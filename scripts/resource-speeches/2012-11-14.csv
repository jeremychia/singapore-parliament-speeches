2012-11-14-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,"asked 	 the Minister for National Development (a) for the past three years, how many applicants for HDB flats are unable to secure a loan from HDB because they had taken two HDB loans previously; (b) whether HDB can review this policy; and (c) what is the financial cost to the Government for providing an HDB loan.",1,1,2012-11-14-T-001-S-00001

2012-11-14-T-001,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Sir, from January 2010 to September 2012, there were nearly 178,000 applications for HDB loans. Among these, 3,500 applications, or 2%, were rejected because the applicants had previously taken two or more HDB loans.",1,4,2012-11-14-T-001-S-00004
2012-11-14-T-001,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Two HDB loans are generally sufficient to meet the life-cycle needs of each flat buyer. The first loan helps buyers purchase their first home, while the second loan helps them right-size as their needs change. Flat buyers also have the option of taking a bank loan. Nonetheless, for buyers in exceptional circumstances, HDB may assist them by providing them with another HDB loan on a case-by-case basis.",2,5,2012-11-14-T-001-S-00005
2012-11-14-T-001,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Over the past 20 years, HDB's interest rate has been, on average, 1.5%-points lower than the market rates. That is why we need to restrict the number of HDB loans, in order to manage our limited loan subsidies.",3,6,2012-11-14-T-001-S-00006
2012-11-14-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sir, I thank the Minister for the answer. The feedback is that there are residents who are trying to get a third loan because they have one transfer in-between, that is, between relatives. Therefore, that is not, strictly speaking, a second loan. There are also residents who have to change their flats because of divorce. The feedback is that they have difficulty getting another loan because of the two-loan policy. In view of HDB's principle of providing affordable quality homes, would HDB be prepared to review this policy so that we can try to allow as many residents as possible to own their homes, when they are trying their best not to be stuck with a rental flat, and instead buy their own home?",1,7,2012-11-14-T-001-S-00007

2012-11-14-T-001,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Sir, as I said, the rejection rate is rather low – 2%. In any case, we do exercise discretion and respond with sympathy where we can. I have been watching the success rates of appeals. The last I saw, for appeals to HDB for house mortgage matters, the success rate is pretty high – 36%. I think this is quite good.",1,9,2012-11-14-T-001-S-00009
2012-11-14-T-001,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, as Members of Parliament, we often encounter instances where the applicants are unable to get a loan from commercial banks due to their income levels. Yet, they are also unable to get HDB loans for various reasons. For example, their income levels could be too high to qualify. Their incomes could also be too high to qualify for HDB rental flats. They end up paying market rentals, which are way above what they would have paid to service their mortgages. I would like to ask the Minister whether such situations are desirable. Should we not help or facilitate these applicants to own their own flats, so that there is some secured retirement financing and, in a way a hedge against rising property prices?",1,10,2012-11-14-T-001-S-00010
2012-11-14-T-001,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Sir, home ownership as a social objective is something highly desirable, and which we strive to achieve. At the same time, it must be underpinned by prudence. Let us not forget the huge problem created in the US by the sub-prime loan crisis. While we will try to make sure that everyone who can afford it can own a home, the outcome that some Members are hoping for – 100% for everyone who puts up his hand will get a loan – is a little unrealistic because if we push beyond prudence, potentially, we can have a sub-prime crisis, as did the US.",1,11,2012-11-14-T-001-S-00011

2012-11-14-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Sir, the HDB resale market has shown signs of stabilising. Yearly Resale Price Index (RPI) growth has come down from 14.1% in 2010 to 10.7% last year and to 3.9% in the first nine months of this year. Nonetheless, the uptick in quarterly RPI growth to 2.0% in the third quarter shows that while things are improving, we still have some way to go.",1,17,2012-11-14-T-002-S-00017

2012-11-14-T-003,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Sir, the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) limits are reviewed from time to time to reflect Singapore's demographic changes. Currently, about 60% of HDB's public rental blocks have reached the EIP block limit of 25% for Malay households. We are in the midst of reviewing the EIP limits for rental flats, to take into account the demand from the various ethnic groups.",1,23,2012-11-14-T-003-S-00023

As for allocation, rental applicants may prefer certain locations, which are nearer their workplace or their children's school. We allow them the flexibility to choose the location zone, so that we are better able to meet their needs. HDB will advise them on the estimated waiting time for their preferred zone as well as the zone with the shortest waiting time, so that they can make an informed decision.",2,24,2012-11-14-T-003-S-00024

2012-11-14-T-004,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Second Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),"Sir, NEA currently manages the contracts for table-top cleaning and collection of crockery at the 25 MEWR-owned hawker centres. When the previous cleaning contract expired, an open tender was called on 16 August 2011 and three bids were received. The bids were evaluated on price and quality, and the new cleaning contract was awarded in accordance with best sourcing practices.",1,28,2012-11-14-T-004-S-00028

Since then, the cost of providing cleaning services has increased due to, among other things, higher manpower costs. NEA's role in this contract is to consolidate the cleaning needs of the centres and to ensure compliance with cleaning standards. NEA does not levy any additional charges for managing the cleaning contract.",2,29,2012-11-14-T-004-S-00029
2012-11-14-T-004,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Second Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),Hawker centres that are not managed by NEA would usually award the cleaning contracts collectively and directly to the cleaning service provider through the Hawkers Association with each stall-holder paying his share of the actual cost of cleaning.,3,30,2012-11-14-T-004-S-00030
2012-11-14-T-004,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Second Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),"We are mindful of the impact of the increase of cleaning charges on stall-holders. After consultations with the Hawkers Associations in the affected centres, MEWR has decided to phase in the table-cleaning charges in two steps at four-month intervals for six of the nine centres. The increases faced by the remaining three centres are of a smaller quantum – less than $200 per month – and would, therefore, be implemented in a single step. The hawker representatives have accepted our proposal to mitigate the impact of the increase on their stall-holders. I would like to emphasise that this move should not be misread as a subsidy since all the hawkers will eventually have to pay the full cleaning costs.",4,31,2012-11-14-T-004-S-00031
2012-11-14-T-004,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Second Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),"Mr Baey asked about the impact on cleaners' salaries. I would not be able to provide details on the extent to which the increases in fees would benefit the cleaners since this will depend on the operations of each cleaning service provider. However, under the prevalent Government procurement process, NEA prescribes the terms and conditions for best sourcing and ensures that there was transparency and competition in the tender process for effective procurement.",5,32,2012-11-14-T-004-S-00032

With effect from 1 April 2013, the Government will require all tenderers of new Government cleaning contracts to be accredited under the Clean Mark Accreditation Scheme which has since been enhanced on 1 November 2012 to incorporate the recommendation of the Tripartite Committee on Cleaners on progressive wages, among other enhanced criteria.

It is not possible for us to infinitely increase the number of cleaners at our centres to clean up after our mess. Thus, our tagline for our Clean and Green Singapore campaign this year  every action counts. Please help us and our hawkers to keep Singapore clean.",8,35,2012-11-14-T-004-S-00035
2012-11-14-T-004,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Sir, I thank the Second Minister for the answers. I have the following supplementary questions. The first is  I recognise that the contracts were called at different times for different hawker centres. So, my first supplementary question is whether the quantum of any increase in cleaning fees is clearly stated in the contracts. Going forward, I think that it is important to make such provisions clear from the onset. My second supplementary question is  would the cleaning fees at the other hawker centres be expected to rise, going forward? Next, with these increases, can we expect cleaning services to improve, and in what ways? Finally, with the on-going push for the Tray Return scheme – which all of us are fully supportive of – what would the impact be on the efficiency and productivity of these cleaning services at these hawker centres and whether these factors will be taken into account in any new cleaning fee increase?",1,36,2012-11-14-T-004-S-00036
2012-11-14-T-004,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for the supplementary questions. First of all, on the first question, on whether the increase in fee is stated in the tenancy contracts, the answer is yes. There are provisions in the tenancy contracts on cleaning fees that could change from time to time. Sometimes, the stall-holders may not expect and would not be able to anticipate the movements in the pricing of the cleaning contracts, but I think they are aware that these are some of the business risks that they have to manage, just as they are managing other risks, such as cost of utilities, and so on.",1,37,2012-11-14-T-004-S-00037
2012-11-14-T-004,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"As far as whether cleaning fees would increase in other centres – let me say that at this point in time, the cleaning industry is going through some changes. First of all, there is accreditation that the Government will be insisting on. Secondly, there is also some impact coming from the tighter foreign workers dependency ratio. Also, the hours of working and operations in the centres may vary from time to time and from centre to centre.",2,38,2012-11-14-T-004-S-00038
2012-11-14-T-004,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"These are all factors that could have an impact on cleaning charges, and part of the effort in having an enhanced accreditation is to try to move the industry towards one that has better standards, takes better care of its workers through training, development and progressive wages, and where there are greater economies of scale, and therefore, in a better position to invest in productivity measures, such as improvements in the use of equipment, investments in mechanisation, and so on.",3,39,2012-11-14-T-004-S-00039

2012-11-14-T-004,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The industry is actually characterised by a large number of low-skilled workers, lowly educated, sometimes not in a very good position to know their rights. Sometimes, they do not know how to look for information on training, and so on. So, it is time for the society and the Government to take a holistic view and try to improve the working conditions as well as career prospects for this group of workers. It is through the accreditation system that we hope to achieve these objectives.",5,41,2012-11-14-T-004-S-00041
2012-11-14-T-004,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Whether there will be improvements, as I said, we hope so. We hope that by putting in criteria for best sourcing that there are better standards required of the cleaners. With better training, we hope that each of the cleaners will be in a better position to do their jobs better. More importantly is also the need to mitigate the lack of workers because we know that this is not an industry where many Singaporeans would jump on the band wagon and will look for a career here. So, we recognise that we have to achieve more with fewer workers, going forward. This is where looking at processes, looking at improvements in the equipment, looking at better mechanisation will be a longer term solution towards mitigating the cost of increase, going forward.",6,42,2012-11-14-T-004-S-00042
2012-11-14-T-004,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"This is the thinking behind the return of trays. At the moment, when we look at the Tray Return effort, we are looking at it from the point of view of promoting social graciousness, a responsibility amongst Singaporeans to pick up after ourselves and not to leave work behind for others. This is also a more sustainable way for all of us to work towards reducing our reliance on workers, particularly foreign workers. We will have to monitor the progress of Tray Return scheme and continue it on a process of reviewing the work processes, discussing with the service provider, and also looking at how we can make the work of the cleaners a more satisfying and progressive one.",7,43,2012-11-14-T-004-S-00043
2012-11-14-T-004,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,"Sir, I have three hawker centres in my constituency. The feedback from the Hawkers Associations is that they are ill-equipped to manage the calling for contracts for these cleaning contractors. Would MEWR consider consolidating cleaning contracts for all hawker centres so that we can assist the Hawkers Associations who do not know how to call for cleaning contract tenders, as well as for better economies of scale, so that we can, perhaps, with more hawker centres covered under one contract, there can be more cost savings?",1,44,2012-11-14-T-004-S-00044

I am glad to hear that the Hawkers Associations see NEA as a good partner for calling of cleaning contracts. This is also a call that has been made by other Members in this House. We will consider NEA's role in the management of hawker centres. We would like to take a more cautious view because I think there is a balance to be made between centralising greater economies of scale versus more autonomy, more room to decide how cleaning should be undertaken in the various hawker centres.",1,45,2012-11-14-T-004-S-00045

2012-11-14-T-004,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"When we approached the nine affected hawker centres, the feedback from some of them was that they wanted to be more involved in the process. When they meet with an increase in cleaning costs, that is when they will start applying their mind to how to make the work better, or to be less reliant on cleaners. Some of them are even considering undertaking some of the cleaning works themselves. This is where there is always tension, whether we should want to leave the calling of the contracts and tenders to an agency, or does the Hawkers Association want to take it upon themselves and manage the risk better.",3,47,2012-11-14-T-004-S-00047

We live in close proximity, people cherish their quiet time and space, and when that is infringed, disputes arise. How should the law deal with such disputes or should it deal with it at all?",1,52,2012-11-14-T-005-S-00052
2012-11-14-T-005,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"If an offence is committed, you can get prosecution, and punishment meted out. If there are wrongful acts, you can get civil action for damages or injunction. The trouble is that the traditional legal framework may not always be the most appropriate or adequate. The legal process itself can be long drawn out. It is adversarial in nature, and it is not often easy to get amicable solutions. The proceedings may themselves also not be the most cost effective to deal with day-to-day disputes between neighbours.",2,53,2012-11-14-T-005-S-00053

2012-11-14-T-005,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"So, if you want to think of an effective framework, it has to go beyond what is traditionally available in the law. I think one important component of our current framework is community mediation where volunteers are trained as mediators. They try and bring parties together to reach common understanding. The process is voluntary. There is a good rate of success − about 70% of the cases are successfully mediated, and a few hundred cases have been mediated every year since 2009. The weakness or the drawback of mediation is that it is voluntary. If one party does not want to come for the mediation, there is not much you can do. So, the question is, how can we improve on this framework as we go forward?",4,55,2012-11-14-T-005-S-00055
2012-11-14-T-005,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"It is really at a very conceptual stage, and we are considering, firstly, strengthening the mediation process where we get people to mediate their disputes, and then getting them to abide by the understandings that have been reached. The second approach is to try and develop norms of conduct between neighbours which need to be specific enough to be meaningful, but also take into account the complexities of urban life and that includes close proximity. And then encourage the residents to abide by these norms, and introduce effective and properly calibrated sanctions if the norms are breached.",5,56,2012-11-14-T-005-S-00056

2012-11-14-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"Sir, by and large, we know that most of our neighbours observe the acceptable social norms. However, there will always be a very small minority that would cause a significant social nuisance to their neighbours on a prolonged basis. Sometimes, really, no amount of mediation, education or grassroots engagement can change the behaviour of such neighbours. So, would the Minister agree that, perhaps, we need some form of local regulation, maybe some powers devolved to the local agencies to impose some form of penalty? In Hong Kong, there is a demerit point system for the public housing. I would like to ask the Minister whether that will be suitable for Singapore.",1,58,2012-11-14-T-005-S-00058
2012-11-14-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sir, the essence of my answer was that we are considering some form of framework. The precise framework is not settled.

2012-11-14-T-006,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,68,2012-11-14-T-006-S-00068
2012-11-14-T-006,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Sir, we announced an original budget of $12 billion for the Downtown Line in early 2007. Subsequently, we revised the budget upwards to $20.7 billion.",1,69,2012-11-14-T-006-S-00069
2012-11-14-T-006,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Approximately half of the increase is due to the increase in construction costs from late 2007 onwards, because of the sharp growth in overall construction demand in Singapore. The prices of construction materials also increased significantly. For example, market prices for key materials, such as steel bars and concrete, spiralled upwards by 60% and 14% respectively from late 2007 to mid 2008. Actual tender prices were therefore higher than what we had originally envisaged in early 2007, when we planned the $12 billion budget, and we had to revise the budget upwards.",2,70,2012-11-14-T-006-S-00070
2012-11-14-T-006,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The increase in budget was also required to make enhancements to the line that was initially based on a set of preliminary engineering and planning parameters drawn up in 2006-2007. For instance, the original alignment was extended from 40 km to 42 km and an additional station was added. Also, for several of the stations, we decided to improve their design to provide for more entrances and underground links to improve connectivity and access for commuters and pedestrians.",3,71,2012-11-14-T-006-S-00071
2012-11-14-T-006,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Sir, let me explain that the initial planning for the Downtown Line, including the original $12 billion budget, was based on preliminary studies. Detailed engineering and architectural plans were finalised only later, as is typically the case for such major projects. These detailed plans also took into account URA's long-term land use plans which were updated after 2007, and, hence, resulted in some significant changes to the original plans for the Downtown Line. Overall, when compared to the original $12 billion budget, most of the increase in the revised budget can be attributed to Downtown Line 1.",4,72,2012-11-14-T-006-S-00072

2012-11-14-T-006,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Sir, Mr Png also asked about risks for fluctuating construction costs. As is the practice for LTA's major construction tenders, price fluctuation clauses for key materials were included in the Downtown Line tenders. This will also be the case for the Thomson Line contracts. In these clauses, LTA would bear the downside risk for any increase in the cost of key materials from the tender price. At the same time, LTA would also enjoy the upside savings should the cost of the materials come down. Moreover, because LTA bears this risk associated with the cost of key materials, which is beyond the contractors' control, tender prices would be lower because the contractors would not need to factor in this risk premium in their tender. This approach is in line with best practices across other Government agencies and across the world.",6,74,2012-11-14-T-006-S-00074
2012-11-14-T-006,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"For example, the material costs for Downtown Line 3 were higher than tendered because market prices for materials went up subsequently. However, LTA enjoyed some savings for DTL1 and DTL2 contracts compared to the tendered prices, through the price fluctuation clauses, as the prices of key materials came down somewhat after the tenders were awarded. In case there is confusion, let me point out that these subsequently reduced market prices were still higher than in early 2007, when we planned the original $12 billion budget, but if the prices of materials remain at around current levels, then we should expect to see some savings from the revised budget of $20.7 billion.",7,75,2012-11-14-T-006-S-00075
2012-11-14-T-006,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Finally, Sir, let me assure Members that we are prudent in managing public funds. For all development projects, we ensure thorough scrutiny and review at various stages, and work closely with the Ministry of Finance on cost management and value maximisation. LTA also adopts best practices in its tendering and contracting processes, reaps economies of scale through bulk supply contracts, where possible, and attracts overseas international contractors to tender for rail projects as well, in order to keep prices competitive.",8,76,2012-11-14-T-006-S-00076
2012-11-14-T-006,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"I thank the Minister for the answer. I have two supplementary questions. First, how many of the contracts were actually awarded to the lowest bidder? Second, in 2007, the ex-Minister of State for Transport said in Parliament that LTA was reviewing whether some stations required more than one entrance and making stations more user-friendly and handicap-friendly, and that any enhanced standards would also apply to the Downtown Line. Immediately after that, Downtown Line Stage 1 was started in about 2008. So, were those changes made known or incorporated into the tender?",1,77,2012-11-14-T-006-S-00077
2012-11-14-T-006,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Sir, if I may explain a little bit more about the tender process. Basically, it is a two-stage process. We, first of all, evaluate the tender returns based on the quality of the returns and thereafter we open the envelope to review the prices, and we take into account the composition between quality as well as the price of the tender in order to decide on which is the most suitable and appropriate bidder for that particular stage of the project.",1,78,2012-11-14-T-006-S-00078

2012-11-14-T-006,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Secondly, with regard to provision for more entrances, I believe that part of the additional cost that I mentioned earlier came about as a result of an increase in about 30 entrances that we incorporated into the existing Downtown Lines. So, there were about 30 entrances that were built into the various stages of the Downtown Line.",3,80,2012-11-14-T-006-S-00080
2012-11-14-T-006,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Minister for the answers. I have a supplementary question. I noted that in the press report, it says that one of the measures that LTA is taking is to invite more firms to bid for the projects, to make it more competitive. I would like to ask whether that was done so previously, as in how many companies took part in the earlier bids and how competitive were these bids.",1,81,2012-11-14-T-006-S-00081
2012-11-14-T-006,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"I thank the Member for the supplementary question. The answer actually depends on when the tender was put out. So, more recently, because of the lack of work around the world and also in the Middle East, we have actually seen more responders to the tenders that we have put out. And we hope that in this way, we also get more competitive pricing. But as much as possible, we try to make sure that for such major projects like this, we cut it up into many chunks of different sizes and in this way, we allow different-sized companies, including some of our local ones which may not be as significantly capitalised as some of the international companies, also the chance to participate in the tender.",1,82,2012-11-14-T-006-S-00082

2012-11-14-T-006,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,"The Minister said that most of the cost overrun came from Downtown Line Stage 1, and that is actually the shortest line with six stations. Can the Minister explain this?",1,84,2012-11-14-T-006-S-00084
2012-11-14-T-006,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"If I may give a little bit more clarity on the total cost overrun. From an initial budget of about $12 billion, it went up to $20.7 billion. So, it is about $8.7 billion in total. If we take away the GST component for this $8.7 billion, it comes up to an increase of about $8 billion. Seventy-five per cent of that increase came about as a result of either construction cost, technical requirements or the improved connectivity that I was talking about. Why I said that Downtown Line 1 attributed to a larger part of this increase in cost is because of the time when the tender was called. And if Members recall, from 2007 to 2008, construction prices as well as material prices went up significantly.",1,85,2012-11-14-T-006-S-00085

All elderly Singaporeans will continue to enjoy Government subsidies of up to 80% for subsidised healthcare treatment at our public healthcare institutions, regardless of their insured status. Under the GST Voucher scheme, the Government will also provide annual Medisave top-ups for the majority of elderly Singaporeans to help with their medical expenses. Those who still face difficulties can approach the medical social workers at our public healthcare institutions for financial assistance, including through Medifund Silver, which is a targeted assistance scheme for the elderly. Since 2007, Medifund Silver provided about $61 million to help elderly patients with their healthcare expenses.",3,91,2012-11-14-T-007-S-00091
2012-11-14-T-007,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member),"Sir, what are the main reasons why such a high percentage of this age group is not insured? We are looking at 35% of them who are not insured compared to only about 8% of the general population.",1,92,2012-11-14-T-007-S-00092
2012-11-14-T-007,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Member was asking why they were not insured. There are a variety of reasons. Some of them have their own insurance schemes and some of them may have pre-existing conditions where insurance may not be feasible or may not be the most efficient protection for them, because insurance, including MediShield, operates on a risk-pooling basis. When the total pool of the insured becomes smaller, especially those like the elderly group, the risk pooling may not be effective. Among those in the elderly group, a significant number of them may already have pre-existing conditions. Even if they are included in the MediShield, these existing conditions may be excluded from the coverage and, therefore, it may or may not be efficient for them. So, it is on an individual case-by-case basis. We make MediShield available for the elderly beyond 75 years old primarily because of the feedback that some of them may be healthy and they may want to opt in. We open up the scheme to allow them to opt in to MediShield but some of them may already have pre-existing conditions that make insurance not practical for them. We will look at how we can help these people who may not be covered by MediShield in a different way. As I mentioned, we provide assistance and generous subsidies in our public healthcare institutions for all patients, including the elderly. On top of that, we have introduced the Medifund Silver specifically targeted at these elderly, as we understand that they have specific needs, to help them with the medical expenses.",1,93,2012-11-14-T-007-S-00093

With regard to the congenital and neo-natal conditions coverage under MediShield, we have considered it at length and we feel that it is part and parcel of our efforts to provide healthcare protection for our children. It is also part of our overall effort to encourage marriage and parenthood. That is why we have surfaced this for discussion at Our Singapore Conversation, to allow Singaporeans to participate in the discussion on what kind of a healthcare system we want for the future, and what kind of protection we like for our children.

This is done through public education programmes and activities, including talks, workshops, road shows, resource guides, as well as the sharing of real-life stories through publications and online media. It has also gone upstream to engage youths in tertiary institutions to raise the awareness of age-related fertility decline and the risks of late pregnancies. For couples already planning or expecting a baby, both MSF and HPB conduct programmes to equip and prepare them for pregnancy, as well as caring for their newborns.",4,119,2012-11-14-T-009-S-00119

My supplementary question is this  some countries now consider age-related decline in fertility as a medical condition and, hence, they allow egg-freezing. There is growing evidence that eggs frozen from a woman below age 35 have a higher chance of a successful pregnancy or birth. Will the Ministry, therefore, be open to considering egg-freezing as an option available to more women, including single women before they marry? This may enable more Singaporean women to preserve their fertility till they marry, thereby increasing their chances of a successful pregnancy after marriage.",1,121,2012-11-14-T-009-S-00121

2012-11-14-T-009,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Firstly, let me say that I share the Member's concerns about age-related fertility as more men and women delay marriage and parenthood. However, it must be noted that advanced technology, such as IVF, can help women solve their fertility-related problems only to a certain extent. It is not a foolproof or guaranteed solution. Besides the conventional IVF, as the Member has rightly pointed out, there has been an increase in interest in vitrification or ultra rapid egg-freezing, which is a new technology. It is a technique that can help unmarried women to freeze their eggs and store them for future use to overcome the reproductive or ovarian ageing problem.",1,123,2012-11-14-T-009-S-00123
2012-11-14-T-009,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Currently, MOH only allows egg-freezing for medical reasons, such as women who have to undergo certain treatment, for example, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which will damage their fertility. There are various reasons why egg-freezing has not been allowed other than for such medical reasons, and they include the fact that there are inherent risks to the women who undergo the egg-freezing procedure, such as ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome, bleeding and infection.",2,124,2012-11-14-T-009-S-00124
2012-11-14-T-009,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Furthermore, because the technology is relatively new, there is limited information available on the perinatal outcomes of the procedure, for instance, the success rate, live births, pregnancies, and so on.

2012-11-14-T-009,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Besides these medical implications, there are also potential social and ethical implications, for example, the misconception of the use of egg-freezing as guaranteed fertility preservation as well as over-commercialisation. Notwithstanding this, MOH is reviewing the medical, scientific and ethical implications of egg-freezing with the aim to establish a policy position to develop a regulatory framework with the necessary safeguards, if the eventual policy position is to allow social egg-freezing.

NAC's current funding guidelines support no more than 30% of an arts group's total production budget. On average, the rental costs paid by arts groups who do not have access to their own performing spaces, for these arts groups to rent venues like the Drama Centre, which is run by The Esplanade, the rental costs vary between 20% and 35% of their total budget. In this scenario, many of the non-profit funded arts companies have expressed to me that they are literally receiving Government funding from one public agency and handing over the whole amount as rental to another public company. It puts immense pressure on these groups to find the remaining 70% to 80% of their budget from other sources, such as box office revenue and corporate sponsorships, which are hugely uncertain in this economic climate.",1,138,2012-11-14-T-010-S-00138

2012-11-14-T-010,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"My first question to the Acting Minister is  in view of the Ministry's push to bring the arts to a wider public, and to nurture the arts and culture as a way of developing Singapore's soul, would his Ministry consider reviewing its rental rates to local arts groups, to not only create a conducive environment for them to develop original work and new artistic talent, but also to ease the financial pressure that is eventually passed on to the Singapore public through high ticket prices? Secondly, are public companies, such as The Esplanade and The Old Parliament House, under any expectation or pressure from the Government to profit or break even from running these theatre venues which might explain why rental rates and manpower costs for these venues are so high? Thirdly, does the Ministry have plans to develop more mid-size theatres like the Drama Centre, which is now insufficient for the needs of local arts groups.",3,140,2012-11-14-T-010-S-00140
2012-11-14-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for the supplementary questions, and I share her concerns and desire to provide more support for the arts groups in Singapore. On the first question, NAC is indeed doing a review of its grants framework and one of the items being reviewed is the guideline of funding of 30% of operating costs. For the review, NAC has been talking to arts groups, having consultations with the groups, getting their feedback. NAC will design a new framework, a new grant scheme or new items in the grant scheme which will provide more support for the arts groups, and I think the arts community will find it a positive move when the announcement is made.",1,141,2012-11-14-T-010-S-00141
2012-11-14-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the second point about rental rates charged by The Esplanade and other agencies, I did a check on the rental rates and actually the rental rates by The Esplanade have not increased since the day it started operations. So, it is not as though the rental rates have been repeatedly raised in order to recover costs or to charge higher profits. They have not increased the rates since the day it started operations. Be that as it may, I understand the concern from the arts groups about rental costs. It is indeed a significant part of their operating costs and one way in which we can help them is with the grant that NAC provides, and that is why I have alluded to earlier that NAC has been doing a review of its grants framework. And I believe with the new grants framework, more support will be provided to the arts groups.",2,142,2012-11-14-T-010-S-00142
2012-11-14-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the third point about additional mid-size theatres and additional venues, that is something that the Ministry will be committed to do. We are looking at expanding our institutions and spaces for performances. One of the things that we have done is to look at quality arts infrastructure and how we can expand that. We do look forward to the reopening of the Victoria Theatre and the Victoria Concert Hall, and that would be some time in the first quarter of 2014. We are also looking at upgrading facilities in other community nodes. So, we are mindful of the need for more spaces, and we will be looking to expand the possibilities and the spaces that we can have for performance venues.",3,143,2012-11-14-T-010-S-00143

2012-11-14-T-010,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh,"Sir, I thank the Acting Minister. I just want to clarify that based on my supplementary question on rental rates, I was referring to some of the venues that The Esplanade runs, not just necessarily within the Esplanade, but, for example, the Drama Centre, which in 2008/2009, the rate collected was something like 12% of gross box office takings, and by 2010/2011, that had increased to 15% of gross box office takings. Similarly, in 2008/2009, if the venue was not used, the Dark Day Rate would be $750 and by the following year, it had increased to $1,400. So, there have been increases in the venue rental rates, not necessarily within The Esplanade but at the external venues run by The Esplanade.",1,145,2012-11-14-T-010-S-00145

These have to cover some costs. The agencies that rent out these venues do not do this for profit. They are doing this to ensure that their finances are sustainable. So, we will do several things, as I mentioned. One, continue to manage the costs and ensure that the rents are affordable; two, do whatever we can to better utilise these status so that they are well optimised, in terms of utilisation rates; and, three, through the grants framework that NAC provides, ensure that sufficient support is given to our arts groups.",1,146,2012-11-14-T-010-S-00146

Front-loading the support from the MAP to the training and preparation process will be a more practical way of supporting a sportsman and Sports Associations and also give greater assurances to athletes, coaches, Sports Associations and the families, that the support will be coming in a very structured way from the start, more akin to giving somebody the petrol to drive from A to B, rather than saying, ""When you reach there, I will give you the petrol then"".

2012-11-14-T-013,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Sir, with regard to the social mobility question, recently, we read in the newspapers the report that about 40% of students living in HDB flats are studying in the top schools. Knowing that more than 80% of our population are living in HDB flats, is this trend worrisome for MOE? Have we seen more of the students living in better conditions progressing into top schools as an indication of difficulty faced by the low-income families?",1,181,2012-11-14-T-013-S-00181
2012-11-14-T-013,Hawazi Daipi,Mr Hawazi Daipi,"Sir, on the contrary, we should be happy to see that many of our students from low-income families progress through their education, complete their Secondary education, and move into post-Secondary institutions. Instead of looking at the development the way the Member had, I would suggest that we look at it this way. About one in two students from the bottom third SCS families scored in the top two-third at PSLE. This proportion has remained stable over the past decade.",1,182,2012-11-14-T-013-S-00182
2012-11-14-T-013,Hawazi Daipi,Mr Hawazi Daipi,"Second, about one in six students from the bottom third SCS families scored in the top third at PSLE. This proportion has also remained stable in the last decade. It basically means that students from lower SCS families have made good progress and have moved into the different Secondary school level or post-Primary, based on their interest and ability. But, broadly, I would say, we should have a broader definition of social mobility and move away from purely academic or monetary achievements. Rather, I would say, the social mobility is about striving for each successive generation to have more opportunities to pursue their interests and aptitudes and, in so doing, realise their full potential and to live better and more fulfilling lives than their parents. I think all of our students, irrespective of their social background, have made progress and do better than the current generation. In general, I would say, we are doing well.",2,183,2012-11-14-T-013-S-00183

When I do the weekly house visits, I encounter quite a few families where the mothers have three or more children, and they are pregnant. They really hope to join the HOPE scheme. If we do not help these mothers, they will have problems bringing up the children. Without additional help, these children may not be able to do well in school and subsequently may not do well in society. This could create a vicious cycle. So, I hope the Acting Minister can review it earlier, rather than later.",1,204,2012-11-14-T-015-S-00204

Twenty-seven PCF and NTUC Centres, out of the approximately 210 combined centres, are SPARK-accredited. That is about 12% of all the centres that are owned by these anchor operators. This is way short of the target of 85% of the centres to be SPARK-tested by 2013, as shared in this House in November 2010.

Other countries have commended us on our approach with preventive education and expressed interest in the materials produced by the CNB. The Task Force recommends that the CNB should broaden its reach to include at-risk youth, post-Secondary youth and national servicemen to prevent them from even experimenting with drugs in the first place. This is currently being done. We have also improved upstream intervention for youth drug abusers. Since January 2012, CNB has established a dedicated reporting centre for young drug supervisees on the Urine Supervision Scheme. This means that they report to a separate centre for the regular urine test, different from those where adult drug supervisees report to.

This is, therefore, no different from other drug abusers admitted to the DRC for the first time. During their initial stay in the DRC, these young abusers will undergo the same regime as other drug abusers.

As such, we will implement a new intervention programme in the DRCs to help these inmates address their multiple risk factors. These efforts will be complemented by a compulsory after-care regime to enhance the supervision of DRC inmates upon release to reduce the risk of relapse into drug abuse. Given that about 2,000 repeat abusers who are sentenced to Long-Term Imprisonment (LT) will be released over the next two years, we must also do more to reduce their risk of relapse and enhance their potential for reintegration. In this regard, Prisons started a Pre-release Centre Pilot in April 2012 targeted at offenders with higher risk of relapse.

Their view is this. If Parliament deems it necessary to make a drug offence punishable with the death penalty, it is preferable that the statute sets out as clearly as possible the circumstances under which the death penalty ought to be imposed. While the Courts will of course exercise any discretion in a principled and consistent manner, their view is that it is best that the legislature define in the clearest possible terms when the ultimate punishment is justified.

Once you agree on the threshold, and if the elements of offence are made out, that is, trafficking over 15 grams, then how would you have the court exercise discretion? I will be happy to hear Members' views on this.

How do you do it in a way that does not affect the fundamental deterrent effect of the death penalty?",35,311,2012-11-14-T-019-S-00311

So, pose the question in realistic terms  do you want a complete elimination or at least a substantial reduction in the deterrent value of the death penalty? I am not saying you cannot put forward that position. But let us be clear-minded and hard-headed about this, and look at the hard issues  on the one hand, the drug issues and the risks which we face, and on the other hand, whether we have the death penalty.",36,312,2012-11-14-T-019-S-00312

Quite understandable – Judges are reluctant to impose the ultimate sentence. And you also have the drug lords sending you the couriers who fit the criteria for not imposing the death penalty.

2012-11-14-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The short answer is that it is not a realistic option because every courier, once he is primed, will seem to cooperate. Remember we are dealing not with an offence committed on the spur of the moment. We are dealing with offences instigated by criminal organisations which do not play by the rules, which will look at what you need, what your criteria are and send it to you. So, if you say just cooperate, just do your best, all your couriers will be primed with beautiful stories, most of which will be unverifiable but on the face of it, they have cooperated, they did their best. And the death penalty will then not be imposed and you know what will happen to the deterrent value. Operational effectiveness will not be enhanced. Will we be better off? Will we be worse off?",45,321,2012-11-14-T-019-S-00321

It is a point that was raised extensively during our consultations. Let me throw back the question. Assuming the couriers are not able to help, what should be the penalty? That goes back to the fundamental question  should there be the death penalty for couriers? That is the first hurdle you have to cross. It is a difficult question, but I think Members other than Mr Lien have agreed that there should be the death penalty for couriers. Once you say that, then you will see this change as making an exception to that position. So, only those who qualify for that exception can be spared the death penalty. You then need to be careful about making the exception so wide that the rule itself is seriously qualified.",48,324,2012-11-14-T-019-S-00324
2012-11-14-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In any case, CNB's operational assessment is that couriers can give substantive assistance in some cases. Also, the very existence of the mechanism adds friction to the entire drug trafficking network. Every arrested courier is now potentially a lead back to the syndicate. That will make it difficult for the entire organisation. Let us not underestimate the syndicates. They will of course try to work around this in innovative ways. The question for this House is, should we therefore not try this approach?",49,325,2012-11-14-T-019-S-00325

2012-11-14-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,It is not our intention to extend this to those who do not suffer from a recognised and proven psychiatric condition.,1,364,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00364
2012-11-14-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sir, let me conclude by making some broad points. I have spoken several times about weighing the consequences in realistic terms, before deciding what we do. Let us look at some real cases to see what I mean.",2,365,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00365
2012-11-14-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"First, the case of ""Nonoi"". In 2006, Mohd Johari was charged for the murder of his two-year-old step-daughter, Nonoi. Her photograph was all over the newspapers. He admitted to slapping her and repeatedly immersing her in a pail of water. He was a father at 17, a marijuana smoker, cough syrup abuser, an immature, deficient parent. He said that he sometimes brought Nonoi home with him as he thought that she would help him avoid detection by CNB. She is a victim, maybe he is also a victim, of the drug traffickers and the drug lords. The question for this House  how many Nonois do you want?",3,366,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00366
2012-11-14-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Then look at ""Tony"", aged 51. Long history of drug abuse. First admitted to DRC at age of 16. Eight subsequent DRC admissions. Lived with his mother, who took out a protection order against him for violent behaviour. Imprisoned in 2007 for breaching the order. Later imprisoned for drug trafficking and causing grievous hurt. He often beat up his father, who committed suicide. He was picked up for vagrancy in 2010, and now lives in a welfare home. This is typical of the many, many cases we deal with.",4,367,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00367
2012-11-14-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Look at ""Nelly"" and ""Rose"". Nelly, aged 6, was placed under foster care after her mother, uncle and grandfather were arrested for drug consumption. She had been cared for by multiple caregivers. She witnessed her mother taking drugs. Her sister, Rose, a newborn baby, was also placed under foster care in 2010.",5,368,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00368
2012-11-14-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Look at ""Ricky"". Nine years old. Referred to MCYS in 2007 when his mother and stepfather were imprisoned for drug offences. Both had a long history of drug abuse. His father was also a drug abuser. Ricky was admitted to a children's home, with emotional issues and suicidal tendencies. His father was released from prison recently, but has now defaulted on his urine tests.",6,369,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00369
2012-11-14-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Last case  ""Girl A"". Arrested at the age of 16 for possessing methamphetamine. The drugs were given to her by her half-sister, now in jail for drug consumption, and also her mother's boyfriend. When her mother's boyfriend was caught, she turned to her mother, who gave her heroin regularly. She has three half-brothers now doing time for drug consumption. Five of her mother's friends are also in, for consuming drugs at her half-sister's home. A group of 12 in total, caught in the snare of drugs.",7,370,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00370

2012-11-14-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We want to show mercy and compassion to the traffickers. But we also need to show mercy and compassion to the Nonois, and the Roses, and the Nellies, and the Rickys in this world, and thousands of others like them. Young lives, full of promise, destroyed in their prime. None of us, really, is here cheering for the death penalty or the mandatory death penalty. It has to be a careful calibration of the risks that society faces and the punishment that can be imposed. If we want to go a particular route, let us do it without hiding the truth from ourselves, and without assuming that nothing else will change, while we change certain penalties. When we change certain penalties, there will be consequences. Ask yourselves if we are prepared for the consequences. And if we honestly are prepared for the consequences, then we change.",9,372,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00372
2012-11-14-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I would suggest we ask whether the changes we make are going to help the victims, or if they are going to hurt the victims. Approach the question with firmness, clarity of purpose and compassion, to both offenders as well as the victims. [Applause]",10,373,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00373

2012-11-14-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"And finally, can the ""substantive assistance"" provision really be effective?",7,380,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00380
2012-11-14-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"But let me take a step back and re-focus ourselves on the challenges that we are facing, and the policy objectives that we are aiming for in tabling these amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act. It is with this overall perspective in mind that I will take us through each of these points before wrapping up by taking a look at our holistic approach to combating the drug scourge.",8,381,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00381

2012-11-14-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"Sir, when Parliament sat in 1975 to consider the drug problem, they were faced with a serious drug situation which was threatening to overwhelm Singapore. They weighed the damage that drugs and those who traffic in drugs were doing to our society. They decided to institute tougher laws and penalties, coupled with strong enforcement.",11,384,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00384
2012-11-14-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"Severe penalties were introduced, including the mandatory death penalty for those trafficking significant amounts of drugs. Even though the penalties were severe, they were instituted in a measured and calibrated way, with only those convicted of trafficking substantial amounts of drugs subject to the mandatory death penalty. In the case of heroin, for example, the threshold amount for capital punishment is set at 15 grams of pure diamorphine. This may not sound like very much, but it is, in fact, equivalent to the pure diamorphine content of some 2,200 straws of heroin, with a current street value of $66,000. This is enough to supply one straw per day to more than 300 addicts for a week.",12,385,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00385
2012-11-14-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"Trafficking in amounts below the threshold amounts where capital punishment applies, is also subject to mandatory minimum penalties and, in this case, long prison terms and caning.",13,386,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00386
2012-11-14-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"Sir, as Mr Shanmugam has pointed out, it is the responsibility of Parliament to decide what acts should be criminalised, and the importance and emphasis to be placed on each crime. Based on the seriousness of the crime, and the damage it does to society and to the victims, Parliament then provides an appropriate penalty framework. For some serious crimes, due to the potential harm that they cause and to register society's disapprobation, it is necessary to send a deterrent signal by providing for minimum or mandatory sentences. This, by their nature, limits the degree of discretion that the courts have in deciding on sentences. Severe penalties are not something which the Government chooses to impose lightly, but only after careful consideration of the nature of the act and the consequences of doing so.",14,387,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00387
2012-11-14-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),And this is especially so in the case of the mandatory death penalty. Parliament bears the heavy responsibility of deciding whether an offence is serious enough and the damage to society severe enough to make the death penalty the only available sentence for that offence.,15,388,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00388
2012-11-14-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"In his tribute to former Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong on Monday, the Minister for Law stated that Chief Justice Chan believed that the function of Judges was to interpret and apply the law, and not to legislate or make policy in the guise of adjudication. Which offences carry the mandatory death penalty and which do not is, therefore, clearly a matter of policy which Parliament, and not the Courts, has to decide, in the interest of our society.",16,389,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00389

2012-11-14-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"Parliament took that responsibility for making this policy decision and sending this strong signal in 1975 after careful and serious consideration. This, together with the other measures that Parliament decided on then and over the years, has provided the basis for our success in tackling the drug problem that has overwhelmed so many other countries.",18,391,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00391
2012-11-14-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"On Monday, Members of this House unanimously welcomed the setting or raising of penalties for those who target youths or vulnerable persons in drug offences and this included mandatory minimum sentences. When Members of the House pass this amendment into law, this would be another example where Parliament has taken a policy decision and is prepared to send a strong signal, which requires the courts to subject persons convicted of such offences involving young persons or vulnerable persons in drug offences, to mandatory minimum sentences.",19,392,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00392
2012-11-14-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),Let me now deal with the second and third themes  has the mandatory death penalty been effective in helping to curb the drug menace? Do the amendments to the mandatory death penalty send the wrong signal that we are softening our stance against drugs?,20,393,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00393
2012-11-14-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"A number of Members, including Ms Sylvia Lim, Asst Prof Eugene Tan, Mrs Lina Chiam and Ms Faizah Jamal, has asked whether the mandatory death sentence has been effective. As several Members have already pointed out, it is not easy to prove a counter-factual conclusively. But it is instructive to take a look at the approaches that other jurisdictions have used to combat drugs and the corresponding outcomes.",21,394,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00394
2012-11-14-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"In some jurisdictions, the legal regime is not operating properly and the enforcement is not effective. The drug situation is completely out of control and drug cartels rule the roost. We read about them in the newspapers and thank our lucky stars that we are not there or in one of those countries. Then, there are jurisdictions where laws are strict, at least theoretically, but enforcement is not effective. They also face problems, which demonstrate that strict laws and severe penalties are not sufficient by themselves; good enforcement and effective Courts are needed too.",22,395,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00395
2012-11-14-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"And there are also jurisdictions where law enforcement agencies are effective, but drug laws are liberal, allowing drugs to become commonplace. In such countries, we have all heard of, or seen for ourselves, the easy availability of drugs, for example, in legalised so-called ""coffee shops"", or being passed around at parties, or caught a whiff of drugs being smoked while walking down the corridors of college dorms. We might also have encountered drugged-out persons ""shooting themselves up"" in side streets in the night, or seen the detritus of discarded hypodermic syringes in public parks and underpasses during a morning jog. It strikes me, Sir, that families from these countries with more liberal drug regimes and drug laws find that one of the key attractions of living in Singapore with their families is that their children are much safer from drugs and crime. And I think there is a lesson, an important one, to learn from there.",23,396,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00396

2012-11-14-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"So, Sir, we have to ask ourselves what type of society we want. There may be no death penalty or mandatory death penalty, but the human toll is great. Drug wars take the lives of thousands – innocents, law enforcement officers and members of drug cartels. Daily, people die of overdoses or adverse drug reactions, including young people, and sadly, people whom young people idolise – pop stars, movie stars and even sports personalities. Lives and futures are destroyed, families are left destitute and in despair. The fabric of society is weakened, safety and security for its citizens compromised, and children put at risk.",25,398,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00398
2012-11-14-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"Sir, the mandatory death penalty is an important part of our comprehensive anti-drug regime. The regime does not just depend on one element, but it depends on all of them. The regime is a multi-pronged one – it involves education, strong enforcement, severe penalties for trafficking, strict rehabilitation for drug abusers, and long-term imprisonment for repeat abusers. The deterrence message is strong and clear. We send the signal that drugs are bad – bad for abusers, their families and society. People who take drugs do so at their own peril. They should expect to be caught eventually. Drug traffickers should also beware; there is high certainty of being caught and punished. Punishment is severe, including capital punishment.",26,399,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00399
2012-11-14-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"The mandatory death penalty strengthens this deterrent message. The incidence of kidnapping and firearms offences fell sharply after the mandatory death penalty (MDP) was introduced for these crimes. From 38 kidnapping offences in 1959, the number of offences fell significantly after the death penalty was introduced for kidnapping in 1961 to just one case and has remained low since then. For firearms offences, the number fell from 174 in 1973 to 97 in 1975 after the introduction of the death penalty in 1973. This has since dropped steadily and there have been no firearms offences since 2007.",27,400,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00400
2012-11-14-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"For drugs, the war is on-going. We want to give our drug enforcement officers the tools they need to do their jobs, to keep us safe. We know that the mandatory death penalty has a deterrent effect because drug traffickers deliberately try to keep the amounts they carry to below the capital punishment threshold. So, you can say, they are clever, they can get away with it. But there is an operational effect on the drug syndicates, and a benefit to Singapore. This complicates their supply chain, raises their costs and their risks. This ultimately helps to restrict drug supply in Singapore and helps keep our drug situation under control.",28,401,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00401

They have looked at this from the point of view of the drug trafficker who has been apprehended. We also have to look at abolition from the point of view of society and the victims of drugs.",32,405,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00405
2012-11-14-T-021,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"Would Singapore and Singaporeans be better off as a result? I do not think so. Not if our deterrence is weakened and more people might be tempted to try to smuggle in significant quantities of drugs. Not if more of them try, get caught, and spend the rest of their lives in prison. Not if more victims fall into the downward spiral of drug abuse because more drugs enter into Singapore. Not if our enforcement officers are overwhelmed by a greater number of traffickers and drug abusers and are not able to get on top of the situation. These are real risks we face if we weaken our deterrence and the message that we are sending.

We need people like Mr Lien in our society to try to save every wrong-doer and to give him more chances. But we must also, as a Parliament, carry the responsibility of putting in place an overall system that minimises the number of those who will take the chance and end up becoming wrong-doers in the first place, by sending an unequivocal deterrent signal that this is a serious crime and the consequences are severe, and do not even think about going down that line.",34,407,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00407

But we also bear the responsibility of putting in place a legal and policy framework that minimises the temptations for people to commit crime and cause damage to others, thinking they can get away with it lightly. Members like Asst Prof Eugene Tan, Mr Vikram Nair, Mr Desmond Lee, Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap understand this as they have seen the despair and destruction that drugs cause.

The CNB feels that there is potential for useful information to assist them. They also asked whether it is fair that those couriers who know little about the drug network may not be able to benefit from this, while couriers who are more knowledgeable about the drug network may be able to cooperate and thus avoid the death penalty.",43,416,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00416

In fact, they are often our key point of contact with the drug network. Let me explain why. Illicit drugs are not manufactured or grown in Singapore because of our tough laws and enforcement. All our drugs, therefore, have to be couriered into Singapore. Thus, couriers are a key part of the network which has to be vigorously targeted and suppressed in order to choke off the supply to Singapore.

They may have to look for new couriers, which will make their supply chain less reliable.

About four out of five of the local prison population had drug antecedents. Mr Vikram Nair spoke about the higher recidivism rates for those with drug antecedents. And this is so. For prisoners who were released in 2009, the recidivism rate over two years for those with drug antecedents was 36% – more than one in three. This is almost double the 20% recidivism rate for those without drug antecedents. This is how the long tail of drug addiction destroys lives and families.",52,425,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00425

Experimenting with drugs is not like trying bungee jumping or sky-diving – drug taking is illegal, and it can only lead down the path of addiction, and damage to one's health, one's mind, as well as one's future and family. Beyond the impact on the individual, taking drugs outside of company time can have a serious impact on work and society. Surely, one would be concerned if a train driver or an airline pilot were to take drugs, even outside of his working hours.

And then you would have to set out, and what would you set out? I think I gave Members some idea of what we might have to set out  youth, family circumstances, maybe young unwed mothers, impecuniosity, and you know what the consequences of setting that out would be?

Here, you have to understand the crucial distinction between the manner of committing the crime which is fairly straightforward – you hide the drugs, you bring them across the causeway, you traffic them, they are above a certain limit. And that is to be contrasted with the background factors which do not change. Once we legislatively set the background factors which will displace the death penalty, then you will get a lot more traffickers fitting that profile. And we have to think whether that is what we want. That is the difficulty. It is not something that we rule out but we must accept that it is a serious difficulty.",3,445,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00445

I heard what the Minister said earlier about the Judges' preference for it to lay it out, but my preference is actually to have a general clause because we cannot foresee all the circumstances that could arise in each case. And I think the Judges would be appropriately placed to assess the merits of each case as it unfolds before them in the Court.

In a sense, if I may suggest, that is passing the buck to the Courts, because somebody has to make a decision when it comes to the death penalty. It really ought to be Parliament. If you give broad discretion to the Courts, first of all, I think Members have heard me say that it is quite unlikely that the Courts will then take it upon themselves to say that in these cases, the death penalty is justified; and in these other cases, that it is not justified. That is the first problem. The second problem is, if they try and define criteria − because that is the way the common law works and that is the way the Courts work − it cannot be palm tree justice. It has to be based on precedents, and over a period of time, precedents will build up. You go back to the same problem.",1,448,2012-11-14-T-021-S-00448

We have tried looking at it from many different angles, and Members are welcome to make suggestions. Philosophically, we are ad idem, but, in the context of drugs, as I said, as long as you give the Courts broad discretion, you will find that, de facto, you will have a serious qualification to the deterrent value of the death penalty. Which is why I was happy to hear suggestions at the end of my speech. If there are other suggestions, I am happy to hear them as well. But, in reality, we have consulted extensively before we put this Bill up. We looked specifically at this quite comprehensively. We spoke with the agencies, we spoke with the Courts, we spoke with the Attorney-General's Chambers and the result we have come to – which is the result every time we look at it over the last several years, we have always come to − is that the structure we now have is probably the most effective for the problems we now face.

On the basis of Ms Wuts' assessment of the intellectual capacity of Rozman, the learned judge's crucial findings were  that Rozman was subnormal and ‘may not be able to discern right from wrong' and could be easily manipulated and that he was a ‘guileless simpleton' and ‘would not have embarked upon this expedition for a mere $100 … if not for his feeble mind which seemed to have been overborne by the CNB agent and the CNB operative.' Having made these findings, he held that these factors affected or lessened ‘the degree of guilt' of Rozman with respect to the charge of trafficking and as a result ‘a grave doubt arose as to whether he could be criminally responsible to warrant the mandatory death sentence'. With the utmost respect, we think that the learned judge has confused the presence of mens rea, which is an essential element in a criminal offence, with the mitigating factors in the punishment for the offence.""

In relation to the first charge, the following facts have been established and are not really in dispute. On the afternoon of 24 November 1993, Tan [a CNB agent] met Rozman at Rochor Centre and negotiations took place between them for the sale and purchase of cannabis. Rozman agreed to sell one kilogram of cannabis [that is a pretty substantial amount] to Tan at the price of $1,800 with delivery taking place on the following day. On 25 November 1993 they met again at Rochor Centre at about 5.30 pm and further discussion took place. It was agreed that they should meet later at the bus stop opposite Bukit Timah Shopping Centre. Later, Razali as the rider of the motorcycle with Rozman as the pillion rider brought the drugs to a spot near the bus stop. There Tan and Rozman met again, and it was agreed that the drugs would be delivered at the KFC restaurant at Bukit Timah Shopping Centre. Soon thereafter, Rozman turned up at the KFC restaurant where Tan had been waiting and brought along bundle A in a paper bag and pointed the content of the bag to Tan with a view to effecting delivery. Now, what clearly emerged from these facts were as follows  first, Tan and Rozman, notwithstanding that each did not speak the language of the other proficiently − the learned judge gave little credence to the conversations which Tan alleged had taken place − had made themselves understood to each other, whether using Malay, English or Hokkien or a combination of them, and arrangement had been made for the sale and delivery of one kilogram of cannabis to Tan; secondly, Rozman knew what he was doing  he negotiated with Tan on the price for one kilogram of cannabis and thereafter acted consciously and purposefully to procure the cannabis to sell to Tan; and thirdly there was no force or coercion exerted on Rozman such that his will was overborne by the CNB operatives. Indeed, there was no evidence to show that Rozman had either been manipulated by the CNB operatives or that they had taken an active role in persuading Rozman to sell the drugs without his willing and active participation. In particular, there was no evidence that Tan had taken an excessively active and overpowering role in persuading Rozman to sell the drugs. Rozman might have been easily induced or instigated by Tan and the agent informant at the first meeting to sell the drugs to Tan; he might have benefited only in a small way from this transaction and in that respect he might have been made use of and exploited by his supplier (whoever he might be) who would receive the bulk of the profits. However, these considerations whether singly or collectively do not constitute a defence to the charge; nor can they in any way be said to eradicate Rozman's mens rea in trafficking in the drugs which he had agreed to sell to Tan.""

He may be a person of low intellect or subnormal intellect. But, as the learned judge held, and we agree, low or subnormal intellect is not unsoundness of mind and is not a defence to a criminal charge, and an educationally subnormal person can be criminally culpable for his actions. Now, even accepting the assessment of Rozman as given by Ms Wuts, Rozman was not really so intellectually disabled as to be incapable of knowing the nature of his act or of discerning that the act was either wrong or contrary to law. True, Ms Wuts expressed the opinion that Rozman might not have been able to discern right from wrong. But this opinion is itself inconclusive; it seems to be neither here nor there. On the contrary, on the evidence, including his own evidence, Rozman knew it was contrary to law to sell drugs; he knew the consequences that would be visited on him if he sold drugs.

The Court of Appeal said he knew what he was doing. He knew what he was doing was wrong, and that the low intellect in that case was not of a level for the Court to conclude that he did not know what he was doing. It is difficult, without having gone through, say, the detailed case notes and so on, to go into minute analysis. We have to go by what the law report says. But, as I said earlier, Rozman's case, as well as many other cases, was considered when we were developing the framework which is before the House.

Before I begin, I want to offer my deepest condolences to the families of PTE Lee Rui Feng Dominique Sarron and 3SG Tan Mou Sheng. The SAF and MINDEF are deeply sorry for the untimely and tragic loss of PTE Lee and 3SG Tan and the anguish and distress it has brought to their families. I will now ask the Clerk to distribute the facts of these two cases [",1,475,2012-11-14-T-022-S-00475

COIs are chaired by senior civil servants outside MINDEF. Members also include one or two medical specialists, who would be able to provide professional expertise. The COI has full powers and access to information and personnel to independently investigate fully the circumstances leading to death, to determine the contributory events or persons and make recommendations to rectify lapses, if any. MINDEF and the SAF treat COI reports with utmost seriousness so that we can avoid similar occurrences.",2,476,2012-11-14-T-022-S-00476

2012-11-14-T-022,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"First, on PTE Lee Rui Feng Dominique Sarron. The main substantive findings from the COI report on PTE Lee. On 17 April 2012, PTE Lee participated in an exercise at the Murai Urban Training Facility at Lim Chu Kang. Smoke grenades were thrown outside a building. PTE Lee entered one of the rooms of that building, and experienced breathing difficulties after exposure to the smoke. He was immediately accompanied away from the smoke but lost consciousness outside the building. He received Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation on the spot and was evacuated in a safety vehicle to the Sungei Gedong Medical Centre, before being sent to the National University Hospital (NUH) in an SAF ambulance. Resuscitative efforts by an SAF medical officer continued throughout the journey and at NUH. The COI found that ""the medical aid rendered was timely, adequate and proper"". Regrettably, however, PTE Lee was pronounced dead after these attempts failed.",4,478,2012-11-14-T-022-S-00478

2012-11-14-T-022,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The cause of death was certified by the forensic pathologist of the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) to be due to an ""acute allergic reaction to zinc chloride due to inhalation of zinc chloride fumes"". Zinc chloride is a primary component of smoke grenades currently used in the SAF.",6,480,2012-11-14-T-022-S-00480
2012-11-14-T-022,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The COI found that the number of smoke grenades used in the exercise exceeded the limit specified in training safety regulations. The Training Safety Regulations (TSR) stipulate that the minimum distance between each thrown smoke grenade should be not less than 20 metres and that the minimum distance between troops and the thrown smoke grenade should not be less than 10 metres. Based on the exercise layout, not more than two smoke grenades should have been used, but the Platoon Commander had thrown six grenades instead. The COI opined that ""if the TSR had been complied with, PTE Lee and his platoon mates would not have been subjected to smoke that was as dense as that during the incident, and for as long as they were during the incident"" and that ""reduced exposure to smoke would have reduced the risks of any adverse reactions to the smoke."" The COI concluded that ""the cause of death of PTE Lee resulted from inhalation of the fumes from the smoke grenades used in the incident"".",7,481,2012-11-14-T-022-S-00481

The COI found that PTE Lee's medical classification and vocational assignment were appropriate, based on the severity and control of his asthma condition. The COI was unable to establish with certainty if PTE Lee's history of asthma was a contributory factor to his death. First, the COI noted that the specific effects of zinc chloride fumes on asthmatics had not been reported in medical literature. Second, adverse reactions to zinc chloride can occur even in individuals without asthma. Third, the other platoon mates with asthma had developed only mild symptoms after the exposure to the zinc chloride fumes in the same exercise.",9,483,2012-11-14-T-022-S-00483

2012-11-14-T-022,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"First, on the use of smoke grenades in training. Sir, smoke grenades which produce zinc chloride fumes have been in use by the SAF since 1970s. They are also used by other militaries and agencies, such as the United States and the Republic of Korea militaries, because in acceptable concentrations of exposure, these smoke grenades are safe. Lung injury following exposure to zinc chloride fumes, and even deaths, have been reported in international literature but the numbers are few and mainly occur after exposure to high concentrations of zinc chloride fumes. In fact, PTE Lee's death directly attributable to zinc chloride inhalation is the first on SAF's records.",13,487,2012-11-14-T-022-S-00487
2012-11-14-T-022,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"To update our TSR for smoke grenades, MINDEF had in 1998 commissioned the Department of Community, Occupational and Family Medicine of the National University of Singapore to conduct a detailed technical evaluation of smoke grenades. Specifically, concentrations of zinc chloride fumes were measured at different distances from the thrown smoke grenades to determine the safety parameters. The findings of that study now form the TSR for smoke grenades that I have previously detailed.",14,488,2012-11-14-T-022-S-00488
2012-11-14-T-022,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Smoke grenades, which have zinc chloride fumes, are still safe to use if the TSRs are observed.

So that our soldiers can train with confidence, MINDEF would like to address these concerns directly.",15,489,2012-11-14-T-022-S-00489
2012-11-14-T-022,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Following PTE Lee's death, the SAF has suspended for training exercises the use of the smoke grenades which produce zinc chloride fumes. The suspension will continue as the SAF is studying using smoke grenades which do not produce zinc chloride for training exercises. For missions, we will continue to use zinc chloride smoke grenades as they are judged still to be the most operationally effective.",16,490,2012-11-14-T-022-S-00490
2012-11-14-T-022,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The second public concern arising from this case is due to asthma, as a significant proportion of National Servicemen – one in five – have asthma, albeit often in a mild form. The SAF convened a Respiratory Medicine Specialist Advisory Board, consisting of five senior respiratory medicine specialists to address this issue, taking into account the COI report. The Advisory Board concluded that the SAF medical classification on asthma is relevant, up to date and in line with national and international standards. It is still safe for servicemen with a history of asthma to undergo training with smoke grenades if the TSRs are followed.

He was travelling with other instructors in a scout jeep and seated at the rear of the jeep. When the jeep overturned, 3SG Tan was thrown out and pinned under the jeep. 3SG Tan was extricated, attended to by a medic and evacuated in a safety vehicle to the Nee Soon Camp Medical Centre. The duty Medical Officer immediately accompanied 3SG Tan to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital via SAF ambulance. 3SG Tan underwent emergency surgery but, despite this, succumbed to his injuries.

First, the jeep driver was not licensed to drive. The Conducting Officer had assigned the jeep driver to drive without checking if he had a licence. Neither did the assigned jeep driver highlight to his superior that he was not licensed to drive a jeep. Second, the two rear passengers, one of whom was 3SG Tan, were not wearing helmets or lap belts.

Second, an Army Safety Review Board (ASRB), chaired by a senior civil servant outside MINDEF, has been set up to review the Army's overall safety structure, processes and culture. Third, the SAF will set up an SAF Inspectorate, reporting directly to the Chief of Defence Force. The SAF Inspectorate will set the safety culture across the entire SAF and oversee the individual inspectorates of the three services.

But to prevent injuries and death, our commanders and soldiers must observe training safety regulations. Any commander who ignores safety regulations, whether wilfully or negligently, puts his soldiers at risk, and is not fit for command. Our soldiers can train realistically and safely. There need not be a compromise. Indeed, the more we ensure that conditions are safe, the greater confidence our soldiers will have in training. These two deaths could have been avoided if safety instructions had been followed. The SAF will learn from the incidents, correct any inadequacies and punish those who disregarded safety regulations.

But having said that, one recognises that our safety standards are fairly high, comparatively. Again, I am not saying that that is a figure we accept. We are always striving towards zero injuries and deaths, but that is the figure as it is. The two-per-year is to be taken in the context of how many servicemen we have in training. We have 40,000 full-time National Servicemen. Each year, about 180,000 NSmen come back for their In-Camp Training for a few days to a few weeks.

The first  especially in the case of the smoke grenade, it does appear that an error in human judgement was exercised on the part of the commanders. Do we have an indication of the timeline as to when a decision on whether further proceedings, General Court Martial will be carried out on the responsible personnel, given that deaths occurred? There is a need to re-assure the public, other servicemen and their families that SAF does take this very seriously. The fact that they were re-deployed to non-command positions is a good step forward, but I think families and parents would appreciate knowing that the people who are responsible are held to task.",1,518,2012-11-14-T-022-S-00518
2012-11-14-T-022,Nicholas Fang,Mr Nicholas Fang,"My second question pertains to the fact that a huge raft of measures are put in place to ensure that TSRs and the safety culture are improved and maintained.

In an independent track, on the parallel track, the Police investigations will then be submitted to decide whether there will be civil prosecution. In addition, the coroner may decide to hold an open inquiry, and that will take its course. So, while we want closure to the aspects, I think we want to also ensure that due process is followed.",1,520,2012-11-14-T-022-S-00520

In fact, that is not the message. It is a false dichotomy. If we look at these two incidents, they are not high-risk training aspects – driving in a jeep, clearing a room in an urban training set-up. Within the SAF, we do much riskier exercises, in that sense – live-firing, we jump off helicopters, we take deep dives. And it is not the risk of that activity that sets the people at risk. It was just disregard for safety instructions. And the message to commanders is, if you disregard safety instructions, you put men at risk, you are not fit for command. Two, realistic training does not have to be unsafe training. In fact, the opposite is true. If you make training conditions safe, soldiers will train with greater confidence.",2,521,2012-11-14-T-022-S-00521

Let me just say that it is related to the second question on the open reporting culture, which means that not only do we want to encourage them to be conscious of safety regulation breaches, but even when they have followed safety regulations and there are near-misses, as the Member said, in countries or agencies with good safety culture, that an open reporting system is, indeed, the hallmark of one. And we have started that. The Army established a safety hotline in November 2011, where soldiers can ring the hotline and report safety problems. And since then, in nearly a year, we have received about 100 calls. They report, exactly as the Member said, unsafe practices, near misses or safety hazards. So, we will continue to encourage that. In addition to the Army hotline, there are ""1800"" numbers, so that we want to have an open reporting system.",1,525,2012-11-14-T-022-S-00525
2012-11-14-T-022,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The Member also asked if what happened in the Combat Intelligence School was a systemic one, and that was the question we ourselves asked in MINDEF. Was this just an isolated incident or was this one example of a systemic problem? The Chief of Army has assured me that this is an isolated problem. His assurance or his judgement is based on the Army Safety Inspectorate that does routine inspections. My other source of assurance is the fact, in terms of our training or vehicle accident rate, it is fairly low, it is something in the order of 0.5 to 0.6 accidents per 100 thousand kilometres. Now, that is not a sure sign, and I know some Members will say maybe, ""They do not report it"". But be that as it may, it gives you a rough gauge of the accident rate, which is fairly low. And also, my fourth assurance is what the COI uncovered. In this particular incident, there were two jeeps for the second incident. The jeep which 3SG Tan was in had an unlicensed driver, and they did not wear any helmets or lap belts. The jeep in front of them, all four wore helmets, lap belts and a licensed driver. So, I think, it is an isolated incident but, nonetheless, we want to continue to step up checks and make sure that that kind of lax attitude towards safety regulations does not spread.",2,526,2012-11-14-T-022-S-00526

I know the Minister has replied to that saying, ""Yes, it will"". My further question is whether that can be shared between the services. For example, in the Army where there is a safe land movement unit and they have a good safety record, would they be willing to share with the Air Force or the Navy, where there are less land movement exercises to be performed – cross-service sharing of best practices and near-misses, arising out of the new inspectorate?",1,527,2012-11-14-T-022-S-00527

The SAF looked at it, and decided it needed an inspectorate that reports directly to the Chief of Defence Force (CDF) for accountability and responsibility, that oversees the three services, and, first of all, inculcates and embeds a high safety culture within the SAF and that inculcates safety habits into individual commanders and men, as well as − what the Member Christopher de Souza has suggested − to just share best practices across Services.",1,529,2012-11-14-T-022-S-00529

2012-11-14-T-022,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The COI concluded this from interviews with servicemen. It was on various aspects. One, in terms of the vehicle safety management. It was in response to whether conducting officers checked whether drivers were licensed in the first place. Two, their procedures in terms of vehicular movements in the training field. And I would agree with the COI in terms of that conclusion. Independently, the Army Safety Inspectorate has done a review of that, and recommended to SAF, MINDEF, the removal of certain personalities from command. And as I have mentioned, the SAF has acted on that.",1,531,2012-11-14-T-022-S-00531

Drivers are now required to show their driving licence whenever they board their vehicles. I would like to ask two supplementary questions and make one observation. One, is that in 2010, there were no accidents or deaths reported; 2011, there were three; and in this year alone, there have been five fatalities. I would like to ask the Minister whether there have been any COI or BOI findings that the overall safety awareness in the SAF may have fallen?

This is the highest daily fatality rate of any given day within the week. Is it possible that safety has become lax due to the fact that this is the last training day of the week, and whether any measures should be taken to address this?",5,536,2012-11-14-T-022-S-00536

The Member's point about Friday, I would have to check that up, but if that is true, I think that is a useful point.

2012-11-14-T-022,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"I would have to say that of the two deaths that I talked about each year, the majority of them are not in these cases where there are clear breaches of safety instructions. Some of them were really medically related. For example, cardiomyopathy or viral infections – which when after the COI has ascertained all the facts and whether we could have done anything different, and we have asked the medical specialist board – the answer is, no. That is the extent of our technological ability and its inability to just determine before the incident whether anything could have been done to prevent it. Some were acts of God, for example, like the tree falling on the soldier outside the training grounds, and completely unforecasted or hard to predict. But when it comes to cases which are of public interest and significance, the SAF and MINDEF will share these cases, as I am doing for these two cases in this House.",2,538,2012-11-14-T-022-S-00538

2012-11-14-T-022,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The answer is, no, it is not a matter of procedure. The overriding principle is one of fastest evacuation to a facility that has the capabilities to resuscitate the injured. The Member would, of course, be aware that time is of the essence. For example, whether they are bleeding or they have an airway obstruction. And some of the trips back to, say a hospital, may take a longer time. And so the principle is they will be evacuated to the nearest either medical centre or hospital facilities which can provide that resuscitation.",1,540,2012-11-14-T-022-S-00540

I think it will be especially difficult when servicemen lose their lives under circumstances that could have been prevented. I want to assure this House and members of the public that – some Members mentioned restoring confidence and I think Member Seah Kian Peng made that point – the first step is, as Member Low Thia Khiang said, to be open, to be transparent, to leave no stone unturned to discover why and how it happened. And then correct the lapses and continue to report to the public and to families the measures that we have taken and the progress of these measures. I know that this is not a one-off exercise that we conduct; this is a long-term exercise that we need to inculcate a better safety culture. I want to assure this House that SAF will learn from this and put things right. After all that is said and done, I think what will show is what happens on the ground that will give confidence to our men.

In addition, where the court orders life imprisonment, it is also given the discretion to order caning. For consistency, clause 3 repeals and re-enacts section 304 to remove the option of a fine when life imprisonment is ordered for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. In other words, when the court orders life imprisonment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, it can still order caning but not a fine.",4,549,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00549

2012-11-14-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Let me explain the rationale for these changes, Sir. It was set out in July. We are making the changes in the context of the homicide rate in Singapore which is low – 0.3 cases per 100,000 population. In these circumstances, we think it right to introduce more judicial discretion in deciding whether the death sentence ought to be imposed for murder. That, as Members will appreciate, is our starting point, as I stated in the earlier debate on the amendments to the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill. Where possible, where practical, where it is realistic, and where it does not substantially impact our crime control framework, we must move towards giving greater discretion to the courts. In fact, that is the case for the vast majority of our laws. Mandatory sentences are and should be the exception.",6,551,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00551

2012-11-14-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The transitional provisions are in clause 4. They work as follows. The court which last heard the case will clarify the limb of murder under which the accused is guilty. Before the court does so, the prosecution or the accused may apply to the court to adduce further evidence as to the limb of section 300 under which the accused is guilty. After the court clarifies that, it will affirm the death sentence for section 300(a) cases. For section 300(b), (c) and (d), there will be re-sentencing by the High Court, which will decide whether to impose the death penalty or life imprisonment, and whether there should be caning in the latter case. The High Court's re-sentencing decision can be appealed against. Those who have not exhausted their appeals against conviction can also bring an appeal at the same time. The new requirement for the Court of Appeal to confirm sentences of death which will be introduced by the next Bill, the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill, will also apply to these transitional cases. At the end of the appellate process, those still under a sentence of death will go through the clemency process.",8,553,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00553

2012-11-14-T-023,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed amendments to the Penal Code centre on the introduction of the judicial discretion to not impose the death sentence for non-intentional killing. This marks a significant change to the former penalty regime where all forms of murder were punished with the mandatory death sentence.",1,556,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00556

2012-11-14-T-023,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"I welcome this change. There is a difference between someone who intends to commit murder who will still be sentenced to death and one who does not but should know that the injury he intends to inflict may very well cause death. Although still wrong, it reflects a lower level of culpability which should, in the appropriate circumstances, be met with something less than the ultimate sentence of death. Sometimes, judges are faced with the moral dilemma of whether to apply the law in its strictest sense, and convict someone who did not intend to kill or murder, knowing it will attract the harshest sentence on our Statute books. This has sometimes led to the occasional odd result where the criteria for the accused to be convicted of the lesser offence of manslaughter, which does not carry the mandatory death penalty, to be applied in an uncharacteristically liberal way. This is not to criticise our courts as, in such cases, both prosecutor and defence counsel can perceive the horns of the dilemma that the courts are perched on. The proposed amendments would, hopefully, put an end to such quixotic decisions.",3,558,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00558

Another Member pressed for the removal of mandatory sentences generally, arguing that the courts should have full discretion to mete out punishment according to the facts of each case. I respect those views coming from Members who are speaking from their conscience but I do not agree with them. The Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Law, in their responses on the Misuse of Drugs Bill, spoke powerfully and eloquently on those topics, and allow me to add my brief comments to that debate.",4,559,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00559
2012-11-14-T-023,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"First, whether we should continue to have the death penalty. We are not the only country to have such a penalty and certainly not the only developed nation which has this on our Statute books. It is said to be barbaric, based on medieval concepts of retribution, and that we should temper justice with mercy in not putting the worst offender to death.",5,560,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00560
2012-11-14-T-023,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"But I believe that justice and mercy are a two-way street. While we should rightfully have concern for the position of the convicted murderer or drug trafficker, what about their victims? Are they not entitled to protection under the law as well? Does this protection not require that the punishment fit the crime? And does this protection entail that the punishment be severe enough to deter others from going down the same lawless route? It is, afterall, deterrence, not retribution, that guides modern sentencing policy, and the paramount objective is to protect future victims from suffering a similar fate.",6,561,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00561

2012-11-14-T-023,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"The paradigm example is the mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking which has engaged this House in vigorous debate from Monday to today. In my view, it has played an integral part in our overall zero-tolerance approach to drugs that has kept Singapore largely drug-free, especially compared to other developed nations and even some of our neighbours in the region, and the Minister for Law had some sobering statistics to refer to in his reply on the Misuse of Drugs Bill.",10,565,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00565
2012-11-14-T-023,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"Yet, another example, lest one thinks that mandatory death sentences are only confined to death penalty, is the mandatory imprisonment for rape offences. Many of us would have come across cases in other countries where convicted rapists walk free with a fine or suspended sentence because the particular judge felt there that that was appropriate in the circumstances of the case. Amidst all the outrage and protests that such decisions provoke, one cannot help but think that the problem would have been averted if judges did not have that much discretion.",11,566,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00566
2012-11-14-T-023,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"What lies at the heart of mandatory sentences is the interest which Parliament deems so important to protect that it cannot be left to the discretion of individual judges. Hence, we have mandatory death sentences for drug trafficking because Parliament considers the serious damage that drugs can cause to many, many victims, including their families, demands that wrongdoers pay the ultimate penalty. Similarly, the mandatory sentences for rape and sex crimes against children are underpinned by the regard, the concern for their welfare and the imperative of deterring criminals who seek to prey on them.",12,567,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00567
2012-11-14-T-023,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"We do not have those sensational outcomes that you read about from other countries where perpetrators walk away from a serious crime unscathed in part because Parliament has seen fit to mandate the punishment to fit the crime. This is not to say that all mandatory sentences are good things and I was heartened to note that the Minister for Law, in his opening speech on the Penal Code amendments, said that they are the exceptions rather than the rule. One may recall the attempt to clamp down on the harbouring of illegal aliens by imposing jail terms. This was under the Immigration Act on offenders even when they have been misled by the illegal aliens as to their credentials. Unless the persons who had led them into their home had checked his original passport and work permit, the courts had no choice but to sentence them to jail. And among those who suffered imprisonment before the law was changed were a priest and an elderly grandmother. So, I do hope that the Ministry of Law not stop at the mandatory death sentences for murder but carry out a wholesale review of the mandatory sentences in our Penal Code and other penal statutes to see if they are properly calibrated for the interest they seek to protect or simply to see whether or not some of them may have outlived their usefulness.",13,568,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00568

2012-11-14-T-023,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee,"According to some academics, the Court appears to worry about the fact of death above all and that it matters little if the injury is serious or not serious. With the amendments, the Court will have the discretion to sentence the accused to death penalty or life imprisonment, and the death sentence will no longer be mandatory. I think this will help to rectify some views which are less than objective. For example, the view that the Singapore legal system is too stringent, and the penalties are too harsh, and it is not appropriate. On the contrary, these amendments prove that our society has held a consistently clear view of the law – our laws provide a safe, crime-free environment for our citizens, but we also seek consistency in the application of our laws, and will continue to do our best to improve in this aspect.",14,584,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00584

2012-11-14-T-023,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Sir, it is overdue but very welcome that the Government recognises that the existing definition of murder under section 300 of the Penal Code is just too wide to justify the death penalty in every case.",2,588,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00588
2012-11-14-T-023,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"For instance, section 300, limb (c), has long been much criticised by academics for attracting the death penalty mandatorily. Under this limb, a person is guilty of murder if he intentionally inflicts an injury which causes death, not necessarily knowing that the injury is of a fatal nature. A classic example is a stab wound to the thigh, which many people do not realise is usually sufficient medically to cause death due to a severance of the femoral vein. In such cases, the accused person may not have intended death and may not have even known that death was likely to result from the injury. It was clearly too harsh to have mandatory death in such cases.",3,589,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00589

The alternative of life imprisonment gives the judge some room to give weight to the circumstances of each case.

During the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) debate, I had touched on the mixed nature of studies which tried to ascertain the deterrent effect of the death penalty on homicides. I had also spoken then about how the mandatory death penalty shifts power away from the Courts to the Public Prosecutor, enabling him to determine the outcome of the case through the choice of charge. I note the Minister's earlier statement during the MDA debate that former Attorney-General Walter Woon's reservations about the mandatory death penalty shifting power to the Public Prosecutor applied particularly in the context of homicide cases.",5,591,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00591

Having an intention to kill is clearly more blameworthy than the mental states required under sections 300(b), (c) or (d) – after all, the accused in section 300(a) intended to bring about the death of the victim. However, a closer examination of situations coming within section 300(a) will show that an intention to kill can be present in a wide range of circumstances, which, I submit, should not be lumped together for the same sentence of death.",6,592,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00592

We have also had groups who rob and kill hard-working taxi-drivers with deadly weapons. Moving to the other end of the spectrum, we find more multi-faceted scenarios where the accused is not inherently a killer. For instance, an accused finds a childhood friend whom he discovers has been having a long affair with his wife behind his back, in his matrimonial bed, and is unable to get over the betrayal despite a lapse of time. Another example is where a person who kills under a threat that his child will be killed if he does not do so, will be guilty under section 300(a), because the defence of duress does not apply to murder. An intention to kill can also be formed on the spot. There is no requirement for premeditation or any pre-arranged plan to kill under section 300(a), whereas in some other jurisdictions, murder which is not pre-meditated is classified as murder in the second degree.",8,594,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00594

2012-11-14-T-023,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Sir, it is true that persons charged with murder under section 300(a) will not hang if they can prove that they have a valid defence under the Penal Code. For instance, if the accused can prove that he acted in self-defence, this is a full defence leading to acquittal. If he can show that he was provoked by something sudden and grave, he may have a partial defence which would reduce his sentence to a long jail term. However, these defences will only succeed if the accused is able to prove them in Court on a balance of probabilities. Because the burden of proof is on him, he must convince the Court and, preferably, find witnesses to support his case. There could well be a conflict of expert evidence, for example, on whether the accused has some mental illness which would diminish his responsibility for his actions, forcing the court to choose one expert over another. In addition, defences are strictly worded and sometimes expect a person to behave in very measured ways. For example, for the partial defence of provocation, the accused must not have had time to cool off, which is construed strictly.",10,596,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00596

I would argue that this will still be achieved if the death sentence was available to the judge, especially since a wide range of circumstances are caught under section 300(a). As a second alternative, I repeat my suggestion that the Government could consider phrasing the death penalty as the presumptive sentence for section 300(a).",11,597,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00597

We should consider employing such a device here, which would still send a strong signal to society about the seriousness of the offence of murder and yet allow Judges to depart if the circumstances of the case warrant it. Some factors which could be considered by the Court for such departure include whether the accused acted under duress, whether the murder was premediated or not, and if the accused did not carry any weapons to the scene.",13,599,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00599

While I acknowledge the significance of the changes this Bill brings, I believe further reform of our homicide provisions is desirable. For instance, it remains a mystery why section 300(c) should still be classified as murder, when the accused need not have intended death nor known that death was likely. Even after this amendment Bill, the Judge could still impose death for section 300(c), which is not easy to justify. It seems more appropriate to move such situations lower down the seriousness ladder to a lesser category of homicide which does not attract death.",14,600,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00600
2012-11-14-T-023,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Sir, as a wider law reform exercise, the Government may also wish to look at the broader structure of the homicide provisions. We inherited our Penal Code from our colonial days, and the drafting of the homicide provisions has been criticised by no less than an eminent jurist, Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, who drafted our Criminal Procedure Code. He labelled our homicide provisions as the ""weakest"" part of the Penal Code, calling them ""obscure"" and ""not fully thought out"". His criticisms were several. Homicide itself has not been defined in the Penal Code, except in the context of culpable homicide; murder is a species of culpable homicide; the definitions of murder and culpable homicide also closely resemble each other, such that it is difficult to distinguish between them. For instance, a person intending to cause injury which is sufficient to cause death is a murderer, but a person intending to cause injury likely to cause death commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder. This may be why the Member before me, Mr Alvin Yeo, classified the situation as ""chaotic"".",15,601,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00601

There are precedents from other countries to study, for example, the Australian states, and the UK, which both had law reforms in this area. The Americans have first and second degree murder, and then manslaughter. If a review is done to remove the overlap between culpable homicide and murder, I believe the law will be clearer; and the public will also better understand the homicide provisions.",17,603,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00603

Giving our Supreme Court judges the discretion in sentencing in cases of conviction under section 300(b), (c) or (d) is an imperative if we are to temper justice with mercy.

That has been my own philosophy, and we try to put that in place where possible, but I have to tell Mr Yeo that it is beyond my purview to look at all legislation, most of which are not under the Ministry of Law or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. But I will pass his message on to the Ministries concerned, and I thank him for his suggestion. I think that it is, in principle, a sound policy and one which we try to institute.

2012-11-14-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"First, on section 300(a). It is a fair point to say that many different types of cases can fall within section 300(a). A cold-blooded, deliberate, planned, gangster-style execution on the one hand; on the other hand, someone who finds out that his wife had betrayed him and then goes out and decides to kill. But the fact is, even in the latter situation, it is deliberate, cold-blooded, intentional killing. If it is done out of provocation, on the spur of the moment, there is a defence. Ms Lim knows that. And there are other defences as well  self-defence and so on. But I can see that another approach is to have a presumptive death sentence and let the accused show why it should not apply. That is a possible approach. On balance, looking at section 300(a) today, our assessment is that society sees this as extremely serious – intentional, cold-blooded, deliberate killing – and that in such situations, the mandatory death penalty should apply. But for section 300(b), (c) and (d), we are making a significant change. The balance is a question of judgment, I accept that.",5,622,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00622
2012-11-14-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"On the suggestion that there should be further reform, we continuously review these areas. Specific to section 300(c), I do know that it has attracted a lot of commentary and a lot of attention. Likewise, it has received a lot of attention from us as well and the group of people we consulted. I think the list has been circulated. Let me make three points on section 300(c).",6,623,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00623

2012-11-14-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The first is, when we consulted, the submission that the academics gave was that the repeal of section 300(c) is not likely to, in any significant way, affect the manner in which homicide offences are dealt with. I quote  ""While it is true that a great majority of murder convictions since 1972…has been technically based on section 300(c), a study of the relevant facts and circumstances reveal that in almost all of them, a conviction under one of the other three subsections (section 300(a), (b) and (d)) would have been likely."" That, of course, is not a complete answer to why you should keep section 300(c). I accept that and, in fact, there was a significant body of opinion among those we consulted that section 300(c) ought to be deleted or moved to some other place.",8,625,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00625
2012-11-14-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The second point is, in the short period between the completion of the latest review in July and putting up the Bill now, I did not think we should take such a major step. The key reason is that we are now giving the Judges the discretion to impose life imprisonment. So, a High Court Judge who decides to impose the death sentence in a section 300(c) case would, in fact, have been satisfied that the death sentence, as opposed to life imprisonment, was warranted on the facts. That is a significant factor to bear in mind when we talk about section 300(c).",9,626,2012-11-14-T-023-S-00626

That said, and as I have said on more than one occasion, while we look at what the majority of the society want, we also look at what is right. In this case, for the reasons that I have given, we believe that it is also right at this time to keep section 300(a) as it is, and I thank Asst Prof Tan for his views.

2012-11-14-T-024,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"This Bill makes two key changes to criminal procedure. The first is to the appellate procedure. Clause 10 amends section 374 to provide that no appeal can be filed against a conviction until sentence is passed for that offence. Clause 11 amends section 377 to provide that the time for filing an appeal against conviction, or against conviction and sentence, starts running from the date of the sentence. These two amendments ensure that appeals against conviction and sentence are brought and heard together, consistent with what is already the practice today. Also, with the amendments, an accused no longer has to file a notice of appeal against conviction while waiting for sentence to be passed, but can instead wait until sentence is passed before making a decision.",2,638,2012-11-14-T-024-S-00638
2012-11-14-T-024,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,The second key change is to require confirmation by the Court of Appeal before a sentence of death can be carried out. Clause 12 amends section 383 to provide that sentences of death shall not be carried out unless confirmed by the Court of Appeal in an appeal by the accused; or a petition for confirmation by the Public Prosecutor where there is no appeal.,3,639,2012-11-14-T-024-S-00639
2012-11-14-T-024,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"This petition for confirmation is a new procedure created by clause 13 which introduces a new Division 1A in Part XX of the Criminal Procedure Code. The process is triggered when no appeal is filed within the time allowed for an appeal, and 90 days have expired after the time allowed for appeal has elapsed. Once the process is triggered, the Public Prosecutor will be required to lodge a petition for confirmation.",4,640,2012-11-14-T-024-S-00640

The Court of Appeal may choose to hear parties if it deems that to be necessary. After examining the record, the court will either confirm the sentence of death passed upon the accused; or set it aside, and it can make such further orders as it deems fit.",5,641,2012-11-14-T-024-S-00641

2012-11-14-T-024,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee,"The saying goes, ""A human life is of greater value than anything else."" According to the amendment Bill, even if the accused who is sentenced to death did not appeal, the Court of Appeal will still automatically initiate the appeal proceedings. Under the new proceedings, the Public Prosecutor must lodge a petition for confirmation with the Court of Appeal after sentencing. The Court of Appeal will then review the correctness, legality and propriety of the death penalty decision. Without confirmation from the Court of Appeal, no death sentence shall be carried out.",2,647,2012-11-14-T-024-S-00647
2012-11-14-T-024,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee,"This amendment is significant. Many developed and democratic countries have abolished death penalty out of respect for life. Singapore still retains the mandatory death penalty, which appears not in line with the norms of a civil society. Our leaders have always emphasised the importance of building an ideal home, a caring and harmonious society, then why not abolish the death penalty?",3,648,2012-11-14-T-024-S-00648
2012-11-14-T-024,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee,"The most important reason is that the situation in Singapore is different. Singapore maintains the death penalty because it can deter crimes effectively; it is also widely supported by the public. The Government is reviewing the death penalty to ensure that Singapore's judicial system is able to strike a balance between different objectives, so that both the victim and the accused are treated fairly. I believe this move demonstrates respect to each individual life. Sir, I support the amendment Bill.",4,649,2012-11-14-T-024-S-00649
2012-11-14-T-024,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill provides for the Court of Appeal to automatically review all death sentences passed, in cases where the accused does not lodge an appeal.

2012-11-14-T-024,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"I would like to seek two clarifications on the Bill. First, clause 7 amends section 313 of the Criminal Procedure Code regarding what is to be done after a death sentence has been passed by a High Court Judge. The proposed change to section 313(c) will now provide that the trial Judge must produce a report stating whether, in his opinion, there is any reason why the death sentence should be carried out. By contrast, the current provision states that he should give his opinion whether there is any reason why the death sentence should or should not be carried out. I would like to know why the Judge now no longer needs to give his opinion as to whether the death sentence should not be carried out. I think his opinion on this is still highly relevant, since we are still retaining offences where the death penalty is mandatory, such as intentional killing under section 300(a) of the Penal Code, and for drugs and firearms offences. I note that the trial Judge's opinion on whether the death sentence is justified will later be read by the President, who has the prerogative of mercy. There may be strong mitigating circumstances which the trial judge noted, but due to the mandatory provisions, he had no choice but to impose the death sentence. However, the President can still do something about it by exercising his prerogative of mercy.",3,652,2012-11-14-T-024-S-00652
2012-11-14-T-024,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"My second clarification concerns the provision at section 394D. It is provided there that no party has the right to be heard in a petition of confirmation, but the court may, if it thinks fit, hear any party either personally or by advocate. If the presence of the parties is still to be discretionary, I think it is important that, if the Court of Appeal wishes to hear from one party, the other party must be present as well. This will enable the other party to respond, if necessary, to any new matters which are raised, and make this last Court appearance fair to all parties before the death sentence is confirmed.",4,653,2012-11-14-T-024-S-00653

Sir, the Minister would agree with me that it is at the trial stage that important findings of fact are done. An appellate Court is loathed to disturb a finding of fact, given that it did not have the opportunity of hearing the evidence first-hand and also of observing the demeanour of the witnesses. Given such deference, having two Judges at the trial level can enhance the public's confidence and that of the accused person in the trial processes. We no longer have the backlog of cases at the Supreme Court level and should be able to deploy two High Court Judges in capital offence cases.",6,659,2012-11-14-T-024-S-00659
2012-11-14-T-024,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,"I also seek the Minister's clarification on the role of the President in clause 7 of the Bill. My understanding is that the President will have to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet, and that the President has no discretion in this matter under the proposed new procedure relating to the execution of death sentences. As such, would it not be better not to bring the President into the framework, given that his role is apparently a procedural formality? I fear that this may reinforce the perception that the President is a mere ""rubber stamp"".",7,660,2012-11-14-T-024-S-00660

And what is this significance? Well, collectively they urge Members of this House and Singaporeans to appreciate the value and sanctity of life.

2012-11-14-T-024,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Ms Lim had a couple of questions. For the first question, I am not sure I followed very carefully. The current requirement is that the trial judge must, within a reasonable time after a period had lapsed, send to the Minister, a copy of the notes of evidence taken at the trial with a report in writing signed by him stating whether, in his opinion, there are any reasons and, if so, what are the reasons why the death sentence should or should not be carried out. What is now happening is that the Court of Appeal is inserted in the middle because even if there is no appeal, the matter must go to the Court of Appeal.",2,663,2012-11-14-T-024-S-00663

2012-11-14-T-024,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The new requirement under subsection (c) is that ""the trial Judge who tried the accused must, within a reasonable time after the sentence has been pronounced, prepare a copy of the notes of evidence taken at the trial and a report in writing signed by him stating whether, in his opinion, there is any reason (and, if so, particulars of the reason) why the death sentence should be carried out."" The trial Judge must forward to the Court of Appeal the notes of evidence and report referred to in paragraph (c) within a reasonable time and so on.

2012-11-14-T-024,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Yes, Sir. If I may be permitted to clarify my first point about section 313(c). As the Minister read out just now, the current section requires the trial judge to give his opinion as to whether the death sentence which he imposed should or should not be carried out. But under the Bill, now he is only restricted to saying why the sentence should be carried out. And my question is  the omission of the second part appears to me significant because even though he, the trial judge, decided to impose the death sentence, he could have done so under circumstances where it was mandatory. That is why his opinion on whether there are any circumstances why it should not be carried out would still be relevant under the current regime as it would be read later by the Cabinet in advising the President to exercise his prerogative for mercy. That was my first query.",1,668,2012-11-14-T-024-S-00668
2012-11-14-T-024,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"There was no intention of changing that. That is why I say it is syntax  whether it should be carried out includes whether it should or should not be carried out. I have said that openly here in Parliament. I know that it reads ""whether it should be carried"". The Member's concern is, previously, it was slightly broader in language. I can confirm that there is no intention of changing that.",1,669,2012-11-14-T-024-S-00669
2012-11-14-T-024,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"So, can I just clarify with the Minister that the trial Judge can give his opinion about why the sentence should not be carried out?",1,670,2012-11-14-T-024-S-00670
2012-11-14-T-024,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Absolutely.,1,671,2012-11-14-T-024-S-00671
2012-11-14-T-024,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Okay. My second query actually relates to section 394D, the new section that is being introduced. It provides that no party has a right to appear in the petition of confirmation but the Court of Appeal can decide to hear any party. My point was that if the Court of Appeal wishes to hear one party, I think it is only right that the other party also should be present because this is the last court appearance. The presence of both parties would enable the other party to respond to any new matters which may be raised. Since this is the last hearing before the death sentence is confirmed, I think that would be a fair way to go about it.",1,672,2012-11-14-T-024-S-00672

2012-11-14-T-024,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I think we want to give the broadest possible flexibility to the Court of Appeal. If you have a strict requirement that the Court of Appeal should hear both parties, in a situation where neither party has filed an appeal, that could frustrate what the Court of Appeal is trying to do. Here, what we are trying to do is something good, which is to introduce an additional safeguard, and I am sure that the Court of Appeal will observe the rules of natural justice and, where it is necessary, hear both parties. Sometimes, it may not be practicable or possible to hear both parties. But I think we can leave that to the discretion of the Court of Appeal. Our intention is to give the Court of Appeal a broad discretion with the understanding, of course, that the Court of Appeal will act in accordance with the rules of natural justice. You have seen the framework.",1,674,2012-11-14-T-024-S-00674
2012-11-14-T-024,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As for Asst Prof Tan, if I follow him rightly, the point he made was whether we can go back to the system of two Judges. This was something which we changed at the request of the Courts – to have one trial Judge instead of two. We have certainly not had a request from the Courts to revert to the old system. The last time we reviewed it, we were of the view that it is adequate to have a system with a single trial Judge whose verdict is reviewed by the Court of Appeal. We have not seen anything to change that view but we will keep in mind what you have said.",2,675,2012-11-14-T-024-S-00675

2012-11-14-T-024,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The processes in the Bill which involve the President are technical in nature. Asst Prof Tan has used phrases like ""rubber stamp"" and so on. But it is the Constitution that sets out the role of the President, including that on these issues. The Constitution provides that he acts on the advice of the Cabinet and that has a very specific technical meaning, which is, perhaps, not often understood by laypersons but which Asst Prof Tan would well appreciate. It means that the President has to act in accordance with the advice given by the Cabinet and not in his discretion. Where the Constitution intends to give the President specific powers to act in his own discretion, it says so expressly. There is no intention of changing that, nor would we be able to change that through ordinary legislation.

Workfare payments are currently taxable even though most recipients would not need to pay income tax, given that their wages fall below the threshold for liability for income tax. This change has been introduced to provide certainty of non-taxation. The exemption will apply retrospectively from Year of Assessment 2006 when Workfare was first introduced. This is consistent with Workfare's policy objectives, which are to supplement the wages of older low-wage workers, and encourage them to find work or continue working.

However, mothers who stay at home to care for their children, whether by choice or circumstances, should not be unduly disadvantaged.

If Members could look at this slide [a slide was shown to hon Members]. In this slide, scenario A, excluding all reliefs, a family with a single breadwinner earning $70,000 would pay $1,950 in income tax, while in scenario B, a dual-income family with husband and wife working, each earning $35,000, would pay $195 in income tax.

2012-11-14-T-025,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"To level the playing field, can I suggest for the Ministry to review and strongly consider increasing the current Spouse Dependency Tax Relief of $2,000. Currently, I understand that individuals who are supporting spouses and who earned not more than $4,000 in annual income in the preceding year are eligible for this relief. Could the Ministry consider, number one, increasing the Spouse Dependency Tax Relief from $2,000 to $7,000, to be on par with that of parent relief? Secondly, increasing the current income cap criteria of $4,000 to provide greater tax relief to families and husbands of stay-at-home-mothers with children under 18 years old. This could provide additional savings to households relying on a single income, especially those belonging to the sandwiched group of lower-middle and middle-income families that have to support and care for the young as well as the old.",6,707,2012-11-14-T-025-S-00707

While the state cannot make all things equal, it can certainly create an environment that is hugely pro-family and supportive of the women's role, be it at work or at home. So, in essence, we need tax measures that are not only pro-family and pro-children, but also pro-women. If Singapore's mothers decide to devote themselves to caring for the family, we should not only extend them our respect but we should also try to extend them longer purse strings.",7,708,2012-11-14-T-025-S-00708

2012-11-14-T-025,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"The other key area I wish to highlight is with regard to the enhancements to the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) Scheme in relation to SMEs. The SMEs collectively contribute to half of Singapore's GDP and 70% of employment. They are certainly critical to Singapore's economic growth. With increased global competition and shorter business cycles, SMEs face enormous pressure to differentiate themselves through innovation. However, we all know investments into R&D take time to bear fruit – from an idea to proof of concept, to getting market traction and, eventually, building a good viable business and revenue model. Even as the process of R&D takes place, SMEs face the constant challenge of maintaining a healthy cash flow. Therefore, our SMEs need significant support in this area.",9,710,2012-11-14-T-025-S-00710
2012-11-14-T-025,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"The move to raise the cash payout rate from 30% to 60% for up to $100,000 of qualifying PIC expenditure for each Year of Assessment is a good one. The PIC covers activities, such as Training, Automation, Design, Acquisition and Registration of IPR, as well as R&D. However, in addition to raising the cash payout rate, could we also look into the possibility of increasing the limit of $100,000 on these PIC payouts, specifically for R&D expenses?",10,711,2012-11-14-T-025-S-00711
2012-11-14-T-025,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"In Australia, for example, SMEs are eligible for a tax credit of 45% of R&D expenditure, which is equivalent to about 15 cents per dollar of R&D expenditure. This puts money back into the SMEs – an important factor for their healthy cash flow and viability. If I could refer Member to this example [a slide was shown to hon Members], a Singapore company making investments of $600,000 into R&D and, similarly, in Australia, an Australian company making $600,000 of investment into R&D. In Australia, that company, would be eligible to receive $90,000 in cash payout while the Singapore company will receive a payout of $60,000. In Australia's case, there is no limit placed on the R&D cash payout.",11,712,2012-11-14-T-025-S-00712
2012-11-14-T-025,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"In fact, if Members could look at the slide over here [a slide was shown to hon Members], as this slide indicates, as the amount of R&D investment increases, the difference between what an Australian company would receive in cash payout, compared with a Singapore company, would be much larger. So, while the new increase in cash payout rate to 60% is significant, the ceiling of $100,000 would still make SMEs think twice about investing heavily – the keyword here is ""heavily"" – into R&D.",12,713,2012-11-14-T-025-S-00713
2012-11-14-T-025,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"So, as the SMEs go through the pain of a labour crunch and global economic slowdown, they would need all the help they can get to raise productivity. Some of them may even be making losses. For such cases, the 400% tax deduction on qualifying expenditure may not even be an attractive incentive. So, if we are serious about getting SMEs to raise productivity, we need more aggressive measures to put more cash directly back into the SMEs' pocket for immediate effect.",13,714,2012-11-14-T-025-S-00714

2012-11-14-T-025,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"This brings me to my next point on the PIC. The new measure to include non-certified in-house training expenditure up to a cap of S$10,000 per Year of Assessment is a welcome development. However, this amounts to 2.5% when compared to the overall cap of $400,000 for training expenditure. Due to the $10,000 cap, the total tax benefit for a company's spending on training non-certified in-house training would be $6,800 a year. To spur more training by SMEs, I hope the Ministry would be open to considering increasing the $10,000 ceiling so as to encourage more internal training activities by SMEs which may be non-certified in nature. Why is that so? This is because internal training activities are often more affordable, flexible and easily carried out. Due to their size and operations, SMEs face many constraints in releasing their staff for training – from scheduling constraints to costs issues to manpower needs, especially in today's tight labour market. A higher ceiling for non-certified internal training would provide SMEs with more flexibility and opportunities for courses conducted and customised to their needs, pace and budget.",15,716,2012-11-14-T-025-S-00716

While the SMEs acknowledge the leg-up, they have also expressed their desire for more help. In fact, the recent SIM Management Monitor survey conducted by the Singapore Institute of Management revealed that one in two SMEs wished that the Government could ""help support businesses become more productive"". I hope the Ministry can review the present ceilings on PIC to spur more SMEs into raising their productivity. On this note, I support the Bill.",16,717,2012-11-14-T-025-S-00717

I understand this is how most tax relief schemes generally work, but the situation is really something quite different. A death is a death, regardless of being the first, second or third in the family. The amount of stress and pain is always felt.",5,722,2012-11-14-T-025-S-00722

I think it is a more befitting way to do so than the ""hongbao"" of $50 to $100 vouchers.",6,723,2012-11-14-T-025-S-00723

2012-11-14-T-025,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"I should first highlight that in response to Ms Low's questions on spouse relief, the subject actually is not under review in this round of amendment but, nevertheless, I will respond briefly to her. I fully agree with her that stay-at-home mothers – actually stay-at-home spouses in general – make very important contributions to the family, enabling the working spouse to continue doing so with peace of mind. With regard to the slide which Ms Low has shown, I thought it would be useful just to make a small point on the example that she raised. She has talked about a couple, one of whom stops working and then the person who remains working is able to earn the same income that the two of them used to earn together. And as a result, because the household income is unchanged – the combined income is unchanged – more taxes are being paid. I think they are actually not quite comparable simply because it is more likely that there is going to be a loss of total income in any case which even a reduced tax bill does not make up for. This reduced tax bill, especially even if we were to make the reliefs much higher, would not make up for the loss of income. I think we should recognise that.",2,725,2012-11-14-T-025-S-00725
2012-11-14-T-025,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Of the group of lower to middle-income families which Ms Low, in fact, said was trying to benefit through any increase of such reliefs, they would benefit less compared to higher-income families. And that is why the Government does not look at tax reliefs alone but takes a holistic approach to supporting families, and there are several substantive forms of assistance to families that are given, whether the mothers are in the workforce or at home. This includes the Baby Bonus, infant care and childcare subsidies. The Baby Bonus, for example, is the same amount, regardless of the work status of the mother. The childcare subsidies are differentiated, but for stay-at-home mothers they amount to $1,800 a year if they send their children to childcare centres. So, on a total package basis, such help extended to families with stay-at-home mothers is much larger than the tax benefit of spouse relief. Nonetheless, we will bear in mind Ms Low's point on spouse relief in future reviews.",3,726,2012-11-14-T-025-S-00726
2012-11-14-T-025,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,Page  1285,4,727,2012-11-14-T-025-S-00727
2012-11-14-T-025,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Ms Low has brought up the example of how the Australians support research and development (R&D). For the benefit of the Members of the House who are perhaps less familiar with how the Australian system works, companies with turnover of less than $20 million can enjoy a 150% tax deduction on an unlimited amount of R&D spending. They can also get a 45% refundable tax credit, which is simply a cash conversion, because the corporate tax rate in Australia is 30%. For companies with more than $20 million in turnover, they can enjoy a 133% tax deduction on R&D spending, but there is no cash conversion option for this group. In comparison, the tax deduction for Singapore companies can be up to 400% for the first $400,000 expenditure, regardless of the company's size. And R&D spending above $400,000 also qualifies for a 150% tax deduction. In other words, overall, Singapore's tax deduction for R&D spending is actually more generous, especially for smaller businesses. In terms of cash conversion, the PIC offers a higher conversion rate of 60 cents for every dollar of R&D expenses, whereas Australia offers 45 cents for companies with less than $20 million in turnover. However, while the PIC has a cap of $100,000 expenses for cash conversion, there is no cap in Australia. So, I understand Ms Low's concern about whether this cap constrains our SMEs in their R&D efforts. I would like to assure her that, in fact, based on the latest claims that have been submitted, most SMEs have not exceeded the $100,000 expenditure cap on all types of activities and not just R&D. In other words, the cap is not a constraint in most cases.",5,728,2012-11-14-T-025-S-00728
2012-11-14-T-025,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Every country decides on its tax policy to meet its own objectives and, therefore, we can see that the Australian R&D cash refund is targeted at smaller businesses, specifically those with R&D spending. Singapore's PIC cash conversion, on the other hand, aims to help all SMEs that invest in productivity and innovation, of which R&D is just one avenue.",6,729,2012-11-14-T-025-S-00729
2012-11-14-T-025,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Ms Low further suggested that we consider raising the $10,000 ceiling on in-house training so as to spur more training by the SMEs. She cited that due to their size and operations, SMEs face many constraints in releasing their staff for training. We agree that this is something that is very important and we have to encourage as many SMEs as possible to take training seriously and as a means for uplifting the quality of their workforce. But I should clarify that the expense ceiling of $10,000 is for in-house training that is not certified by WDA or ITE. Training expenditure in excess of the $10,000 cap can still qualify for PIC if the in-house training courses are certified by WDA or ITE, and there are quite a large number of such courses available. Based on the Year of Assessment 2011, PIC claims for training, SMEs incurred an average of $9,000 for in-house training. Therefore, for the time being, a $10,000 threshold is adequate. Let me assure Ms Low that we will monitor the expenditure trends very closely and adjust the PIC parameters to meet the needs of SMEs.",7,730,2012-11-14-T-025-S-00730

I should clarify with her that this amendment that we are making in the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill this time round is to equalise the treatment for women whose children have unfortunately passed away in the basis year.

2012-11-14-T-026,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Sir, the GST Voucher Scheme is an important feature of our system of taxes and benefits.

2012-11-14-T-026,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The Government is also committed to making the GST Voucher a permanent feature of our fiscal system. By setting up the GST Voucher Fund, we provide greater certainty of payments which will otherwise be subject to budget availability, depending on economic conditions and other competing priorities in any year.

2012-11-14-T-026,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"Sir, one of the common concerns and criticisms of tax on consumption is that it is a flat tax and, therefore, regressive in nature. It takes up a higher proportion of the pay from the lower income groups.",1,757,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00757
2012-11-14-T-026,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"However, unique to Singapore and notwithstanding the GST, our overall taxation system is still progressive; taking into account the other Government subsidy programmes, such as Workfare, housing, education and healthcare. These assistance schemes typically require means testing and are specifically structured to favour the lower and middle-income groups so that they receive more subsidies.",2,758,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00758
2012-11-14-T-026,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"The newly introduced GST Voucher is another addition to the suite of social transfers and is an effective way to mitigate the regressive nature of GST by directly assisting lower and middle-income households to cope with the GST. In some groups, such as the lower income seniors, the GST Voucher would more than offset the GST they pay.",3,759,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00759
2012-11-14-T-026,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"When the scheme was announced in Budget 2012, what caught my attention is the word ""permanent"". The GST voucher is a permanent system of offsets as opposed to the earlier schemes which were one-offs and depended on the immediate budget position. The permanent nature of the scheme is a comforting assurance.",4,760,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00760
2012-11-14-T-026,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"Cost of living is amongst Singaporeans' top concerns.

2012-11-14-T-026,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"So, today's Bill will allow the establishment of the Goods and Services Tax Fund to finance the payment of the Goods and Services Tax Vouchers (GSTV). And this will ensure that there is funding available for the GSTV Scheme, regardless of the economic conditions in the next five years.",8,764,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00764
2012-11-14-T-026,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"In this regard, I would like to ask the Minister how the GSTV will be funded beyond the five years when it is due? The outlay for the GST voucher is estimated to be about $680 million for FY2012 and the fund will mostly be depleted in about five years' time. Would the appropriation from the Consolidated Fund be substantially reduced if we are faced with a prolonged downturn that significantly impacts the Government's revenue?",9,765,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00765

2012-11-14-T-026,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"I have received some feedback with regard to the eligibility of the scheme. I agree that using household income and value of the home are, by and large, a fair attempt to ascertain those that need help from the GSTV scheme. However, it does leave out some people who may need help.",11,767,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00767
2012-11-14-T-026,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"There are two segments that I would like to highlight with regard to this question of eligibility for the Cash and Medisave component of the GST Voucher. Firstly, the retirees and older Singaporeans who are aged 65 years and above, who own and live in homes that fall above the annual value criterion of $20,000. Secondly, older Singaporeans aged 65 years and above who do not have an income or property but are living with their children or relatives in properties that are above the annual value criterion of $20,000.",12,768,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00768
2012-11-14-T-026,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"Annual property values have risen in recent years and may continue to rise. Would that mean that more Singaporeans will not be eligible as more home values could rise beyond the $20,000 annual value criterion? Such an increase in annual values is non-cash items for the occupier and may not necessary mean they would correspondingly be better able to cope with the higher cost of living.",13,769,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00769
2012-11-14-T-026,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"While we encourage individuals to turn to their families for support, it may not be accurate to assume that those who live with families in properties above the $20,000 value do not require support or assistance. To an extent, it does seem that we are penalising those that live with their families.",14,770,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00770
2012-11-14-T-026,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"Separately, I have also received feedback with regard to the eligible age of 65 to qualify for the GSTV scheme. I understand this is in line with the new retirement age of 65 under the new re-employment law. The question is  how many Singaporeans are, indeed, able to secure re-employment after 62 and whether the new terms of contract, often at lower salary, would still enable them to cope with the cost of living, including GSTs?",15,771,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00771

2012-11-14-T-026,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"Also, the assessable income used to determine the GSTV payout for 2012 is based on assessable income for Year of Assessment 2011; in other words, based on income earned in 2010 or two years ago. Would the lag be too long and can this be shortened so that it is more responsive to their needs?",17,773,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00773
2012-11-14-T-026,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"For the above scenarios, I would request that a review and a further work be done to refine the eligibility criterion. Finally, I support this legislation which places the Fund under the purview of the Minister for Finance, and will ensure that the money set aside in the Fund is to provide financial assistance to eligible persons under the GSTV Scheme. Sir, I support the Bill.",18,774,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00774

2012-11-14-T-026,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"The Bill is designed to help financially needy Singaporeans with GST costs and this is useful as it helps cope with rising costs of living in Singapore. Although reports have suggested that the inequality gap has widened here in Singapore, transfer payments from the Government have actually helped narrow this gap, and this Bill is another example of how the Government can help further plug this gap.",2,776,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00776
2012-11-14-T-026,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"As costs of living in Singapore have increased over the years, at a pace that is faster than the rate of income growth for most Singaporeans, there have been calls to look at how these financial burdens may be alleviated. The Goods and Services Tax is one area in which some of the public attention has focused on, especially since the rate of GST has increased gradually in line with the Government's public finance policy of a greater shift to indirect taxation from direct tax. Such calls have asked to exempt low-income Singaporeans from paying GST on basic necessities.",3,777,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00777
2012-11-14-T-026,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"While I do not think that this would be a productive or effective move, I recognise that the emotion behind this argument has been fuelled by a view that the GST is an additional burden on this group of Singaporeans. In light of that, this Bill is timely and relevant as it is a more direct and effective way in helping low-income Singaporeans deal with the GST costs. There are some points though that I would like to raise in relation to this Bill.",4,778,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00778
2012-11-14-T-026,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"First, I would have hoped that the Bill stipulated the criteria through which the beneficiaries of this Bill would be defined. It would have been a good opportunity to determine, which Singaporeans would qualify for this assistance and which would not. If these criteria are intended to dovetail any existing criteria stipulated in other schemes or regulations, then this should be made explicitly clear.",5,779,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00779

2012-11-14-T-026,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"One of the reasons I feel that it is important to specify these criteria clearly and explicitly in the Act, is so that a more accurate number of Singaporeans who fall under these guidelines may be determined and, therefore, a better estimate of the amount of payment likely to be paid out can be made. This will make the fund more efficient, the size of which would be better estimated.",7,781,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00781
2012-11-14-T-026,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Touching on the size of the fund, it may be also useful to stipulate how this would change in accordance with the rate of GST. Should the GST rate be increased in the future, for example, would this then lead to a larger size of a fund, to reflect a larger quantum of financial assistance that may be needed to be paid out in future? Theoretically speaking, it should, but it should be useful to have this enshrined.",8,782,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00782
2012-11-14-T-026,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Since the fund may be used for investment, the incomes of which would help grow the initial fund size, I think it may be useful to also provide more clarity and guidelines on the nature of investments the fund may engage in. I would think, given the use of the fund, it would be prudent to ensure that the fund's risk-appetite is not that large. It would be better for the fund to be invested in less risky investments. This should be stipulated, especially since a third-party may be engaged for the purposes of managing these investments of this fund.",9,783,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00783
2012-11-14-T-026,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"As this fund is also public money, there should be little tolerance of any attempt to cheat or mislead the system to benefit from the financial assistance being meted out. As such, I feel that the sentences being meted out to those whose actions are intended to cheat the scheme, should be harsher so as to create a strong deterrent. On the whole, Sir, I support this Bill.",10,784,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00784

2012-11-14-T-026,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Dhinakaran highlighted how the GST Voucher Scheme can help lower-income Singaporeans. Indeed, the GST Voucher − Cash and Medisave – has benefited close to 1.4 million Singaporeans while the GST Voucher − U-Save has benefited about 800,000 HDB households. One such family is that of Mdm Noorashikin, a homemaker living with her husband and two school-going children in a 4-room HDB flat. The family estimates that they spend about $1,300 each month on daily necessities which means that they pay about $85 in GST. In August this year, Mdm Noorashikin's family received a total of $500 in GST Voucher – Cash. This in addition to the $220 in GST Voucher U-Save that they will receive annually. Their total GST Voucher of $720 means that about 70 cents of every dollar they paid in GST will be covered. With more resources in hand, the family was able to celebrate Hari Raya Puasa comfortably and put aside a little something for the children's education.",2,786,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00786

2012-11-14-T-026,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The GST Voucher is also designed to help retiree households with more modest assets. For example, a retiree household living in a 3-room flat is likely to pay less GST than the amount of GST Voucher they receive this year.",4,788,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00788
2012-11-14-T-026,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Liang Eng Hwa has raised certain scenarios under which retirees may not be able to benefit from the GST Voucher. This is because some of them live in homes with Annual Values above $20,000, or live in homes which have appreciated over time to above $20,000. However, that does not translate into income for the retirees.",5,789,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00789
2012-11-14-T-026,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The eligibility criteria for the GST Voucher are set to target those who need it most. Today, we have used a combination of income and property Annual Value as the best available proxies of financial strength. The Annual Value of $20,000 means that 80% of homes in Singapore are covered, including some private property. Our existing criteria already benefit one in two adult citizens and eight in 10 citizen-households. About 85% of all elderly Singaporeans can also expect to receive the GST Voucher – Medisave each year.",6,790,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00790
2012-11-14-T-026,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked if Singaporeans aged 62 to 65 have been successful in securing re-employment, and if they earn enough to cope with the cost of living. This is a valid and important question which would be more appropriately addressed by the Minister for Manpower.",7,791,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00791
2012-11-14-T-026,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Liang asked if the time period between the GST Voucher payment and the income assessment period can be shortened. I would like to explain that the eligibility criteria aim to be practical. Using this year as an example, for Singaporeans to receive their GST Voucher by August, we must determine the payout based on the latest available Assessable Income, which is for Year of Assessment 2011 based on income earned in 2010. If we were to use income earned in 2011, it would mean delaying payouts until December, after all the tax assessments have been completed.",8,792,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00792
2012-11-14-T-026,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Nonetheless, Singaporeans facing extenuating circumstances can write in to the Ministry of Finance.

2012-11-14-T-026,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"We will also continue to explore avenues to refine the eligibility criteria to target those who will benefit most from the GST Voucher, and we will take into account changes in property Annual Values and incomes in our reviews. In the meantime, I encourage Members to look out for needy individuals and households who may not qualify for the GST Voucher and refer them to other channels of assistance, for example, the Community Development Councils.

2012-11-14-T-026,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The second related point is that the Fund size will need to be adjusted in the event of a GST rate increase. I believe the Member's concern is whether the funds set aside will, indeed, be sufficient. This was a point also echoed by Mr Liang. The Members are right to counsel prudence in the way we estimate our financial commitments in the GST Voucher Scheme. Let me assure the Members that the Government takes this commitment seriously. It is the reason we have set aside a very significant $3.6 billion for a start, which is expected to provide for five years of the Scheme. Additional injections to the Fund will be made as and when the Budget allows. And this must, of course, be predicated upon the continued health of our public finances.",13,797,2012-11-14-T-026-S-00797

This is for the convenience of pedestrians as such links provide all-weather connectivity.",1,815,2012-11-14-T-028-S-00815
2012-11-14-T-028,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"For the Marina Bay and the CBD areas, we have been able to require the developers to implement underground links through land sale conditions imposed on the Government Land Sale sites. For example, developments, such as One Raffles Quay, The Sail and Marina Bay Financial Centre, are all connected to one another as well as to the Raffles Place MRT Station and to the upcoming Downtown MRT Station via underground pedestrian links. Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort, which is directly connected to the Bayfront MRT Station, is also connected by an underground link to Gardens by the Bay.",2,816,2012-11-14-T-028-S-00816
2012-11-14-T-028,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"For the Orchard Road area, progress has been slower because there are existing developments. We were able to realise some critical links to surrounding developments from the Orchard and Somerset MRT stations for ION Orchard and 313 Somerset, as they were former GLS sites. However, it has been more challenging to extend the network to older developments. Understandably, building owners prefer to carry out such works only when they intend to either undertake major works or redevelop their buildings.",3,817,2012-11-14-T-028-S-00817
2012-11-14-T-028,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"To encourage such development, URA has introduced a Cash Grant Incentive Scheme. The URA grant is intended to cover a large proportion of the construction costs for the underground links. However, building owners may still have other concerns, for example, the loss of business during the construction period and the loss of lettable space due to space needed for the links. The take-up rate has thus far been low. Nevertheless, we will continue to work closely with owners and developers to enhance the underground pedestrian networks, as we strive to make Singapore pedestrian-friendly.",4,818,2012-11-14-T-028-S-00818
2012-11-14-T-028,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Such underground links can potentially ease the flow of vehicular traffic as more people may choose to take the MRT instead of driving to their destinations along Orchard Road. In addition, there may be less pedestrian crossings and pedestrian-related traffic incidences at Orchard Road.",5,819,2012-11-14-T-028-S-00819

2012-11-14-T-029,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The different academic streams are designed with different curriculum and pedagogies, to cater to our students’ different learning pace, learning aptitudes and learning styles. This allows our schools to provide the appropriate support to all students to build a strong foundation for lifelong learning. Students are allowed to transfer between streams, and such transfers are assessed by schools on a case-by-case basis.",2,824,2012-11-14-T-029-S-00824
2012-11-14-T-029,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"In addition, within each stream, students have the flexibility to take subjects that are pegged at a higher level from their stream if their schools assess that this is in their best interest. For example, about 4,500 (or 35%) of Secondary 4 N(A) students offered one or more subjects at the GCE ""O"" Level in 2011. Some Secondary 4 N(T) students also take up to two subjects at the N(A) level. So, what Dr Intan is suggesting is already taking place to some extent. Nevertheless, we are studying how we can provide even greater flexibility to students.",3,825,2012-11-14-T-029-S-00825

2012-11-14-T-030,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"HESP, introduced in 2003, provides schools with a set of healthier food service guidelines so that students and staff will have convenient access to healthier food and beverage choices. Commercially-prepared sweetened drinks offered in vending machines or sold in canteens in participating schools must have the Healthier Choice Symbol (HCS) logo. Drinks under the HCS programme contain less sugar than similar drinks. In addition, to discourage students from consuming sweetened drinks, participating schools are expected to have two drinking water coolers within the canteen area to provide an even healthier option. We intend to step up our efforts with schools to encourage students to consume water instead of sweetened drinks.",2,831,2012-11-14-T-030-S-00831

2012-11-14-T-031,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Singaporeans aspire to secure good jobs and wages, and they have many different aspirations. Being a dynamic and attractive business location for local and foreign companies plays a critical role in helping to meet our people’s needs. We want to keep the labour market tight even as we create good jobs and we want to ensure that our Singaporeans are equipped with competitive skills to take up these diverse job opportunities.",1,837,2012-11-14-T-031-S-00837
2012-11-14-T-031,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In fact, it is more than creating jobs. We want to provide resilience in employment and growing a diversified economy at a sustainable rate of growth provides this. We will bring in good, higher value-add industries while developing our local companies continuously. We have a small local workforce. New industries and growing companies will inevitably need to be supplemented with a foreign labour force at various levels. This would also mean competition for our young graduates.",2,838,2012-11-14-T-031-S-00838
2012-11-14-T-031,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We will ensure that young foreign entrants compete on a level playing field as local fresh graduates. As such, we have adjusted the Employment Pass (EP) and S Pass qualifying salaries to take into account local wage progression. For instance, in January 2012, we raised the qualifying salary for young foreign graduates from $2,800 to $3,000 to keep pace with the increase in the median starting salary of local university graduates, which was $2,900 in 2010. We have also raised the EP qualifying salaries for the older and more experienced foreigners so that they do not compete unfairly with our locals, both fresh graduates and those with work experience. We have also tightened up the qualifications criterion. These steps help ensure that the quality of EP holders is progressively raised over time.",3,839,2012-11-14-T-031-S-00839

2012-11-14-T-031,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Let us be clear. Businesses are here in Singapore because there are advantages, relative to being elsewhere. Many are competing regionally and beyond. Costs and capabilities are never local because the playing field goes beyond the domestic economy. Businesses are looking at building capable and diverse teams, and are tapping the whole range of skill sets and global networks to complement our local workforce. These efforts ensure that the businesses grow in Singapore and remain globally competitive. There will be competition for jobs but, ultimately, our main objective is that good jobs are created for Singaporeans. In reality, when companies move elsewhere, the jobs will also move and it would ultimately impact on our people and the opportunities available for them. It is a fair and valid concern as to how this balance is struck. We will continue to monitor the employment situation closely and make further refinements to our policies where necessary.",5,841,2012-11-14-T-031-S-00841
2012-11-14-T-031,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"At the same time, we must help ensure that our local diploma and degree holders have the necessary skills for these jobs, not just upon graduation but throughout their working life.

These are guided by Advisory Councils comprising different stakeholders, such as industry representatives and sector champion agencies, so that the curriculum imparts industry-relevant knowledge and skills.",6,842,2012-11-14-T-031-S-00842

Those who have joined the workforce have enjoyed rising incomes; we have seen real median gross monthly incomes of full-time employed citizens rise by 2.5% per annum from 2006 to 2011. These are positive outcomes and suggest that our general approach is sound.

Over the past nine months, CPI-All Items increased by 4.8% on a year-on-year basis. However, a large part of the increase in CPI-All Items was due to imputed, rather than actual housing rentals and a surge in the Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums for private cars.

Those who still face difficulties managing their healthcare bills can apply for financial assistance from our medical institutions, such as via Medifund. We are mindful that the cumulative costs incurred by those with congenital conditions may be a burden even for middle or higher income families, and will take these into consideration when assessing the patients' eligibility for financial assistance.",1,903,2012-11-14-T-039-S-00903

2012-11-14-T-040,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"International indices generally place much emphasis on a universal basic pension as a means to achieve financial security in old age. In Singapore, our approach is different, with greater focus on self-reliance and less on universal entitlements. We help Singaporeans own a home, so that they do not need to worry about where they will live when they retire, and these homes also serve as valuable assets which can be monetised if necessary. We boost CPF balances of those with lower incomes through Workfare and CPF top-ups. For those who need more help, we have ComCare and Medifund. Again, international indices on retirement adequacy are not comprehensive enough to factor in how home ownership is an important pillar of retirement adequacy in Singapore. Mercer has acknowledged that the CPF is designed to address a broader range of needs, such as home ownership and medical costs, than their index seeks to measure.",4,911,2012-11-14-T-040-S-00911
2012-11-14-T-040,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"International indices do not account for the uniqueness of how we achieve retirement adequacy in Singapore.

2012-11-14-T-040,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We recognise that it is important for the public to have assurance that the CPF can provide adequately for their retirement. MOM recently commissioned an independent study by NUS academics to compute the level of retirement income that the CPF can provide for young Singaporeans entering the workforce today. The study finds that such new entrants will be able to save enough in their CPF to provide a reasonable level of income in retirement, as long as they work consistently. The median male earner will be able to replace about 70% of his pre-retirement earnings through his CPF savings, whereas a female median earner is able to replace almost 65% of her pre-retirement earnings. In other words, using a methodology that factors in the uniqueness of our CPF system, the study found that income replacement rates in Singapore are comparable to those seen in the pension systems in many developed countries, and within the recommended range by the World Bank. The study has just been released.",6,913,2012-11-14-T-040-S-00913
2012-11-14-T-040,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The Member also asked about the current generation of older Singaporeans. This issue was given some focus in MOM's Committee of Supply debate in March this year. Older Singaporeans generally have lower CPF balances due to lower incomes and greater leeway to use CPF for housing in the past. But the CPF has helped them own their homes, and they have benefited from the healthy appreciation of their homes over the decades. Such older Singaporeans have the option to tap on their housing asset to supplement their retirement income if they wish to, and we will provide avenues, such as the Silver Housing Bonus and the enhanced Lease Buyback Scheme, to help them do so.",7,914,2012-11-14-T-040-S-00914

2012-11-14-T-047,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"Taking up citizenship is a serious commitment which is ultimately a personal decision. While we welcome qualified PRs who have decided to make their future here to consider applying for citizenship sooner rather than later, this is best served by ensuring that Singapore Citizens are well looked after. To reflect the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship, and to acknowledge Singapore Citizens' commitment to Singapore, Singapore Citizens receive more support and benefits in the areas of marriage and parenthood, housing, healthcare and education. Over the past few years, we have widened the differentiation in benefits accorded to Singapore Citizens and to PRs. We should also continue to be a society that is open and gracious. How welcoming and accepting we are of newcomers will also impact on their decision to sink roots here permanently.",4,963,2012-11-14-T-047-S-00963

2012-11-14-T-049,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Over the years, we have supported various research, pilot and test-bedding programmes to strengthen our capabilities in solar PV. For example, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) is leading the $31 million Solar Capability Building Scheme, a nationwide solar pilot programme on public housing blocks. Since 2008, HDB has been progressively installing solar PV in both new and existing HDB precincts. To date, about 100 blocks have been installed with solar PV systems. From HDB's pilot programme, we seek learning points on the feasibility and performance of various solar PV technologies in Singapore’s densely built tropical environment, as well as best practices for implementation and systems integration of solar PV.",1,971,2012-11-14-T-049-S-00971

2012-11-14-T-049,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Going forward, we will continue to support such test-bedding efforts. To meet the energy demands of Government-owned buildings, we remain open to all energy technologies and options. These could include buying electricity from the grid, installing solar PV to augment electricity supply, or installing energy-efficient technologies to reduce energy consumption. The Government could take the lead in installing solar PV where it makes economic sense to do so.",5,975,2012-11-14-T-049-S-00975
