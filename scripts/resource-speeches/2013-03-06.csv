I am assured that the Government is taking the matter seriously. I think the debate was rather divisive, but I believe immigration is an imperative. My follow-up question relates to how the Government would seek to encourage Singaporeans to keep an open mind as I think that is important. We are not asking Singaporeans to be wedded to a ""yes"" or a ""no"" position, but rather how we can continue to strengthen trust and consensus given that immigration is an imperative, relating fundamentally to the well being of our society.",1,22,2013-03-06-T-002-S-00022
2013-03-06-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Mdm Speaker, I certainly agree Asst Prof Tan. The ageing population issue that we face is a very major one. It is a one-off problem which we are facing as a result of the very large Baby Boomer generation, spread over about 15 to 18 years, from the early 1950s to the mid 1960s. This is now coming through our system. We have to make preparations for that future. If we want to maintain a stable, energetic and able population for Singapore and Singaporeans into the future, and be able to support and make sure that our seniors in these coming two decades are able to look after themselves, are well looked after by their children and by our nation, then we have to shape those policies today. I am glad that the debate has focused attention on this very critical issue and also the range of options and choices that we have from those which are on both ends of the spectrum. We will continue to make sure that we discuss this as we go into the future. We hope that as we go along, Singaporeans will understand the issues and choices that we face, better.",1,23,2013-03-06-T-002-S-00023

Both SMRT and LTA will also look into preventive measures.",2,27,2013-03-06-T-003-S-00027
2013-03-06-T-003,Lui Tuck Yew,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"At this juncture, what we have established is that the fire was caused by a short circuit, most likely due to cable insulation issues. This will be confirmed by laboratory tests which should conclude in the coming few weeks. As an immediate measure, the cables at the affected stretch have been replaced. SMRT has also conducted a complete insulation test of all underground traction cables and stepped up its insulation checks on similar installations at all tunnels.",3,28,2013-03-06-T-003-S-00028

2013-03-06-T-003,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister for Transport a follow-up question. I understand that this is not the first fire at Newton MRT Station. I was rather concerned to see that passengers were milling around the train platforms and were also taking photographs that were eventually uploaded on social media websites. I do not know whether the assessment was that it was a small fire and so there was no need to unnecessarily alarm passengers. But is that the protocol? Would that not be somewhat dangerous, given that it is hard to ascertain how serious a fire is, especially in an enclosed area?",1,30,2013-03-06-T-003-S-00030
2013-03-06-T-003,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mdm Speaker, the Member is right in that this was not the first fire at Newton Station. The last was in 2004, which incidentally was also the last incident in the MRT system. The passengers in this case were ushered as quickly as possible out of the station, contrary to impressions that they were allowed to mill around and so on. Whether we can effectively prevent any passenger from taking a photograph if they choose to do so is something that needs to be looked further into.",1,31,2013-03-06-T-003-S-00031

So, in desperation, he turned to moneylenders to cover his bills. This decision is haunting him now and we are helping him.

He believed in the ability of our people to transcend their racial, cultural and religious divisions to create a shared national identity, to which they give their primary loyalty. For him, this was an act of will and faith. He did not differentiate between old and new citizens, core and not core; he differentiated them on the basis of their values. It does not matter where you were born, it does not matter the colour of your skin, the texture of your hair, the accent in your voice.

I am glad to know that such assistance is available and tapped upon by these families. Indeed, as someone who worked in a Family Service Centre before, I have seen many children benefiting from this Scheme. However, many in this House would know that KiFAS is only made available mainly for students in the PAP Community Foundation kindergartens.",6,114,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00114
2013-03-06-T-005,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, in January 2012, my fellow Workers' Party colleague, Mr Yee Jenn Jong asked a parliamentary question on KiFAS. He asked whether the eligibility for KiFAS could be extended to private pre-school operators and not-for-profit religious or racial groups. In his written answer, the Minister pointed out that there are currently about 240 kindergartens where families can apply for KiFAS. At the same time, it is a known fact that PCF kindergartens are eligible for KiFAS. Incidentally, a quick check on the PCF website would indicate that there are 247 PCF kindergartens in Singapore. You must understand the various considerations a parent has in enrolling his or her children in a pre-school. Among the many factors are proximity and the environment provided by the school. Some parents may, for convenience sake, choose to send their children to a non-PCF kindergarten. For example, in my Kaki Bukit ward, some parents who are unable to obtain a placement at a PCF kindergarten at Block 519 Bedok North Avenue 1 would have to send their children to a non-PCF kindergarten. Parents would also like to have their children receive their education in a preferred environment in accordance to their beliefs and values. As such, there are parents who send their children to kindergartens run and managed by religious organisations or religious-based voluntary welfare organisations.",7,115,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00115
2013-03-06-T-005,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, my view is simple and I hope KiFAS can be expanded to all families who are in need. It should be about providing assistance in accordance to economic needs rather than in accordance to one's choice of kindergarten. KiFAS should be made available to all students who require it and should not be limited solely to the 247 PCF kindergartens. Mdm Speaker, I will continue in Malay.",8,116,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00116
2013-03-06-T-005,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech on Pg xxx.]  Madam, beside the KiFAS scheme, another scheme that I would like to talk about is MOE's Edusave scheme. Mr Zainal Sapari, Member for Pasir-Ris Punggol GRC, and I raised this issue in the Committee of Supply last year. One of us has given our views on why the Edusave scheme should be extended to students in the full-time madrasah.",9,117,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00117
2013-03-06-T-005,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, creating an inclusive society is one of the main objectives of the Budget last year and this year. The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Tharman, has said in his speech that we, meaning the Government, has taken major steps to ensure the creation of an equitable and more inclusive society. Madam, it is on this call for a more inclusive society that I again call upon MOE to realise this call by the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Tharman, to extend the Edusave scheme to students of the full-time madrasah.",10,118,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00118
2013-03-06-T-005,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"(In English)  Mdm Speaker, I will continue the rest of my speech in English. Allow me to move on to my second issue on the Public Assistance (PA) scheme. I welcome the Government's move in enhancing this scheme. Any amount of increase means a lot to the beneficiaries. I also welcome the multi-tier approach to the PA scheme. Under the secondary tier, healthcare assistance, such as adult diapers, stoma bags, milk supplements and so on, is long overdue as expenses on these items are not cheap to the affected families. I have also noted the scale of increment ranging from $50 per month for a one-person household to $130 per month for a four-person household. However, clearer clarification and explanation as to how the increment is considered, tabulated and arrived at is required from the relevant Ministries.",11,119,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00119
2013-03-06-T-005,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, the PA scheme and the other ComCare assistance schemes that are currently in place are meant to ease the burden of needy Singaporeans, and these assistance schemes come under the purview, management and administration of the Community Development Councils or CDCs in short. Apart from enhancing the various components of assistance, is also crucial to ensure that the administration of the aid is thorough and effective. In my last Budget speech, I have expressed my concerns that only 6% of the Investigative Officers from the CDCs are trained in social work. This is not only unfortunate but also worrying at the same time. Investigative Officers on the ground have to make judgement calls that require the aptitude of trained social work professionals who are able to evaluate the needs of the vulnerable with compassion. With the intake of social work students at the University level remaining constant at about 200 each year, I hope to see more plans to make social work and the study of social services a more attractive option for GCE ""A"" levels and Polytechnic graduates.",12,120,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00120
2013-03-06-T-005,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"There is an urgent need to increase the current pool of social work professionals in the industry. This can come in the form of more scholarships and greater societal, remunerative recognitions of their contributions especially in the contacts of a rapidly ageing Singapore. I believe that the quality of social services rendered to our people should not be compromised. It is important to have a professionally trained sector so as to minimise the number of Singaporeans who fall through the cracks and hence move Singapore a step closer towards a more inclusive society.",13,121,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00121
2013-03-06-T-005,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman announced that about 20 social service offices would be established to improve the manner in which the Government delivers social services. In The Straits Times article on 26 February 2013, it is explained that the social service offices serve as a one-stop centre located closer to homes with the function of planning and co-ordinating social services to ensure that the families get holistic support. In short, it is hoped that the administration of social services can be integrated and any duplication avoided. However, I remain puzzled by the introduction of another level of bureaucracy to the existing layers of social service structures and support network. While we frown upon a welfare state, we seem to embrace increase bureaucratisation in the administration of social welfare support. There are too many questions that need answers and I hope these questions can be properly addressed.",14,122,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00122
2013-03-06-T-005,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, first, I would like to know which organisation would be given the responsibilities to run and manage these offices. Second, social workers that I have spoken to are interested to know more about the function of this office and the roles of the officers stationed at this office. And thirdly, is there a requirement for these officers to be social work trained?",15,123,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00123
2013-03-06-T-005,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"The social service officers appear at first sight without much explanation to be a duplication of services offered by the Family Service Centre or FSC. From my tenure as a counsellor at an FSC, I am aware that FSCs provide information and referral services or INR. It also assumes the role as a one-stop centre for residents who are seeking assistance. Basically, the role of an FSC, apart from providing counselling and casework management, is to provide information on type of community services that are available and wherever necessary conduct the appropriate assessment and recommend referrals to relevant Government agencies.",16,124,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00124
2013-03-06-T-005,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"There needs to a be a clear definition of the different case management roles played by the respective agencies namely the CDCs, FSCs and the social service office. If the social service office does the co-ordination, then what happens to the case manager at the FCS? How does this differentiate from the intensive case management system being put in place now? Seen in this light, may I ask what makes the social service office different from the current Family Service Centres that we have and what improvement can social workers on the ground expect from the establishment of the social service office? What would happen to the existing CDCs, FSCs and VWOs' structure that are currently in place, recognised and accepted by the people whom we want to help?",17,125,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00125
2013-03-06-T-005,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),I hope that the Deputy Prime Minister can ensure social workers and industry professionals on the ground that the social service offices are not mainly satellite CDCs which would then defeat the purpose of the proposal to set up 20 social service offices.,18,126,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00126
2013-03-06-T-005,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, I am of the view that it is far more productive to channel the resources in establishing the social service office towards enhancing the functions and the capabilities of the FSCs which incidentally are located in the neighbourhood. As a Member of Parliament for the Kaki Bukit ward of Aljunied GRC, I can attest to the good work done by the staff and volunteers at the Moral Family Service Centre at Block 534, Bedok North Street 3, and any enhancement of the functions and capabilities of the centre would be most welcome by residents and social workers alike staying and working in my constituency.",19,127,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00127
2013-03-06-T-005,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"From my experience as a counsellor, greater support would also be welcomed by all concerned and aware of the situation in many of the FSCs across the island. An efficient and productive FSC will be in line with the fourth pillar of the social strategy painted by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman in his Budget Speech, that the role of the community and the Government providing strong support for the community initiatives by partnering with community bodies and groups of citizens to improve the lives of Singaporeans.",20,128,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00128
2013-03-06-T-005,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, the issues I raised during last year's and this year's Budget are not mutually exclusive from one another. In fact, in striving for an inclusive society which is the core principle in last year's and this year's Budget, these issues are integral and intrinsic components. However, there are no quick solutions to complex issues especially when it comes to issues over social welfare and the role of Government in welfare support. But as long as any government of the day puts the welfare of its people at the core of it policies, exercising compassion with flexible management of resources, while strengthening the social compact, nothing is too difficult to overcome in our case for a better and more inclusive Singapore.",21,129,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00129
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mdm Speaker, I will be focusing on two areas of concerns that I have been hearing from Singaporeans and that this Budget also intends to address. Firstly, on Public Transport, and secondly, the job competition from the EPs in the PME space.",1,130,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00130
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Firstly, on public transport. In the Budget Statement, the Finance Minister made particular mention of the pressing challenges of housing and transport and that the Government will spare no effort in resolving these problems.",2,131,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00131
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Credit to the National Development Minister, I think we are on our way to resolving the housing imbalances in the next one to three years. The slew of demand management measures and the massive ramping up of housing supply has since begun to show some stabilising effects in the property market. All we are hoping now is for a nice soft landing in the next two to three years.",3,132,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00132
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"However, in the area of transport, our Transport Minister has on hand a much bigger and tougher problem to solve. For example, just in the area of car ownership, how can the Government fulfill the aspiration for more Singaporeans to own a car? Is this possible?",4,133,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00133
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"With our land constraints, it is inevitable that the growth of vehicle population on our island will one day come to zero. We are building new roads and expressways and we are widening existing ones as well. But there is a limit as to how much we could increase road capacity. Even if we have more and wider roads being built which would help improve traffic, the emerging traffic problems on the ground now are actually bottlenecks and congestions at road junctions and slip roads, made worse by the higher housing density.",5,134,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00134
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The much greater convenience and comfort of owning a car coupled with rising incomes and easy car financing have pushed up COE to historically high levels. But no matter how we tweak the COE system, we cannot run away from the fact that the demands for COEs are higher than the available supply.",6,135,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00135
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The real and sustainable way to manage demand of car ownerships is really to offer a compelling alternative to owning a car. And it has to be public transport in our circumstances. Taking public transport must make sense to commuters in terms of convenience, reliability, value for money and comfort. Unfortunately, our public transport system at this point in time is still some way from the desired state.",7,136,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00136
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Long waiting times, long travelling times and crowded buses and trains are a daily norm. Chaotic scenes at major bus stops and at MRT and LRT stations during the morning and evening peaks are not helping to entice more to take public transport. Often, commuters need to make multiple transfers to reach their destination and at each transfer you have to again endure the waiting time and crowdedness; not to mention contenting with the elements of weather.",8,137,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00137
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"To make matters worse, there are clearly many parts of our island that are under provided and under served by public transport, especially in the HDB towns that have seen sharp increases in the population. We are building housing at a much faster rate than we improve public transport. This has worsened congestions and crowdedness. My colleagues at my workplace told me that commuting to and fro from work is probably the most unpleasant thing they have to do every day.",9,138,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00138
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"While MRT lines will take a much longer time to build, we must do more to speed up the provision of bus services. Hence, I call on the Government to urgently act on some of the following measures I will suggest.",10,139,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00139
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Firstly, significantly speed up the implementation of the Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP) including engaging private operators to do the job. I applaud the Government for coming up with the $1.1 billion BSEP. It is a decisive and necessary intervention to ramp up bus capacity. Left to the two public transport operators, the capacity build-up would not be fast enough.",11,140,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00140
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In fact, many Members would agree with me that it has a trying experience working with the Public Transport Operator (PTO) on the ground. Each of the requests submitted to these companies to improve bus services would often end up in a long drawn discussion. And often, the final get-out answer from the PTO is that they have no drivers to increase the bus services.",12,141,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00141
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I hope that MOT would move away from the two PTOs model and start using more of the private operators to help expand the bus capacity, especially under the BSEP. The privately run bus operators are very entrepreneurial and resourceful as evidenced by the way they scale up their bus fleet in 2010 when they provided the island-wide free shuttle bus service to Resort World Singapore. If the two PTOs are incapable of increasing the bus capacity fast enough, we should not waste time on them and quickly look to other operators to do the job.",13,142,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00142
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Secondly, we need to manage the peak demand and further incentivise the non-peak hour travel. There is this inherent inefficiency in public transport where you design capacity to meet peak window demand. And at the non-peak window, capacity will be under-utilised and hence the overall operating costs would go up.",14,143,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00143
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"One of the logical solutions is to encourage employers to adopt flexi-work hours or to start and end work at non-peak windows. I am hearing that a few companies are adopting such practices but it is still a small number. Perhaps the Government and Statutory Boards could lead the way in this area, some of the learning institutions and some part of the Civil Service could take the lead and experiment with such flexi timings.",15,144,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00144
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The Finance Minister mentioned in the Budget Statement that more measures will be introduced to reduce crowding, including significantly enhanced incentives for commuters who travel during the ""shoulder"" period before and after the morning peak. If the incentives are good enough and can bite, it would certainly make taking public transport more comfortable and less crowded and more appealing. Hence, I join the call by Dr Janil Puthucheary to seriously consider having free or very low fares during the non-peak window in the morning and evening. After hearing Dr Janil's speech yesterday, I did a little research and found out that indeed in Melbourne's Metro, the city metropolitan train operator, do offer weekday free fares for early birds travel before 7 am in their city zones. We should study the Melbourne's experience. Even a shift of say, a 10% of commuters from peak to non-peak, would make a great deal of difference and ease crowdedness.",16,145,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00145
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"However, I would want to caution that even as we give free fares for the non-peak window, it should not come at the expense of the other groups of commuters, or cross-subsidise the other groups of commuters. It should be funded from other revenue sources such as the collections from COE, car taxes and the ERPs. So, I await in anticipation the good news from the Transport Minister in the coming Transport Ministry COS.",17,146,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00146
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Thirdly, I want to call on the Government to freeze any public transport fare increase until we see significant improvements in service level and enhancements. Operating costs may well have gone up for the PTOs but that is just justifying it from the company's perspective.",18,147,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00147
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"From the public and commuter standpoint, LTA and PTOs have not delivered on its duty to provide reliable and convenient public transport. Commuters feel let down and are disappointed by the current under provision of services and the series of disruptions in trains, LRTs and the buses. LTA and the PTOs have to restore public confidence before we can even talk about fare increase.",19,148,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00148
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mdm Speaker, I move on now to talk about job competition from EPs in the PME space. Like Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Ms Foo Mee Har and Mr Patrick Tay, I too want to raise the concerns on unfair employment practices where Singaporeans are not getting their fair opportunities.",20,149,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00149
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I noted the Finance Minister's careful choice of words in the Budget Statement when he talked about the tightening of EPs and the strengthening of the Singaporean Core in the PME space. Yes, our EP policy must ensure that firms in Singapore can continue to recruit the best talents – both locals and foreigners – so that companies here can compete in the global markets. But at the same time, we must ensure that Singaporeans have a fair chance to the available job opportunities.",21,150,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00150
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"However, there are clearly still a number of firms that had visibly hire a large proportion of foreigners particularly in the managerial level. You cannot help but think whether it is really that difficult to find Singaporeans to fill those managerial positions. These include job roles like HR, finance, compliance, auditing and general administration. Or is it a case where some of the employers or hirers may already have pre-determined mindsets that foreigners with some international experience can do a better job? More engagements with such employers are necessary so that Singaporeans are given a fair chance.",22,151,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00151
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Hence, I agree with the colleagues in this House that some form of market sensing practices when companies apply for EPs is necessary. While it may not always lead to a Singaporean hire, at least it will make the employers more conscious in their hiring process and give our local PMEs a chance.",23,152,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00152
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"One sector that demonstrates the leap of faith in Singaporean talents is in the Singapore Real Estates Investment Trust (S-REITs) scene. In the last decade, Singapore REITs has grown in leaps and bounds to become Asia's largest REIT market ex-Japan. It is a sophisticated market and requires specialised skills in real estate, finance, management and coming up with competitive value propositions. If we look closely into the entire development and growth of the S-REIT market, we would have noticed that it has been predominantly led and driven by local talents. The CEOs, CIOs and CFOs of the large market cap REITs are mostly our home-bred talents. And with these local senior executives at the helm, they help develop and nurture even more Singaporeans local talents below them to grow the sector and to expand beyond Singapore. Many of the REITs are more than just a Singapore-listed entity. They own and manage properties across the region. The vibrant Singapore market has also attracted more listing of foreign properties and assets in Singapore. This further deepens and broadens our capital markets and creates many more attractive professional job opportunities.",24,153,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00153
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"My point is this, our home grown talents can step up to many positions. What they need are more opportunities and the leap of faith. And my message to employers is this  Singaporeans may not be as articulate as those with international background, or speak with a flair for the language. But do note that our local talents have solid grounding and have the ability to grow and prosper your company as the S-REIT markets have shown. Importantly, these talents are rooted in Singapore and form the Singaporean Core.",25,154,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00154
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Next, I want to speak for a pool of former PMEs who have either retired early or are now under-employed. Many used to work in MNCs or large companies as managers and engineers. They are still in their employable age – probably at the mid-life age of 50s. They are well-educated and technically well-trained and experienced in their area of specialisation. However, either due to structural changes in their industries or companies downsizing or relocating, many left their jobs that they are specialised in. Few were successful in doing a career switch while many felt dejected in not being able to find jobs of similar terms or similar level of seniority or similar scope. I spoke to a number of them in my constituency. I can sense their anguish and frustration in not being able to find suitable jobs in which they think they can do well. Many went for interviews in numerous jobs but were mostly not successful in roles that they think they can perform. They get the sense that companies tend to favour the younger ones or foreigners. They also feel stereotyped as being less energetic or ""over the peak"".",26,155,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00155
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"We must help these Singaporeans to adjust and re-enter the workforce by way of skills conversions, customised career counselling and how they could turn their previous experience and expertise into job enhancing advantage. I am glad we have CaliberLink – a one-stop service point for PMEs under the WDA. But I believe that WDA may need to work with the ground agencies like CDCs, e2i and the community self-help groups to reach out to these discouraged PMEs and help them match meaningful jobs for their re-employment.",27,156,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00156
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"We may also again need to incentivise companies to hire these middle age former PMEs so as to give them a headstart. During the 2009 financial crisis, I remember there was this programme where MAS and EDB co-pay part of the salaries of our fresh graduate hires for a period of time to encourage companies to hire young graduates during the crisis. I think we could consider a similar approach for former PMEs who have undergone re-skilling programme. We could also look into giving scholarships for re-skilling or professional conversions in industries that are in need of PMEs, and upon graduation help place them in.",28,157,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00157
2013-03-06-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Clearly, more resources and support are needed here. Of course, ultimately, it depends on the former PMEs themselves. They need to respond positively to such programmes, and must be prepared to change their expectations and attitudes, to embark on a new career journey.

I am not sure if Mr Png has been to NTUC Foodfare, but he would know that NTUC Foodfare is open to members of the public – whether you are a member or not – at affordable prices. Of course, if you are a member, there are some discounts. And, if you are a senior and on public assistance scheme, you will also get some discounts.

Despite the high rentals at that area – I think that is one of the premium office locations – NTUC Foodfare does charge cheaper and provide affordable foods. For example, a cup of coffee costs $0.90. I am not sure whether you will find another public eating place at Marina Bay – air-con ambience – for a coffee at $0.90. So, I thought I should keep Mr Png informed about this. More importantly, it is to do justice to the good work done by NTUC Foodfare, which has kept food prices at an affordable level at MBFC and benefiting thousands of office workers there.",31,160,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00160

I just want to touch on one point that I feel very encouraged about in this Budget. Many ideas and suggestions raised by the PAP Members of Parliament were taken in or being studied. It could be quite a long list to cite. But we know many of the issues are what PAP Members have championed, and in this Budget, we have seen some of them bear fruits. I am glad that we are not in the similar situation or predicament, like what is happening in US now, where their legislature and executive have locked horns, fighting over spending cuts and raising taxes. Even as we speak, they are now faced with this self-inflicted situation where a series of heap hazards and economically destructive spending cuts – known as the sequester – would take effect.

I would like to reiterate my call for an independent commission to look into work-life balance practices for equal opportunities for women and a more family-friendly Singapore. Partners and membership should extend to Government, key business leaders, employers, business associations, civil society groups and regular Singaporeans in order to take an integrated approach to work-life balance solutions. The setting up of this commission will signal a commitment to look into the complex issues of work-life balance, taking into consideration the needs of not just businesses but the larger society. The objective of this commission would be to lead public discussions on family-friendly work practices, develop research and promote global best practices to enhance work-life balance, and to develop pro-family business practices and resources to help businesses shift towards a more pro-family environment. It is simply because the issues are complex that we should dedicate sufficient time and resources to look into solutions in-depth for the long term and not go for the one-size-fits-all approach.",17,206,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00206

The number one concern of families is how to manage the high cost of living. The accumulated costs are immense, from financing a house, buying a car to transporting young children, paying for childcare, supporting the medical expenses and a host of other bills. What more for families who are also taking care of disabled or elderly relatives?",18,207,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00207

And in the harsh reality of meritocracy, we also expect the meritorious to do what is necessary for meritocracy to remain relevant – they must contribute more than others to the betterment of the society and maximise welfare for everyone living and working in Singapore.

In the past few years, the Customer-centric Initiative by NTUC, SPRING Singapore and Workforce Development Agency has resulted in many companies re-designing their workflow, improving the companies' performance, as well as attracting and retaining more staff, getting more Singaporeans to join the service industry.

For one, it gives $200 to any staff that refers a new employee that stays on for more than three months. In addition, Han's only employs Singaporeans for its office-based jobs. If an employee has done well and is more productive, achieving higher sales figures for the outlet, the employee will receive a bonus equivalent to 2% of his/her quarterly salary.

The Wage Credit Scheme is a form of transitional support for businesses before their investments take off. The WCS can serve as a catalyst; it is like the medical ingredient added to enhance the efficacy of medicine. If companies, big or small, tap on the suite of Government productivity schemes, together with the WCS, to increase productivity and restructure, and allow employees to enjoy wage increases, the WCS will definitely be of help.

2013-03-06-T-005,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),We also have to come down strongly on employers who do not pay their workers promptly. I would like to urge MOM to prosecute such employers to set a firm stance that such moves are unacceptable.,28,257,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00257
2013-03-06-T-005,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"Mdm Speaker, besides our moves to create a vibrant and dynamic manpower landscape that provides opportunities and productivity outputs in a fair and just way, we must also look beyond just managing manpower to optimise and sustain it. To this end, we must continue our efforts to build a safer and healthier workplace for all. It is essential that every worker, whatever his or her job is, returns to his or her home safe and sound at the end of every workday.",29,258,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00258
2013-03-06-T-005,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"Now that the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Act covers all workplaces, the Government must ensure that this Act will really have teeth and have measures to help every worker say no to risks at work and help every company to be equipped to maintain their WSH capability. I urge MOM to roll out more incentives and training support to unions and companies to achieve their WSH targets and monitor that these are sustainable.",30,259,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00259
2013-03-06-T-005,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"Lastly, I would like to reiterate my call for reviewing and enhancing the portable medical benefits. A flexible and comprehensive portable medical scheme is a good form of security for our workers; in particular, we are all more concerned about medical expenses and also with the drive towards longer employment and the implementation of the Re-employment Act. Currently, the Government only gives tax incentives for employers to contribute additional MediSave for their employees. Mdm Speaker, I hope MOF will seriously consider my call again to review its tax incentive scheme to encourage efforts that enable medical benefits to be made portable in whatever form, and not just only this form, so as to help everyone make the medical benefits for our employees portable.",31,260,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00260
2013-03-06-T-005,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"In conclusion, Mdm Speaker, with the new direction – lower dependency ratios, higher levies, stricter manpower regulations – a new reality is upon us. These moves, while challenging now in the initial stage, will serve to help us to do better, be more productive, innovative, self-reliant and be better skilled. I urge employers to take on the challenges and the Government to support efforts that have been put in by the tripartite partners. Most importantly, we must go for quality and not quantity, value every worker in this transition and transformation process. Madam, I support the Budget.",32,261,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00261
2013-03-06-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, my speech today is divided into two parts – the first assesses the Budget's attempts to create a more inclusive Singapore, with the second focus on changes to our car ownership policy as a result of the Budget announcement on the same.",1,262,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00262
2013-03-06-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, a simple ""control F"" of the Budget speech, and a search for the words ""do more"" reveal seven matches. According to the Budget, the Government will do more for retirees, Singaporeans who need help with their medical expenses, seniors so that they have a sense of economic security and fulfilment in their retirement years, and also for children in the pre-school and Primary school levels.",2,263,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00263
2013-03-06-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Government also wants to do more against rising inequality to tilt the balance in favour of the lower and middle income, and for older Singaporeans, with enhancements in Workfare and CPF. The timing of these changes are significant, too – three years before the next General Elections with enough lead time for the proposals to take effect.",3,264,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00264
2013-03-06-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Be that as it may, the Government's efforts to improve social mobility and reduce inequality are necessary steps, especially in view of how the global economy and, more importantly, forces beyond this Government's control, are shaping up. Chiefly among which are inequality and economic insecurity.",4,265,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00265
2013-03-06-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"For the longest time, the state discourse in Singapore has eschewed any reference to welfare. Similarly, the state has tended to place meritocracy on a pedestal. In fact, the political leadership has tended to frame both issues in the extreme, with welfare representing the bad and meritocracy representing the good.",5,266,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00266
2013-03-06-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"However, this Budget was noteworthy because meritocracy came with a caveat. The Deputy Prime Minister's Budget speech noted that meritocracy alone will not assure Singaporeans of social mobility and that Government policies seek to level up children that come from poorer and less stable families. This is a significant statement as it appears to premonition a shift in the state discourse.",6,267,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00267
2013-03-06-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Equally noteworthy, the Budget speech established that while overall healthcare expenditure will go up, Government policies envisage a reduction in Singaporeans' out-of-pocket share of medical costs, with the Government taking on a larger share. Whatever the reasons for these shifts to the left, they are in line with the long-held belief of the Workers' Party and many Singaporeans that for a country with a per capita income of about US$45,000, the Government can do much more on the social front for Singaporeans.",7,268,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00268
2013-03-06-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, one subject covered in the Budget that affects many middle-class Singaporeans are changes to the Government's policy on car ownership. The significance of the Budget and associated changes to the Government's car ownership policy led the executive director of a leading car dealership to say, ""In my 28 years in this trade, this is the most serious development I have seen."" An accounting partner of a Big Four firm was quoted as saying, ""The Minister is riding through Singapore's Sherwood Forest to tax the rich who own high-end properties and drive luxury cars.""",8,269,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00269
2013-03-06-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"While I would not take it as far as the accounting partner did – as there is much more room for greater progressivity in our tax system – I am in favour of higher taxes paid by those who drive luxury vehicles. It was telling that as the Minister spoke about the tiered ARF for his Budget speech, an MAS circular about a cap on loan-to-valuation (LTV) ratios also started making its rounds.",9,270,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00270
2013-03-06-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The circular established that the new loan quantum for a car with an OMV of less than $20,000 would be 60% of the car price and 50% if the OMV was higher. Significantly, the maximum loan repayment is now only five years, from the 10 years previously.",10,271,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00271
2013-03-06-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"On one level, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance's Budget speech on tiered Additional Registration Fees (ARF) appeared to continue with the theme of progressive taxation, but the possible effects of the Budget announcement and the MAS circular taken together lead me to conclude the opposite  that the rich will benefit from the latest changes to our car ownership policy as the changes do not address the high disposable income of the rich.",11,272,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00272
2013-03-06-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In the context of the Budget statement, it would have been helpful if the Minister had addressed the changes to the ARF with the policy intent of the MAS circular, especially since the two are so inextricably linked. If these changes were implemented to force Singaporeans to use public transport, the system, as it stands, leaves much to be desired, especially during peak hours. I am not sure what the effects of these latest changes to our car ownership policy will be, as there are differing views on the impact of the latest policy changes on COE prices and, as a result, the price of cars. But the effect of the new LTV ratios is likely to be most acutely felt by families with two or more children and those with elderly family members or the disabled who need the mobility provided by a car but are unable to cough up the down-payments since the larger household size necessarily entails a lower disposable income set aside for the higher down-payment required now.",12,273,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00273
2013-03-06-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"There is also the tangential concern about the inability of larger families to purchase a vehicle which, from a policy perspective, may well indirectly stymie efforts to promote our TFR, since the lack of mobility for family, leisure, travel and support will well factor into a person's decision to have fewer children and prejudice those who already have large families. It would be imperative for the Government to look at possible tweaks to the system if indeed larger families and families that include disabled Singaporeans or elderly parents are genuinely affected, as the effects of the new policy kick in over the next few months.",13,274,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00274
2013-03-06-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"One specific way could be to raise the LTV ratio for cars back to 70% as it was previously, but only for families with two or more children so as to buttress and incentivise the Government's efforts to raise TFR.",14,275,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00275
2013-03-06-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, it would be a tragedy if younger Singaporeans included the inability to purchase a car as a reason for wanting to look abroad for greener pastures, in addition to the visceral insecurity of a more crowded Singapore in the future. It may be helpful for the Government to solicit feedback from Singaporeans about our car ownership policy going forward, particularly on the aspirations of owning a car, even if the stated objective of this policy is to discourage Singaporeans from over leveraging.",15,276,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00276
2013-03-06-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"This may entail a deeper look into the COE system or even larger national considerations, such as the future population size of Singapore, so that the policy fear of a more crowded Singapore does not operate to scuttle the aspirations of Singaporeans to own the car of their dreams, unless of course the Government's intention – be it directly or directly – is to remove the dream of car ownership for middle-class Singaporeans.",16,277,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00277
2013-03-06-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"On the flip side, I am encouraged by tweaks to the COE policy that give greater business flexibility to SMEs. In January 2013, I asked the Minister for Transport in a Parliamentary Question whether the Ministry will consider reviewing the COE bidding system for goods vehicles and buses to alleviate the costs of doing business for SMEs. While the Minister replied that there were no plans to review the COE system for the said category, he did say that, as part of Budget 2013, his Ministry would carefully consider if more help was needed. To this extent, I welcome the flexibility granted to commercial vehicle owners whose vehicles have reached the end of their 10-year COE, as they can now choose to renew their COEs for five years in the first instance, and a further five years later.",17,278,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00278
2013-03-06-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Likewise, the granting of a one-year 30% road tax rebate for goods vehicles, buses and taxis is also welcomed. It would be helpful if the Government could make the extension of such road tax grants permanent, especially for the ""mom-and-pop"" SMEs with a headcount of five or less, when COE prices reach astronomically high levels as they have been in the recent past for Category C COEs. In addition, as some SME owners, particularly hawkers and sundry store owners, work with narrow margins, it may be helpful to look into allowing Category C COE holders to extend their COEs every 30 months or two-and-a-half years, rather than every five years, as the Budget has announced. Such a move would allow for even greater flexibility for SME owners and nudge them to consider pulling an older vehicle off the road since the decision-making cycle of renewing of COE would be shorter.",18,279,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00279
2013-03-06-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, post Budget, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance acknowledged that the country continues to be in an unhappy part of the property cycle, following up from the Budget speech that reiterates that the Government will spend more efforts in resolving the present challenges facing housing and transport. While I look forward to the resolution of these problems, it would be equally important for the Government to explain the reasons behind significant policy shifts instead of leaving Singaporeans to second guess the Government's real purpose, as has been the feedback for MAS' changes to the car ownership policy. Such engagement will help reduce unpredictability and encourage a more participatory democracy and allow Singaporeans to plan for their future with more certainty.",19,280,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00280

Madam, this year's Budget has many initiatives for both companies as well as for Singaporeans, especially those more affected by the high cost of living and in doing business.

2013-03-06-T-005,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"Madam, on helping companies, I feel that the current year's Budget did not adequately address the cost of doing business issues that are faced by many of our companies. The problems that they face are multi-faceted – the high cost of rental and real estate, high cost of the Singapore dollar therefore making us uncompetitive, the increasing labour costs, and the demand and supply imbalance of infrastructure and vehicles that has skyrocketed prices of goods and services in Singapore.",3,283,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00283
2013-03-06-T-005,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"This year's Budget could, therefore, have focused on cost competitiveness, especially since we are already facing steeper competition from many of our neighbouring countries. The Government has placed all its bets on productivity improvements, which, we all know, will take a little longer to be achieved and that, too, not easily. So, in the meantime, all the other bottomline cost issues will plague companies rendering them uncompetitive. We need to give companies some breathing space to survive first and then restructure to become competitive and, then, strong. How can we build a strong and resilient economy if the bulk of our companies are struggling to stay afloat with these issues?",4,284,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00284

2013-03-06-T-005,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"On achieving productivity gains, it is good that we are now really focused on productivity-driven growth, as a small and expensive country like Singapore should be pursuing such a growth strategy in the first place. But I think we are putting the cart before the horse by increasing levies and restricting foreign workers before productivity improvements can take effect; and this is a risky strategy that the Government is taking, in my opinion.",6,286,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00286
2013-03-06-T-005,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"In the past, we also tried to pursue a productivity-driven growth, through the Construction 21 project in late 1999, to address the increasing problems in the construction sector. Then, there was Retail 21 launched in March 2001, which was part of the SME 21 vision of doubling the impact on the productivity level of the retail sector in Singapore. And there was ProAct 21 launched about a decade ago for Singapore to become a knowledge-based economy, deriving its competitive edge from productivity.",7,287,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00287

2013-03-06-T-005,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"It is good that the Government is now serious about the productivity drive and I hope we will not make future U-turns on this as we did in the past, but I am asking the Government to be realistic about the rate at which companies can restructure their businesses.",9,289,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00289
2013-03-06-T-005,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"The Government needs to ask whether the current schemes, like the PIC and the intended Wage Credit Scheme, are going to change the behaviour of companies and also that of the employees. The way things are going with the PIC, in my opinion, is that companies that are going to spend on some big ticket items, especially the larger companies, are benefiting by claiming back money from the Government for what they are going to spend anyway. But did they have a mindset change in terms of doing more things to improve productivity? My gut feel is that a small number only really did something to change behaviour towards productivity-driven business models. The same will be with the Wage Credit Scheme, in my opinion. Companies, especially bigger companies, will anyway be increasing their employees' salaries and it would have nothing to do with new productivity behaviour and they will be claiming millions of dollars from the Government. It will be a pity if this is widespread. We should, therefore, relook and sharpen some of these productivity intended tools introduced in this year's and past years' Budgets.",10,290,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00290
2013-03-06-T-005,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"On survival versus restructuring, I urge the Government to recalibrate the whole process. I think this is something that we really have to think about very seriously, to allow companies to survive first before going for aggressive restructuring. We are now forcing companies to fight for their survival and aggressively restructure for an aggressive productivity goal, all at the same time.",11,291,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00291
2013-03-06-T-005,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"I would like to suggest we recalibrate the process and timing and focus on a five-year goal where we slow down in the first two years but we speed up even faster than the current projected five-year rate, from the third year onwards. We will still arrive at the same destination, with the same goals that we want, but through a different journey or route. If, after two years, companies fail to restructure, despite the grace period given by the Government, they will face even greater challenges from the third year onwards, and they will have to make even steeper changes as the rate of restructuring then becomes much more intense. And if they fail to restructure in the first two years, then I think it will be a fair proposition that the Government cannot help any further because they failed to help themselves when they were given ample opportunity.",12,292,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00292
2013-03-06-T-005,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"The Minister might say that the Government did give ample notice to companies about the impending foreign labour cuts, but I want to say that many in the business community thought that the Government would again make a U-turn on its labour policies, as it did in the past. Now that everyone knows that the Government means business in the restructuring drive and that there will be no more U-turns, let us give companies a last chance to restructure properly. I am afraid that we are pushing companies beyond the tipping point unnecessarily with the aggressive pace of restructuring.",13,293,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00293
2013-03-06-T-005,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"What about the impact on labour policies? I hope that the Government will tweak the labour control measures. We need two things to happen. First, how can we make it more attractive for locals to enter the workforce and, second, we need to recalibrate the reduction rate of foreign workers. While I agree that in the longer term we need to be less dependent on foreigners, in the short term, we cannot suddenly turn off the tap. So, let us recalibrate the reduction rate to give companies some time to restructure their business models.",14,294,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00294
2013-03-06-T-005,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"MOM is already working on many things to attract more locals to the workforce and I hope these will work well. This year's Budget also announced a number of measures that, hopefully, will attract locals to the workforce. I believe we will have some success by these measures but we need to attract them with reasonable wages. The current approach by the Government is to encourage employers to raise wages, but I feel that it may take too long and we may lose the battle for restructuring in the near term. I feel that we cannot wait and hope for wages to go up by encouraging employers. We have waited too long and we should, therefore, take a more decisive action right now.",15,295,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00295
2013-03-06-T-005,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"Therefore, I would like to once again call on the Government to adopt a formal minimum wage system to speed up the reform of wages for locals. Some say that the minimum wage adds to the cost problems for companies. I am, therefore, suggesting a Government-assisted, time-reducing minimum wage system, something like the Jobs Credit Scheme where the employer pays a certain level of wages he can afford and the Government tops up the rest needed to make up the minimum wage. There can be a five-year decline in the Government top-up which zeroes out in the sixth year and then the company will have to pay the full minimum wage from the sixth year onwards.",16,296,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00296
2013-03-06-T-005,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"For companies, what this means is that they will have a clear roadmap of reduction of foreign workforce quotas − a five-year reduction and also a five-year roadmap of having to pay higher wages. This will be an excellent way to compel companies to restructure and work seriously on productivity and, if they fail to do so, they will know that it will not be viable for them to operate here in Singapore and may perhaps have to relocate or shut down. We will therefore not artificially kill companies too early with our desired pace of restructuring.",17,297,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00297
2013-03-06-T-005,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"We must also have greater confidence that Singaporeans with minimum wage will not be a deterrent for employers. We have many other good things going for us − good infrastructure, good connectivity with global markets, good financial system, stable government, a hardworking work force and, of course, low taxes. These will be enough to balance any negativity that may arise as a result of a minimum wage system here in Singapore.",18,298,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00298
2013-03-06-T-005,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"Over the Chinese New Year period, I spoke with a senior banker from Hong Kong who told me that the Hong Kong government was worried that the minimum wage will result in companies leaving and job losses for people. But this did not happen and Hong Kong's economy, in fact, remains vibrant and continues to boom and they are now advocating − just after one year − an increase of the minimum wage that they had set a year ago. I believe that as long we have a vibrant economy, we should be confident and not be afraid of establishing a minimum wage system.",19,299,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00299
2013-03-06-T-005,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"Hong Kong's lesson is that the minimum wage policy helped enhance the incentive to work. The labour force participation rates rose across different age groups and educational levels, especially among women and the elderly. Even in the US recently, President Obama announced an increase of the minimum wage, and I do not think the US economy is less vibrant as a result of this policy.",20,300,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00300
2013-03-06-T-005,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"In Singapore, I am suggesting that the minimum wage could be around $1,500, something less than what the US practises. This will allow Singaporeans and their families to have a basic decent quality of life based on our current cost structures. If we pay people well, they will do the job. I firmly believe that what we consider as jobs which Singaporeans are not willing to do are such because we have depressed the wages in industries like construction, security and cleaning industries. It is unfair for such jobs to pay Singaporeans just $800 or $900 per month when cost of living is so high. If we pay a reasonable salary for some of these jobs, I am sure Singaporeans will be willing to do them. It is happening in all the developed countries in the world, like Australia, USA and Japan where locals proudly do these jobs because they are paid well and because the jobs are restructured to be more value added than the way we have structured these jobs in Singapore. We should raise the salary base to uplift the lives of lower income Singaporeans and use the quotas on S Passes to lift the median wages of Singaporeans.",21,301,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00301
2013-03-06-T-005,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"The Wage Credit Scheme is a good attempt to help encourage companies to pay employees more, but I do not think we will achieve the desired objective easily for a few reasons. First, the three-year limit of wage support will put an overall salary burden on companies from the fourth year onwards. Fearing that they may not be able to support the future wage all by themselves, we may not achieve the objective of uplifting the workers' salaries in the near term. Second, the scheme requires companies to pay the salary first and claim later, in fact, I think at the end of one year of employment. So, companies incur costs first, adding to their cost and cash flow woes. It will be viewed as a cost-adding component although the intent is to have companies pay higher wages for Singaporeans who otherwise may not want to take up a job. Third, bigger companies will benefit most from this scheme because they would in any case be increasing their salaries to retain and hire staff. And in the case of hiring new staff, they would in any case be raising salaries after a typical probation of three months or so. Why compensate them when they do not really need it? I recall when we implemented the Jobs Credit Scheme after the 2009 recession, this is exactly what happened. When I spoke with some CEOs, some actually told me that they did not really need the money but it was a welcome addition to their income, a few million dollars each for some of these big companies.",22,302,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00302
2013-03-06-T-005,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"Why are companies struggling to pay higher wages to Singaporeans? Because the overall cost of doing business is very high, especially rentals. If we had a good handle on costs, companies may not use their employees as a squeeze point. It is unfair for employees to face the brunt of the serious business cost issues that we are facing as a result of our past economic policies and also because of the liberal investment environment we adopted in the past, that is, investment in commercial and industrial properties by locals and foreigners who are just financial investors and have no vested interest in businesses. Therefore, I strongly feel that unless JTC or any other Government agency goes back to providing affordable rentals for our companies, we will have little chance of seeing future local entrepreneurs starting and growing in Singapore. And we will see many of our SMEs actually not being able to operate. One other way of reining in prices is to strictly enforce that industrial property should be only used for goods and services producing activities and not for office and other non-producing activities. The current liberal usage rules have distorted the rentals of industrial properties and, therefore, made it too expensive for industrial users while it may be much cheaper than the office and commercial users.",23,303,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00303
2013-03-06-T-005,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"If we still believe that we need cooperatives like NTUC FairPrice, NTUC Choice Homes and NTUC Foodfare to inject reality to market prices, then why do we not believe that we need JTC rental factories to manage factory rental prices? So, let us bring back the JTC of the past to help us inject some reality into the rentals of industrial properties. In fact, this will discourage the investors from playing with our industrial properties to make monies for themselves because the JTC, leveller of rentals, will not make their returns in investing in industrial properties attractive.",24,304,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00304
2013-03-06-T-005,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"In summary, I would like to urge that we keep things simple and make the measures sharper and more targeted towards achieving the originally intended recipients. These simple measures are, first, the wage gap. Let us combine the WIS, wage credit and some of the GST rebates to have one simple minimum wage scheme supported by the Government for a five-year period. Then, people do not have to feel that they can only survive because of the handouts that they get from the Government. Second, cost of doing business – combine all the initiatives, including the wage credit, to help companies manage cost and cash flow, instead of a blunt tool like the wage credit, as it is intended right now, that also benefits companies that do not really need it. Let us allow companies to apply for the money that will compensate for their cost of doing business. It may be more cumbersome but it is more targeted, causes companies to justify why they should be given support to manage their costs. So, roll all of the measures into one cost mitigating package. And third, restructuring for productivity. I urge the Government to give companies a five-year roadmap and support the smaller companies with more resources in a more targeted approach to help them restructure. In this respect, I hope that we will add more resources to organisations like SPRING.",25,305,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00305
2013-03-06-T-005,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"If we can do all of these things, we can definitely help companies here a lot more in coping with the restructuring while keeping our targets fixed on the same objectives at the end of the five-year period. I hope the Government will consider these initiatives and make sure that our restructuring plans are effective. As I mentioned at the beginning, we have many excellent ideas in this Budget, but I think we just need to re-target them and we will be very effective in achieving our restructuring goals. On the whole, Mdm Speaker, I support the Budget.",26,306,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00306

So, I am actually happy to hear the Member, Mr Pritam Singh's acknowledgement of the Government's ethos, but disagree that it is a departure from the Government's long-standing principles.

When Mr Lee Hsien Loong first became Prime Minister, he reiterated the importance of building an inclusive society. And in recent policy debates, I hear of public intellectuals and Singaporeans at large concerned that we remain an inclusive society, and that no one should be left behind because of their background or the nature of their talent or ability.

It has done this through its commitment to educating the nation, levelling-up those in need, creating an active income policy, and negotiating with the business sector and labour unions as partners so as to ensure that business and economic growth translate into better jobs and wages, and, of course, ultimately, a better life. The aim is to serve its citizens first.",3,309,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00309

Over the past 40 years, we reaped the demographic dividend via social cohesion and a vibrant economy. As wealth builds up and given the miracle of compound interest, wealth replicates itself a lot more with each generation, contributing, in part, to a higher Gini coefficient. It is not useful to beat ourselves up just because we have been successful in wealth creation. However, what we must do is to mitigate this via progressive taxes and egalitarian fiscal policies, so all boats can be lifted when the tide comes in.",5,311,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00311

The Government improved the support to the lower income and other disadvantaged groups. Positive steps include the increase in the quantum of the GST Voucher, the top-up of the MediFund and ElderCare Fund, the edging-up of the Public Assistance payout and additional help for the disabled population. Together, these measures help these groups to keep up with the rising cost of living.",7,313,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00313

Jobs give people a sense of purpose and fulfilment. The Workfare system reinforces the idea that jobs are the best form of welfare. Hence, the expanded and improved Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) and the newly introduced innovative Wage Credit Scheme (WCS) will help up to 70% of our working citizens cope with cost-of-living issues while living a dignified life. It is a hand-up, not a handout.",8,314,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00314
2013-03-06-T-005,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Third, which is probably the most important that underpins this Government's ethos, is really social mobility via education. Think of the massive ramp-up in education that has enabled Singaporeans to move from a position of few jobs in the 1960s, to the blue collar jobs of the 1970s to white collar jobs in the middle class today. This was, in fact, the kind of lifestyle that our people used to aspire back in the 1960s, 1970s and even 1980s.",9,315,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00315

In 2010, 22%, close to 23% of our resident population, had University education and about 50% of Singaporeans are in PMET jobs. By 2030, well over 40% of each Singaporean cohort will have accessed publicly-funded University education and it is expected that two-thirds of Singaporeans will be in PMET jobs. That will be the aspirations that parents of pre-schoolers today have for their children.",10,316,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00316
2013-03-06-T-005,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The commitment to education as the route to social mobility, therefore, has been a long-standing one. In fact, in December 1990, in a speech to the grassroots, the then Prime Minister Mr Goh Chok Tong said  ""I want to elaborate on one of the central pillars in my approach to building a better Singapore. Essentially, I want to maximise and equalise opportunities for Singaporeans to improve themselves. I do not want anyone in our society to miss out on a chance to better his life because he cannot afford the opportunities. I want to give everyone the same chance for a good start in life. I shall do this primarily through education.""",11,317,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00317

My heart aches whenever I see and hear that the little children of school-going age are still unable to read A-B-C or count one-two-three. They are capable of it, and I know that.

We also persuaded a VWO to design both the space and jobs to cater to the elderly population and generate jobs for the residents of the rental blocks. We hope to showcase students who show potential in both the academic and non-academic arena, and, in so doing, inspire the rest of the students and parents in our rental blocks to strive for a better tomorrow. The simple message is  there is hope when we all work together. The centre is now almost built, and I will do my utmost to make it a success.",19,325,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00325

It is smarter and a boon for cash-strapped families in a weak recovery. It also frees up the much needed space in the house and puts cash in the pocket for more productive use.

Benny Se Teo takes in ex-offenders like himself during their last few months of their jail sentence to train them in necessary skills so that they can have a new start in life. Through employment, he helps to ease their integration back to the society. Benny went in and out of prison between 1980 and 1993 for heroin addiction from the age of 14. After a near-death experience, he turned over a new leaf and started learning how to cook. Benny serves up not only good food, but a strong dose of hope for other ex-offenders.",5,347,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00347
2013-03-06-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"More recently, just last month, in February, Mdm Sim Sin Sin, who is the CEO of Laksania, invited me to join her and other friends to celebrate the opening of their latest eatery at Upper East Coast. Laksania is another social enterprise, a social enterprise that Sin Sin herself started in 2008. Their social mission is to help persons with mental or physical disability to gain employment. Laksania employs them and enables them to earn a living using their own efforts. They have set up a central kitchen to hire and train clients of IMH. These clients are encouraged to be self-reliant and have gained important inter-personal and other life skills, setting down the road to financial independence.",6,348,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00348
2013-03-06-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"These groups have benefited from on-the-job training in the various aspects of F&B and have been fully integrated into their business model – one which is sustainable. Laksania, for those who are not sure what they are, as the name suggests and implies, it is a laksa specialty café where you can try all kinds of laksa. You will be amazed what kind of laksa and how many different types there are. Indeed, in this year's Budget, all social enterprises will benefit from the various schemes, such as the PIC, Wage Credit Scheme and others. But, certainly, I hope they could be given even more help.",7,349,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00349
2013-03-06-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Let me now turn to a different kind of social enterprises – co-operatives. UN Secretary General Mr Ban Ki Moon said, ""Co-operatives are a unique and invaluable presence in today's world. They help to reduce poverty and generate jobs."" In his message to commemorate International Year of the Co-operatives in 2012, Mr Ban Ki Moon emphasised the role that co-operatives play in strengthening communities socially and economically. He recognised that co-operatives are value-based businesses and are rooted in their communities because they are owned by their members. I certainly agree with what Mr Ban Ki Moon has said and wish to state upfront my contention that co-operatives also help to make for a Better Singapore. As you know, NTUC has set up various cooperatives and they include NTUC Fairprice, NTUC Income, NTUC First Campus and NTUC Foodfare.",8,350,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00350
2013-03-06-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Mdm Speaker, yesterday, the hon Member Mr Png Eng Huat made some statements about one such NTUC cooperative, NTUC Foodfare, to be precise. His comments, I felt, cast certain aspersions which I feel compelled to respond and clarify.",9,351,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00351
2013-03-06-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Foodfare Co-operative was set up by NTUC in 1995 – just like all other NTUC social enterprises – to help all Singaporeans, not just union members or certain target groups. Foodfare was set up amidst a backdrop of rampant price increases and profiteering by F&B private operators during the introduction of the GST. Foodfare's mission is to keep cooked food prices affordable and ensure that all Singaporeans and consumers can benefit from its initiatives.",10,352,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00352
2013-03-06-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"How do they do this? First and foremost, Foodfare benchmarks its food and beverage prices against similar locations to ensure they are fair. It moderates the prices of its food and beverage in the coffeeshops and food courts that it operates at by controlling price increases to prevent unchecked increases that hurt consumers. Foodfare has, on many occasions, held prices of basic food and beverage down during recessions when the need is greatest. For example, in February 2011, when there was a tide of price increases within the coffeeshop/foodcourt industry, Foodfare announced that it would hold off any price increases at all its outlets for the rest of the year. While Foodfare is not immune to the business pressures of rising food, labour and rental costs, it did so in order that all Singaporeans, not just union members, can better cope with inflation. By setting this price floor, Foodfare stood against the rage of others who had been raising their prices and, as some would say, profiteer. I think this is something to be applauded, not derided.",11,353,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00353
2013-03-06-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"In addition, in April 2011, Foodfare launched its One Million Plates for Singapore, an initiative to help Singaporeans cope with the rising cost of cooked food. Under this initiative, Foodfare set aside one million NTUC Value Meals, which are available not only to union members, but to all Singaporeans in all its outlets. The meals, at discounted prices, can be redeemed via coupons at every stall. In order to better reach out to the poor and needy who are not union members, Foodfare also partnered the Community Development Councils (CDCs) to distribute 200,000 coupons out of the one million to needy residents so as to make a difference where it is most needed.",12,354,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00354
2013-03-06-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Foodfare's efforts to do good for the general public to moderate the cost of cooked food are also being acknowledged by a private property owner of Marina Bay Financial Centre. In fact, just now, hon Member Mr Liang Eng Hwa talked about his own personal experiences. Foodfare was invited by the owner there to operate the foodcourt there in order to provide reasonably priced and quality cooked food to the general public and the working people in the Marina Bay area. I know for a fact that many office workers and PMEs there, they all wished NTUC Foodfare had opened much earlier so that they could have saved more money from the meals they had to otherwise take elsewhere before Foodfare was there.",13,355,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00355
2013-03-06-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Now, let me give some more specific examples of the good that Foodfare has done for all Singaporeans and consumers. For example, Foodfare's Breakfast Set delivers very good value at just $1.80 to the public. And what does $1.80 give you? Two eggs, a toast and a cup of coffee or tea. If you compare that with the average price sold in the market today, I think they range between $2.50 and $2.80. Additionally, its basic coffee or tea prices start at how much? $0.70 and $0.80 at their coffeeshops and food courts respectively. These are good benchmarks. These prices, offered to all customers, have not increased since 2006, regardless of where the outlets are.",14,356,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00356
2013-03-06-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"They strive to ensure that basic food offerings, such as fishball noodles, yong tau foo, duck rice and others, are one of the cheapest and provide great value for its customers – again, regardless of whether they are union members. For example, you can get a bowl of fishball noodles at $2.50 in their Clementi coffeeshop. If you like chicken rice, there is $2.80 chicken rice at Yew Tee coffeeshop, and char siew noodle at its Rivervale Mall foodcourt for $2.80 a plate.",15,357,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00357
2013-03-06-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"It is not an easy task to balance quality options and affordability for the masses and, at the same time, balancing the business aspirations of their tenants. In addition, they strive to also deliver these in a good shopping ambience – standards and comforts befitting what the customers want. Members heard earlier their foodcourt at Marina Bay Financial Centre. Those who have not been there, pay a visit. It really serves up a menu at heartland foodcourt prices which are easily 5% to 15% cheaper than any neighbouring foodcourts in that area.",16,358,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00358
2013-03-06-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"While Foodfare strives to serve every Singaporean, not just its union members, Foodfare does strive to do even more for the poor and needy. So, I wish to put this question to Mr Png  should the poor and needy or those on the Public Assistance scheme not be helped more? Let us not be naive. Foodfare helps nobody if it cannot first make its numbers work. But given what they have, they have already decided not to make super-normal profits. Further, from the margins that they have, they have to decide where to give this help. It makes sense, certainly to me, to channel this to where the need is greatest. If this logic is faulty, I would thank the Member for Hougang for correcting it and, more importantly, provide his own distributive logic.",17,359,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00359
2013-03-06-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"As a social enterprise, Foodfare has extended an extra helping hand to those who are on the Public Assistance scheme and to the elderly. This can be seen really from its $1.99 economic rice community project, as well as its recent launch of its Budget Pick programme where these groups of people get extra help with discounted meals. And for the avoidance of doubt, NTUC Foodfare Co-operative does not enjoy any subsidised rental from the Government or NEA in any of the premises they occupy. They still have to make an offer and, if they are successful, pay at market rates for the premises, just like anyone else. So, I find some of the comments made yesterday a bit incorrect, not just to the co-operatives, but they also cast a certain slur on our efforts and it also demeans the work of the many people who work in and for the co-operatives.",18,360,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00360
2013-03-06-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Eating out at hawker centres and kopitiams is a favourite pastime for all of us. And, indeed, at NTUC Foodfare stalls, they provide a convenient and affordable meal option for all Singaporeans and consumers alike. But, of course, if you want to stretch your dollar even further, nothing beats cooking and eating at home. And this is where another NTUC co-operative, NTUC FairPrice comes in. We work for over 630,000 owners − all Singaporeans who own our shares. We employ about 9,000 staff and they are overwhelmingly Singaporeans. Over two-thirds of our staff are female and over 40% of them are above 50 years old. I cite this because the national profile will show that about 31% of our workforce is more than 50 years old. This shows that we are very pro-mature workers.",19,361,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00361
2013-03-06-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"FairPrice also ploughs a large part of its surpluses to the community to help the poor and needy, the elderly and low-wage workers, as well as to VWOs and many charities. We also do our best to help moderate the cost of living. One good example is the senior citizens discount that we give out every Tuesday. The figures would show some five million transactions each year benefiting over 90,000 senior citizens each week. I checked the figure yesterday, which was a Tuesday, and, indeed, over 90,000 senior citizens came by. What does it cost us? Over $2.3 million each year and this amount can only grow.",20,362,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00362
2013-03-06-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"We are also a strong promoter of local SMEs and their produce. We do our best whenever a crisis strikes us − Bird Flu, SARS, rice crisis and the list goes on. Whenever the opportunity for profiteering arises, we will certainly be there to try to stand up against it by taking the first hit. All these are not by chance but deliberate policy and guiding principles that we subscribe to because we are an NTUC co-operative with a social mission.",21,363,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00363
2013-03-06-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"I am stating all these because not so long ago, in October 2011, Mr Png's colleague, Mr Yee Jenn Jong, also made some statements concerning NTUC co-operatives, which I had also addressed and clarified. But since Mr Png raised some of these issues, I wanted to take this opportunity to shed more light.",22,364,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00364
2013-03-06-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Mdm Speaker, co-operatives are a check on pure market forces. They have social, not political ends.

2013-03-06-T-005,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Finally, I hope, through these examples, the Government – and I am looking at the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance – would continue to look at ways to further build, nurture and grow the social enterprise sector. Social enterprises and cooperatives can help us in our journey to build a more inclusive society and, when we do, a Better Singapore would follow. Mdm Speaker, I support the Budget.",24,366,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00366

2013-03-06-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"I would like to make two recommendations for MOF and the Deputy Prime Minister's consideration. Firstly, respect every job and value every contribution. In the past, many freelancers and self-employed had indicated that they needed more support. They do not receive CPF contributions by employers, nor do they enjoy medical or leave benefits. Some have to deal with clients who do not pay up, or take a long time to pay for the services rendered. I have spoken with many of them recently and they have reiterated that these remain major concerns for them.",2,368,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00368
2013-03-06-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"This year's Budget has brought much cheer to them. Many will enjoy income tax rebates, GST rebates, enhanced Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) and MediSave top-ups. These measures will go a long way in helping them manage cost pressures.",3,369,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00369
2013-03-06-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"With the evolving economy, we are actually seeing more and swifter changes to job options. Many people are becoming self-employed and freelancers, whether they are taxi drivers, adult educators or tour guides, as examples. Many of them I spoke with hope that society will respect their career choice and not perceive this choice that they have made as a fall-back option. What they do every day contributes significantly to our economy. Our economic transformation should include the self-employed. We can do more to make their jobs more respectable and their choice a better one. Let me cite two examples to illustrate what I meant.",4,370,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00370
2013-03-06-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"First, taxi drivers. I would like to declare that I am the Adviser for the National Taxi Association, and many taxi drivers that I spoke with share their sentiments with me. I hope taxi drivers and taxi operators will be able to strike a good partnership. Drivers should be viewed as co-owners, instead of the current taxi operator-hirer relationship. Take, for example, the Government has just announced a one-year 30% road tax rebate for commercial vehicles, including taxis. The immediate response by some taxi operators to the call by the National Taxi Association (NTA) to give back the savings to drivers is a good start. We hope all taxi operators will follow suit.",5,371,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00371
2013-03-06-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Older taxi drivers I spoke with are also pleased with existing programmes, such as the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) by MOH, to help them manage healthcare costs. The NTA, together with dental and healthcare groups, has also rolled out discounted schemes to enable taxi drivers to enjoy affordable medical care. Recently, the Health Promotion Board has also stepped in to provide some level of support for taxi drivers.",6,372,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00372
2013-03-06-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"All the stakeholders have taken very proactive steps. However, with rising medical costs and needs, affordability remains a major concern. The drivers I spoke with welcomed the one-off MediSave account top-up of $200. In addition, they have two requests to make this Budget a more inclusive one.",7,373,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00373
2013-03-06-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Firstly, this Budget enhanced the WIS and created the Wage Credit Scheme (WCS). This was good news to many. However, as self-employed, they hope that they will be able to receive the same amount in WIS as employees. Today, they also receive a smaller amount in cash. Mdm Speaker, many are pleased with the generosity of the WCS. But as self-employed and freelancers, they do not benefit from this programme. While there is no direct scheme to help the self-employed in this Budget, perhaps the Deputy Prime Minister could consider further refinements at a later date.",8,374,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00374
2013-03-06-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Secondly, taxi drivers work very hard every day. What they hope to see is that the Government and operator can offer greater support to help them build up their CPF savings. They grapple with rising business operating costs, such as higher taxi rental, ERP charges, diesel tax levy, petrol costs and insurance premiums. They have suggested reviewing an existing old scheme and re-calibrating it to meet today's reality, and that is the diesel tax levy. With cleaner diesel technologies and more Euro IV cars on the roads, perhaps the Government can review the annual diesel tax levy and its utilisation.",9,375,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00375
2013-03-06-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"One way is to explore taking part of the levy collected from drivers and transferring into the drivers' CPF accounts. This way, resources can be directed towards giving them greater security for their healthcare, housing and retirement needs.",10,376,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00376
2013-03-06-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Another group of the growing pool of self-employed is the adult educators. Efforts over the last few years by the Government in Continuing Education and Training have actually expanded the market for more local trainers. The Singapore Workforce Development Agency estimates that, today, there are probably over 15,000 training practitioners. I have spoken to some of them recently and they welcome the recent announcement that training for Singaporean workers would be boosted and the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund will receive a top-up. To them, this represents a bigger market share – more people going for training, more businesses for the adult educators. Our brand as an adult training hub has also gone up among our regional neighbours. I am also the Executive Secretary of the Education Services Union and we recently conducted a survey among adult educators. Their main concern is about income security.",11,377,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00377
2013-03-06-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"In this Budget, many workers can look forward to benefiting from the enhanced Workfare and WCS. Many will see their wages and skills rise through the progressive wage model illustrated by Mr Zainal Sapari and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang earlier on. Adult educators have not been left out in this effort. Together with the Institute of Adult Learning by the WDA, industry practitioners and the unions have been working on the progression pathways for adult educators. Today, they can progress from being a trainer certified under the Workplace Trainer Programme to attaining an advanced certificate, a diploma and even Masters in Training and Development or in Lifelong Learning. And the good news is these courses are co-funded by the Government.",12,378,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00378
2013-03-06-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Such a pathway enables adult educators to deliver better services, handle more complex needs, such as assessing training outcomes and designing curriculum. Moving forward, they are able to better earn higher income and access new markets, both locally and regionally. Indeed, adult educators can seek the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance's consideration to give them more help, more funds. But as one of them remarked to me, the best help is to expand his market reach and deepen his professionalism, not more money.",13,379,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00379
2013-03-06-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Hence, I call upon the Government and employers to speed up the recognition of training certification, whether it be WSQ or other certifiable courses. Such skills recognition is key to our efforts to embark on quality growth. We should also engage the services of training practitioners with the right qualifications. This is especially important since they have a significant role to play in bringing about positive impact to our workers.",14,380,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00380
2013-03-06-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Adult educators gain expertise in their fields and have valuable skills that allow them to perform well in their job.

2013-03-06-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Finally, my second point is to help Singaporeans get a job quickly. I support Ms Mary Liew and Mr Heng Chee How's call to help more segments of Singaporeans to find good jobs quickly. Last year, the Minister for Finance announced enhancements to the Special Employment Credits (SEC) scheme. The Acting Minister for Manpower, in a recent reply to a Parliamentary Question, also shared that he is open to extending SEC or some variant form of it to ex-offenders who are under the Yellow Ribbon project.",16,382,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00382
2013-03-06-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Previously, I had called for the SEC to be extended to other vulnerable worker segments, be it back-to-work women or ex-offenders. I have also visited the Prison to find out more from inmates about their employment concerns. In my constituency, I continue to meet many ex-offenders and back-to-work women who face challenges to return to the workforce. Some have shared that employers tell them that the cost of having to make adjustments for hiring them is not viable. For example, they may have to create a more flexible work schedule or create a mentoring system. And job seekers also share that they find it challenging or costly, sometimes, to attend courses and there are obstacles they face along the way.",17,383,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00383
2013-03-06-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Perhaps, the Minister can consider bundling some of such support services together so that the job seekers are trained before they are sent to the employers. And employers are prepared in their workplace with certain incentive schemes to receive these groups of job seekers. I hope that the Minister can also review the plans to use the SEC scheme to enable more back-to-work women and ex-offenders to re-integrate back into society quickly.",18,384,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00384
2013-03-06-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Mdm Speaker, I think it is important that we do more for the self-employed. It is not always through giving out more grants, although I am quite sure many will welcome it. For many, this career route was not their first choice. They may have lost their jobs in other arena and have to look for alternative ones. It is unfair to leave them alone, assuming that because they are self-employed they can look after themselves. I believe that, with greater help and support, we can deepen their skills and enable more people to appreciate the self-employed and the work they do.",19,385,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00385
2013-03-06-T-005,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"It is equally important that we adopt the right mindset towards such career options and create the right working environment for them to thrive. Their jobs, whether as taxi drivers, adult educators or other forms of freelance work, must be considered as a viable long-term career.

When Singapore proclaimed its Independence in 1965, one of the aims in the proclamation was to ""seek the welfare and happiness of her people, in a more just and equal society."" Reading this Budget brought that aspiration to mind, as it seemed that many of the measures in this Budget are geared towards building a more just and equal society in this modern age, with the welfare and happiness of the people in mind.",1,408,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00408

This is something that we take for granted in many ways, but, at that time, it had to be fought for. Now, over the decades, since Singapore's Independence, Singapore has prospered. Equality of opportunities has allowed many people to benefit, some more than others. Unfortunately, over the years, equality of opportunities often means inequality of outcomes. This has led to the current situation where we have rising income and wealth inequalities in Singapore.",2,409,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00409
2013-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"One big danger of this inequality of outcomes, in rising income and wealth disparities, is that it may lead to inequality of opportunities as well, if the children of the wealth-off have better chances, while the children of those who are less well-off do not have as many good opportunities.",3,410,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00410

2013-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"In that respect, I support many of the measures in this Budget. I think the broadly re-distributive themes are in the right direction. The property taxes are a very good way of capturing those who have wealth and who are enjoying it. At the same time, the higher distributions in terms of bigger workfare payments, as well as more generous GST Vouchers, are very good means of redistribution.",5,412,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00412

2013-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The first is childcare and child-raising. I think everyone in this House agrees that one of the biggest challenges that Singapore faces is how to improve our total fertility rate, what we can do to encourage more people to have children. Certainly, in my ward, which is a much younger estate, there are many families with children. One of the biggest challenges that many of them raised to me is that getting childcare is difficult and very expensive.",8,415,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00415
2013-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"In that sense, I certainly welcome the expansion of childcare and student care benefits in this Budget, as well as greater subsidies for pre-school education. I also welcome the reduced levy on foreign domestic workers – they can also help with the child-raising. But perhaps, aspirationally, we could go even further in this respect. If we look at Primary and Secondary education, the philosophy we have always taken is that the large chunk of the cost of Primary and Secondary education should be borne by the state, with parents paying a certain amount of fees. The fees are never enough to pay for the whole cost, but the parents would, by and large, pay something so that they still value the service.",9,416,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00416
2013-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"As a matter of philosophy, it might be helpful if we did this for childcare as well. What this means is that we will be socialising the cost of childcare a great deal more and taking away the burden from individual families. This means parents will pay a certain amount, but it will not necessarily be in the hundreds of dollars. If we want to maintain the cost, we could make it something token. For lower income families, this already happens. Those who pay $5 or $20 a month for childcare are very happy. But this does not apply to the majority of the households. There is a hope for socialising the cost of child-raising even more, and providing more subsidised childcare for middle income families.",10,417,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00417
2013-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Another aspect in many people's mind for the young working adults is, ""What are my prospects going to be like at work? What is going to happen?"" A big concern here is what happens when we have rising numbers of foreign workers coming in. In this respect, the measures that increase the levies and tighten the quotas on both S Pass and Work Permit holders are welcomed, especially by lower income Singaporeans, who might feel that they are facing competition from them. As I mentioned in my previous speech for the White Paper debate, there is also scope for expanding this protection to Employment Pass holders, perhaps introducing some method of labour market testing, or even restricting the numbers. I am glad that there seems to be some steps in this direction made in the Budget as well. This is a measure that I would support.",11,418,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00418
2013-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),SMEs are another important area that need a lot of support. I welcome a lot of the schemes that are in place in this Budget. I have filed COS cuts on these and I will take that up in more detail in the next session. SMEs do employ a very substantial part of our workforce and it is necessary for us to make sure that any workforce restructuring we do still keeps their interests in mind.,12,419,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00419
2013-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Now, let me deal with the third element that is big on the minds of many of these young Singaporeans and, that is, healthcare. A lot of the young working families tell me that they are stuck with paying very expensive cost for child raising. At the same time, they may have elderly parents staying with them and are concerned about what happens if their parents suddenly fall ill. For a lot of low-income families, there are very substantial subsidies for healthcare. But for middle income families, especially when means testing takes place, this may not be as generous, and the middle income families may be forced to make more serious trade-offs, in terms of what they can and cannot do. This again places a greater burden on the middle income families.",13,420,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00420
2013-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Aspirationally, could we provide healthcare that would be substantially cheaper for a large majority of the population after they reach a certain age? I understand that the current measures that expand Medisave and Medifund are in the right direction. This could be one means of doing it. Another way of doing it would be to expand the coverage of MediShield and include a larger amount of conditions in that and reduce exclusions.",14,421,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00421
2013-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),I recognise all these measures would obviously mean much greater Government spending in the upcoming years. I could deal with that in a while.,15,422,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00422
2013-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"One more aspect, since we are being aspirational, that I would like to discuss is housing. Again, a number of middle income families have told me that while they would like to have bigger families, it would be nice if there were bigger flats available and the specific request was flats with more rooms – four bedrooms or five bedrooms. One couple was telling me that they have two children – one is a boy and one is a girl – and the husband's parents. So, the parents take one room, he and his wife take one room, and there is one more bedroom for the children. It gets a bit awkward, as the boy and girl get older, for them to share the room. I guess in the past, we may have been more prepared to have more children sharing rooms and so on, but I guess, as Singaporeans get wealthier, their aspirations rise. I guess they would like to have more comfortable housing options available, too.",16,423,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00423
2013-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"As long as we can build flats higher, one more option might be to actually provide larger flats for people to buy. If we want to restrict these to families that are growing, we could even say that these flats are only available for those who are upgrading so that you will not have a lot of first-timers going towards them. Those who have a bigger family who wish to take in their parents within the flat would have that option, too.",17,424,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00424
2013-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Having mentioned a lot of measures which I think will probably add to the strain on Government finances, it is probably responsible to mention a little bit on the revenue front as well. Most Members in this House can see lots of areas where additional Government spending would be helpful, but the big challenge we face is where are we going to raise all these revenues from? I think there are some options we could look at.",18,425,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00425
2013-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The first is revenue from Government land sales. At the moment, most revenue from Government land sales goes into the reserves and all we are allowed to spend is the income from it. Now, this, in a sense, appeals to one's innate sense of responsibility because when we sell away land, it may have a 30-year lease or 99-year lease and it would be irresponsible to spend everything in one year. But if you look at a lot of the Government spending, a lot of it also involves investment. So, for example, if you are investing in infrastructure, if you are building hospitals, these also have a long lifespan. Certainly, in Hong Kong, government land sales are recognised as part of government revenue and used for annual spending. So, if we need more spending, this may be one option by which we can raise the revenues.",19,426,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00426
2013-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Another option is to look at using a larger proportion of our net investment income for our yearly spending. At the moment, we use about 50%. I think there is potential to use a much larger proportion of this, provided that we account for inflation. This, again, would give us more options for fiscal spending.",20,427,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00427
2013-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"And, finally, of course, taxation. If we provide a society where we can say that we will socialise the cost of childcare, socialise the cost of medicine even more, then people might even be prepared to pay higher taxes if they do not have to worry about these costs on an individual basis. I guess this is a question that we can look at if the numbers require it.",21,428,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00428
2013-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Overall, I think this Budget is a very good Budget because it goes towards helping us create a more just and equal society and to look after the welfare of the people. But I think there is more we can do in terms of reducing the significant cost pressures the middle income faces.",22,429,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00429
2013-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"One last point that I should probably make is, as a matter of philosophy, what this also means is that we will probably be growing our reserves at a less aggressive rate because we will be having less revenues going in from land sales, and less of a proportion of our net investment income. But, personally, I think this is something that I am comfortable with because, if we look at where we are in our stage of development, we are probably looking at a stage where the Baby Boomers will be growing older up to 2030. So, we are looking at a stage of exceptional spending for, maybe, the next 17 years or so. But after that, if we actually see a declining population, we may not actually need such substantial reserves. So, if we look at breakeven, that means balancing the budget and not seeing our reserves diminish substantially over the next 17 years, I think we would be in a fiscally responsible position as well. I certainly hope that in the upcoming years we can be more generous in extending our social safety nets and that we can still continue to balance our finances in the way we have always done.",23,430,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00430

Apart from this, five out of the 12 items on the Chamber's Pre-Budget Wish-List submitted at the end of December 2012 had also been responded to positively. These include strengthening, streamlining and broadening the Productivity and Innovation Credit Scheme (PIC), reducing transport costs, lowering the corporate income tax rate, establishing a three-year Transition Support Package similar to an ""Economic Restructuring Grant"" which we had proposed and extending the scope of the Job Flexibility for Productivity (JFP) initiative.",4,434,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00434
2013-03-06-T-005,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng,"In order to build a better Singapore and help enterprises during this period of economic restructuring, the Government has rolled out a three-year package of incentives worth $5.3 billion. Integral to this is the Wage Credit Scheme (WCS). This would not only help to increase the salary of local employees, but help to reduce companies' wage costs, with benefits to both employees and employers.",5,435,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00435
2013-03-06-T-005,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng,"However, we would still urge employers to strengthen their communication with workers, and help them to fully understand the integral connection between the growth of an enterprise and driving up productivity, to manage the unrealistic expectations of workers on wage increases. For example, if a company had originally wanted to increase its worker's pay by $100 and the Singapore worker knows that the Government will co-fund 40% of the increase, he may hope to get a higher wage increase of $166. The scope of the Wage Credit Scheme needs to be more closely examined. It would only apply to those workers who earn up to $48,000 in gross annual wages, including bonus, that is, $3,000-plus in gross monthly wages. It would not apply to those who earn gross monthly wages of $4,000. Other than this, the WCS is applicable only to Singaporeans. When a company increases its wages, it should also consider the performance of its non-Singaporean employees. Businesses should, therefore, proceed with caution in utilising this scheme and wage increases have to be linked to productivity growth. Otherwise, they would not be able to withstand the pressures of higher labour costs after the scheme expires in three years' time.",6,436,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00436

2013-03-06-T-005,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng,"Two, liberalise the space utilisation for neighbourhood shophouses, allowing SMEs, and especially micro-enterprises, some flexibility for restructuring.",9,439,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00439
2013-03-06-T-005,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng,"Three, during the process of economic restructuring, there should be greater coordination amongst different Government agencies, in order to solve speedily any difficulties encountered by SMEs and micro-enterprises. This would also ensure that Singapore's culture and core values have an opportunity to thrive.",10,440,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00440
2013-03-06-T-005,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng,"On my first point, last week, local car dealers experienced a ""tsunami"", with announcements in the Budget and from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The immediate curbs on car loans have been very unsettling for the industry and its customers. On the afternoon of 25 February, the new Budget announced the introduction of a tiered Additional Registration Fee structure with higher ARF for luxury cars. On that same evening, the Monetary Authority of Singapore suddenly announced that, with immediate effect, the maximum motor vehicle loan amount would be reduced to 50% or 60%, depending on Open Market Value, and the tenure of a motor vehicle loan will be capped at five years. The Singapore Vehicle Traders Association (SVTA) and the Automobile Importers and Exporters Association (AIEA) quickly approached our Chamber to give us their feedback on the three big challenges the car dealers would have to deal with as a result of these cooling measures.",11,441,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00441
2013-03-06-T-005,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng,"The first challenge  what would happen to new cars which have already been ordered? Based on the market trend, car dealers have already ordered their cars from suppliers to meet their sales targets for 2013 and paid up a 20% deposit. Those new cars delivered to Singapore would already attract import duty. With such immediate cooling measures, car dealers would have to honour their orders and cannot possibly pull out.",12,442,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00442
2013-03-06-T-005,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng,"The second challenge  what would happen to the 20,000 used cars in the used car market? The value of the used car stock amounts to $1 billion. All along, the used car market has been patronised by the working class. These curbs would have an effect on those families which really need cars as a mode of transportation. In general, car dealers would buy used cars from the car owners and apply for floor stock financing from the banks to help with their cash flow. With these newly introduced cooling measures, car dealers need a longer time to offload their used cars, translating to higher costs for the interest payable.",13,443,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00443
2013-03-06-T-005,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng,"The third challenge  what would happen to the Used Car Centre which has been leased and renovated not long ago? As an assistance to their members, the SVTA had signed a three-year lease (2012-2014) with the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) for the MacKenzie Used Car Centre. The association has invested $700,000 into renovating the place. Immediately after the cooling measures were announced, SVTA received calls from some car dealers that due to the bleak market outlook, they would be pulling out from the Used Car Centre.",14,444,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00444
2013-03-06-T-005,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng,"SVTA offered three suggestions. Firstly, could the Government consider applying the financial restrictions to new cars and not the used cars? Such cooling measures would not only control buyers but cut off the lifeline of the car dealers. This would cause severe damage to the entire industry. Could the Government consider waiving the financing curbs for car importers? Secondly, could the Government's cooling measures be implemented progressively? If the Monetary Authority of Singapore could give a six-month to 12-month grace period, car dealers could have some respite and probably sufficient time to deal with their stock. Thirdly, could relevant Government agencies offer assistance schemes to tide over this critical period for the car dealers? If banks and financial institutions react to these curbs by raising interest rates, some 1,000 car dealers would suffer heavy financial burdens, and the consequences would be devastating.",15,445,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00445
2013-03-06-T-005,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng,"If different Government agencies were to tighten their policies at the same time, this would definitely add to the burden of the car dealers. This can be likened to patients in the hospital who may be treated by a number of doctors. If each doctor treats the patient without communication or coordination with each other, the patient could receive injections from each of the doctors. Each injection, while intending to help the patient, may cause the patient's condition to become critical. SVTA hopes that relevant Government agencies, such as MOF, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, SLA, MOT and LTA could organise joint dialogues to coordinate on their respective policies to prevent the situation from becoming worse.",16,446,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00446
2013-03-06-T-005,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng,"I have asked SVTA why the dialogues needed to include SLA. They said that since the Used Car Centre was set up, they have to sign leases every year with SLA and this process did not pose any problems. However, starting from last year, SLA started to implement a bidding system. SVTA had no choice but to pay a four-fold increase in rental to keep the lease, for the benefit of their members. With the immediate cooling measures, some used car dealers are unable to cope. The entire industry has entered a crisis situation. While we support the Government's economic restructuring policy, we also hope to help our member companies solve their urgent problems.",17,447,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00447
2013-03-06-T-005,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng,"The second point I wish to make is that local SMEs need to make every effort to restructure within this new environment. However, some micro-enterprises face numerous difficulties in the process. I refer to the case of some small businesses operating in 2-storey neighbourhood shophouses with living quarters under HDB. Prior to mid-2012, HDB had allowed bakery and cake shops to do cake decoration and icing, and store their cakes in refrigerators within the air-conditioned area on the second storey. Then, from mid-2012, due to Hygiene and Fire Safety reasons, the second storey of the shophouse was no longer permitted for such activities and could only be used for the intended purposes as ""living quarters"". Neighbourhood shops, when renewing their licences, have to strictly observe the rules imposed by HDB, SCDF and the National Environmental Agency.",18,448,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00448
2013-03-06-T-005,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng,"The monthly rental for a neighbourhood shophouse in a central location averages $10,000, and other business costs are also on the rise. Added to this, Government agencies control the usage of commercial space. The small industry players are like hairy crabs with all legs tied up and with no room to move. Although the Government has been promoting the use of shared services for the industry, using outsourcing services and establishing central kitchens to improve productivity, cakes made from the same mould and thus look and taste the same would not be appealing to consumers or retailers. Thus, many of these shops which are affected by the new rulings would rather give up their bakery business.",19,449,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00449
2013-03-06-T-005,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng,"Micro-enterprises are the most affected by economic restructuring. They are too small to benefit from automation. Insufficient capital limits their expansion. Even if they want to expand their operations, they need to move out of the existing small premises. Food manufacturers suggest that the Government set up a public cold storage facility in the food industry zone, which can be rented out to smaller factories. This would allow existing factories to free up some space, purchase automated equipment and raise the productivity of the whole industry.",20,450,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00450
2013-03-06-T-005,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng,"Thirdly, to recap the above examples, we would suggest that, going forward, at certain crucial stages of economic restructuring, Government agencies need to intensify their mutual coordination efforts and work together. At the same time, under the tightened foreign worker policy, we hope Government agencies could streamline some of the over-stringent Government rules and create a more pro-business environment for the economic restructuring measures to truly benefit the industry. Twelve years ago, the Government established a Pro-Enterprise Panel (PEP) and we hope that the PEP could make its role even more useful and beneficial at this time.",21,451,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00451
2013-03-06-T-005,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng,"Two thousand thirteen is a year of reform for local enterprises and a major operation is needed before the process of economic restructuring can be completed. We are willing to help member companies to meet this enormous challenge, and hope that with constant dialogue and interaction between Government and business, we could reduce the risk of this big operation. If this operation succeeds, it would give business a new lease of life. If it fails, businesses would be in dire straits. Hence, the only option is to cooperate and brainstorm over how to succeed.",22,452,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00452
2013-03-06-T-005,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng,"At the same time, during this period of economic restructuring, we should not ignore Singapore's unique character and traits, which consists of many small components. Those small shops which line the big streets and small alleys are also part of Singapore's cultural heritage and form part of our core values. We want to improve on our effectiveness and productivity, but we should not do it at the expense of culture and tradition. Over the years, large malls have become a part of the retail landscape, with each mall having many similar shops selling the same merchandise and providing the same services. There is hardly any space left for SMEs and micro-enterprises. I am concerned that if these enterprises are not able to survive, our city would also lose a part of its vibrancy and part of Singapore's unique charm.",23,453,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00453
2013-03-06-T-005,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng,"Going forward, the Chamber will be doing its utmost to help its trade association members pursue productivity-led growth, as well as to preserve its original character. Hong Kong is also facing an ageing population and encounters the same pressures of escalating rentals. However, not only can their retail, services, food and beverage industry and other SMEs and micro-enterprises survive; they are also extremely resilient and vibrant. There must be a reason for their success. We have already led groups of local enterprises to Taiwan on study missions. This year, the Chamber plans to organise study trips for local SMEs to visit Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea to understand and learn from their SMEs. Singapore enterprises need to learn how they survive and obtain some experience, and hope that the answers would be forthcoming. I hope that when the Government rolls out policies which are related to SMEs, they could also do appropriate research and learn from the practical experience of other regions. What they can do, we can, too! Having said this, I support Budget 2013.",24,454,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00454
2013-03-06-T-005,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the Budget. Let me first begin, Madam, by looking outside of our little red dot. The world economy as we know it is still very much in flux. Unemployment and underemployment rates remain high globally. In the Euro area alone, unemployment in January of this year was 11.9%; simply put, 19 million people are out of job in Europe.",1,455,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00455
2013-03-06-T-005,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"The young are not immune from the impact of economic slowdowns. The International Labour Organization (ILO) projects that young people are three times more likely to be unemployed than adults, and, currently, over 75 million youths are looking for work.

As we aspire for a better Singapore, as this Budget calls for, as we grow qualitatively and build an inclusive society, let us not forget that our youths are not just beneficiaries of a better future Singapore but are also co-owners, co-builders and co-drivers as well. The future cannot be shaped in a vacuum; the future generations of Singaporeans must have a hand in the future success of our country. It is none more important than to ensure that they have a fair chance of being more than just building blocks, but co-creators of growth.",6,460,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00460

2013-03-06-T-005,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"Firstly, a fair employment market for our young job entrants. One of the biggest stumbling blocks for our fresh job seekers is what I call an ""experience trap"". A significant number of young graduates that I spoke to recently, expressed their disillusionment at a lack of opportunity. This seemingly runs counter to the employees' market that we are supposed to be experiencing.",10,464,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00464
2013-03-06-T-005,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"The hurdle, simply put, is that employers require minimum years of experience for applicants to get a job. It is an oxymoronic situation.

2013-03-06-T-005,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"Contract work and long-term internships are also becoming the norm. A recent article in the New York Times on 1 March was titled ""The No-Limits Job"". It alluded to the fact that the notion of traditional entry-level jobs are fast disappearing. In its place are longer hours and less job security. In addition, the concept of a 22-22-22 worker is emerging. And no, it is not a Toto combination, but meaning a 22-year-old who is willing to work 22 hours a day earning just $22,000 a year. This is a frightening proposition.",12,466,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00466
2013-03-06-T-005,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"I urge the Government to consider more measures for young job entrants to better protect them over the next three years. I agree with the hon Member Mr Patrick Tay that protecting a Singaporean Core for PMEs, especially for young PMEs, through robust labour market testing may be required. But I also urge that young job entrants get a fair deal and fair employment, that they are not taken advantage of, in terms of pay or benefits; that they are better educated of their employment terms and be work-ready even when completing their education.",13,467,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00467

The Singaporean workers want to see not just a better Singapore, but rather they want to be able to say that we the Singaporeans made it happen. Yes, Singaporean workers recognise and the Labour Movement recognises that the Singaporean Core does not equal to Singaporeans only.

More than 90% of the countries in this world have already adopted minimum wage. So, Singapore belongs to the minority. Why is it so? Minimum wage as a policy has its upside and its downside. The limitation of minimum wage is that if you want to maximise the upside, then there will be more downside as well. If you want to minimise the downside, then the upside will be limited as well. So, in other words, minimum wage can be a zero-sum game. You cannot have high upside and at the same time, low downside.",10,500,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00500

In the case of USA, for example, they have a minimum wage. At the same time, they have an income tax credit, similar to our WIS. In the case of Australia, they implement minimum wage sector by sector.

Yesterday, Mr Zainal suggested that we can go beyond accreditation. Can we go for licensing? If we were to go for licensing, then, effectively, we have put in place a minimum wage system, sector by sector and, on top of that, WIS, WTS and on top of that, not just minimum wage but a wage ladder. So, a cleaner need not be stuck at the minimum wage of $1,000, as advocated in the Progressive Wage Model.

Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Mr Tharman announced the three-year transition support package. As a Labour Movement, we are very encouraged by this package. Over the last week or so, since the announcement of the package, the most discussed component in the transition support package is the Wage Credit Scheme (WCS).

If the market is tighter, the employers will typically grant greater wage increases. So, these are very normal market forces at work. However, given our present situation of a tight labour market and the expected tight labour market over the next few years, our assessment is that, on the ground, many employers, especially SMEs, will find themselves having no choice but to grant somehow a wage increase to the workers.",18,508,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00508

So, no wage increase means no Wage Credit Scheme. Of course, it is not an option open to companies, including SMEs. But for these companies and SMEs, I am very sure that many of them are fully aware that it can be a risky move in the tight labour market because you could end up losing your workers – not able to attract new ones, and may not be able to retain the existing ones.",19,509,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00509

So, if the SMEs grant $50, they can claim back $20 from the WCS, so their cost has come down to $30. If they grant $100, then $60, and $40 from the WCS. However, if these companies adopt the attitude that they just make use of the WCS to lower their wage cost without doing anything different – the job is still the same, the skill is still the same, and the operation is still the same, then at the end of the three years, they will be back to square one, because nothing has changed. The operation is still the same. Like what the Chinese say  ""一寸光阴一寸金，寸金难买寸光阴"".  In other words, yes, you can make use of WCS for the next three years, but what is even more precious is that you would have missed the opportunities to upgrade and enhance in these three years. At the end of three years, if the companies are back to square one, I think they will face even greater challenges.",20,510,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00510

Given such a situation, a wise and logical thing to do obviously is to try to break this manpower bottleneck by making best use of every worker and every person. For example, making best use of every worker could mean giving everyone and every worker the best opportunities and do the best to reward them. For the younger and better educated workers, over the next five to 10 years, we are going to see the majority of the workers becoming PMEs. Like what labour Member Alex Yam mentioned, many workers of today aspire to be future-ready. They look forward to the factories and services of the future. When Deputy Prime Minister Tharman announced the future of manufacturing plan, I was actually very excited. It was not discussed much in this sitting of Parliament. But in my view, it is the kind of incentive, programme and initiative that would bring Singapore to the next stage of development, creating all these exciting opportunities for the workers of today and tomorrow to really enable them to rise to their full potential.",22,512,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00512

If the job is a second-world job today, upgrade the second-world job to a first-world job. And from the third-world to second-world, and eventually to the first-world. So, we believe that is the best way we can break this manpower bottleneck. I am happy to say that within the unionised sector, we are, in fact, seeing more and more companies adopting this concept. We now have more and more companies – from aerospace to hotels to F&B and so on.

Of course, for many SMEs, one of the challenges they face is that you can invest in your productivity today, but it may take another one or two years before you realise the gain. In the meantime, what do you do? In fact, this is where the Wage Credit Scheme comes in. Because with the Wage Credit Scheme, the Government is now co-funding the sharing of the productivity gain, even before the gain is fully realised by the companies. We really hope that more companies will make full use of the PIC, WCS and all the other programmes to ensure that they can invest in productivity gain and share the gain.",24,514,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00514

With manpower as the bottleneck, I am a lot more confident now that more and more companies will take this transformation towards a productivity-driven, innovation-driven economy a lot more seriously. We hope that enough companies will come forward so that we can look ahead into the future whereby more and more companies will be able to compete for customers by offering products and services which are cheaper, better and faster, and yet at the same time, able to attract, retain and reward the workers with better jobs and better pay.",26,516,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00516

This is done carefully this year through what the Deputy Prime Minister calls the wealth tax – higher taxes on luxury cars and non-owner–occupied properties. Madam, we can see taxes of this nature as penalising the wealthy or, worse, discouraging hard work. But I urge those who are affected to see it in a different light.

Persons earning above $500,000 to $1 million taxable income to contribute 1%, and an additional 1% for every $500,000 additional income bracket up to a maximum of 25%.

It is not a surprise that Singapore real estate investment trusts (REITs), including retail REITs, remain a darling amongst the financial analysts. 2012 was a bumper year for them. OCBC, in fact, recently reported that looking into 2013, the sector offers the highest yield spreads compared to other major markets, with very positive outlook and financial position. But it is a known fact that many SMEs and even private food court stallholders have been suffering from the seemingly uncontrolled spiral increases in rental. Rental hikes that run way ahead of GDP have been the bane of businesses. If allowed to continue, rental increases will put out not only current small businesses but also extinguish the flames of small businesses of the future. Even good online business models need warehousing real estate. MAS should install cooling measures and place a cap on the REITs' rental income rates.

Unless the numerous productivity incentives, grants, and support packages yield tangible results, many SMEs, including those with potential, will exit, leaving a major negative impact on jobs and workers.

After settling the administrative costs, how much can he be left with? We think that HDB flats were never meant to be an asset, an investment portfolio, a retirement fund.

There is no room for error when paying off a home loan – unforeseen circumstances, such as retrenchment – especially when one is also providing for one's children. Needless to say, the hurdle for landed properties and cars is even higher. If we had our way, population should never increase beyond a critical point. We believe the critical point is 5 million to 6 million. Other cities have suburbs and a hinterland as a buffer. On weekends, you can take a retreat to these places. During holidays, you could move back to your home. In Singapore, we cannot, and this leads to an increased stress level for our commuters.

I wish to frame our situation in what I think as an appropriate context.",11,645,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00645
2013-03-06-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"This Government has put us in a strong fiscal position because it has exhibited prudence and sound management at every turn. We are fortunate not to be in a fiscal mess that some other governments have gotten themselves into, especially in the West. The political climate in these countries has thus made it fashionable to make the rich pay more taxes and attack big bonuses. Examples abound in proposals for the Buffet Tax in the US, a 75% super tax in France, EU and Swiss proposals to cap bonuses. We should not let this currently fashionable thinking influence our own approach, because our finances are sound and even reserves that were used in the worst recession in recent memory were promptly returned the very next year.",12,646,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00646
2013-03-06-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"I do, however, agree with progressive taxation. Deputy Prime Minister Tharman introduced the concept of progressive property and vehicle taxes being a wealth tax and described it as an efficient tax. I agree with the Deputy Prime Minister.",13,647,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00647
2013-03-06-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"I would like to go further by arguing that our existing tax structure is already progressive. Only the top 20% of income earners currently pay any form of income tax. GST-Plus implements a permanent GST Voucher Scheme and, in this year's Budget, a one-off GST Voucher Special Payment which mitigates what superficially appears to be a regressive tax. And in the 2011 Budget, the tax burden of the middle class was lessened.",14,648,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00648
2013-03-06-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"There is always a cost to increasing taxes. Nothing is free. In an age of flexi-work arrangements, high-speed computer connectivity and easy air travel, it is no longer inconceivable to be doing one's work lying on a beach somewhere else. With globalisation, the competitive advantages that we try to put up in the form of creating an eco-system around our industries, ease of doing business and high-quality living are getting less and less compelling. The marginal increases in taxes from a high rate might not be more than the marginal decrease from an exodus. We might end up with a smaller tax pie instead; and in the process, also succeed in decreasing our incentive to work.",15,649,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00649
2013-03-06-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),I hope the Government will consider any structural changes to the current tax system very carefully.,16,650,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00650
2013-03-06-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"Mr Deputy Speaker, as we set ourselves up for the next stage of development in our economy, I would like to voice support for the Government's prudence in taking a measured and calibrated approach with regards to the speed of restructuring.",17,651,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00651
2013-03-06-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),Is Singapore heading in the right direction to restructure our economy with an emphasis on productivity? The logic of this approach cannot be in doubt. It is the only way to maintain high quality and sustainable growth. The question really is  are we doing it too fast or too slow?,18,652,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00652
2013-03-06-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"The Government is very mindful of seeking the right balance between helping SMEs to restructure by relying less on labour, but at the same time, not to the extent of choking off the oxygen that keeps these SMEs afloat. With a comprehensive set of measures outlined in the three-year Transition Support Package, I am confident that the Government will succeed in meeting its objectives.",19,653,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00653
2013-03-06-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"The centrepiece of this year's Budget is the $3.6 billion Wage Credit Scheme. I am especially appreciative of this scheme as it is a very good example of unconventional thinking. The Wage Credit Scheme achieves two main objectives, and they are to help businesses mitigate costs and uplift incomes of Singaporean workers, while at the same time, leaving efficient allocation of resources to the market.",20,654,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00654
2013-03-06-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"This scheme, in my view, is superior to a minimum wage scheme because it minimises distortionary effects to the economy. If businesses are in a position to raise wages, Government will step in with help. If businesses are not in a position, then workers will leave to more efficient and profitable businesses to work. Businesses will also have to think hard between employing a foreign worker versus using those resources to encourage the local worker to be more productive.",21,655,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00655
2013-03-06-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"But the point is that, in all these scenarios, the worker benefits from being in a position to achieve a higher wage. The wage increase would go directly to him. And businesses are given help for three years to restructure their operations.",22,656,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00656
2013-03-06-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),I hope the Government will look into improving the efficacy and implementation of the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) Scheme. Anecdotal evidence from businesses suggests that disbursements of PIC benefits can be bureaucratic and slow moving.,23,657,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00657
2013-03-06-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"For example, a business owner cannot receive a claim if he presents an electronic receipt instead of a paper one, or that a business owner has to wait for six months to receive a claim which might have helped to ease his cash flow. I believe this Government has the ability to solve these teething problems in PIC, especially when I look at how efficient the automatic process is in the payout of Wage Credits.",24,658,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00658
2013-03-06-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"It is critical that the Government extends its support for Continuing Education and Training (CET) to facilitate workers, especially older workers 45 years and above, to acquire the skill sets to remain as productive stakeholders in the restructured economy. With skills getting obsolete ever so quickly on the back of globalisation, providing continuing education must be emphasised just as much as pre-employment education.",25,659,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00659
2013-03-06-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"Restructuring of the economy is necessarily painful. The process of Schumpeter's creative destruction will mean that some less efficient businesses get displaced. This would also mean that workers, especially older workers who have been in those displaced industries, find that their skill sets unsuitable for newer, more modern industries.",26,660,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00660
2013-03-06-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),Commitment to education has always been a core value of this Government. I hope this commitment will be extended to older workers who might be structurally displaced. Not only will this help them to remain economically productive and reduce the state's burden in providing welfare; it will also aid in social cohesion as it reduces a layer of discontent from the unemployed or underemployed who are often vocal with their angst.,27,661,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00661
2013-03-06-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"To this end, I welcome the Government's initiatives at Workfare Training Support and the $500 million topping up of the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund. But I hope that the Government can do more.",28,662,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00662
2013-03-06-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"First, I hope the Government can consider an annual spending target on CET equivalent to a certain percentage of GDP, similar to how MOE targets spending on pre-employment education. Second, I hope CET can offer vocational courses with more rigour; for example, diplomas in mechanical engineering or aerospace engineering via modular courses in our ITEs and Polytechnics. Third, I hope enrolment for CET programmes will consider job experience and existing skills, and not just be solely based on prior academic qualifications. Fourth, I hope MOE can work closely with MOM and industry associations to identify possible ways of collaboration and to bring about more awareness to these programmes.",29,663,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00663
2013-03-06-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I made a case for Singapore's SMEs to emulate Germany's Mittelstands in last year's Budget Debate. I applaud the Government for putting in place a comprehensive set of measures in this year's Budget for our SMEs to close the gap with the Mittelstands. However, I would also like to ask the Government to consider publishing statistics on a regular basis on how we fare in terms of productivity as compared to the most globally competitive companies in each industry sector, so as to create an awareness of what is humanly possible and also to encourage the adoption of best practices to help our SMEs ascend the productivity ladder. On this note, Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Budget.",30,664,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00664

We will never do anything quite like it, at least we hope not to. Even decades later, we talk about it with friends. It brands us as Singaporeans.

2013-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Last month, I wrote a series of posts on my Facebook page suggesting that we impose a national defence tax on non-citizens as a way of sharpening distinctions between citizens and non-citizen residents, and using the proceeds to benefit NSmen. I was happy that my posts sparked a lively debate. It brought into focus the larger issues of whether Singaporeans, new citizens, PRs and foreigners are successfully integrating in our society and the implications for us if they do not. The problem, I think, is that we have largely dealt with these issues on a superficial level.",3,667,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00667
2013-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),I would like to share with this House some things I have been told online and in person in the course of the debate. I believe they represent the views of a good number of Singaporeans. They raise serious issues which I hope the Government will look into.,4,668,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00668
2013-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"First, many Singaporeans recognise and appreciate the contributions of new citizens, PRs and foreigners. They have no desire to discriminate against them. They acknowledge that this country would not be the success it is without their contributions.",5,669,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00669
2013-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Second, many want to see new citizens and PRs genuinely integrate better with Singaporeans and be part of our society. We want them to demonstrate that they regard this land as their home; that they believe in our cause; and that they, too, have a stake in Singapore's future. What grates most on our nerves is the thought of those who seek the privilege of citizenship and permanent residency do so purely out of convenience or economic gain, and that they will abandon us at the slightest risk or sign of trouble.",6,670,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00670
2013-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"That is why National Service is such an emotional topic. Doing National Service, or giving an undertaking that your son will do National Service, is a tangible demonstration of that commitment. Many talk about shedding blood, sweat and tears. But it means more than that. It forges a common bond which is unique to us and, in some ways, helps define who we are. There is also a real financial sacrifice. For men from poorer Singaporean households, it means two years of earning a nominal allowance when they could have joined the workforce and helped supplement the family income. So, it disturbs us when we perceive others avoiding NS by playing fast and loose with the rules and taking easy rides in the system. That is the true cheapening of National Service.",7,671,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00671
2013-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Thirdly, most demand that those liable to do NS must perform their duty. It is not enough that NS-dodgers pay a penalty and are barred from returning to Singapore. We would rather that they stay and serve with us. But we must accept the reality that some PRs will arrange for their sons to leave when they reach a certain age. Not a single person who has posted or given their views believes that the current sanctions against this are adequate.",8,672,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00672
2013-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"That is why I proposed the National Defence duty − as a practical response to a practical problem. We cannot force people to remain in Singapore who do not want to stay here. But we can make it so costly that they would think twice or three times before taking PR status or arranging for their child to dodge NS. As with all proposals, some liked it; some criticised it; some felt it did not go far enough. Some even accused me of proposing that PRs who were liable for NS be allowed to pay their way out of their obligation. Of course, I never made any such suggestion. But one thing most appeared to agree on  something needs to be done. The status quo will not do.",9,673,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00673

2013-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Firstly, at a macro level, we need to explain better the importance of keeping Singapore an open society with an open economy. ""Singaporeans first"" does not and cannot mean ""Singaporeans regardless"". These issues are complicated and, frankly, we do not do a good job of explaining things. This is sad because we have such a compelling story to tell. Neither will the approach that people should trust us because we know what we are doing works. We cannot take the people's trust for granted.",11,675,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00675
2013-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Secondly, we need to convince Singaporeans that Singaporeans remain central to Singapore and its future. This year's Budget takes a step in that direction. More is being done to help members of our Singapore family who are in need of more help – increasing incomes for low-wage workers; securing their children a better education; helping the elderly age with more dignity. More is being done to share the prosperity that Singapore has achieved. We become a better, stronger society when the lot of all Singaporeans are improved.",12,676,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00676
2013-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Thirdly, while foreigners and PRs are important, we must also demonstrate that there are privileges in being a citizen. We have thus far largely dealt with this on a piece-meal basis, with different Ministries announcing changes or measures at different times, whether it is securing places in Primary schools, differentiating medical fees or property ownership. We should have a comprehensive review of all these measures and look at how we can make changes on a fair and principled basis. Some have said that such a move would be xenophobic. By that definition, any privilege given to a citizen is xenophobic. Of course, it is not. It is legitimate for a government to draw distinctions between citizens and non-citizens. In any case, I firmly believe that most Singaporeans are not xenophobic. But they are genuinely unhappy because of perceived unfairness of treatment. We, in this House, need to address this squarely and rationally because if we ignore this, this only gives cause and strength to the less rational voices.",13,677,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00677
2013-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Fourthly, we should review our approach to granting citizenship and permanent residency. It has to be more than just satisfying criteria or completing forms. I have a constituent who is a Singapore Citizen. His wife is a Malaysian, gave birth to their son in Malaysia and the boy became a Malaysian citizen. The boy is now about 20 years old, not well educated but hard working and wants to improve himself. He has been working as a cook in Singapore for about two years on a work permit. The boy wants to live in Singapore with his Singaporean father, become a citizen and do NS. This is what he tells me. His application for PR has been rejected several times. Why? Not clear. Is it because of his lack of education? But he is the son of a Singaporean, who wants to live with his father and do NS, and does a job which Singaporeans apparently shun. Why do we regard him as less qualified to be here compared to sons of Permanent Residents, who may or may not choose to stay and do NS when they come of age?",14,678,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00678
2013-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Fifthly, we should have new citizens and PRs perform some form of compulsory service. If NS is not suitable by reason of age or other circumstances, other forms should be introduced. This can be for short periods annually, much like how Singaporean men do reservist training. The point is not to discourage foreigners from sinking their roots here, but to emphasise that they now have a stake in the country as well. One commenter on my Facebook page mooted the idea of having some of them serve in the Volunteer Special Constabulary (VSC). It is worth exploring. There are even practical benefits as it helps with the current manpower shortage in the Home Team. In fact, there are currently 52 Permanent Residents serving in the VSC on a voluntary basis. At a recent award and appreciation ceremony, I met one of them, Cpl (V) Yanase Yoshitaka, a Japanese who has lived here for 12 years. He is proud to serve in the VSC. He told me he wants to become a Singaporean. Others can do the same. Give them a chance. They may surprise us.",15,679,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00679
2013-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Finally, we need to have a more robust and effective response to those who undermine our efforts to integrate. I have spoken about PRs who send their sons away to avoid NS. We also need to deal with allegations that some employers favour hiring foreigners at the expense of Singaporeans, or retrench Singaporeans before releasing their foreign staff. This story is always different, depending on who you speak to – employers who say they cannot find Singaporeans despite their best attempts or that Singaporeans are unrealistic about pay and benefits; Singaporean employees who say they have been discriminated against because their employers want to hire cheaper foreigners or help their fellow nationals.",16,680,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00680

2013-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Some have mooted rules or laws to compel employers to prove that they cannot find Singaporeans before they are allowed to bring in a foreigner. We should find simple ways of doing this. For example, the CDCs and NTUC can help by offering a comprehensive job matching service, not just for low-income workers, but for PMETs as well. To make sure their efforts are sincere, we can have them certify that job matching has failed before an employer can make an application for a foreign worker. In this regard, an employer who has proven that he is unable to secure a Singaporean for a reasonable wage should be given some leeway to bring in foreign workers. For some industries, you can only improve productivity so far and workers are needed to keep the business going.",18,682,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00682

2013-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Deputy Speaker, integration is a long and complex journey. It was something that Singapore did very well. In one of my first speeches after becoming a Member of Parliament, I told of an encounter which made that clear to me. More than 20 years ago, in 1991, shortly after my final University examinations, I undertook a backpacking trip with some of my friends around Asia, the ASEAN countries. So, on a hot day in Bangkok, my two Chinese friends and I walked towards a street vendor selling drinks. Before we could open our mouth, he looked at us and said ""Singaporean"". We asked him, ""How did you know?"" And he said, ""Different colour, walk together; must be Singaporean."" We laughed at the incident but, you know, I have never felt prouder to be a Singaporean.

2013-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"We have lost our way somewhat on integration. It is not too late to get back on the right road. The Government must lead the national debate on immigration and integration. It should come up with a comprehensive package which Singaporeans, PRs and foreigners can accept as sound, compulsory community service, monetary and non-monetary measures, carrots and sticks. We should not avoid this sensitive topic, but embrace it as part of the evolution of our young country. It is a fallacy to think that a country can stand still, frozen in time and never change. Change is inevitable, and change can be a good thing, provided we manage this process fairly and rationally, involve Singaporeans and, most importantly, act in the interests of Singapore.",21,685,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00685

2013-03-06-T-005,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"Another reason for my suggestion, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, is my concern on reading reports in the press last year of the increasing incidence of elderly suicides. Many reasons may, of course, have contributed to this. However, I would be so bold as to say that the fast pace in which Singapore is changing and the loss of the places that were familiar to our elders, may well be contributing factors. After all, it is known medically that when a place that holds a deeply cherished memory disappears, a part of our psyche dies and we deeply grieve the loss and we are emotionally affected.

It struck me then that it might well have been a cathartic and healing process. I cannot help but feel that by acknowledging and validating their experiences, giving them as many opportunities to share as well as to give them a chance to earn an income for their time and effort, must surely go a long way in easing their sense of displacement and discomfort at a world turning too fast.",30,716,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00716
2013-03-06-T-005,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"Sir, this suggestion also ties in with the theme raised in the Budget of providing for flexi-work. I would therefore go further with this idea and extend it to homemakers who had grown up or are still living in such areas that I have mentioned before, and who may potentially have an interest and an untapped gift for story-telling of their childhood experiences in their neighbourhoods, who wish to obtain an income and still maintain their ability to manage their time and their families.",31,717,2013-03-06-T-005-S-00717

At the same time, we are facing a social evolution and emerging trends such as widening income inequality, infrastructure strain, particularly in the housing and transport sectors, as well as a changing social compact between the Government and people.",1,746,2013-03-06-T-007-S-00746

2013-03-06-T-007,Nicholas Fang,Mr Nicholas Fang (Nominated Member),"In this year's Budget, it was heartening to see that the poor also receive help as part of the drive to narrow income inequality in the country, with $1.7 billion in financial aid to be dispersed through various means, such as GST Vouchers, conservancy rebates and MediSave top-ups. The provision of such financial assistance is important as it will have a direct impact on Singaporeans trying to cope with the current challenging environment and also on closing the income gap. This is especially critical for those working at the lower rungs of the income ladder, who have seen little or no rise in real income over the past five years. But it will be important to see if these measures will enable wages of all Singaporeans to keep pace with the rising consumer prices which have been rising significantly in recent years. Many Singaporeans I have spoken to have expressed scepticism that this can be achieved.",6,751,2013-03-06-T-007-S-00751

While Singaporeans benefit indirectly from measures such as the increase in assistance in healthcare which will benefit those with aged parents, they also feel the squeeze from other policies like the new restrictions on car loans. I hope that future measures and policies will be able to offer more direct help to this large group of Singaporeans.",7,752,2013-03-06-T-007-S-00752

We are generally victims of our own success having been conditioned to aim for certain definitions of academic, financial and career successes, sometimes at the expense of other concerns. We are accustomed to social and economic policies that are effected through financial incentives and disincentives.

But it is also imperative for us to encourage the rest of society − individuals, schools and other institutions – to also support such individuals and activities by recognising the important role that sports and arts can play in creating a better quality of life and more fulfilling lives for Singaporeans. This will require a shift in our attitudes towards what is deemed as traditionally important – academic results, high salaries or soaring career trajectories – and other less tangible but no less important elements that feed the soul of a country. The need for the Government to balance this shift against the imperative to maintain the country's competitiveness and economic growth is yet another challenge to be managed in the on-going transition and transformation.",13,758,2013-03-06-T-007-S-00758

Meritocracy holds that individuals should be recognised and rewarded based on merit. It perceives intellectual talent as well as ability as measured through examination or demonstrated achievement. It has been a cornerstone of Singapore's growth story and the driving force behind many of our achievements. But it also encourages a very self-centred approach to life with one's own interests, progress and achievements – the key concern. This could then lead to, at best, an indifference to the plight of our neighbours and fellow Singaporeans and, in the worst case, a beggar-thy-neighbour outlook.",14,759,2013-03-06-T-007-S-00759

If we are unable to do this, then much of the effort now and in the future may be destined to fail to achieve the whole potential impact.

2013-03-06-T-007,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Similarly, Sir, I would like to further reiterate my call in this House which I had done on several occasions for HDB to go back to its fundamental and core business, which is to offer affordable housing to Singaporeans. In this regard, I would like to once again propose that the HDB seriously consider regulating the sale and purchase of 3-room and 4-room flats which are originally intended for low-income Singaporeans. I have previously suggested that 3-room and 4-room flats should not be bought and sold in the open market. Instead, the HDB should take over the role as the sole seller and sole reseller of such flats. If, for example, a 3-room or 4-room flat owner wants to sell his flat, the HDB should undertake to buy it back, at its original sale price plus inflation over the years that the owner has held the flat. HDB can then resell the flat to qualified buyers. The HDB will have much better control over pricing and thus can keep the prices of 3-room and 4-room flats truly affordable for the low-income Singaporean families.

Now, it is normal for us to hear news about the excellence of Malay children in their class or in important examinations in schools. We also have more Malay professionals of high calibre – doctors, accountants, lawyers, engineers − and they lead and shine in various industries. At the same time, I am also proud of the growing number of Malays who succeed in business including those who shine in the arts and the creative fields.",15,803,2013-03-06-T-007-S-00803
2013-03-06-T-007,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"But, Sir, the community is still facing a number of problems, especially among the low income and the poor. If we look deeper into the problems of those families who are stuck year after year in the same situation, continue to earn low income and do not enjoy positive progress, you will find certain characteristics. For these families, that I often meet, it seems like they have lost hope and they are resigned to their fate. If the parents are low-educated, their children often do not have the determination to succeed or they fail in school and drop out. Why does this continue to happen to these dysfunctional families? Is it possible that these children who come from such families are required to start working to assist the family? But I feel that the Government and the community must provide more assistance to these dysfunctional families so that they can break this cycle. We must help the parents of these families so that they have the hope and the high aspirations for their children. Whatever the challenges and problems faced by these families, we must work more closely with the community organisations to raise their development and status in life.",16,804,2013-03-06-T-007-S-00804
2013-03-06-T-007,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Sir, we do hope that from the generous Budget this year, the Government will give assistance to community organisations and work with them to help these dysfunctional families break this vicious cycle  where the parents are unable to fulfil the aspirations, their children will be able to do so; so that the children will succeed in school, they will work harder and they will want to upgrade their skills and abilities for a brighter future for their children.",17,805,2013-03-06-T-007-S-00805

I would like to call on members of the community who have succeeded to show interest and concern. We hope that they will come forward to help with the effort to uplift the needy families. With their involvement, they will not only achieve a sense of personal fulfilment, but also remind ourselves that every Singaporean, whether well-to-do or not, has an equal stake in Singapore.",18,806,2013-03-06-T-007-S-00806
2013-03-06-T-007,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"(In English)  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I come now to my final point. It is clear that the Government is making great efforts to address the concerns of Singaporeans. Concerns about the high costs of living are genuine, and the Government's plan to help Singaporeans increase their earnings is a long-term solution, while the credits and rebates offered by the Government are to stem immediate-term needs. We are also building more flats and are expanding our transport system – both immediately and in the long term. This is all well and good, and I am sure Singaporeans will appreciate all these efforts. But, Sir, I would like to signal that we are still some way away from restoring the trust that Singaporeans have given to us for so many years.",19,807,2013-03-06-T-007-S-00807
2013-03-06-T-007,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Many Singaporeans that I spoke to, still feel that their concerns are falling on deaf ears. They feel that our policy-makers are too isolated from the situation on the ground. Sir, we risk losing the art of explaining our policies in a way that makes common sense to the common man. We risk losing the pulse of the ground and we are in danger of paying a dear price – that there will be a disconnect between our residents and ourselves. Once we completely lose our residents' trust, we will no longer be able to call on them to support difficult, yet necessary steps, accept painful policies, to ensure Singapore's long-term survival. If that happens, Sir, then Singapore will be no different to many other countries – where governments have populist policies to win the day, but the populace suffers the long-term effect. If that happens, then, we have failed Singapore.",20,808,2013-03-06-T-007-S-00808
