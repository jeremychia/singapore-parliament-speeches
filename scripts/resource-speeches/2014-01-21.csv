2014-01-21-T-001,Nicholas Fang,Mr Nicholas Fang,"asked the Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether the results of the 2013 Southeast Asian Games will lead to (i) any adjustments to the $40 million Sports Excellence Scholarship scheme to include more athletes from lesser known sports; and (ii) a decision to focus on a smaller number of sports to ensure the best chances of achieving results at major games such as the Olympics.",1,1,2014-01-21-T-001-S-00001
2014-01-21-T-001,Lawrence Wong,"The Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong)",The Government is committed to supporting the aspirations of talented Singaporeans who wish to excel in their chosen sports.,1,2,2014-01-21-T-001-S-00002
2014-01-21-T-001,Lawrence Wong,"The Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong)","Our High Performance Sports system, introduced in 2013, provides support to more than 1,000 carded athletes across 50 sports. On top of this, we recently introduced the SpEx Scholarships to enable our top and promising athletes to train full-time. The inaugural batch of scholarships was awarded to 64 athletes across 15 sports in September last year. We expect to award more scholarships this year for talented athletes who wish to pursue full-time training. Based on the performances in the recent SEA Games, there are several promising candidates and we look forward to receiving their applications. The $40 million Sports Excellence budget, which Mr Fang mentioned, already provides for this.",2,3,2014-01-21-T-001-S-00003
2014-01-21-T-001,Lawrence Wong,"The Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong)","The High Performance Sports system and the Sports Excellence (SpEx) Scholarship programme under it are intended to support athletes with the potential and ability to excel at the international level, across all sports. We provide targeted levels of support according to how well the athletes have performed, how far they can go, and how much they are willing to commit to training. We also set clear performance requirements for these athletes, and if there are athletes who do not measure up, then funding support will cease. Hence the support is tied strictly to individual performance, and not to the type or number of sports.",3,4,2014-01-21-T-001-S-00004
2014-01-21-T-001,Nicholas Fang,Mr Nicholas Fang (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, one clarification and supplementary question. Given the recent performances at the 2013 SEA Games and given that it followed very shortly on from the awarding of the SpEx scholarships, perhaps it is a little bit premature to use that as a benchmark as to how the athletes in this first batch performed. Given that the 2015 SEA Games, the 2016 Olympics and subsequent competitions are coming up very shortly, is there a need on the part of the Ministry to want to focus a little bit more to ensure that we attain those high performance results, with a more targeted approach, perhaps not such a broad spectrum as 15 sports?",1,5,2014-01-21-T-001-S-00005
2014-01-21-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mdm Speaker, I would say that we are, indeed, looking at the range of sports and discussing very closely with each National Sports Association (NSA) to see how they can identify athletes in the sports that will be featured in the SEA Games to make sure that they are well prepared to achieve good results during the SEA Games. We are, indeed, taking that focused approach in preparing our athletes and working with the NSAs for the SEA Games.",1,6,2014-01-21-T-001-S-00006
2014-01-21-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Member talked about the performance of the SEA Games in relation to the High Performance Sports system which was recently introduced and the Sports Excellence (SpEx) Scholarship. It is not related because the SpEx programme just started. So, we cannot say because of this, therefore, the results we saw in the recent SEA Games. I wish it were so. But the results of the SEA Games were the results of the years of training and investment that have been put in by the respective NSAs, through the support of the Singapore Sports Council (SSC). With this additional injection that we are putting in now through the SpEx Scholarship and the High Performance Sports system, we think that that would prepare us even better for SEA Games 2015.",2,7,2014-01-21-T-001-S-00007
2014-01-21-T-002,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,"asked the Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether the Government will consider regulating the organisation of concerts and other events to ensure that ticket charges paid by consumers will be secured in the event of a cancellation of the concert or event.",1,8,2014-01-21-T-002-S-00008
2014-01-21-T-002,Lawrence Wong,"The Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong)","Mdm Speaker, currently, the purchase of tickets for concerts and other events is covered under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act.

2014-01-21-T-002,Lawrence Wong,"The Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong)","Most concert tickets are currently sold through Sistic, which is the ticketing agent with the main share of our local market. Sistic retains the revenues from ticket sales for most events until they are over, making exceptions only for event promoters with a proven track record. This practice by Sistic to retain the revenue from ticket sales allows Sistic to provide refunds should there be a cancellation. The private consortium operating the Sports Hub has recently introduced a new ticketing system called Sports Hub Tix, which will also adopt a similar practice as Sistic.",2,10,2014-01-21-T-002-S-00010
2014-01-21-T-002,Lawrence Wong,"The Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong)","For these reasons, there may not be a need to introduce new regulatory measures at this stage. Instead, the preferred approach is to push industry self regulation and to raise consumer awareness. In this regard, the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) has been actively educating consumers about the importance of checking terms and conditions when buying concert tickets.",3,11,2014-01-21-T-002-S-00011
2014-01-21-T-002,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Mdm Speaker, a few questions for clarification. I wanted to ask, firstly, whether the Acting Minister would agree that the closure of a company that organises K-pop concerts would adversely impact Singapore's reputation as a suitable venue for future concerts or shows; secondly, whether the Acting Minister would agree that such a liquidation of the company would hurt consumer confidence; thirdly, whether the Government would investigate the management of the company to see whether there had been any breach of the Companies Act whereby the officers of the company had contracted debt without expecting the concert to be performed; and fourthly, whether the Government would hold the company's officers personally liable for such events?",1,12,2014-01-21-T-002-S-00012
2014-01-21-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The cancellation of events is not something that can be completely avoided. Even in major markets like London and New York, you do see cancelations. If we look at the cancellations that we have had over the past year, the number that we have is not large. From what we can see, we have had five cancellations throughout the whole of 2013. Most of the events have had refunds of ticket sales.",1,13,2014-01-21-T-002-S-00013
2014-01-21-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In this particular case with the Korean pop concert that was mentioned, as the Member highlighted, the company went bankrupt, and so, not all of the ticket sales were refunded fully to consumers who had made the purchase.",2,14,2014-01-21-T-002-S-00014
2014-01-21-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the specifics of the company, I do not have the full information of what happened within the company and whether the officers in the company had contracted debt, as the Member had mentioned, or whether there were commercial practices which were found to be not appropriate. That is something that will have to be investigated, but I do not have the information at this stage.",3,15,2014-01-21-T-002-S-00015
2014-01-21-T-002,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,I would like to ask the Acting Minister whether he is aware that Sistic would be refunding the ticket sales to the consumers of the affected cancelled K-pop concert.,1,16,2014-01-21-T-002-S-00016
2014-01-21-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The answer is, ""Yes"". As I mentioned, Sistic keeps the ticket revenues and holds them until the event is over. Because Sistic has that practice, it is able to refund all the revenues it has held to the consumers who bought tickets for that particular Korean pop concert, through Sistic.",1,17,2014-01-21-T-002-S-00017
2014-01-21-T-003,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,asked the Minister for Health how do polyclinics and Government hospitals raise the awareness of Medifund among patients.,1,18,2014-01-21-T-003-S-00018

We also encourage patients and their families who face difficulties with their medical bills to approach the medical social workers at the public hospitals and polyclinics, or speak to healthcare professionals caring for them. Hospital and polyclinic staff may also take the initiative to approach patients to ask if they are in need of assistance, if they observe patients having difficulties making payment, especially during financial counselling.",2,20,2014-01-21-T-003-S-00020
2014-01-21-T-003,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Mdm Speaker, there have been anecdotal accounts of patients or their families having to sell their flats or take up loans in order to pay hospital bills. I have also heard of patients who go to polyclinics, but do not have the money to pay for the full prescription and instead asked for shorter duration of the course of medicine. It seems that there are still people who are not aware that Government has put in a lot of money to help patients in need.",1,21,2014-01-21-T-003-S-00021
2014-01-21-T-003,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"I would like to ask whether MOH can work out an SOP rather than just leaving it to individual initiative, given the heavier patient load in the hospitals nowadays. An SOP for all Government hospitals to give out leaflets on Medifund upon patients' admission and for hospitals and polyclinics to display notices in four languages at the cashier counters to inform the public that they can ask to see the medical social worker to apply for Medifund when they have financial difficulties.",2,22,2014-01-21-T-003-S-00022

I would like to assure the Member that, as mentioned in my reply earlier, we will continue to improve our outreach efforts to fellow Singaporeans to see how they can get assistance. We have increased assistance. If we look at the financial assistance we provided in Financial Year 2012, total financial assistance given to Medifund-accredited institutions increased by 12.2%, from $90.8 million in FY2011 to $101.9 million in FY2012.",1,23,2014-01-21-T-003-S-00023

2014-01-21-T-003,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Mdm Speaker, like the hon Member Mr Baey Yam Keng, I have also come across cases where patients and my residents have said that sometimes, they are not aware of where to go to for financial assistance. For example, some of them may not have even heard of the medical social work department. My supplementary question is whether MOH intends to start a campaign or put in place a programme to publicise the various avenues of financial assistance available to patients of both public hospitals and polyclinics.",1,26,2014-01-21-T-003-S-00026

2014-01-21-T-004,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many accidents involving cyclists and pedestrians are reported in the past three years; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider reviewing the current laws to allow people who are injured by cyclists to seek redress without taking a civil suit.,1,28,2014-01-21-T-004-S-00028

2014-01-21-T-004,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs),"Currently, an injured person can initiate civil action if the accident was caused by the negligent conduct of other road users. Other options of redress include making an insurance claim, mediation and private settlement. In general, these avenues provide adequate means for persons who suffer injury in such accidents to claim compensation. TP and LTA will continue monitoring the situation to assess the need for additional remedies to address the Member's concern. Both agencies will also continue to improve cycling infrastructure and education measures in respect of both cyclists and pedestrians.",2,30,2014-01-21-T-004-S-00030
2014-01-21-T-004,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Mdm Speaker, I am sure the number on the ground is much higher than that because I have been receiving feedback very regularly. Recently, one of my resident's arms were badly injured. She reported to the Police and the Police said that she had to take a civil suit, as Senior Minister of State mentioned just now. She was told to either take out a civil suit or make an insurance claim.",1,31,2014-01-21-T-004-S-00031
2014-01-21-T-004,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State if the Ministry can review the legal framework in such a way that errant cyclists who caused injuries, be prosecuted without going through a civil suit. How many residents would like to take that path because it involves costs? The second question is on the insurance claim  claim from whose insurance, I would like to ask.",2,32,2014-01-21-T-004-S-00032
2014-01-21-T-004,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The civil suit has to do with claiming for damages whereas prosecuting the offender for the offence has to do with the act itself. For those pedestrian cases, we have been charging them under various Acts. But certainly, for the most egregious cases where serious injury is caused, we can also use the Penal Code to invoke against the cyclist offender to charge them under the rash Negligent Act. Under this Act, a fine of up to $10,000 or a jail term can be meted out. It would depend on the kind of injuries, the circumstances and the evidence we can bring against the offender. That is not the same as what compensation the pedestrian can claim against the cyclist. It is quite separate – the act of prosecuting and the act of getting compensation.",1,33,2014-01-21-T-004-S-00033
2014-01-21-T-004,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"I think the Senior Minister of State did not answer my second question. When he mentioned claiming from insurance, if let say the cyclist currently does not have insurance, so whose insurance can the pedestrian claim from? The other question is the reply from the Police to the residents. Normally, they would say, ""There is nothing that we can do."" Perhaps something can be done to brief the Police properly, so that the residents would not walk away thinking that they are always at the losing end.",1,34,2014-01-21-T-004-S-00034
2014-01-21-T-004,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Certainly. There are cyclists who are insured. In cases where the cyclists are insured, you can claim against the cyclist. When they are not insured, that is where the civil suit would have to take place to get the injury claims against the damages. As for the Police, we would take that on board to make sure the communications with the complainants are carried out properly. In times when they are injured, Police should not cause further injury by giving them information which is not helping the case.",1,35,2014-01-21-T-004-S-00035

Through the curriculum, schools emphasise the importance of values such as respect, responsibility and resilience. Students are also taught skills to handle challenging situations. The new Character and Citizenship Education curriculum specifically teaches students to report cases and seek help and to care for others. Anti-bullying awareness programmes, organised in many schools, empower students to help themselves and support their peers who are bullied.",3,42,2014-01-21-T-005-S-00042

So, what we want to do is actually pay our officers accordingly based on their capabilities and the job grade that they are on and try to retain our good officers for as long as possible in service because, certainly, as a whole, our teaching force has contributed enormously to the education of our children and we want to make sure that this continues.",1,73,2014-01-21-T-007-S-00073

Is MOM able to track these movements? What these people are doing, is it legal and acceptable in Singapore, because they do not pay Foreign Worker Levy?

There are other people who come into Singapore on social visit passes and we are aware that sometimes, some of them might engage in various types of work, whether legal work or otherwise.

2014-01-21-T-012,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,120,2014-01-21-T-012-S-00120
2014-01-21-T-012,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Excess Wait Time (EWT) measures how regular a specific bus service is. It is an average score measured across all the trips for a single bus service. It is assessed at several bus stops along the way and every bus service has its own specific EWT, depending on how regular and reliable that bus service is.",1,121,2014-01-21-T-012-S-00121
2014-01-21-T-012,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"For example, a bus service that is operating at a perfect, regular 10-minute interval will have an average wait time of five minutes, and an EWT of zero. An EWT of 0.1 minute for this service means that the commuter is likely to wait six seconds more, on average, compared to the EWT of 0 minute.",2,122,2014-01-21-T-012-S-00122
2014-01-21-T-012,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"However, as the EWT is an average score, I should make it clear that the actual commuter experience waiting at a specific bus stop could be different. But over time, if we keep on reducing the EWT, there would be a perceptible improvement in bus reliability for our commuters. That has been the experience for London which had implemented a reliability framework of the same kind for more than a dozen years already. Typically, they would regard a 0.5-minute or 30-second reduction in EWT as a significant improvement.",3,123,2014-01-21-T-012-S-00123
2014-01-21-T-012,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The Bus Service Reliability Framework, while intended to get buses to arrive at bus stops at more regular intervals, we do not believe will encourage unsafe driving behaviour. Bus captains will be instructed by the service controllers to slow down, or even hold at bus stops for a minute or two, provided the bus does not obstruct traffic and other buses.",4,124,2014-01-21-T-012-S-00124
2014-01-21-T-012,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Bus captains found to be driving recklessly or flouting road traffic rules will be subject to discipline by the bus operators or even charged by the Traffic Police. Bus operators have Standard Operating Procedures on safe driving standards, and safe driving skills are continually reinforced. Bus operators also provide incentives for bus captains who drive safely and have a good record.",5,125,2014-01-21-T-012-S-00125
2014-01-21-T-012,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Mdm Speaker, I want to thank the Minister for his answers. I am wondering if a traffic controller gives instructions to the bus captain or driver to slow down or even to wait at the bus stop, and then later on, the bus captain finds that he cannot catch up, how then does he deal with the stress of having to catch up, after having been asked to stop at the bus stop for two minutes or so? My concern is whether we would add undue stress and pressure on the bus captain because he faces a certain degree of unhappiness from his employer if he does not comply. For all that we say, that he should not drive recklessly, there would be a certain amount of pressure on him to try to adhere to the time limit. In the Minister's view, would this be something that we are trying to encourage?",1,126,2014-01-21-T-012-S-00126
2014-01-21-T-012,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,I think this will have to evolve over time. The truth is that there would be additional stress on the system as a whole. What the Public Transport Operators (PTOs) would need to do is to significantly improve their backend operations. They also need to train people at the Ops Control centre to be monitoring these buses much more closely and to give directions to the drivers accordingly.,1,127,2014-01-21-T-012-S-00127
2014-01-21-T-012,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Indeed, the situation that Mr Lim had suggested could well come up. I suspect that even today, there is always a certain amount of pressure already on the buses to adhere to the schedule to get back to the interchange on time, so that they can start the next run. There is always a certain amount of pressure.",2,128,2014-01-21-T-012-S-00128
2014-01-21-T-012,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Having said that, we can look at the safety records of the two operators against the standard that is set for them. What is the standard? The standard is 0.75 accidents per 100,000 km drive. Buses cover quite a lot of distance on a daily basis, so it is best to measure this against 100,000 km and on a consistent basis. The standard that we set for them is 0.75 accidents per 100,000 km across the fleet. This is roughly equivalent to us, as a driver of a private vehicle getting into an accident once every six or seven years. That is the standard we set for them.",3,129,2014-01-21-T-012-S-00129
2014-01-21-T-012,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"For the past few years, when we look at the records, we have found that both operators have exceeded this, meaning they have performed better than 0.75. The record has generally been a good one. This is something that we will be watching but it is not something that worries us unduly at this point in time.",4,130,2014-01-21-T-012-S-00130
2014-01-21-T-012,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister, based on what had been shared earlier and in his reply, there seems to be a fair amount of judgement that the bus captain and the traffic controller have to exercise on a day-to-day basis. Because of the subjectivity, would the bus driver not feel pressured and make reckless decisions, especially when they may have had to stop for a few more minutes to allow an elderly passenger, for instance, get onboard, or because of congestion on the road? In such instances, what kinds of measures are being put in place to guide them in terms of making such assessments, that is, when they should slow down and when they should catch up so that, overall, not only will they be safe on the road, but also to cut down on the excess waiting time to improve reliability of the service to passengers?",1,131,2014-01-21-T-012-S-00131
2014-01-21-T-012,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"That, indeed, is a series of very good and pertinent questions. These are some of the same things that we posed to Transport for London when we visited them. I would have to say that this is an idea that we took from Transport for London. They assured us that if we looked at it over a number of years – and they have improved on their procedures and operations – that these were not areas that proved to be of great concern.",1,132,2014-01-21-T-012-S-00132
2014-01-21-T-012,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"We look at London, for instance. They have been operating this as far as I know since 2000. Over a dozen years, they have improved from an EWT of about two minutes to about one minute. They attributed this to a significant improvement in the reliability of the service as well as customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction went up by 60%. They felt that some of these concerns that we raised with them were manageable, and seen against the improvements as well as the derived satisfaction of customers, it was well worth making. They told us that the greater pressure comes on the people at the backend, because they will have to make decisions on how the buses move and how to close the gap, or whether they should inject an additional bus enroute because of congestion mid-stream, and so on.",2,133,2014-01-21-T-012-S-00133
2014-01-21-T-012,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Indeed, when they summarised it for us, we felt that the additional stress on the drivers was not so significant – certainly manageable – and it would be the training of the people at the backend and the system that you have in place that will allow us eventually, we hope, to make the greatest improvements.",3,134,2014-01-21-T-012-S-00134
2014-01-21-T-012,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Madam, I have two questions. I note that the quantum for the penalty and incentive, there is a difference. There is a higher quantum for incentive versus penalty for the same duration, above or below the EWT that was mentioned. Why is that so?",1,135,2014-01-21-T-012-S-00135
2014-01-21-T-012,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Secondly, when a bus is on the road, a lot depends on the road conditions as well – whether there is obstruction on the road, whether other vehicles give way at the bus bay for the buses to come out. There could be a lot of factors that are beyond the bus driver's or the bus company's control or sphere of influence. Would this scheme be steering a behaviour that is probably not entirely in the bus company or bus driver's control?",2,136,2014-01-21-T-012-S-00136
2014-01-21-T-012,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Again, some very good questions. These were exactly the same things we also asked Transport for London. They, too, have a scheme where they provide more incentives as compared to penalties – one and a half times – which is what we have also adopted.",1,137,2014-01-21-T-012-S-00137
2014-01-21-T-012,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"When we thought through it, we came to about the same conclusion as to why London did it this way. There is a certain amount of investment that the operators have to make in order for this to work. It is not just hoping that conditions will allow your buses to become more regular or that the bus drivers themselves will talk to each other but, essentially, a system to monitor, direct and, if necessary, to inject additional resources. That is one way to look at it because there is a certain outlay that the operators would have to be responsible for in order for this to work.",2,138,2014-01-21-T-012-S-00138
2014-01-21-T-012,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"On road conditions, the Member is right. Not everything is within the control of the PTOs and, certainly, they try to emphasise that point very much to us. The counter to that is  it, therefore, requires them to pay greater attention to road conditions, to know when there are works taking place or to be familiar with the peculiarities of the route and even at specified time intervals, because while conditions change on a day-to-day basis – and I grant you that – there are some things that do not change. So, they have to factor these in and plan accordingly.",3,139,2014-01-21-T-012-S-00139
2014-01-21-T-012,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member),"Madam, just a quick question. Would it not be more straightforward to just set high enough standards and then penalise the PTOs for failing to meet those standards? Because this can certainly spur improvements at the backend as well, and the PTOs' reward really is in more satisfied customers and bigger ridership.",1,140,2014-01-21-T-012-S-00140
2014-01-21-T-012,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"We also have to try and arrive at a position and at a model that is fair to all parties concerned. With greater demand, there will be calls for greater injection of resources. So, we are trying to find a balance between incentives and penalties in order to arrive at a better situation than what we have today.",1,141,2014-01-21-T-012-S-00141

The WIS income cap was raised from $1,500 in 2007 to $1,900 in 2013 to benefit about 30% of our citizen workforce. We increased the maximum WIS quantum by 25% to $3,500, and increased the cash proportion of WIS from less than 30% to 40% in 2013. The frequency of WIS payouts has also been increased to help workers better cope with current expenses.",2,144,2014-01-21-T-013-S-00144
2014-01-21-T-013,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Acting Minister for Manpower),"Mr Christopher de Souza asked about the steps taken to assist workers to receive WIS. The cash component is paid into his bank account or via cheque and the CPF component is credited into his CPF account. These payouts are made automatically, but only if the employee receives CPF contributions from his employer. Hence, we are also taking steps to address poor employment practices that can potentially undermine our WIS efforts. MOM and CPF Board launched the ""WorkRight"" programme in 2012 to step up compliance with the CPF Act and the Employment Act through education and enforcement.",3,145,2014-01-21-T-013-S-00145

MOM has worked with NEA to introduce employment-related criteria in the Clean Mark accreditation scheme to encourage better employment standards. Similar criteria will also be incorporated into NEA's mandatory licensing regime for the cleaning sector which will take effect later this year. At the broader level for all workers, MOM has also been working with our tripartite partners to bring about the adoption of fair, responsible and merit-based employment through the work of the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP).",4,146,2014-01-21-T-013-S-00146

The Government also provides assistance in housing, healthcare and education. As Mr Christopher de Souza has pointed out, one of the healthcare assistance schemes is the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS). CHAS allows Singaporeans from lower- and middle-income households the convenience of seeking subsidised care at private GP and dental clinics near their homes. MOH, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) and HPB have been actively publicising CHAS through grassroots organisations and the unions. With the removal of the age floor for CHAS with effect from 1 January 2014, all eligible family members of lower- and middle-income households are now able to qualify for CHAS.",5,147,2014-01-21-T-013-S-00147

2014-01-21-T-013,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,I take the Member's point that he would like it to be comprehensive within a letter so that the individual knows the total amount of benefits or subsidies that he is given for any year. This is something that we can consider as we look into how we can enhance measures to help our low-wage workers as a whole-of-Government effort because it is not just about WIS and what MOM does but all the other agencies as well.,2,151,2014-01-21-T-013-S-00151
2014-01-21-T-013,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,I would like to note that it is probably not possible to put everything into one letter because there may be certain schemes where it may be administratively costly and cumbersome or burdensome to put in.

Indeed, in order to become an advocate and solicitor and be called to the Bar, it is important that the applicant is of good character and the right suitability. Good character and right suitability do not start from the time you begin your training at a law practice. It is something which pertains to the essential individual character of that person and could be affected by matters which have occurred even before the applicant has made the application to be admitted to the Bar. This issue of character is not constrained in terms of time. What is important is that at the time that the application is made and heard, the Court has the opportunity to determine that the person is of the appropriate suitability to be admitted. After all, that person is going to have in his or her hands the practice of the law that affects the rights of individuals and the public at large.

In case they are not, I would direct their attention to Rule 28(1) of the Legal Profession (Admission) Rules. These are the Rules which provide that any person – this includes a member of the public – may file a notice of objection to the application for admission to the Bar. Indeed, that is the purpose of the fact of the application being made public.

While we will do what we can to grow the local manpower pool, it is unlikely to be sufficient to meet Singapore's growing healthcare needs. Based on our projections, we will need to grow our national healthcare professional workforce by 50%, or about 20,000 more, between 2011 and 2020. This is not a small number. We need to supplement our local workforce with overseas-trained healthcare professionals. In particular, we aim to bring back more Singaporeans studying medicine and dentistry overseas, through the offering of pre-employment grants. We have attracted about 250 of them back since 2010.

The engagement sessions, with representatives from the relevant agencies, such as MOM, SPRING and WDA, have been most helpful in increasing awareness among SMEs about all the Government schemes.

Through the dialogue sessions, we see that they are accepting that. Now, is to be able to look at how, with the limited resources that they have, can they produce more with less; how can they increase their opportunities in internationalisation; how do they fund some of these opportunities.

It is only right that laws and policies that will have a severe impact on people's lives should not be made based merely on anecdotal evidence. Such studies will also allow us to be sufficiently certain that our laws are truly targeting the causes of crime, for the study of criminology has constantly proven to us that conventional ideas of crime can easily contain misconceptions that are not immediately obvious to the unfamiliar observer.",2,205,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00205

This is despite the fact that the current system of remissions imposes no conditions on inmates for the period of their release. While we should not relent on our effort to curb crime and re-offending, perhaps these figures might also be an indication that we do not need a radical alteration of the current system. Rather than restrictive measures, the focus should, instead, be on encouraging them to lead a meaningful and crime-free life by helping them acquire skills that will allow them to find employment.",9,212,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00212
2014-01-21-T-018,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member):,"Mdm Speaker, let me deal with certain concerns about the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme for inmates who have received a prison sentence of 20 years or less. Section 50U(1) seeks to impose aftercare conditions for persons who have committed offences which are listed under the First Schedule, and who are not liable to being deported after serving their sentences. These aftercare conditions will apply for the duration of the person's remission order.",10,213,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00213
2014-01-21-T-018,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member):,"I am not convinced, as it stands, that sections 50X and Y can be administered in a fair manner. Both provisions set out the consequences of a minor and major breach of the mandatory aftercare conditions respectively. The provisions do not, however, define when persons are deemed to have committed these breaches. This means that persons on remission are left in the dark as to how they should behave in order to prevent themselves from being in breach of the conditions, major or minor. Furthermore, this also means that the prosecutorial authority will have full discretion over the type of breach that an inmate has committed. Given that a major breach is listed as a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment under section 50Y, Parliament should provide a clear statutory definition of what would constitute minor or major breaches of the conditions, so that both persons on remission, as well as enforcement and judicial authorities, can be clear on what the law requires of them.",11,214,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00214
2014-01-21-T-018,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member):,"Furthermore, in section 50X (1), it is stated that the Commissioner may, after due inquiry, administer a variety of punishments on a minor breach of a mandatory aftercare condition. There is, however, no indication of what steps the Commissioner must take before he can satisfy himself that a person has committed a minor breach. As a matter of fairness, the person being accused of a minor breach should be afforded the right to hear the charge and evidence against him/her, and to make his/her defence before the Commissioner makes a decision on the matter and this should be made clear in the statute.",12,215,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00215
2014-01-21-T-018,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member):,"Mdm Speaker, I now turn my attention to inmates who have been sentenced to a prison term of more than 20 years. Section 50J (1) of the Bill allows the Minister to direct the Commissioner to make a remission order where an inmate has served 20 years of his/her sentence. Section 50J (2) makes it obligatory for the Minister to review the decision every 12 months or less, should he decline to make a remission order under subsection 1.",13,216,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00216
2014-01-21-T-018,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member):,"While I welcome the Government's recognition that long-term prison sentences may be reduced where the offender has shown signs of rehabilitation, I am of the view that an independent review board, rather than the Minister himself, should make such decisions. The board should comprise eminent persons who possess certain expertise in relevant fields that will enable them to make better and more informed decisions on the rehabilitative progress of inmates. This is the position adopted in Hong Kong, where there is a ""Long-term Prison Sentences Review Board"" made up of at least two judges or former judges, one medical practitioner who is or was a specialist in psychiatry, as well as one member who has the expertise and experience in social work. The board determines whether long-term prisoners should be released early, as well the conditions which the inmates have to adhere to after their release. Furthermore, it also reviews the progress of the inmate after release to determine if new conditions should be imposed or old ones removed. The merits of having a similar panel of experts in Singapore is undeniable and should immediately be studied with a view towards implementing such a system as soon as possible. This decision-making body, driven by a collective wisdom, seems to me to be in a much better position to evaluate whether inmates are suitable for early release, instead of the Minister or the Commissioner, both of whom already bear the burden of other heavy duties and responsibilities.",14,217,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00217
2014-01-21-T-018,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member):,"Secondly, can the Minister also tell the House whether the Government has sought expert opinion on the average time it would take for long-term inmates to be fully rehabilitated into society, and whether these experts were of the opinion that the average period of time needed for rehabilitation is one-third of the inmate's sentence.",15,218,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00218
2014-01-21-T-018,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member):,"Mdm Speaker, we must not forget that in cases where inmates are sentenced to 20 years or more receive remission, their remission order will be at least six years long, perhaps even longer if they are released at the Minister's discretion before they are entitled to remission. The aftercare conditions may, therefore, be imposed for the full duration of the remission order regardless of the rehabilitative progress of the person. While it is understandable that measures are needed to support the reintegration of these long-term inmates back into society, there is the possibility that a person would have been fully rehabilitated well before the expiration of the remission order but is nevertheless unnecessarily subjected to the mandatory aftercare conditions. Will it not be better if the duration of the aftercare conditions for long-term inmates is set for a determinate term for all long-term offenders with the option given to an independent board to extend or reduce the period where it is necessary?",16,219,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00219
2014-01-21-T-018,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member):,"Before turning to the external placement scheme, allow me to turn my attention to the position on those who have been sentenced to life imprisonment. Section 50P (1) of the Bill allows the Minister to direct the Commissioner to make a remission order after the prisoner has served 20 years of his/her sentence. Section 50P (2) requires the Minister to review the decision every 12 months or less should he/she decline to make the direction to the Commissioner. My criticism of the position in relation to long-term prisoners applies equally in this instance. The discretion to allow for remission should be given to an independent board that also has the power to impose and remove conditions upon the inmate's release.",17,220,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00220
2014-01-21-T-018,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member):,"Mdm Speaker, in the case of inmates sentenced to life imprisonment, section 50(R) states that the remission order shall have effect until the end of the person's natural life. This means that the mandatory aftercare conditions will be applicable for such persons for the rest of their lives, even if the offender has been successfully rehabilitated within that period. Based on the provisions of the Bill, it is entirely possible for a person to be electronically tagged and be required to report to the Commissioner for the rest of his/her life. This, I am afraid, may not be the best method of rehabilitating an ex-offender. All that this measure does is to make it extremely difficult for a person to reintegrate back into society because of the person's loss of privacy, as well as having to carry the stressful burden of meeting the mandatory aftercare conditions for an extraordinarily long period of time. These may also have an adverse impact on the person's ability to find stable employment, an important aspect of social reintegration. Again, there is a strong case to be made for a determinate term to be imposed, after which the conditions should expire, unless it is necessary to do otherwise. Within this stipulated term, the Board should also be given the discretion to change or remove the conditions should it be satisfied of the person's progress.",18,221,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00221

In many other societies, a significant proportion of crime, and, in particular, violent crime is carried out by offenders of prior history. The low recidivism rate we see in Singapore is testament to the good work of our prison officers, SCORE and the various organisations and VWOs that work with these ex-inmates.",3,225,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00225
2014-01-21-T-018,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol):,"It is assumed that in the absence of a family network, without social support and employment, the chance of recidivism is higher, much higher, as someone who is desperate, who has nothing to lose, is much more likely to do something foolish. The difficulties faced by these men on release are significant and need to be addressed in order to give them a fair chance at rebuilding their lives as this would reduce the likelihood of a repeat offence. Helping them get back on their feet is a kindness but also serves the interest of society at large in enhancing our peace and security. The amendment to this Bill seeks to enhance the system of managing ex-offenders and to help them reduce the risks of re-offending.",4,226,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00226
2014-01-21-T-018,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol):,"Madam, while the recidivism rate has seen a decrease in recent years, a large proportion of the prison population are repeat offenders. I would like to ask what are the main reasons for the recidivism in Singapore. One of the measures introduced under this amendment is the Conditional Remission System. As the majority of the prison population are repeat offenders, it appears that the risk of spending more time in jail had not deterred them from re-offending. So, to what extent would these measures be effective with respect to recidivism? Is it likely that there would need to be a different effect for the 20% of first-time offenders, rather than the majority of the prison population who are repeat offenders? Does this imply that a different application of the process is needed for inmates who are already repeat offenders?",5,227,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00227
2014-01-21-T-018,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol):,"Madam, the amendment also seeks to introduce the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme to facilitate the reintegration of ex-inmates upon release from Prisons through enhanced community support, counselling and case management.

The staff are caring and have a deep understanding of the self-discovery and rehabilitation needed for the residents, the personal journey that these ex-inmates have to go through to become reintegrated into society. The residents themselves want a fair chance to get themselves back onto their feet and they do work hard to make that happen.",7,229,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00229

How would the Ministry ensure that the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme is applied in a consistent way by the various organisations? Has the Ministry been able to help these aftercare services develop their skills and capabilities so that they can increase their effectiveness, and will these efforts continue? For some ex-offenders, a degree of psychological rehabilitation may be important, and how would the aftercare services be supported in providing this?",8,230,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00230
2014-01-21-T-018,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol):,"As a society, we could do more to treat these ex-offenders with dignity and provide them with the opportunities to take care of themselves. A job is often the key to providing a structured life, a sense of financial security and a set of useful skills. The time spent in these aftercare institutions is very important in the journey of rehabilitation and reintegration for the ex-offenders, and is also an opportunity for the residents to actively seek work. How successful has SCORE been in finding employment for these ex-inmates and how will such efforts be enhanced by the introduction of this Bill?",9,231,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00231

In this case, the enhancement of social peace and harmony is aligned with an opportunity to show kindness and to help some unfortunate members of our society who have been rehabilitated following an offence and an appropriate prison term. Stronger efforts and social integration will be more effective in helping ex-inmates turn over a new leaf. With that, I support the Bill.",10,232,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00232
2014-01-21-T-018,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah):,"Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the Prisons (Amendment) Bill that is before Parliament today. In recent years, the rate of recidivism for released persons has decreased consistently. However, a significant majority of released persons who return to prison are repeat offenders. Once a person is caught in the vicious cycle of re-offending and imprisonment, it is often difficult for that person to break out of the cycle easily. This is especially so for released persons who do not have any support from their families, loved ones or from the community at large.",1,233,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00233
2014-01-21-T-018,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah):,"Therefore, in this amendment to the Prisons Act, MHA seeks to introduce two programmes, namely, the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme and Conditional Remission System, that they hope will allow released persons to break out of the cycle of re-offending, and to rehabilitate and reintegrate back into cycle of re-offending, and to rehabilitate and reintegrate back into society after their release from imprisonment.",2,234,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00234
2014-01-21-T-018,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah):,"I support this Bill for two reasons  first, the amendments introduced in this Bill are timely, as they seek to introduce programmes that address real problems that repeat offenders face in trying to escape the vicious cycle of re-offending and imprisonment; secondly, these initiatives provide released persons with an incentive to turn over a new leaf and to be rehabilitated and reintegrated back into the wider Singapore fold.",3,235,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00235

2014-01-21-T-018,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah):,"With this in mind, it is particularly beneficial that the MAS applies to persons who are convicted of drug offences, because the rehabilitation of drug offenders must focus both on the physical and mental aspects in order for it to be effective. The tighter supervision and more structured approach to rehabilitation envisioned under the MAS ensure that released drug offenders have all the necessary assistance and support that they might require to break out of the cycle of drug abuse and imprisonment. Under the MAS, the Prison Service can also closely supervise the progress of their rehabilitation and monitor their movements, through restrictions like curfew hours and electronic monitoring.",15,247,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00247

By imposing the basic condition that persons released under the CRS should not be convicted of another offence during the remission period, these released persons will be more cautious and reluctant to re-offend. In the event that they do re-offend during the remission period, the courts will be empowered to sentence the released person for breaching the basic condition, with an imprisonment term capped at the remaining portion of the remission period.",17,249,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00249

With the introduction of the CRS, the courts now have flexibility and versatility to take such factors into account when sentencing released persons who breach the basic condition during their remission period. While we must correct the wrongdoing that has been committed by the released persons, we should try to understand the motivation behind their actions and to show them more compassion.",18,250,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00250

Inmates will continue to be released at the two-third mark. Upon release, they will then be issued with a Conditional Remission Order which will last till the end of their sentence. Inmates who breach prison discipline will still have their release delayed beyond the two-third mark. This is no different from the situation today.

Under the Prisons Regulations, an inmate may forfeit up to 180 days of remission for an offence committed in prison.

The new section 77A empowers the Superintendent to restore remission that had previously been forfeited by an inmate, but does not impose a limit on the number of days that can be restored.",11,265,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00265

Indeed, it creates the opportunity and incentive for good conduct and behaviour among inmates. Superintendents will not have unfettered discretion in restoring remission. The Commissioner of Prisons will set guidelines, which all Prison Superintendents must adhere to, in the exercise of these powers. For example, when an inmate remains offence-free for a certain time period, a number of his days of forfeited remission may be restored to him. Therefore, it is the behaviour of the inmate that determines whether forfeited remission is restored, rather than the authority which ordered the forfeiture.",12,266,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00266

The objective of the MAS is to help ex-inmates help themselves. We will do this by giving them structured support and assistance to stay crime-free and out of prison. All inmates convicted of offences specified in the First Schedule to the Act will be emplaced on the MAS. Mr Hri Kumar had asked why certain offences in the Misuse of Drugs Regulations were included. We took a comprehensive approach in listing the drug and property offences linked to the drug problem. The Commissioner of Prisons, however, will have the discretion to determine specific MAS conditions for the ex-inmate, depending on a holistic set of factors, such as the nature of offence, criminal antecedents, progress in prison, risk of re-offending and family support.",13,267,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00267

It builds on, brings together, and improves upon existing aftercare programmes as part of Prisons' broader throughcare strategy. The intent is, as Assoc Prof Tan has mentioned, to provide a smooth transition for the inmate to reintegrate into society. I disagree with Mrs Chiam that we do not need to do more for inmates. Even though recidivism rates are falling and are currently about 25%, inmates to be emplaced on MAS are at higher risk of re-offending with recidivism rates of up to 40% to 50%. And we must give them more help. Each ex-inmate, or ""released person"" as Mr de Souza has said, and I like that term better than ""ex-inmate"", emplaced on the MAS will be assigned a case worker prior to his release.",14,268,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00268

I agree with Mr Zainal Bin Sapari, Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap and Assoc Prof Tan that the community as a whole, including families and potential employers, play important roles in supporting the MAS. This is important even during the incare phase, and Prisons already actively involves inmates' families in the rehabilitation process. Prisons will also continue to engage families after inmates have been released from prison under the MAS. Similarly, SCORE provides inmates with vocational training and employment matching before their release. In answer to Dr Janil, SCORE also works with employers to match inmates and ex-inmates to jobs after their release. In 2012, SCORE emplaced 5,840 offenders on its employment and reintegration programmes. This is almost double the number in 2008. Of those assisted by SCORE, almost 98% of them successfully secured employment in 2012.",16,270,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00270

We have a comprehensive support structure of community partners, including religious and grassroots organisations, community self-help groups, and Family Service Centres, that work with inmates in prison and are ready to provide a pro-social network of volunteers and befrienders to ex-inmates and assist them in their reintegration into society. Such engagements begin while the inmates are still in prison so that it is a smooth transition to the aftercare phase when they return to society. Prisons provides training for these community partners.",17,271,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00271

This is known as wrap-around care, which provides support to both inmates and their families during this difficult time. Prisons is also working on a pilot project with the National Council of Social Services to leverage on localised Family Service Centres to provide even better wrap-around care for inmates and their families to meet their specific needs.",18,272,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00272

2014-01-21-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M):,Our multi-stakeholder approach to throughcare has worked well and we will continue to work closely with the various stakeholders and community partners on our throughcare programmes.,20,274,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00274
2014-01-21-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M):,"Next, I would like to reassure Mr Zainal and Assoc Prof Tan that before an inmate is released on the MAS, Prisons will first make a holistic assessment of each individual based on factors, such as the nature of offence, criminal antecedents, progress in prison, risk of re-offending, and family support. Each inmate will then be emplaced on a suitable programme within the MAS. Not all individuals will have to go through all the three MAS phases of a halfway house stay, home supervision and community reintegration. Some may be placed on the halfway house phase while others may be placed directly on the home supervision phase.",21,275,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00275
2014-01-21-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M):,"The time spent and the intensity of the programme at each phase depends on the ex-inmate's progress over the course of the MAS, which will last for up to two years, even for inmates sentenced to life imprisonment or who have long sentences, and not indefinitely as Mrs Chiam thought.",22,276,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00276
2014-01-21-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M):,"Let me describe the regime for an inmate under the MAS. Take the example of an inmate who is a repeat drug abuser and was sentenced to long-term imprisonment for six years. He is subsequently released from prison after serving four years, or at the two-third mark of his six-year sentence. He is then issued a CRO and subject to the basic condition for two years. As a drug offender, he is also emplaced on the MAS for up to two years.",23,277,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00277
2014-01-21-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M):,"Based on Prisons' assessment of this inmate's circumstances, he is emplaced in a halfway house upon his release. The halfway house programme is a residential programme that will last for at least six months. There, he undergoes regular counselling and casework sessions to address his rehabilitation and aftercare needs. These sessions are meant to address his criminogenic needs and risk factors of re-offending. He will be able to leave the halfway house during the day to work.",24,278,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00278
2014-01-21-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M):,"After several months in the halfway house, he is assessed to be coping well and making good progress in his rehabilitation and reintegration journey.

After several months on home supervision, he is assessed to be progressing well. He will then be placed on the final phase of the MAS, the community reintegration phase. As part of community reintegration, he is no longer subject to curfew hours or electronic monitoring. However, he will still need to attend counselling and casework sessions. This will continue till the end of his time on the MAS, which will be for up to two years.",26,280,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00280
2014-01-21-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M):,"The example shows how the MAS is a structured programme with progressive step-down aftercare arrangements to help the individual reintegrate into society, build resilience to stay crime-free, and adapt to ""post-imprisonment realities"", as Assoc Prof Tan put it. However, I would like to emphasise again that it is just as important that ex-inmates be motivated to help themselves.",27,281,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00281
2014-01-21-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M):,"There will be consequences when MAS ex-inmates breach their conditions. Mr Hri Kumar and Mrs Chiam asked about what constituted a minor and a serious breach. An ex-inmate would have committed a minor breach, for example, when he misses his counselling sessions or breaches his curfew hours. For such breaches, the Commissioner of Prisons may administer punishments, from tightening the ex-inmate's conditions to temporarily recalling him to prison. An ex-inmate would have committed a serious breach, for example, if he tampers with his electronic monitoring device, or if he has committed multiple minor breaches. For such breaches, the courts may sentence the ex-inmate to imprisonment for up to the remaining duration of his remission period at the time of the serious breach.",28,282,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00282
2014-01-21-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M):,Minor and serious breaches will be stipulated in the Prisons Regulations.

2014-01-21-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M):,"Mrs Chiam asked what steps must the Commissioner take before he is satisfied that a minor breach has been committed. Yes, he will be given a chance to explain his actions and hear the evidence against him. The intent of the MAS is not to punish the ex-inmate but to assist him in his rehabilitation and reintegration journey. There will also be an independent Advisory Committee set up to advise the Director of Prisons on MAS-related matters. This can include appeals from inmates themselves.",30,284,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00284
2014-01-21-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M):,"As several Members noted, the CRS and MAS are significant undertakings for Prisons.

2014-01-21-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M):,"At the same time, with the implementation of the MAS, Prisons will be building up its aftercare capabilities and strengthening the aftercare sector as a whole. Prisons will be developing a halfway house in the new Selarang Park Complex to provide a structured environment to supervise and rehabilitate ex-inmates emplaced on the MAS. It will cater to both male and female ex-inmates, and will complement the efforts of our current halfway house partners who work with lower-risk inmates. Prisons will also engage more counsellors and case workers. Furthermore, Prisons has recently developed a new training and development framework to raise the competencies and capabilities of personnel and volunteers in the aftercare sector to support ex-inmates in the community.",32,286,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00286
2014-01-21-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M):,"We will continue to work closely with our community partners, including halfway houses, to raise the capabilities within the sector. These are worthwhile investments and initiatives.

2014-01-21-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M):,"Next, I would like to clarify that the MAS will not replace but will build on current aftercare programmes that are already in place or aftercare programmes run by our community partners – the Singapore After-Care Association (SACA) and the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association (SANA) – which all ex-inmates may register for after their release from prison or after they have completed their MAS. Halfway houses that are operated by VWOs also accept walk-in from ex-inmates. Those who are not covered by the MAS will continue to be able to benefit from these programmes.",34,288,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00288
2014-01-21-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M):,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked about the amendments to the provision on the employment of auxiliary police officers (APOs) as escorts and guards. The objective of these proposed amendments is to facilitate the expanded deployment of APOs so that prison officers can focus on the rehabilitation and reintegration of inmates. APOs currently assist prison officers with escorting inmates of low and medium security risk to external locations, such as the Courts or hospitals, and guarding them while there. This amended provision will enable APOs to be deployed for functions, such as inmate escort within the prison complex and prison patrol. They will not be involved in rehabilitation functions. APOs deployed within the prison setting will continue to receive specialised training to deal with inmates and will be fully supervised by prison officers.",35,289,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00289
2014-01-21-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M):,The amendments will neither compromise prison security nor the safe custody of inmates. Prisons remains fully accountable for the safe custody of inmates both within and outside of prison.,36,290,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00290
2014-01-21-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M):,"Finally, on the External Placement Scheme (EPS), I would like to clarify Assoc Prof Tan's point about the EPS, as well as address Ms Lim's queries on the need for and safeguards for the EPS. The EPS is distinct from the MAS. The EPS, unlike the MAS, is not meant to be a step-down arrangement to facilitate reintegration. The EPS is meant to right-site inmates in places more suited for their physical or mental conditions. The scheme will be tightly scoped. For a start, we will limit eligibility only to inmates who have been certified by Prisons-appointed medical specialists as being at the end-stage of a terminal illness with a poor prognosis. In addition, the Minister will be advised by an independent committee that will include medical professionals. Finally, the inmate will be subject to conditions and restrictions and closely monitored. The placement can be cancelled at any time if the inmate's circumstances change and external placement is no longer deemed appropriate.",37,291,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00291
2014-01-21-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M):,"Mdm Speaker, I am glad that Members generally agree with me that there is a need to do more to deter offending and re-offending and help ex-inmates rehabilitate and reintegrate into society. The amendments which seek to introduce the CRS and MAS will strengthen Prisons' throughcare system, particularly in the aftercare phase. These two initiatives mark a paradigm shift in our rehabilitation of inmates. However, the inmate's motivation and will to change and his determination to turn over a new leaf for the sake of his family and himself is critical. Together with the support of the community and employers, we will help ex-inmates break the cycle of re-offending, return to their families, and reintegrate into society. I urge Members of the House to give support to the Prisons (Amendment) Bill.",38,292,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00292

It is stated in section 50V that MAS conditions are discretionary – that the conditions may be imposed on the released persons who qualify under the various criteria. I would like the Senior Minister of State to clarify if he anticipates that there would be qualified released persons who are not subject to any conditions under MAS or will everybody be subject to at least one of the conditions in MAS.",1,294,2014-01-21-T-018-S-00294

Specifically, the Member asks whether there is any time limit for the Police to issue the notice for information. In this case, Traffic Police will have a standard operating procedure (SOP) in place to prevent long delays. Under the SOP, notices will be sent out generally within one to two weeks from the time the offence is disclosed. The registered vehicle owners will have seven days to respond.

The mission of the Subordinate Courts is ""to provide an effective and accessible system of justice, inspiring public trust and confidence"". These amendments reflect that mission.

2014-01-21-T-022,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, I support this Bill. This Bill brings three important changes which I believe will potentially enhance public confidence in the justice meted out by the lower courts.",1,496,2014-01-21-T-022-S-00496
2014-01-21-T-022,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, a sitting member of the Supreme Court Bench will now be the Presiding Judge of the renamed State Courts. This change will potentially promote closer links to the Supreme Court and tighten its supervisory role over the lower Courts, as compared to the current system of having the Chief District Judge with no direct connection to the Supreme Court. Having a sitting member of the Supreme Court head the State Courts also enhances its standing as an institution which, after all, hears the vast majority of cases affecting Singaporeans.",2,497,2014-01-21-T-022-S-00497
2014-01-21-T-022,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),The second change is that the qualifying criteria for appointment of District Judges will be raised. A person to be appointed as a District Judge will now need to have at least seven years' post-qualification experience rather than five years.,3,498,2014-01-21-T-022-S-00498
2014-01-21-T-022,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The third change is that the qualifying criteria for the appointment of Magistrates will also be raised. Instead of needing just one year's post-qualification experience, a potential Magistrate will need to have three years' experience.",4,499,2014-01-21-T-022-S-00499
2014-01-21-T-022,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The raising of the qualifying experience is desirable and, indeed, necessary as the powers of District Judges and Magistrates to make orders and sentence persons have been increased significantly over the years. At the last debate on the Subordinate Courts (Amendment) Bill in 2010, I spoke in some detail about Magistrates, and the concern about giving them powers to grant injunction orders and how some of their decisions can be unappealable under the current rules. This is worrying if we only require Magistrates to have graduated just one year before.",5,500,2014-01-21-T-022-S-00500
2014-01-21-T-022,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"To this end, I am glad the Government has reviewed this matter for both District Judges and Magistrates. I believe the public will also feel more confident appearing before Judicial Officers with longer working and life experience.",6,501,2014-01-21-T-022-S-00501

2014-01-21-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"There are four key changes in this Bill  the renaming of the ""Subordinate Courts"" to the ""State Courts""; the re-designation of the Chief District Judge as the Presiding Judge of the State Courts; third one is the amendment of the requirement for a District Judge to be a qualified person for not less than seven years, which is an increase from the present five years; and the fourth change is the amendment of the requirement for a Magistrate to be a qualified person for not less than three years, an increase from the present one year.",2,503,2014-01-21-T-022-S-00503

2014-01-21-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"District Judges and Magistrates play an important role in the administration of justice in our Courts. Amongst other things, they have to deal with criminal matters which involve the imposition of hefty fines and incarceration of offenders. They also have to adjudicate on civil disputes involving cases of up to $60,000 for Magistrates and $250,000 for District Judges.",4,505,2014-01-21-T-022-S-00505
2014-01-21-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"In the 2012 Annual Report of the Subordinate Courts, it was reported that the Subordinate Courts handled a total of 352,763 cases of which 254,959 cases came under the Criminal Justice Division. Thus, the bulk of most litigants who have to appear in Court to pay a fine, to be sentenced to jail or to have their disputes adjudicated upon, will have to face either a Magistrate or a District Judge. It is critical that each litigant who appears in Court be given assurance that their case would be heard fairly and justice is dispensed in an impartial manner by an appropriately qualified person. It is, hence, important that we have qualified persons who are not too junior in age or in experience to be sitting in a judicial capacity to decide on the litigant's fate.",5,506,2014-01-21-T-022-S-00506
2014-01-21-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"One commonly expressed concern is whether the qualified persons have sufficient exposure in life's experiences and wisdom, without which, they may not appreciate the challenges that a litigant may face. This is especially so in the Small Claims Tribunal and the Magistrates' Courts.",6,507,2014-01-21-T-022-S-00507
2014-01-21-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Mr Deputy Speaker, whilst raising the minimum statutory requirements of a District Judge and a Magistrate is a step in the right direction, I believe that more can be done. Hence, I would suggest that every new Judicial Officer be sent for an exposure stint at any Community Development Council (CDC) or a registered Volunteer Welfare Organisation (VWO) before their appointment. This is to allow each young or inexperienced Judicial Officer to better appreciate the daily challenges that an average citizen faces in life. Such a stint would allow our Magistrates and District Judges to see, firsthand, the struggles of families in dispute and how family background affects juvenile offenders. By allowing these officers to interact with applicants for social welfare, some of them may better appreciate the need sometimes for mercy whilst dispensing justice. And for officers working with a VWO involved in protecting women from violence, they may also gain better insight as to the pain suffered by victims of family violence.",7,508,2014-01-21-T-022-S-00508
2014-01-21-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"I note that whilst the minimum statutory requirements to be a Magistrate and a District Judge have been increased, the minimum qualifying criteria of a Registrar and Deputy Registrar under clause 12 of the Subordinate Courts Act have not been increased. Deputy and Assistant Registrars also play a key role in the Courts especially when they sit in a judicial capacity to decide on applications for summary judgments, for striking out of cases, for assessment of damages and so on. May I ask the Minister to consider instituting an internal Court guideline to ensure that Deputy or Assistant Registrars are suitably qualified and experienced before they are allowed to sit in a judicial capacity.",8,509,2014-01-21-T-022-S-00509
2014-01-21-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"On the renaming of the ""Subordinate Courts"" to ""State Courts"", my personal view is that it is not quite necessary. For many years, our judicial system has been well regarded and well ranked internationally, which Senior Minister of State had alluded to earlier in her speech. The many accolades referred to in the Subordinate Courts Annual Report 2012 from pages 52 to 58 say it all. Whether the Courts are renamed as ""State Courts"" or they remain as ""Subordinate Courts"", the main focus should really be on the many dedicated people running the judicial system.",9,510,2014-01-21-T-022-S-00510
2014-01-21-T-022,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"The new Bill even provides for a Presiding Judge of the State Courts to be someone who is either a High Court Judge or a Judicial Commissioner. Mr Deputy Speaker, I understand that the Chief Justice had felt the renaming necessary so as to raise the standing of the Subordinate Courts. Perhaps, the Minister could clarify how the renaming of the Subordinate Courts would raise the standing of the Courts, as compared to the costs implication of having to change the name of an institution which has been around for many years.",10,511,2014-01-21-T-022-S-00511
2014-01-21-T-022,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank Ms Lim and Mr Lim for their support of the Bill. The Members' response has been encouraging and certainly shows the support that the Subordinate Courts have in this Chamber.",1,512,2014-01-21-T-022-S-00512
2014-01-21-T-022,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"There were several questions that were raised by Mr Lim Biow Chuan. The first was a suggestion that new Judicial Officers could perhaps be attached to a VWO or CDC. That is a suggestion that certainly merits consideration and I will relay that to the Chief Justice and to the Courts, because at the end of the day, we want to be sure that those who dispense justice also have empathy and an understanding of the struggles and difficulties faced by the people who come before the Courts for their disputes and woes to be adjudicated.",2,513,2014-01-21-T-022-S-00513
2014-01-21-T-022,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The second point that Mr Lim had raised was whether the Minister could institute internal guidelines for suitably qualified persons for the Deputy Registrar or Assistant Registrars. The Minister may not, but the Minister will relay this to the Chief Justice as Court guidelines come under the purview of the Chief Justice. But I think that I can say that the Courts do pay a great deal of attention to the appointments of persons to any judicial function, recognising the responsibility that they discharge in their functions.",3,514,2014-01-21-T-022-S-00514
2014-01-21-T-022,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The third point which Mr Lim wanted to know was whether or not the name change was really necessary and particularly so with respect to the costs of the name change. Mr Lim is correct that a name change in and of itself does very little. It is the other things which are done – the appointment of Presiding Judge of the State Courts, the raising of the qualification criteria, all the things which are part and parcel of the Subordinate Courts system, that make it what it is. So, the substance is there.",4,515,2014-01-21-T-022-S-00515
2014-01-21-T-022,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"But nomenclature is also important because it is a reflection of what an entity or an organisation does. In this case, the Subordinate Courts are the Courts that come into the greatest contact with the everyday lives of people. It is the Court that has the greatest interface with the people of Singapore, adjudicating upon their disputes, and helping to resolve many of their difficulties. For that reason, it was felt that the new nomenclature would be better. ""Subordinate Courts"" implies subordinate, slightly lower and lesser in status. ""State Courts"", on the other hand, reflects that everyday interface which is a function of the State in adjudicating the disputes of the people that come before the Court. So, that is the reason for the name change.",5,516,2014-01-21-T-022-S-00516
2014-01-21-T-022,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"With respect to the costs incurred, this would mainly be with regard to the replacement of the signage, name cards and other stationery.

2014-01-21-T-023,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"The Merchant Shipping Bill is a major boost and recognition of the rights of seafarers in Singapore. For the seafarers, the challenges they face at work are multi-faceted. This includes being exposed to the elements, piracy, being constantly away from home and having only limited time with the family. With this Bill, we have set out an equitable framework and system of accountability with the ship-owners that will give due credence to the tough working conditions that our seafarers face at sea. In due course, we should continually review the current penalties for contravention to ensure greater deterrence against violation.",7,574,2014-01-21-T-023-S-00574
2014-01-21-T-023,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"Not only does this Bill provide workplace protection for our seafarers, it also seeks to improve the quality of life for seafarers like any other employee. This includes being entitled to full annual leave without having them sacrifice because of their nature of work which runs over public holidays as well as temporary shore leave and training. For public holidays, seafarers should be similarly compensated with replacement off-in-lieu or payment in lieu. Seafarers, too, would also need their work-life balance just like any employees on land and should not be assumed to be used to an irregular lifestyle. As for regulating the hours of rest for seafarers, a pragmatic approach is taken in relation to the maritime working environment. The division of work and rest hours will have to follow stipulations under the law, with the rest hours properly logged in records. The ship master will have to submit these records of rest to the seafarers at the end of each month. I am heartened to note that these aspects of fair working hours will be captured in the Merchant Shipping Bill which would put seafarers on par with any other employees on land.",8,575,2014-01-21-T-023-S-00575
2014-01-21-T-023,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"Regulating the shipping requirements and environment forms another key thrust in the Merchant Shipping Bill.

2014-01-21-T-023,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"In terms of repatriation and termination of contract for seafarers, the Merchant Shipping Bill provides greater clarity in terms of the criteria and conditions to be met. For example, young sailors can be repatriated if found unfit for life at sea once they have served on a ship for at least four months. All repatriation cases are stated to be at the employers' expense and the seafarer can decide on the location where he is to be repatriated. The Bill will, thus, enforce responsible behaviour on the part of employers and ship-owners.",10,577,2014-01-21-T-023-S-00577
2014-01-21-T-023,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"Similarly, on wages, the Bill has made important provisions that will safeguard the interests of seafarers when unforeseen situations or factors lead to premature termination of contract. For example, this could happen in the case of a shipwreck or loss of ship. The wages of the seafarers are still payable by binding employment agreements. Arrears or non-payment of wages have been a perennial issue faced by seafarers over the years. For example, in early 2013, SMOU had assisted the crew of Aiden Marine to recover unpaid wages of $20,000 when the employer AZ Marine prematurely terminated the crew's contracts. The Bill will help to expedite and resolve similar infringements in the future and, hopefully, reduce the incidence of such cases.",11,578,2014-01-21-T-023-S-00578
2014-01-21-T-023,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"Beyond the legal framework, an important consideration for the seafaring profession would be looking at how best we can enhance the career paths of seafarers and attract more professionals to view it as a viable career. Career progression could be a long-drawn process. For example, a cadet engineer with a diploma will take about eight years to become a chief engineer, while a junior deck officer will take 10 years to become a ship captain. I know of a resident of mine who shared with me that he is keen to enter the shipping industry. He is in his early thirties and has a degree qualification from one of our local universities. Would there be career opportunities for Singaporeans like him to enter into this industry but hopefully on a faster track? To keep pace with the changing employment landscape and needs of the new generation of workers, the relevant authorities can study how to expedite the career tracks for navigation and engineering, bearing in mind the need for competency, safety, skills and experience.",12,579,2014-01-21-T-023-S-00579

The initiative started with a pilot of placing and training 80 locals with ""N"" levels and above qualifications as Certificate of Competency Class 3 cadets over 31 months. To date, the initiative has put 135 locals through the training, with a retention rate of about 75%. Two of the trainees – Mr Afham Hatim Bin Kamarudini and Mr Ahmad Helmi Bin Kamarudin have just graduated from the 31-month programme and they are now full-fledged Class 3 cadets with a monthly salary of $3,000. We have another five more cadets going for certification this year in April.

2014-01-21-T-023,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"The seafarers' employment agreement is an important document that will help protect the welfare and interests of those employed in the industry. I fully agree with clause 14 of the Bill that the seafarer must be familiarised with the agreement, understand it fully and even be allowed to seek advice on it before signing the same. In order to facilitate this to ensure that the seafarer has been given sufficient time to do all of these, especially if the seafarer's native language is not English or if he does not understand English well, then it is important that we mandate through this Bill that the seafarer be given at least a week to study the agreement and seek advice before he is required to sign on it. I feel this is important as it ensures that the seafarer is not forced to sign the agreement before he is given ample time to understand it.",2,583,2014-01-21-T-023-S-00583
2014-01-21-T-023,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"While the Bill helps protect the interests of seafarers, it must also ensure that the employers, too, must be protected. Firstly, any seafarer found furnishing his employer with fake, inaccurate or misleading information or documentation prior to or during the signing of the employment agreement should also be found to contravene this Act and be liable to conviction. Since Singapore's maritime industry is world-class and world-renowned, it is important to protect the integrity in all parts of the sector, including its manpower force. We cannot compromise on the quality of the workforce in the maritime sector, and, therefore, it is important to have a strong deterrent to make sure that the seafarer hired is suitably qualified.",3,584,2014-01-21-T-023-S-00584
2014-01-21-T-023,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Rest for the seafarer is another area where we cannot compromise as this affects the welfare of the seafarer and could also affect the quality of his work.

2014-01-21-T-023,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"This rest period should also extend to the seafarer when he is unwell. It should be mandated that every vessel has a doctor on board, the violation of which will result in a heavy penalty. This will allow a seafarer who is unwell to be attended to urgently and not wait until they reach a port. If the doctor feels that the seafarer should be allowed medical leave of rest to recover, then the employer should be mandated to approve and ensure that the seafarer gets that prescribed rest. Any contravention of both of these rules should then be liable to conviction with a strong penalty as a deterrent.",5,586,2014-01-21-T-023-S-00586
2014-01-21-T-023,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Some of the medical attention needed by seafarers may arise out of work accidents.

2014-01-21-T-023,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Hence, employers should be mandated to send all seafarers on their payroll, especially new ones, for safety and training courses. I would like to urge the MPA to consider that seafarers be allowed employment only upon satisfactory completion of the mandated health and safety courses as is currently done in the construction industry. This will help ensure that seafarers entering the industry already go in with the requisite knowledge and skills on safety standards. MPA may also consider ensuring that all maritime companies mandate that their seafarers spend some pre-assigned hours per year on safety courses. This will help build the safety capabilities in their companies while updating the knowledge of the seafarer and keeping it relevant. In fact, I would even say that it should be mandated that each vessel have a safety officer on board whose main duty is to oversee all safety standards on board and to take measures to promote them and ensure that they are adhered to.",7,588,2014-01-21-T-023-S-00588

2014-01-21-T-023,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Further, the Bill clearly delineates minimum requirements or standards for working conditions and employment of seafarers onboard these ships. An example of such conditions include requirements relating to their employment agreement (clause 14), hours of rest for seafarers working on board ships (clause 16), the manner and timing in which wages shall be paid (clause 20), and the entitlement to have paid annual leave (clause 22). The inclusion of such requirements into our law would increase the working conditions onboard ships as shipowners are now conferred with an explicit obligation to ensure that these conditions are provided for all seafarers that they employ. Where in the past shipowners were allowed free rein over determining the working conditions implemented onboard their ships, the enactment of this Bill will ensure that errant shipowners will no longer be able to mistreat seafarers employed on their ship without facing consequences. Furthermore, shipowners who resort to forced or compulsory labour onboard their ships can now be prosecuted and dealt with severely and strictly.",7,596,2014-01-21-T-023-S-00596

Seafarers would have to follow such procedures for safety training. It is not just training the seafarers but also putting the onus on the shipping companies to ensure that there are procedures in place and they need to carry out the drills. In today's context, where some parts of the sea lanes are under constant threat, in fact, I think shipping companies and seafarers take this type of training very seriously and they will go through their drills.",8,610,2014-01-21-T-023-S-00610

We heard from Mr Tay the efforts of the e2i in partnership with MPA as well as with the Singapore Shipping Association, the training courses that have been launched and how individuals have been impacted by these courses and embarked on meaningful and well-paying careers. Besides safeguarding the well-being of seafarers, MPA will also continue working with our tripartite partners to enhance the training and career progression for seafarers, especially to raise the awareness of Singaporeans of the attractive career opportunities in this area.",9,611,2014-01-21-T-023-S-00611

The passing of this Bill is an important milestone for Maritime Singapore and demonstrates our steadfast commitment to enhancing the well-being of seafarers.

Nevertheless, the full increase in Singapore's subscription to IBRD's capital will be charged to the Consolidated Fund, as the callable capital represents an increase in the Government's financial liabilities.

I understand that voting power at the World Bank is allocated based on the capital stock held by each member. Is the increase in our subscription intended to strengthen our voting power or increase our influence at the Bank? If so, can the Deputy Prime Minister explain what are the tangible benefits that this translates to for Singaporeans? Does it make much of a difference if we raised our vote share from the current 0.05% to 0.25%, and is it worth the full US$672 million?

2014-01-21-T-024,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"First, having strong and effective multilateral institutions is in Singapore's interests. We are small, we are dependent on the rest of the world. We are dependent on a stable and growing world for our people's livelihoods. So, we have a vested interest in strong multilateral institutions. At our current stage of development, quite different from 1966 or even different from 10 or 15 years ago, and given our growing links with developing Asia and the developing world at large, we have to play a responsible role in the multilateral institutions. We cannot be a free rider. We cannot be a free rider expecting to reap the benefits, directly or indirectly, without paying our membership fees. So, that is a basic proposition.",2,642,2014-01-21-T-024-S-00642
2014-01-21-T-024,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"But the second proposition is equally important, which is, that we should only commit to what we can afford and in proportion to our size and role in the global economy. That is something which we study very carefully  how does it fit within our overall budgetary commitments, each year and over the long term? Secondly, how do we compare with other countries  our neighbours, those in the region, as well as those further afield? We should commit in proportion to our size and role in the global economy, and not beyond what we can afford. That is what instructs our calculation of how much we should contribute.",3,643,2014-01-21-T-024-S-00643
2014-01-21-T-024,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"How much have we contributed? The amount that we are contributing will give us a share in the World Bank's capital of about 0.24%, slightly lower than the voting share but that is technicality. So, 0.24%. In fact, that is still significantly lower than our share of the global economy in GDP, for instance. Our share in global GDP is about 0.4% and our share in global trade is significantly more than that. So, our share in the World Bank, an institution responsible for supporting sustainable growth in the developing world, is, in fact, much lower than our share in global GDP and in global trade or in global cross-border investments. So, we are not over-committing.",4,644,2014-01-21-T-024-S-00644
2014-01-21-T-024,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The reason why we are still below our share, as dictated by GDP or trade or cross-border investments, is because we were a developing country. Our starting point was one of a very small contribution. And we are still not an advanced economy. So, we are increasing our share, increasing our contributions, but we are doing it in the right proportion. We are not over-committing. Playing our responsible role, making a significant increase, but we are not over-committing. I am satisfied with that.",5,645,2014-01-21-T-024-S-00645
2014-01-21-T-024,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The amount looks large because we have included the callable capital. In the nature of our contributions to these organisations, the callable capital is significant but it has never been called. In the history of IBRD, it has never been called because the purpose of callable capital is merely to allow the IBRD to issue bonds to finance its operations, and to maintain its AAA rating. The true budgetary cost is what we will pay in, that is, the paid-in capital. And that is the US$38 million increase.",6,646,2014-01-21-T-024-S-00646
2014-01-21-T-024,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"That is not an annual figure. That is US$38 million that I expect to last for quite a while because the IBRD only raises capital once every 10 to 20 years. The last time it raised capital before this round – this was the 2011 round – and the last time before that was 1988. So, even conservatively, let us, say, 10 years, that is US$38 million, or about S$50 million, over 10 years, which is about S$5 million a year. So, it is S$5 million a year which, I think, is not an inordinate amount to contribute to the World Bank, an institution whose effectiveness we have a clear and vested interest in sustaining.",7,647,2014-01-21-T-024-S-00647

The main point I am making though is that you do not expect the callable capital to be called; that is not the way the IBRD is run. The whole purpose of callable capital is for it to maintain its AAA rating. The budgetary cost for us is the paid-in capital. That is something which was reflected in this fiscal year's budgetary estimates and that is the true charge on us. As I mentioned, it really amounts to – when you look at it amortised over 10 years – about S$5 million a year, which is not an inordinate sum.",9,649,2014-01-21-T-024-S-00649

The thriving tuition industry has become a security blanket for many. Now, the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a triennial global survey that evaluates education systems worldwide amongst 15-year-olds. According to the latest PISA report, which sees, of course, Singapore doing very well academically, Singapore has the highest number of students who had one-on-one private tuition. It is understandable when academically weaker students seek extra help through tuition. But when it is reported that even some of our top students from top schools regularly attend tuition classes either on their own accord or encouraged or arranged by their parents, then there is a big cause for concern. The longer we ignore the root causes, the longer we delay in working out a multitude of solutions and thereby allow this thriving shadow education industry to keep growing, the harder it will be for us to trim this elephant to size.",31,687,2014-01-21-T-026-S-00687

Granted, we all learn differently, with different strengths, learning styles and pace for learning. But the solution need not come in the form of physically separating students in different locations all the time in the form of Gifted schools, Normal (Technical) schools and Special schools. The solution can come in the form of scalable and quality programmes and learning support that can penetrate all schools.

And, indeed, at the national level, treading at a realistic pace may be the way forward as there is frequently no one response that is supported by all the different stakeholders in the system. For everyone who prefers less formal exams and rankings, there are others who cannot imagine a world without exams, top schools and tuition.

2014-01-21-T-026,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"And, indeed, all our attainments have been possible because we encourage effort and the pursuit of excellence, create opportunities for all regardless of background, and because parents value education, and teachers are dedicated. While these strengths can also result in an over-emphasis on, for instance, academic results at times, we must be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. We need a balance.",17,726,2014-01-21-T-026-S-00726
2014-01-21-T-026,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Fourth, we have a multi-layered approach to innovation which has served us well. The first layer is system-wide innovation. For example, the current structure of 10 years of basic education, and the multiple pathways are now key features of our system. The second layer is vertical or school-level innovation. For example, we have brought together innovative approaches and specialised programming on a whole-school basis, such as the Independent Schools and specialised schools like Crest and Spectra, SOTA and the Sports Schools. The third is horizontal or curricular-level innovation across all our schools. Innovations in specific areas – we scale across the whole system – to benefit all students in all our schools. For example, we have put in place the STELLAR reading programme, Programme for Active Learning, inquiry-based learning for science and problem-based learning for math, creative approaches for delivering Character and Citizenship Education, etc.",18,727,2014-01-21-T-026-S-00727
2014-01-21-T-026,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Now, this third layer of innovation – at the horizontal-level – is very important. It may not have the same visibility as setting up a specialised school. But its impact is systemic. Teachers are empowered to experiment and try better ways and share these with others. Parents are happy that their children benefit from these programmes without having to attend a particular school. The changes benefit thousands of students across our entire school system. This is why we have been able to help students across schools learn better, and not just in one or two schools.",19,728,2014-01-21-T-026-S-00728
2014-01-21-T-026,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Fifth, for innovation to be successful and sustained, pacing and prioritisation are necessary. Innovations are lasting and yield results, only if they are deeply internalised and owned by all our stakeholders – students, parents and educators.",20,729,2014-01-21-T-026-S-00729
2014-01-21-T-026,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"We are changing at a pace that allows our students, parents and educators to adapt, and to build capacity to sustain these changes. We are also changing in a systematic, consistent way, across all our schools, so that all students can benefit.",21,730,2014-01-21-T-026-S-00730
2014-01-21-T-026,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"We have, in the last few years, made some very important changes, some of which will be implemented in the coming years. Ms Phua has very kindly listed some of these – changes to the PSLE system, reserving Primary 1 places, greater flexibility for Normal stream students, new CCE syllabi, and a Values-in-Action approach, the teaching values and greater emphasis on sports and play. We are also in the midst of looking at scaling online learning. We are stepping up on the engagement of parents. We are implementing applied learning programmes and learning for life programmes across all Secondary schools. Now, all these horizontal changes across schools will have major systemic impact.",22,731,2014-01-21-T-026-S-00731
2014-01-21-T-026,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"In conclusion, I appreciate that Ms Phua has not only been a consistent advocate of a better education system, but also a hands-on practitioner who successfully pioneered the development of Pathlight School. Ms Phua's proposal of a pilot cluster of schools with certain features adds to the list of ideas for innovation. I will give her proposal serious consideration, but I should also caution that having debated many of these issues in my Ministry, there are significant policy and implementation issues that we would have to consider. We also have to set this proposal in the context of the many changes that we are in the midst of implementing. Pacing and prioritisation are critical, and we are at this point rolling out a series of very important horizontal innovations.",23,732,2014-01-21-T-026-S-00732
2014-01-21-T-026,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Our goal is the same – to provide the best possible education to prepare our young for the future.

2014-01-21-T-027,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs how many Singapore Citizens have held citizenship from a foreign nation between 1980 to 2012 annually.,1,738,2014-01-21-T-027-S-00738
2014-01-21-T-027,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,Singapore does not allow dual citizenship. We are a small and young nation and it is important that our citizens have a long-term commitment to building a future together. Allowing Singaporeans to retain or acquire a second citizenship would dilute this commitment.,1,739,2014-01-21-T-027-S-00739
2014-01-21-T-027,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"However, there are a number of Singapore Citizen (SC) minors below the age of 21 who acquired citizenship from another country because they were born overseas in that country, or one of their parents was a foreigner at the time of their birth. In addition, there are children who were Permanent Residents (PRs) obtained under their parents’ sponsorship and who were subsequently granted SC, together with their parents.",2,740,2014-01-21-T-027-S-00740
2014-01-21-T-027,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"SC minors who have foreign citizenship are allowed to keep their foreign citizenship until they turn 21, when they will have to make a decision on which citizenship to retain.

2014-01-21-T-027,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"On average, from 1987 to 2012, there were about 3,400 minors a year who were granted SC and also held foreign citizenships. Data before 1987 are not available.",4,742,2014-01-21-T-027-S-00742

2014-01-21-T-028,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Our bilingual policy rightly encourages Chinese Singaporeans to speak Mandarin rather than the Chinese dialects as it provides a common language which allows Singaporeans to access the wider Chinese culture and economic opportunities.,1,744,2014-01-21-T-028-S-00744
2014-01-21-T-028,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"However, Chinese dialects continue to be used in informal communications, as well as in traditional Chinese arts and cultural forms. For example, they are still used in hawker centres, markets, as well as in getai performances and Chinese opera.",2,745,2014-01-21-T-028-S-00745
2014-01-21-T-028,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"To preserve the use of Chinese dialects, the Chinese Clan Associations organise dialect classes for children, as well as for Singaporeans of all ages who are keen to improve their proficiency in these dialects.",3,746,2014-01-21-T-028-S-00746
2014-01-21-T-028,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"MCCY recognises that the Chinese dialects are part of the Chinese Singaporean culture and heritage. Thus, the National Heritage Board provides grants to several Clan Associations to help preserve their heritage and promote their activities, some of which are conducted in dialect.

2014-01-21-T-029,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the quantum of MRT and bus fare increases sought by each public transport operator in their latest submission; (b) whether the new fare subsidy schemes recommended by the Fare Review Mechanism Committee will be rolled out before any fare increases take place and all eligible commuters given ample time to apply for the subsidy schemes; and (c) how the Ministry will reach out to all commuters to ensure that they benefit from the subsidies they are eligible for.,1,750,2014-01-21-T-029-S-00750
2014-01-21-T-029,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The Public Transport Council (PTC) announced its decision on the 2013 fare adjustment last week. Although both public transport operators had applied for a fare increase of 6.6%, which is the combined fare cap for 2012 and 2013, the PTC approved an overall net fare increase of 3.2%, and rolled over the remaining 3.4% to the 2014 fare review exercise.",1,751,2014-01-21-T-029-S-00751
2014-01-21-T-029,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"I would like to thank the Council for taking into consideration my earlier request during the November 2013 parliamentary sitting for the fare increase not to exceed the average national wage increase for 2013, which should come in at about 4-5%. The 3.2% fare increase is well below this and, hence, public transport fares will continue to be affordable for the average commuter.",2,752,2014-01-21-T-029-S-00752
2014-01-21-T-029,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"At the same time, the PTC decided to implement several enhancements to existing fare concession schemes as recommended by the Fare Review Mechanism Committee (FRMC).

2014-01-21-T-029,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"On its part, the Government has decided to implement fare concession schemes for two groups of commuters who may be most impacted by the fare increase, that is lower-wage workers who are under MOM's Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) Scheme, and persons with disabilities.",5,755,2014-01-21-T-029-S-00755
2014-01-21-T-029,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Eligible recipients will be notified around 6 April to apply for the two concession schemes, which will take effect from 6 July 2014. Transport vouchers will be provided to help them for the interim period between the fare increase on 6 April, and 6 July when the concessions take effect. These being new schemes, we need more time to set up the frameworks and processes, and to cater to potentially half a million applicants.",6,756,2014-01-21-T-029-S-00756
2014-01-21-T-029,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Let me assure the Member that my Ministry, the public transport operators and TransitLink will extensively publicise the enhanced and new concession schemes in the coming weeks, so that potential beneficiaries are made aware and can apply for and enjoy the concessions.",7,757,2014-01-21-T-029-S-00757

2014-01-21-T-030,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"To maintain the collective commitment by all Singaporeans and PRs to national service, enlistment to NS must be applied uniformly and equitably to all enlistees. Therefore, deferments are considered very selectively and only for the few individuals with exceptional talents in the sports, arts and other areas. Even then, the deferment is not for individuals to achieve personal accomplishments for themselves but only allowed when they indicate the ability to achieve national pride for Singapore and why performing their NS duties like everyone else would prevent them from doing so.",1,759,2014-01-21-T-030-S-00759

2014-01-21-T-031,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Studies overseas have shown that excessively long working hours can have a negative impact on productivity, largely due to the adverse effects on workers' physiological and psychological well-being. The studies also show that more flexible working arrangements that better promote work-life harmony can help to improve employees' well-being and productivity. When firms adopt a flexible working culture which is outcome-driven rather than based on hours worked, individuals can better manage their time between work and personal needs. This will, ultimately, benefit businesses as well.",2,764,2014-01-21-T-031-S-00764
