2014-02-21-T-001,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) from 2012 to date, what is the number of notices of traffic offences that are issued to motorists by Traffic Police or LTA after more than one year from the date of offence; and (b) what are the reasons behind the delay in the issuance of such notices.",1,1,2014-02-21-T-001-S-00001
2014-02-21-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs),"Mdm Speaker, in 2012 and 2013, the Traffic Police issued a total of 614,000 notices of traffic offences to motorists for violations committed within this period. About 0.15%, or 900, of such notices were issued more than a year from the date when the offence was committed. The majority involve complex cases where protracted investigations were required to determine the appropriate action to take against the parties involved.",1,2,2014-02-21-T-001-S-00002
2014-02-21-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs),"Delays in the receipt of traffic notices may also arise where they were not successfully delivered to the offender in the first instance. This could be because the registered vehicle owner or the offender did not report a change in his address thereby necessitating further checks, or the registered owner did not furnish the Traffic Police with the particulars of the offender in a timely manner.",2,3,2014-02-21-T-001-S-00003
2014-02-21-T-001,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Madam, I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. It can be quite frustrating for motorists who receive a very delayed notice of offence, especially after they might have thought it had all been forgotten. Would the Ministry consider setting a two- or three-month deadline for the issue of notice of offence from the date the offence was committed, after which the offence should be considered as void or a letter of advisory issued instead. I believe, given today's technology, there could be greater efficiency on the part of the Traffic police to issue timely notice of offence.",1,4,2014-02-21-T-001-S-00004
2014-02-21-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mdm Speaker, 98% of all offences would have the notices issued within seven days. The rest of them would have to be issued quickly but, unfortunately, for this very small number – the 900 of them – or 0.15% could not get to the offender as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, the Police has no power to forgive the offence and, certainly, this discretion should not be given to them. They will have to consult AGC, or by legislation, in order to waive such an offence.",1,5,2014-02-21-T-001-S-00005
2014-02-21-T-001,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Madam, just one more clarification. What about cases where the driver cannot remember what happened at the time the offence was committed or if someone else was driving the vehicle?",1,6,2014-02-21-T-001-S-00006
2014-02-21-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Indeed, these are the kind of cases that cause the delays. Sometimes, there are disputes as to what happened, a dispute as to whether he himself was driving or he disputes that he was actually driving. That is why it becomes protracted. Fortunately for us, this makes up a very small percentage of such offences.",1,7,2014-02-21-T-001-S-00007
2014-02-21-T-002,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether AVA and its contractors follow a set of protocols with regard to monkey-trapping activities; (b) if so, what are these protocols and approved methods and how are they enforced; and (c) whether trappers who are recently found using rubbish bins as traps at nature reserve borders are trappers given permits by AVA.",1,8,2014-02-21-T-002-S-00008
2014-02-21-T-002,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman) (for the Minister of National Development),"Mdm Speaker, all contractors engaged by AVA must comply with AVA's guidelines on the capture, handling and transportation of the monkeys. They can only carry out control operations at designated areas and use methods and equipment approved by AVA. During these operations, they must be on-site to monitor the trap and to remove the trapped monkeys as soon as possible. AVA also conducts random checks on its contractors to ensure their compliance to the guidelines.",1,9,2014-02-21-T-002-S-00009
2014-02-21-T-002,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman) (for the Minister of National Development),"AVA is investigating the case involving its contractor who used rubbish bins as monkey traps, as reported in the media. AVA allows the use of rubbish bins as traps as they do not cause any harm to the monkeys during the capture. The bins are no different from other equipment, such as cages, and could be more effective in capturing monkeys which have grown wary of cages.",2,10,2014-02-21-T-002-S-00010
2014-02-21-T-002,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, I have three supplementary questions. Given the fact that the recent incident actually happened near Upper Pierce Reservoir, which is a nature reserve, whereas the actual reason for culling is meant for residential areas, does it mean then that the permit lacks clarity as to what they can and cannot do? Perhaps, they are to be given proper oral instructions from AVA?",1,11,2014-02-21-T-002-S-00011
2014-02-21-T-002,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"If I could get some clarification as to how much does AVA's each trapper cull and if there is any indication that I can get on how many monkeys have been culled over the last year. Finally, what is the long-term strategy that AVA is planning instead of culling? Particularly, in this case, where if you think about it, rubbish bins are actually a lot more cruel than cages, which at least have some kind of ventilation, and which provides some safety for the animal as well as for the public at large, who happened to be passing by these public areas.",2,12,2014-02-21-T-002-S-00012
2014-02-21-T-002,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Madam, I think there were several questions there. First, on the safety of the animals and the bins, the bin is one of the approved methods and that is not the only one that has been used in Singapore; we use cages. As I have said, monkeys do get familiar and cages are a lot more apparent to them when you put the baits around the cage. The bin traps are also used by the authorities in Hong Kong and they have proven to be effective.",1,13,2014-02-21-T-002-S-00013
2014-02-21-T-002,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"AVA gives clear guidelines to its contractors and there are guidelines for the capture, the handling and transportation of the animals. We try to minimise the discomfort to the animals when the animals are captured. The contactors are expected to be on-site. The moment they set up the traps, the way the bin trays work, is that the spring is at the bottom of the bin. We put baits there and when the animal goes in, and they press on the string, the cover is closed. The contractors are nearby. They are supposed to immediately bring the monkeys to the AVA for inspection.",2,14,2014-02-21-T-002-S-00014
2014-02-21-T-002,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"We are very mindful of the welfare and the well-being of the animals. At the same time, on the question on where they site the traps, the Member is right. We do not send them to the nature reserves. Some of these monkeys are very fast. The contractors are giving the site where the feedback was given, and oftentimes, this is near the residential areas. They will not go into the nature reserves but they set up traps where there are feedback of the sighting of monkeys and the nuisance that has been created by the monkeys.",3,15,2014-02-21-T-002-S-00015
2014-02-21-T-002,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"To the question of how many has been captured by AVA, I think in the region of about 500 has been captured. In 2013 alone, AVA received about 1,800 feedback from the public related to monkeys. I do not think that is a small number. On average, that is about five feedback a day. I think we take it quite seriously.",4,16,2014-02-21-T-002-S-00016
2014-02-21-T-002,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"We want to strike a balance between the nuisance that is created by monkeys and the way we treat the monkeys, in relation to how do we manage the co-existence of the monkeys and human beings. We hope that they continue to be in the nature reserves and continue to be there. The more they come out of that space and intrude on the space of our residents – and our residents are giving us those feedback – we get concerned about that.",5,17,2014-02-21-T-002-S-00017
2014-02-21-T-002,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"In the longer term, we have to try to work with animal welfare groups to ask for their cooperation also to help us mange some of these challenges. Our residents need to also understand how to manage the monkey nuisance but, really, it is very tough. We live in an urban environment. Many of our youngsters grow up in an urban setting, not quite used to such intrusions, if I may call it.",6,18,2014-02-21-T-002-S-00018
2014-02-21-T-002,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"The Member also asked about the long-term plans of AVA. AVA looks at it on both perspectives  looking at the welfare and well-being of the animals, at the same time, understanding the concerns and responding to the feedback that I have received by the residents when it comes to the monkey nuisance.",7,19,2014-02-21-T-002-S-00019
2014-02-21-T-003,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,asked the Minister for Education from 2010 to 2013 (a) what is the total amount of tuition grants given to international students in the Polytechnics and publicly-funded Universities who defaulted on their agreement to work in a Singapore-based company for three years upon graduation; and (b) what actions are taken to recover the tuition grants.,1,20,2014-02-21-T-003-S-00020
2014-02-21-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Mdm Speaker, International students who receive tuition grants are required to work in a Singapore-based company for three years upon graduation to supplement our labour force.",1,21,2014-02-21-T-003-S-00021
2014-02-21-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"For those who graduated between 2010 and 2013, about eight in 10 international students who received tuition grants in our Polytechnics and Autonomous Universities had either started serving their tuition grant bonds promptly upon graduation and contribute immediately to Singapore's economy, or have been granted approval by MOE to defer their service obligation to pursue further studies. This does not mean that the remaining international students are in default. Some did not start work immediately upon graduation as they have gone overseas for further study but did not seek deferment approval from MOE, some are in the midst of seeking deferment approval, and some are still seeking employment.",2,22,2014-02-21-T-003-S-00022
2014-02-21-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"MOE has in place bond tracking and enforcement measures to track tuition grant recipients for bond fulfilment. However, the current tracking and enforcement efforts need to be tightened to facilitate more immediate and closer tracking of tuition grant recipients who had not yet started work upon graduation, or who have not sought formal approval for deferment. As MOE is tightening the processes and tracking is still in progress, the final figures are not currently available.",3,23,2014-02-21-T-003-S-00023
2014-02-21-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Action will be taken against those who default on their service obligations by pursuing liquidated damages from these individuals. Where liquidated damages cannot be recovered, their status as bond defaulters will be taken into consideration should they subsequently apply to work or reside in Singapore.",4,24,2014-02-21-T-003-S-00024
2014-02-21-T-003,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Mdm Speaker, two in 10 translates to 20% who did not seek permission from MOE for deferment and they did not start work. Is this correct, since eight in 10 seek MOE's permission or work immediately? So, two in 10 based on the figure given by the Minister works out to about 780. I would like to ask the Minister how much was recovered to-date.",1,25,2014-02-21-T-003-S-00025
2014-02-21-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"I thank the Member for the supplementary question. As I have said, the two in 10 does not mean that they are in default. Some did not start work immediately upon graduation as they have gone overseas for further study but did not seek deferment approval. Some are in the midst of seeking deferment approval. And some are still seeking employment. Therefore, the other question about how much is the amount is not relevant.",1,26,2014-02-21-T-003-S-00026
2014-02-21-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I would like to ask the Minister is there a bond for the international students that seek deferment and is there a maximum duration that is allowed for these students to have their deferment.",1,27,2014-02-21-T-003-S-00027
2014-02-21-T-003,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The question on if there is a bond  they are required to come back to fulfil the tuition grant bond, so the answer is ""yes"". The second question is how long is the deferment  it depends on the nature of the course that they are pursuing. If they are doing a PhD, for instance, the deferment would be longer. If they are doing a Masters programme, for instance, then it would be shorter. It varies on a case-by-case basis.",1,28,2014-02-21-T-003-S-00028

2014-02-21-T-004,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) if he will provide an update on the negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP); (b) what are the prospects for China to be included in the TPP and the USA in the RCEP before negotiations are concluded; and (c) what Singapore can do to facilitate making the RCEP and TPP more inclusive.,1,30,2014-02-21-T-004-S-00030
2014-02-21-T-004,Lim Hng Kiang,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"Mdm Speaker, both the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) are envisioned as high-quality agreements to deepen regional economic integration. They serve as possible pathways to an eventual Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP).",1,31,2014-02-21-T-004-S-00031
2014-02-21-T-004,Lim Hng Kiang,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),TPP negotiations started in March 2010 and there have been 19 formal negotiating rounds to-date. The last TPP Ministerial Meeting was held in Singapore in December 2013. The Ministers had a good discussion on the potential way forward for many outstanding issues in the text. TPP ministers will be meeting again this month from 22 to 25 February 2014 and we expect further progress to be made.,2,32,2014-02-21-T-004-S-00032
2014-02-21-T-004,Lim Hng Kiang,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),The RCEP negotiations only commenced in May 2013. The third round of negotiations was recently held in Kuala Lumpur from 20 to 24 January 2014. Negotiations on a broad range of issues under the scope of the proposed agreement are thus still at a relatively early stage. The fourth negotiating round will be held in China in April 2014.,3,33,2014-02-21-T-004-S-00033
2014-02-21-T-004,Lim Hng Kiang,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"Both the TPP and RCEP are designed to be open and inclusive agreements. Any APEC economy interested to join the TPP, including China, will have to initiate and complete bilateral consultations with existing TPP Parties and secure a consensus agreement for its membership. However, as negotiations intensify and TPP Parties focus on finalising the agreement, prospective members will have less time to conclude those consultations. Nonetheless, as the world's second largest economy and a key link in the Asia Pacific's supply chains, China can contribute to regional economic integration should it decide to join the TPP.",4,34,2014-02-21-T-004-S-00034
2014-02-21-T-004,Lim Hng Kiang,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"As for RCEP, negotiations currently involve ASEAN and its FTA partners – namely China, South Korea, Japan, India, Australia and New Zealand – in the first instance. Other interested economic partners will be able to join the RCEP following the conclusion of negotiations.",5,35,2014-02-21-T-004-S-00035
2014-02-21-T-004,Lim Hng Kiang,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"Singapore plays an active role in the negotiations to secure our economic interests. We also contribute where we can to facilitate the process. For example, Singapore hosted the TPP Ministerial Meeting in December 2013, and over the next four days. We also hosted some of the earlier negotiating Rounds – Round 16 in March 2013 and Round 6 in March 2010.",6,36,2014-02-21-T-004-S-00036
2014-02-21-T-004,Lim Hng Kiang,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"Singapore meets with interested countries to share about the TPP and RCEP process. Indeed, the TPP started out as the P4 FTA, otherwise known as the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership (TPSEP), comprising Singapore, Brunei, Chile and New Zealand. Singapore, together with the founding members, actively brought onboard other like-minded countries, starting with the USA in 2008. Today, there are 12 members in the TPP.",7,37,2014-02-21-T-004-S-00037
2014-02-21-T-004,Lim Hng Kiang,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"Both the TPP and RCEP are important agreements that will further liberalise trade and facilitate regional economic integration, promote growth and create jobs. As we work expeditiously towards their conclusion, Singapore remains firmly guided by the need to ensure that these plurilateral FTAs contribute towards strengthening the multilateral trading system. In this way, we reaffirm rather than detract from the primacy of global free trade.",8,38,2014-02-21-T-004-S-00038
2014-02-21-T-004,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Minister for his reply. Could the Minister elaborate on how relevant TPP is given that you have the absence of Korea, Taiwan, and China? The second question is, will the TPP and RCEP be successful if there is the mutual exclusion of China and the US respectively? I know there is avenue for them to join at the later stage but, given that the rules would have been set by the founding members, would that make admission difficult for these two major economic powers?",1,39,2014-02-21-T-004-S-00039
2014-02-21-T-004,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Speaking from Singapore's economic interests' point of view, we have already bilateral FTAs with China, Korea and Taiwan. As part of ASEAN, we also have FTAs with Korea and China. So, it is not that we do not have preferential trade access to these countries. Similarly, for RCEP, China is in it. The US, so far, has not expressed interest in it. So, we must look at RCEP and TPP as separate but sometimes overlapping plurilateral agreements.",1,40,2014-02-21-T-004-S-00040
2014-02-21-T-005,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the current number of coffeeshops located at or near HDB flats that are allowed to operate 24 hours; (b) what is the current number of supermarkets and convenience stores located within HDB housing estates that are allowed to operate 24 hours; (c) what actions are taken to minimise the inconvenience and noise to residents caused by these 24-hour operations; and (d) whether HDB can consider curtailing such operating hours to reduce the noise and inconvenience to residents living within close proximity to these premises.,1,41,2014-02-21-T-005-S-00041
2014-02-21-T-005,Lee Yi Shyan,The Senior Minister of State for National Development and Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yi Shyan) (for the Minister for National Development),There are currently about 250 coffee shops and 170 supermarkets and convenience stores located within HDB estates which are operating 24 hours a day.,1,42,2014-02-21-T-005-S-00042
2014-02-21-T-005,Lee Yi Shyan,The Senior Minister of State for National Development and Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yi Shyan) (for the Minister for National Development),"To minimise potential inconvenience and noise, HDB will engage such operators to put in place appropriate measures before they begin operations. These include restricted times for delivery of goods by suppliers, restrictions on unpacking activities at night and switching off vehicle engines during loading and unloading of goods. Coffeeshop operators are additionally required to operate their outdoor refreshment areas only within the hours of 6.00 am to 11.00 pm. HDB conducts regular inspections, including late night and early morning inspections to ensure that the operators adhere to the specified measures.",2,43,2014-02-21-T-005-S-00043

In situations where there are repeated complaints, HDB will work with the relevant Government agencies to ensure that these facilities do not generate noise and inconvenience to surrounding residents.",3,44,2014-02-21-T-005-S-00044
2014-02-21-T-005,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State this  before HDB approves such operations in the estates, how does HDB engage grassroots leaders or other stakeholders to seek their opinions and also to discuss how to mitigate any inconveniences to residents? The Senior Minister of State talked about restrictions on delivery times  can he elaborate what are the times that are allowed for these operators to receive supplies of their goods?",1,45,2014-02-21-T-005-S-00045
2014-02-21-T-005,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Mdm Speaker, generally, HDB does not specify or restrict the time of operation of business establishments in the estate. That is the general rule. In other words, businesses are free to operate in the hours they deem fit, but for certain areas such as the Outdoor Restriction Areas (ORA), HDB will consult the advisors and grassroots organisations to ensure that the ORA operators operate within the specific hours, such as stopping operations before 11.00 pm.",1,46,2014-02-21-T-005-S-00046
2014-02-21-T-005,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"We also should realise that 24-hour shops and supermarkets exist for a purpose  there is demand and they cater to workers who work night shifts such as taxi drivers and healthcare workers. Some of them, indeed, serve to cater to that demand.",2,47,2014-02-21-T-005-S-00047
2014-02-21-T-005,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"In balancing the needs of the residents, we have to take a balanced approach. Yes, there have been complaints but the complaints are rather small in perspective. For example, last year, HDB received 60 cases of feedback on noise disturbances from 24-hour coffee shops. This is about 5% of the 1,200 coffee shops that there are altogether. There is less than 1% complaints about 24-hour supermarkets. These are manageable. But we also realise that for specific stores and supermarkets, there may be repeated infringement. In those cases, we really got to work very closely with the advisors and grassroots organisations to ensure that the business owners know what are the requirements and HDB will enforce those requirements.",3,48,2014-02-21-T-005-S-00048
2014-02-21-T-006,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what steps does MPA take to bring parties responsible for oil spills in our waters to task; and (b) whether reports of the actions taken against such parties may be open for public scrutiny.,1,49,2014-02-21-T-006-S-00049

2014-02-21-T-006,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"Lastly, the fact that three collisions happened in a span of about a couple of weeks  does it mean that our waterways are stretched beyond their sustainable capacity, and so would MPA consider using other methods beyond dispersants? As I understand it, a study showed that this method where oil and dispersants are mixed together is actually 52 times more toxic when combined. Is MPA doing any other studies to overcome this kind of problems?",3,55,2014-02-21-T-006-S-00055

First, we have conducted briefings to the shipping community to reinforce the importance of safety of navigation in Singapore waters. We had the first briefing on 13 February. We are also promulgating the Port Marine and Shipping Circulars to the shipping and hovercraft communities, emphasising the importance of navigational safety and maintaining vigilance while navigating. The POCC also broadcasts messages to these vessels at any point in time, when necessary, to remind them of safety aspects while navigating. At the same time, we are working with a few organisations and countries to develop a safe passage guide for all mariners navigating in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. These efforts will make our waters safer for navigation and we will keep on bringing home the message that safety is key. As soon as our investigation findings are ready, we will share it with the shipping community.",4,59,2014-02-21-T-006-S-00059

However, we can only sustain wage increases if we succeed in boosting productivity. Let me put this in another way. Without good productivity growth, if we try to push wages up, we will end up with either higher consumer prices, or squeezed profit margins that hurt both businesses and, ultimately, jobs. Firms will either pass on higher wage costs to consumers through higher prices, especially in the domestic service industries, or else they will become less competitive.

2014-02-21-T-009,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"The value of virtual currencies can also fluctuate greatly within a short period of time. For example, the price of one Bitcoin peaked above US$1,100 in December 2013 and has since dropped to around US$700 in early February 2014.",4,356,2014-02-21-T-009-S-00356
2014-02-21-T-009,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"MAS has, therefore, been advising individuals and businesses to think twice and be cautious about accepting or dealing in virtual currencies. Many countries have likewise warned of the risks of accepting or trading in virtual currencies. However, there is currently no international consensus on the regulatory treatment of virtual currencies. MAS will closely monitor how widely virtual currencies are used in Singapore, the risks they pose, and international developments, and will consider the need to introduce regulations where appropriate.",5,357,2014-02-21-T-009-S-00357
2014-02-21-T-010,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs whether there are measures in place to ensure that immigration officers on duty at immigration checkpoints across Singapore have sufficient rest breaks so that their attention levels do not suffer as a result of fatigue and long hours of repetitive work.,1,358,2014-02-21-T-010-S-00358
2014-02-21-T-010,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Our checkpoints are operational round the clock, every day of the week. To meet this demand, the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers at the checkpoints work on shifts. The morning and afternoon shifts last seven hours each, and the night shift lasts 10 hours, which usually includes two to three hours of low traffic volume during the night. ICA officers are given a meal break and a rest break during their shift. Overall, they work an eight-day shift cycle with days on duty and days off, with total normal working hours during the cycle of 42 to 44 hours.",1,359,2014-02-21-T-010-S-00359
2014-02-21-T-010,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"The officers are monitored by their supervisors for signs of fatigue. Over-time work, which may be necessary during peak periods, is closely regulated. To maintain officers' awareness of operational fatigue, regular advice and updates on fatigue management are also disseminated to them.",2,360,2014-02-21-T-010-S-00360
2014-02-21-T-010,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"MHA reviews ICA's manpower situation on a regular basis. Every two to three years, ICA conducts the Organisational Health Survey (OHS), during which officers can provide feedback on a range of issues, including workload and working hours. Operational fatigue was not highlighted as an area of concern by ICA officers during the last OHS conducted in 2011.",3,361,2014-02-21-T-010-S-00361
2014-02-21-T-011,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew,asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) what is the Ministry's assessment of the civil unrest in Thailand; (b) what are the implications for Singapore of the outcome of the Thai elections; and (c) what is the economic impact of prolonged unrest for businesses in Singapore and ASEAN.,1,362,2014-02-21-T-011-S-00362
2014-02-21-T-011,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Thailand held elections on 2 February 2014. The announcement of the final results will take some time, since voting has not been completed. In the meantime, demonstrations continue in Bangkok and several other provinces, with occasional outbreaks of violence. Bangkok and its surrounding districts remain under a state of emergency imposed by the Thai government last month.",1,363,2014-02-21-T-011-S-00363
2014-02-21-T-011,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Singapore naturally watches these developments with concern. Thailand is an important country and the second largest economy in ASEAN. It contributes actively to the building of a stable and prosperous ASEAN Community. Thus far, we have not observed significant economic disruptions resulting from the unrest in Thailand. Supply chains remain mostly in place and Singaporean companies in Thailand have not encountered major disruptions to their operations, although they reported a slight drop in overall business volumes. However, businesses also take political and security considerations into account. Prolonged unrest could affect confidence and the business environment, which, in turn, could be a setback for Thailand and even ASEAN as a whole.",2,364,2014-02-21-T-011-S-00364
2014-02-21-T-011,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"It is, therefore, our hope that all quarters in Thailand will be able to find a political solution and work towards the restoration of peace and order in the country so that the situation will return to normal as soon as possible.",3,365,2014-02-21-T-011-S-00365
