2014-03-12-T-002,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, since 2011, the Government has set out to foster social cohesion and to build an inclusive society through the Budget. While an inclusive society means different things to different people, it is important to know that the fundamental tenet of an inclusive society is a tolerant and respectful embrace of the cultural values that each community in Singapore holds dear. In the context of the new normal in Singapore's society, Singaporeans are increasingly more vocal and want their views to be heard. I believe that in fostering multiculturalism, public dialogue and constant consultations are the way forward.",1,5,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00005
2014-03-12-T-002,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"In the case of the recent hijab issue, to the best of my understanding, the dialogue that was conducted with the representatives of the Malay community was more of a platform for the Government to convey its stance rather than a dialogue. This is because the Government has already come to the decision of not allowing hijab to be worn prior to the dialogue session instead of making a decision at or after the session.",2,6,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00006
2014-03-12-T-002,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"I am of the view that the Government should enhance not only the manner in which it communicates but also its attitude when forming the communications. At the same time, consultation with one community alone is inadequate, as it may lead to hasty conclusions and unnecessary assumptions. The more constructive approach would be public consultations conducted with different stakeholders and the different ethnic communities.",3,7,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00007
2014-03-12-T-002,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Singaporeans from the different ethnic communities understand that the final policy outcomes may not go according to their preferences. Nonetheless, it is hoped that the Government should also understand that the process is equally important to them. It is the responsibility of any government not to overtly impose its assumptions on any issue, particularly on sensitive and emotional issues. Rather, it should base its understanding on scientific findings and in the event that such information is not available, commission a study on the matter.",4,8,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00008
2014-03-12-T-002,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"The Government should also make available information that it has. Public engagement and consultations that adopt a more transparent, forthright and comprehensive approach will allow us to better understand the issues at large, the context and the nuances behind each issue.",5,9,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00009
2014-03-12-T-002,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"I hope the Minister would agree with me that such an approach would bring us closer to a consensus that is workable, productive and acceptable by the various stakeholders involved. That should be the way forward towards an inclusive society and a multicultural Singapore.",6,10,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00010
2014-03-12-T-002,Hawazi Daipi,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education and Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Hawazi Daipi),"Mdm Chair, I agree with the Ministry's proposed plan to set up a new tribunal to deal with feuding neighbours who are not able or not willing to settle their disputes. In cases where the voluntary dispute resolution system does not work, we need a legal recourse.",1,11,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00011
2014-03-12-T-002,Hawazi Daipi,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education and Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Hawazi Daipi),"I believe the Tribunal will help reduce the frustration of the aggrieved party and prevent the differences between neighbours from escalating. The community dispute resolution framework could potentially provide a mechanism to contain and end neighbourly disputes in an impartial, systematic and orderly manner, with the force and authority of the law, where necessary.",2,12,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00012
2014-03-12-T-002,Hawazi Daipi,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education and Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Hawazi Daipi),"But, Madam, there are two things to note. First, the crucial role of our grassroots leaders, especially our residents' committee members, who work behind the scenes to prevent many disagreements from snowballing into full blown conflicts and for organising programmes to promote good neighbourly ties and inculcate civic-mindedness. Legislation and enforcement should only be taken as a last resort. The tribunal will be important, but the personal outreach of our grassroots leaders (GRLs) may still be able to foster goodwill between disputing neighbours and encourage residents to take ownership of their private disputes. For that to be effective, our GRLs should be trained to deal with the different types of disputes.",3,13,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00013
2014-03-12-T-002,Hawazi Daipi,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education and Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Hawazi Daipi),"Second, the value of mediation. Despite the problems that we face, mediation is still very important. The community dispute resolution framework should also be accessible, cheap and fast and its proceedings should be simple and users should not require formal legal representation. May I get the Minister's comments, please?",4,14,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00014
2014-03-12-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Mdm Chair, a few days ago, an announcement was made that the Government is planning to set up a tribunal to adjudicate what was described as ""intractable community disputes"". It was also mentioned that this was part of a broader framework for the management of disputes in the community. Could the Minister share more details about this broader framework for dealing with community disputes?",1,15,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00015
2014-03-12-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),I understand that the aim of the framework is to promote good neighbourliness and to encourage neighbours to resolve disputes amicably where possible. Could the Minister share what additional measures might be taken to encourage more neighbours to use mediation before going to the tribunal?,2,16,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00016
2014-03-12-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Apart from dispute resolution mechanisms, is the Government also considering a change in the legal framework to deal with neighbourhood nuisance? This would include, for example, developing rules to deal with issues such as noise from neighbours and in public areas such as void decks, and also other elements of nuisance such as smoke from burning of papers and incense.",3,17,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00017
2014-03-12-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"At the moment, the authorities are unable to do much because there are no clear rules on what are the acceptable levels of these sorts of disamenities. While reasonable people may come to some agreement on what is acceptable, if parties become unreasonable and press for their rights, it is not exactly clear where these would fall.",4,18,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00018
2014-03-12-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Exact rules may be developed as part of the community engagement that the Ministry plans to embark on in relation to the tribunal. I do believe that having such rules would be helpful, at least as a starting point for parties in their negotiations.",5,19,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00019
2014-03-12-T-002,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Madam, many Members in this House are no strangers to community disputes within our constituencies. This is perhaps expected, given the high residential density in local housing estates and personal spaces are inevitably infringed on now and then. The Community Mediation Centre (CMC) is, therefore, useful. However, those that could not make it to the CMC or could not be resolved at the CMC are the ones that can be most challenging and energy-consuming for everyone, including grassroots leaders, Government agencies and neutral innocent neighbours.",1,20,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00020
2014-03-12-T-002,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"In an article in Saturday's The Straits Times, which also quoted Minister Lawrence Wong, it was stated that about 60% of meditation applications could not proceed because one party did a ""no show"". According to CMC's 2011/2012 Annual Report, of the cases that did go through mediation, about 30% could not be settled. A back-of-the-envelope estimation reveals that about 72% of applications have gone unresolved per year. This figure does not include disputes where both parties refuse to even try to settle it at CMC. In essence, the current CMC is not sufficiently empowered to have the teeth to bite.",2,21,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00021
2014-03-12-T-002,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Hence, I am glad that the Ministry is considering a tribunal framework and I hope that this cut will help tip the balance in favour of it. At the same time, would the Ministry consider putting in place mandatory mediation, once an application is made but prior to the tribunal hearing? In serious cases where both parties refuse to go to CMC for mediation, could neutral parties, such as neighbours, apply for mediation on their behalf, so that at least there is a way of getting them to come to the table and resolve it? This is to offer a last chance for both parties to resolve their disputes, fully knowing that the next step requires them to face a judge in Court and comply with the Court's decision, even if it is against their will. Also, this is a last shot at preserving goodwill between the parties and, therefore, preserving harmony within the community.",3,22,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00022
2014-03-12-T-002,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Madam, we live in a diverse society with our own individual uniqueness or quirks. Understanding the concept of co-existence and accepting our diversity is key in maintaining harmony in environments where we work, play or live in. We must not only tap on soft approaches to inculcate the right culture, but we must also be prepared to have concrete measures in safeguarding our much valued peace and harmony.",4,23,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00023
2014-03-12-T-002,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),"At my block visits and Meet-the-People Sessions, it is not uncommon to hear residents complain about their neighbours. For many, their relationships with their neighbours have become so toxic, having festered for so long, that they just want their neighbours to suffer, sending the Police to warn them, sending the Town Council staff to warn them, sending the HDB staff to harass them, and now, hoping to also send their Member of Parliament.",1,24,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00024
2014-03-12-T-002,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),"Often, the issues which triggered the disputes appear quite minor  flower pots cluttering the area, dog urine, dripping wet clothes, noisy children. By the time their disputes come to us, they would have escalated to the point where it would often be too late. Some, stewing in anger, would refuse mediation. If such a situation is left to fester, however, it not only makes life quite unpleasant for themselves, but also affects other residents and damages the community spirit in the neighbourhood.",2,25,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00025
2014-03-12-T-002,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),"In this regard, I welcome the move to set up a tribunal with the power to order both parties to go for mediation and to impose judgements and sanctions. But sending disputes to the tribunal should only be a last resort. While it would restore a semblance of peace in the neighbourhood, it would probably destroy the possibility of them having any kind of relationship after that. We need to focus on educating people to take early steps to try to resolve their disputes and to do it in a positive and constructive way. We should also train more people in the neighbourhoods to help those involved in conflict, and to facilitate processes that enable each person to understand another's perspective.",3,26,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00026
2014-03-12-T-002,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),But how do we encourage residents to take greater ownership for private disputes? I would urge the Minister to beef up the community resources available to residents and to mount a campaign on this.,4,27,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00027
2014-03-12-T-002,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),"Disputes can get more complicated, however, when it involves people with mental illness. Some cause their neighbours grief by constant abuse and other behaviour which can make life quite miserable for them. I would urge the Minister to strengthen the mechanism for managing disputes which involve residents with mental illness, ensuring that residents are protected and also that proper diagnosis and treatment be made mandatory for those who need it.",5,28,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00028
2014-03-12-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"Madam, curries, flower pots, music, children running, incense and even alarm clocks – all seemingly innocuous, but it is often the simple things that serve as the spark for neighbour disputes. I often cite the case of two gentlemen that I have met previously, who have been neighbours for 15 years and had feuded for 13 of those years. When I met the first neighbour on my house visit, he complained about this neighbour. I also spotted a pencil line on the wall. I asked the second neighbour and realised it was the border, the de facto no man's land that no orchid or hydrangea should ever cross. They have known each other for many years, by names too flowery for parliamentary decorum, but with the help of our volunteers, we formally introduced them to each other. To our surprise, the curse was broken. Learning each other's names perhaps made the issue now too human. So, now there is peace, there is embarrassment, too, but largely peace.",1,29,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00029
2014-03-12-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"This is perhaps one miraculous resolution that we have had. I joined fellow parliamentary colleagues in calling for a review of the legislation over the last year. Madam, I am heartened to hear that the tribunal has been announced and it will have additional powers proposed that will help to resolve long-standing cases.",2,30,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00030
2014-03-12-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"However, I wish to ask the Minister how soon we can expect the tribunal to be in place, what are the exact powers vested with the tribunal. More importantly, I hope it does not become the first port of call. What other means have the Ministry considered to build stronger community ties, further encourage mediation and reduce the surge in neighbour disputes?",3,31,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00031

2014-03-12-T-002,Hawazi Daipi,Mr Hawazi Daipi,"Two, I understand that the selection and assessment process involves essays, situational tests and interviews. Would this process deter youths who do not write and speak well or those who have to work part-time and, therefore, may not be able to spend the time to finetune an essay or prepare for interviews, from applying?",4,36,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00036
2014-03-12-T-002,Hawazi Daipi,Mr Hawazi Daipi,"Three, the diversity of participants is important as it enhances the learning experience, and their abilities should be relevant to the project they want to work on. How will the Ministry ensure there is diversity among applicants and the selected candidates? Will funds be made available for them to ensure that they can cover transport, meals and other needs during the programme?",5,37,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00037
2014-03-12-T-002,Hawazi Daipi,Mr Hawazi Daipi,"The programme is a meaningful endeavour and it is full of promise. Among others, it can help reduce the drop in volunteerism among youths as they progress from school to the workforce. What are MCCY's plans to keep the participants engaged upon completion of community service programmes bearing in mind the many competing demands amidst a competitive environment?",6,38,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00038
2014-03-12-T-002,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Madam, volunteerism can shape and empower youths to become active citizens. Last year, the Volunteer Youth Corps (VYC) was launched. Can the Minister give an update on VYC?",1,39,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00039
2014-03-12-T-002,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Some people have noted that VYC community partners are required to assign a dedicated staff to conduct impact evaluation, facilitate learning and reflection of VYC members even if it is for a small project. If so, criteria may favour only fairly sizeable NPOs and disadvantage smaller resource-strapped NPOs and unwittingly stumping their growth.",2,40,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00040
2014-03-12-T-002,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"To encourage more bottom-up initiatives and inclusivity, can the Minister (a) level the playing field by tweaking the details of the VYC implementation; (b) elaborate on other youth engagement and development efforts and how NYC will strengthen itself to cope with it; and (c) enlighten us on the plans to rally youths around our nation, in view of Singapore's 50th birthday in 2015?",3,41,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00041
2014-03-12-T-002,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Madam, in Singapore, many youths are active volunteers while they are in school, possibly because of school-based programmes and a facilitated environment. When youths graduate into the corporate world, career takes precedence, particularly for those between ages 23 and 30. Time, opportunities, support become obstacles and many drop out as a result.",4,42,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00042
2014-03-12-T-002,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"However, given the rise in corporate citizenry and many companies now trying to get into CSR and understanding how to do so, youth engagement and CSR can go hand in hand but I think it needs to be structured and facilitated.",5,43,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00043
2014-03-12-T-002,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I hope that MCCY would do more to spur active corporate citizenry, invest in intermediary organisations to set up programmes and match-make employers and youths in giving through the various stages of their life.

2014-03-12-T-002,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"NVPC's Individual Giving Survey 2012 showed that volunteering rates peak when youths are in school. From a high of 55% for youths aged 15 to 19, the volunteerism rate drops significantly when they leave school and enter the workforce. I am not surprised. Young working adults have other competing priorities but we know many would still like to contribute to the community.",2,46,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00046
2014-03-12-T-002,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),One way to address this issue is to integrate the spirit of giving and community involvement into the workplace and to give working adults opportunities to participate in corporate volunteering or philanthropy programmes. Corporate giving does not always have to be in monetary terms. Employees volunteering for worthy social causes represent a meaningful way of corporate giving. Will the Ministry encourage and promote such forms of corporate giving? Can the Ministry share its plans to do so?,3,47,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00047

To cite the analogy that Mr George Yeo once gave, we want to let Singaporeans nurture our own ancestral roots, but these roots must all support the same Singapore tree.

But since Mr Patrick Tay was not here to file the cut, she does not have the opportunity to respond. I would just say that I agree with Dr Teo that the CDCs play an important role in strengthening social harmony, and MCCY and PA will study how best to support the CDCs to do more in this area.",9,58,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00058

2014-03-12-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"By showing care and concern for our neighbours, we can make Singapore a better home for all, and I emphasise community ownership, as many Members here did just now as well, because the effort has to come from ourselves. We can live peacefully together if we show consideration and learn how to give and take. To this end, I agree with many Members like Ms Irene Ng and Mr Hawazi Daipi that citizens should try to resolve their personal conflicts amicably, amongst themselves.",12,61,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00061
2014-03-12-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We have spoken to some stakeholders on managing community disputes. Many say that building strong neighbourly ties can help to reduce conflict. If neighbours know one another, they will be more likely to broach issues sensitively and come to a consensus. Most of the people we consulted called for more public education efforts to encourage consideration and graciousness in our community and we agree with them as well as with suggestions from Members to put more effort in this area because day-to-day acts of kindness will help to make our communities a more pleasant place to live.",13,62,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00062
2014-03-12-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Every day, there are many Singaporeans practising good neighbourliness and kindness in their communities. Like Mrs Chandra Sivarama Krishnan – she has been there to help her elderly Chinese neighbour Mdm Ah Ho for 20 years. Her neighbour can only converse in Chinese, but the language barrier has not stopped Mrs Chandra from reaching out. Though they can only communicate through hand signals, Mrs Chandra helps her neighbour with reading letters received in English and she explains the contents as best as she can. She also checks on her neighbour regularly to make sure that she is doing well. Once, when the electricity supply was cut off, she helped to ensure that the problem was fixed. Her story shows that kindness can go beyond the boundaries of race and language, and these are the acts of kindness we want to promote.",14,63,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00063

2014-03-12-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"At the same time, we recognise that there are some who need help resolving tensions with their neighbours. It is sometimes useful to have a neutral party to help disputing parties communicate better. Grassroots leaders already undertake this role and they do their best to informally mediate disputes between neighbours.",16,65,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00065
2014-03-12-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Residents can also seek formal mediation at the Community Mediation Centre (CMC). It has a fairly good success rate. Out of the 521 cases heard last year, about 70% were successfully resolved. We believe that mediation continues to be a very important process as both parties agree on a solution, so there is ownership and responsibility to follow through. It also helps to preserve and mend relationships, so that neighbours can continue living harmoniously alongside one another. So, we also intend, as part of our enhanced framework, to increase the CMC's capacity and provide more mediation training to grassroots leaders.",17,66,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00066
2014-03-12-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"However, as several Members have noted, we cannot compel people to go for mediation. Currently, 60% of the cases registered with CMC do not turn up.

2014-03-12-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Several Members spoke about some of these very difficult cases and ""deadlocked disputes"". I share their concerns and that is why we had earlier set up an inter-agency team involving my Ministry, together with MinLaw, MHA, MND, and the team has proposed several measures to strengthen our community dispute resolution framework.",19,68,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00068
2014-03-12-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"A key part of the framework is a Community Dispute Resolution Tribunal to adjudicate difficult cases between neighbours. The tribunal will have the powers to mandate mediation, to give parties the chance to communicate and compromise. The tribunal can also make judgements and issue orders which will have to be complied with, failing which there will be consequences including prosecution. The tribunal will provide legal recourse for difficult cases and especially for aggrieved parties. But I must qualify that the tribunal should neither be the first recourse nor the main way we resolve our disputes. This would be counter-productive. We want to promote community ownership and collective responsibility and mediation should remain the first priority. Ms Irene Ng also agrees with that and several Members as well. We do want the tribunal to be there but it should be there as a last resort, for the difficult cases.",20,69,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00069
2014-03-12-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For the tribunal to work well, we will require better frontline responses to community disputes and more effective enforcement capabilities.

2014-03-12-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Vikram Nair also asked about clear rules and penalties. As I have mentioned earlier, our key thrust is on public education and mediation but we recognise there are cases which do require rules and penalties.

I agree with her and we are looking into this as part of the community dispute resolution framework but I would say that this is, in fact, a broader issue that requires further study into our mental health provisions, especially in the community.

And this same spirit of giving must continue in future generations. I think one good sign we see is in the trends of volunteerism. A survey by the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre shows that nearly one in three Singaporeans is engaged in volunteer work today, compared to just one in five two years ago. And Singaporeans are also donating more to help others.",25,74,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00074
2014-03-12-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We hope that more Singaporeans will continue to step forward. One challenge, as Mr Seah Kian Peng highlighted, is the ""bathtub effect"" in our volunteerism trend. Members can see it very clearly in the chart [Please refer to Annex 1 on Pg xxxxx.] Volunteer involvement is high among Singaporeans aged 15, in the younger age groups, but it declines sharply in their mid-20s as they enter the workplace. And participation comes back up again in their 30s, but it is still not as high as before.",26,75,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00075

2014-03-12-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I have spoken to several corporate leaders and many have expressed interest. However, some do not know how to get involved, lack confidence that their contributions will be put to good use, or think that giving makes little business sense. Some local companies may also find it harder to get involved than larger ones, or the MNCs, which have the experience of corporate giving in other countries. They also face resource constraints and the resultant costs may not seem sustainable.",30,79,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00079
2014-03-12-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Despite these challenges, there are SMEs in Singapore who make an effort to practise corporate giving because they want to give back to society. Take for example civil engineering company Feng Ming Construction. Feng Ming has a policy of donating one per cent of the value of each contract that it clinches. And aside from cash donations, Feng Ming also organises visits to homes or orphanages, and movie day outings twice a year, with all the staff taking part. According to the Managing Director, Mr Lim Hong Beng, he does this to instil values in his staff. And he said, ""If you take from society, you must give back to society. This is something I always tell my employees.""",31,80,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00080

2014-03-12-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Companies can also encourage other companies to be involved. One example is ABR Holdings Limited (ABR). They manage several food and beverage companies like Swensen's and Gloria Jean's, and have nurtured a spirit of giving that not only engages their own employees but also other businesses and their consumers. They use their F&B outlets for charitable causes, bringing cheer to children from Club Rainbow with life threatening and chronic illnesses by hosting birthday parties for them at Swensen's. And when it comes to fundraising, ABR also ropes in their suppliers.

I hope that more companies will start to get involved. Public sector agencies can also step forward. Making giving a workplace norm sends a powerful message. It says that giving can coexist with the demands of building one's career and family, because one can never be too busy to do one's bit for society.",34,83,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00083

I would encourage those who are passionate about impacting their communities to come forward and apply. We have a rigorous selection process, as Mr Hawazi Daipi mentioned, but we do not want that to be a deterrence to youths from stepping forward. We are not looking at academic qualifications. We are looking for youths with strong leadership qualities, a commitment to serve the community and a desire to learn. And we do want a diverse mix of youths in the Youth Corps. And that is why, when we do the Youth Corps programme, we look forward to a mix of students from ITE, Polytechnics and Universities coming together.",44,93,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00093

It is also a first in many steps towards more impactful youth development and engagement. To better support youth engagement in the community, NYC will strengthen its partnerships with schools and tertiary institutions, as well as other youth organisations. For example, we are working with schools to enable students to contribute their SG50 celebration ideas. I think it is something that Miss Penny Low highlighted just now. We have also developed resource kits for interactive lessons that will inspire students to organise their own activities, which can also be supported through the SG50 Celebration Fund.",45,94,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00094

I would like the Acting Minister to clarify if that is so. And if not, what would be the criteria for the artists to be selected?",1,104,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00104

It will be quite complex if you think about it, when we want to showcase our artists overseas, we have to think about what markets to go to, which audiences we want to target, if at all, what events and platforms. And these are international events which will have their own curators and organisers. We will also have to take their views into consideration.

But I would like to assure the Member that one important group we would certainly want to consult is our local artists and our art community.

The point is about whether neutral parties can help to make application for meditation, should both parties refuse to go to the meditation on their own. One of the issues now is that they have an ongoing dispute, but neither side is willing go to the meditation and it just continues. It affects the environment and the neighbours around them. I hope that the Minister can help to address this.",1,118,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00118
2014-03-12-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We will look into the suggestion. In fact, we are having a public consultation now for the Community Dispute Resolution Framework, including the way the tribunal operates, but we will be happy to take the suggestion and study this. We have not finalised but I must add the qualification that whatever measures we take, we must not undermine the personal ownership and responsibility for resolving the dispute. So, even if the application is by a third party, there needs to be responsibility placed on the parties in dispute to want to come together to resolve the dispute by themselves.",1,119,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00119

2014-03-12-T-002,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"The first is regarding the 25 community nodes around the island to encourage arts participation. Are we building the capacity of our own cultural officers and actively training them to work with artists and to develop new audiences? The feedback on the ground from arts practitioners is that there is limited knowledge and experience amongst, say, the PA and CDC staff on the ground. How can we ensure that these key arts personnel at these 25 nodes have the relevant training and experience?",2,121,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00121
2014-03-12-T-002,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Second, regarding the $20 million Cultural Diplomacy Fund. Bringing our arts overseas requires people with the domain knowledge, experience, and the personal connections with major venues and festivals overseas, and such relationships are not built overnight. It sounds like MCCY is acting like a bridge builder. How will the Ministry build the capacity within the Government to establish these relationships and will the Ministry consider extending this funding, not just to arts groups but also to intermediaries like producers and agents who already have the domain experience in marketing Singapore artists overseas?",3,122,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00122
2014-03-12-T-002,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"My final clarification and I have spoken much at this debate on the potential of tapping into our Singapore films, contemporary music and designers, which are all part of our creative industries. How will we tap on these sectors as part of our cultural diplomacy efforts? I know these sectors are not under MCCY's charge, but will funding be open to these sectors as well, as part of our cultural diplomacy efforts? And will funding be open to Singapore artists who are already based and working overseas?",4,123,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00123
2014-03-12-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, I agree with the Member that capability building is an important part of this. We need to do more for capability building in terms of the cultural officers within Government itself, not necessarily just within the PA and CDC, because some of them also reside also in the libraries and some of them reside in the Esplanade which also does a lot of community outreach. So, we are looking at how we can strengthen that. That is certainly something we are focused on.",1,124,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00124
2014-03-12-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Likewise for what the Member talked about, there is a lot more bridge building that we need, as she has put it. Similarly, we will have to strengthen that part of what NAC is doing today – establishing these linkages with many of these overseas platforms. We will study whether we can extend funding and support to intermediaries, meaning to say, we do not necessarily have to do everything within Government. We can find partners that we can do the work with.",2,125,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00125

2014-03-12-T-002,Nicholas Fang,Mr Nicholas Fang (Nominated Member),"In my cut yesterday on sporting culture, I mentioned that there seems to be a need for a greater appreciation of sports as an entertainment option comparable to movies, theatres and things like that.

That is, some guidance as to how to create iconic events that Singaporeans will appreciate as sports and entertainment options, rather than just participative.",2,128,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00128
2014-03-12-T-002,Nicholas Fang,Mr Nicholas Fang (Nominated Member),My second question is related to the heartening news of the greater encouragement for the greater spirit of giving among corporates in Singapore. I would like to ask the Minister how this balances them with efforts to encourage individual philanthropy and how to strike a balance between the two elements.,3,129,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00129
2014-03-12-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the first point, sports entertainment is something I think we want to build up. We do not have a lot of expertise in this, but that is a direction to go for some of these sports events, which can be built up to more than just sports alone but can incorporate entertainment and lifestyle. We have already done it quite well for the F1. The next major project which we are doing is the WTA Championship, and STB and various Government agencies which have been involved in the F1 are also assisting and discussing with WTA Championship organisers on how they can make that event into more than just a tennis event, but also a broader entertainment and lifestyle event. Progressively, as we build up these capabilities, we will be able to do more in other sports as well.",1,130,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00130
2014-03-12-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On corporate giving, I do not see that as detracting from our efforts to promote individual giving. They are mutually reinforcing. Many individuals who give are themselves corporate leaders, and so as leaders in the corporate, if they are good individual givers, then, hopefully, they would also take that approach in the way they manage their companies and that culture can then be translated into the workplace. The other way round as well, because if somebody who is running a company, an SME, does something within the organisation, they can take a personal satisfaction in giving, that will hopefully filter down into their own personal lives.",2,131,2014-03-12-T-002-S-00131

2014-03-12-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, I agree with Mr David Ong's suggestion on building up more sports ambassadors. We are already doing so. There are two groups that we are doing this with. One is our current athletes. I think we can do more to profile them, and to bring them out into the community to engage young children to motivate them. There is a plan to do that. We can also do another second group, and it would be for the former athletes, including many pioneer athletes like Mr C Kunalan. Again, we will see how we can engage them better, and tap on their experience, stories to motivate and go out to engage the community, including many of our young children in schools.

Singapore's GDP per capita is about 20% higher than America's, with comparable (if not higher) health outcomes, and spends an absurdly low amount on healthcare relative to the West.""",3,149,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00149

While we seek to add more beds to the system in the form of acute and community hospitals, let us not lose sight of the bigger picture. To me, the bed crunch is just a manifestation of the underlying fact that we have not effectively deployed our resources and ensure right siting of care. They are many measures we can take to ensure the right siting of resources, for instance, ensuring that A&E services are not over taxed by minor non-urgent cases, or encouraging the primary care and private sectors to take up more of the burden of our acute public hospitals. In these terms, what steps then is the Ministry taking to restructure our system to ensure the right siting of care and the full use of our limited resources, both in the public and private sectors?

Many Singaporeans have given me feedback that they have sufficient Medisave in their CPF but the current rules do not allow them to use beyond the current ceiling. For example, $400 per year is allowed for use in the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP).

First, what treatments are necessary, appropriate and most cost-effective for patients? While we generally expect and trust the medical fraternity to think in the interests of patients, we must also be practical to know that there are many commercial and pecuniary incentives that attach themselves to the promotion and use of certain treatments, drugs and equipment. Furthermore, patients themselves are becoming more informed over time and may demand certain treatments, drugs and tests even when their doctors have not recommended them in the first place. The risk of this happening will increase further when insurance is seen as covering the payments and premiums are assured to be affordable.",3,242,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00242

2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"First, on accessibility. As our population grows and ages, demand for healthcare services will rise.

Over the last 10 years between 2003 and 2013, we have increased public acute and community hospitals as well as nursing homes beds by over 30%. This includes the building of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH).

I have previously explained in this House the constraints of this approach. In fact, National University Hospital (NUH) had converted some of its private beds into subsidised beds in 2013.

NUH had to reconfigure the space and carry out renovations, such as rewiring and piping works for the addition of medical gas points, nurse substations and other supporting infrastructure. We actually lost the use of the wards for more than three months during the renovation.",14,262,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00262

However, as these diseases are highly influenced by lifestyle risk factors, including obesity, cigarette smoking and physical inactivity, we can reduce the impact of these risk factors by adopting healthier lifestyles.",50,298,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00298

But he did not stop there. Several years later, he signed up for a Bachelor of Science programme in Construction Project Management. Mr Yap completed his programme in 2011, and now armed with a degree, he has since returned to the workforce and started a new career at the age of 65. He works full time at a construction consultancy firm as a Resident Technical Officer and is looking to contribute for many more years to come.

I believe we can and can do more to remove Singaporeans' anxiety over their healthcare bills as they grow older. Our healthcare system hinges on what some call personal responsibility or others label it ""co-payment"".

With inflationary pressures on Singaporeans, many, especially in the lower-income group, have difficulties coping with everyday life, much less paying extra for the revamped MediShield Life. In this vein, how then can we ensure that premiums remain affordable for Singaporeans, both when it is launched and in 10 to 20 years' time?",2,353,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00353
2014-03-12-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"This, I think, will be a major issue for many Singaporeans. Feedback that my GPC has gathered shows that a portion of Singaporeans, even today, has allowed their MediShield coverage to lapse. Several reasons account for this; their MediShield premiums have risen as they age till it is now sky-high; the periodic top-ups by the Government to Medisave were wiped out by hospital bill payments, either for themselves or their family members; and the advice from medical professionals is to allow their MediShield coverage to lapse and rely on MediFund. Many of these I have raised in the earlier Health GPC paper that was submitted to MOH.",3,354,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00354
2014-03-12-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"As a whole, I think the affordability of MediShield premiums will be a major issue that the Government has to grapple with. While the current increase in CPF contribution rates is useful, how will those who do not have a job, for instance, housewives who contribute to Singapore differently by caring for the young, and caregivers, be taken care of? How will they afford the insurance premiums for MediShield Life?",4,355,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00355
2014-03-12-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I had also previously suggested a reverse premium structure, which was first coined by Senior Minister of State Amy Khor, as a possible policy solution to cope with the anticipated rising MediShield premiums. This is worth serious consideration for it creates individual affordability when they can afford it, that is, when they are young and working, After all, CPF contribution rates do reflect this trend. When a Singaporean is younger, his CPF contribution rates are higher, while when he is older, the rate, both personal and by his employer, falls. Will the Ministry consider the implementation of such a reverse premium structure to make MediShield Life premiums affordable for all?",5,356,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00356
2014-03-12-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Let us also not forget that with premium increases, different groups of Singaporeans will be affected differently. The rich and well-off will have less of an issue, as they have the means to afford and cushion any premium increase. The recent announcement of the subsidies for the Pioneer Generation is very reassuring.",6,357,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00357
2014-03-12-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"However, the rest of Singaporeans, especially those in the lower- and middle-income groups, will find any premium rise hard to manage. Any rise which may appear miniscule to others will be viewed as an added strain on their finances. While we endeavour to meet the medical coverage of others who are uninsured, let us not forget those who cannot afford any increases. How can we ensure that Singaporeans remain covered for healthcare, regardless of income group? Can we consider premium subsidies for the lower-income group as well?",7,358,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00358
2014-03-12-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I also hope that the Minister will look into the co-payments component of MediShield Life. This component is often paid for using Medisave and/or cash. Many Singaporeans have given the feedback that the co-payments can be prohibitive, especially in smaller bill sizes where the co-payment component makes up a significantly larger proportion of the bill compared to bigger bill sizes. Lowering the co-payment will minimise the out-of-pocket expenditure, making healthcare costs relatively more affordable.",8,359,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00359

2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Sustainability is important, not just for today's Singaporeans, but also for our children and future generations.

2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,I had the opportunity to talk to many Singaporeans during last year's Our Singapore Conversation sessions. They had reflected their concerns about healthcare affordability. I was also heartened that this stemmed from a strong desire for self-reliance as well as a sense of responsibility of taking care of their loved ones.,5,365,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00365

2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"First, increase the Government's share of national healthcare expenditure. Second, gradually expand Medisave use. Third, increase risk-pooling. These shifts will improve healthcare affordability and give Singaporeans better peace of mind by reducing their cash outlay for healthcare.",7,367,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00367
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Today, I will provide an update of this review, covering the changes that we have made and will be making in the coming year and beyond.",8,368,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00368
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Let me start with outpatient care. Many welcomed the significant changes to the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) I announced last year. We expanded the coverage of CHAS to more chronic diseases and recommended screenings. We removed the age floor so that younger Singaporeans can now enrol in CHAS and enjoy its benefits. Since October 2013, close to 260,000 more cards have been issued, bringing the total CHAS membership near 600,000 currently. CHAS will be further enhanced for the Pioneer Generation, which I will talk about later.",9,369,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00369
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"As announced at the Budget, my Ministry will be enhancing subsidies or services in the Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOCs) in public hospitals. Let me elaborate. Today, subsidised patients in the public hospital SOCs enjoy 50% subsidy on average for SOC services. These patients are able to enjoy these subsidies after they have been assessed to require specialist care and are referred to the subsidised SOCs by a polyclinic doctor or, if they hold a CHAS card, by a CHAS GP. The subsidies will be enhanced for the lower to the middle-income and span services from the consultation to the scans, tests and allied health services, such as physiotherapy, that are needed to diagnose and manage their conditions. They will enjoy higher subsidies of 70% and 60% respectively, and may see their bill reduced by up to 40%.",10,370,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00370
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"For the convenience of patients, the means-testing framework will be aligned with that of CHAS, which means that current subsidised SOC patients who already have the CHAS blue or orange cards, will automatically enjoy these higher subsidies. We will reach out to the remaining subsidised patients in the SOCs to be means-tested so that those eligible can also enjoy the higher subsidies. SOC patients who are higher income, and those who decline to be means-tested for a variety of reasons, will continue to receive the current subsidy and will not be worse off. These changes will be implemented in September 2014.",11,371,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00371
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"To further improve affordability of outpatient care, my Ministry will also enhance subsidies for drugs in the SOCs and polyclinics. Currently, MOH provides subsidies for standard drugs that have been assessed to be cost-effective and essential. They are mostly capped at the price of $1.40 per week or subsidised at 50% of the retail price.",12,372,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00372
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"From January 2015, all lower to middle income patients will enjoy a 75% subsidy for all standard drugs so that they pay less for their medication, a reduction of up to half. Dr Lam will be pleased to note that we will also extend subsidies to more drugs. From April 2014, we will add another 13 drugs to the Medication Assistance Fund and the Standard Drugs List.",13,373,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00373
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Let me now move to Medisave and how we will allow greater flexibility for patients. Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked about the co-payment for chronic disease Medisave claims. As I mentioned earlier, co-payment is important to encourage prudent consumption. Nevertheless, to reduce cash outlay and encourage timely treatment, we will remove the $30 deductible from July 2014. With this change, patients no longer need to pay the first $30 of each bill in cash. They can tap on Medisave from the first dollar, reducing their cash outlay.",14,374,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00374
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Ms Lee Li Lian asked how we can help cancer patients who need newer types of treatment, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Medisave and MediShield can already be used for such treatments. For patients who still face difficulty paying for the remaining costs, targeted subsidies are also available through the Medication Assistance Fund, if they do not respond to less costly alternatives.",15,375,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00375
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Patients can also use Medisave to pay for scans needed in the course of their cancer treatment today already. However, many Singaporeans have given feedback that scans needed for other illnesses can also be costly. Therefore, from the first quarter of next year, we will allow Medisave use of up to $300 a year to cover non-cancer related scans that are deemed necessary for diagnoses and treatment. With the enhanced SOC subsidies and Medisave coverage, scans will be significantly more affordable.",16,376,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00376
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Dr Lam Pin Min and Mr Gerald Giam had also suggested allowing more use of Medisave for outpatient treatment. Many elderly Singaporeans who need outpatient care have shared with me their worries over depleting their cash savings and burdening their children financially. Many of them want to be self-reliant and have asked to tap on their Medisave more easily, and we hear them. While we remain concerned about the depletion of Medisave balance, we can consider more flexibility, especially for the older Singaporeans. We plan to introduce a new flexi-Medisave scheme that will allow the elderly to use their Medisave more flexibly for outpatient medical treatments at our SOCs, polyclinics and CHAS clinics. This will enable elderly patients who see their CHAS GPs for cough and cold to tap on Medisave to reduce their out-of-pocket payments. Flexi-Medisave will also supplement the $400 annual limit for chronic disease treatment, which Assoc Prof Lateef mentioned.",17,377,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00377
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,We intend to start by allowing up to $200 of Flexi-Medisave use per year. We will work out the details over the next few months and share more in due course. We hope to have this ready by the first half of next year.,18,378,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00378

2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We will be enhancing MediShield to become MediShield Life to provide lifetime peace of mind and better benefits for all Singaporeans, regardless of how their life and health circumstances may change. This includes extending coverage to the very elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. I am glad that many Singaporeans support the shift to provide lifetime coverage and better benefits under MediShield Life for all Singaporeans. MediShield Life is as much about giving all Singaporeans greater peace of mind as it is about us forging a new social compact – with everyone chipping in to better protect one another from having to face life's uncertainties alone. As this is a major step in transforming our healthcare financing framework, we have appointed the MediShield Life Review Committee to review and recommend the key parameters for MediShield Life, such as benefits, claim limits and co-payments – issues which Mr Giam mentioned – taking into account feedback from the public and key stakeholders.",20,380,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00380

2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Dr Lam had also asked if we would consider pre-funding for MediShield Life. Many have supported the idea of pre-funding at the Committee's focus group discussions. With pre-funding, policy holders pay more premiums when they are working and earning income, which are set aside to provide premium rebates when they grow old. This improves the premium affordability at their old age.",22,382,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00382
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Pre-funding is not about the younger generation cross-subsidising the older generation, because such cross-subsidy across generations would be unsustainable as our population ages.

2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Mr Png Eng Huat and Mrs Chiam have also asked about the insurance coverage for patients suffering from pre-existing conditions or who have recently recovered from cancer. With the move towards universal coverage under MediShield Life, all Singaporeans with pre-existing conditions, including those who have cancer or who have just recovered from cancer, will be covered under the scheme. The private insurance schemes, such as Integrated Shield Plans (IPs), are different from MediShield. They provide options for better benefits above the basic protection offered by MediShield. Those who are covered by IPs will still be covered by MediShield. But the additional coverage is over and above the MediShield coverage.",24,384,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00384
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"As insurance is about risk-pooling across members, members have to be in good health at the point of joining insurance schemes. To protect policyholders, we require insurers offering IPs to guarantee renewals so that once policyholders take up the plan, they cannot drop them from coverage, even if they develop illnesses and incur higher claims subsequently.",25,385,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00385
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"But should they not be able to be insured by the private shield plans, they will continue to be insured by MediShield and MediShield Life when it comes into effect. More generally, as insurance buyers, we need to plan for our healthcare coverage wisely and purchase an appropriate plan that is affordable, not just when we are young, but also in old age, because in private plans, the premiums will rise as you grow older. And it will rise significantly. If you plan to seek treatment at public hospitals, a more expensive insurance plan covering the cost of care in private hospitals may not be necessary. Both the Committee and MOH have received feedback on the affordability of Integrated Plans (IPs) and will be reviewing to see how we can provide appropriate options for upgrading coverage beyond MediShield Life.",26,386,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00386

With better coverage and benefits under MediShield Life, premiums will also need to increase. With this shift to MediShield Life, I want to assure Singaporeans that the Government will ensure that premiums remain affordable, especially for the low-income and the elderly, as suggested by the Committee. The cost of bringing in the currently uninsured should be shared across those with pre-existing conditions, the existing insured policy holders and the Government. Therefore, as suggested by the Committee, this cost of bringing those who are currently not covered into the MediShield Life should be shared among those who are currently uninsured as well as those who are existing insured policy holders and the Government.",27,387,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00387

Our intent is that no Singaporeans will drop out of MediShield Life because of their inability to pay for the premiums. However, Government support is necessarily targeted at those groups who need help with premium payments. Those who have the means should still pay our own share.

In the subsidised SOCs and polyclinics, they will receive a further 50% off their subsidised bills, on top of the enhanced subsidies that I mentioned earlier for SOC services, and standard drugs. What this means for a lower- to middle-income PG elderly is a subsidy of over 80% in the SOCs and polyclinics. All PGs will also be placed on CHAS. As Deputy Prime Minister has mentioned, we have brought forward the CHAS benefits for the Pioneer Generation to September this year.

The Government's intent is to help PGs aged 80 and above today fully cover their premiums, through a combination of premium subsidies and Medisave top-ups. For the younger PGs who are on MediShield today, the aim is to help them through premium subsidies and Medisave top-ups, so that their share of MediShield Life premiums will be about half of their current MediShield premiums.

Take Mr and Mrs Tan, a middle-aged couple, both working and supporting two school-going children and Mr Tan's elderly parents.",46,406,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00406
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"As Blue Health Assist card holders, the couple now enjoy free screening tests at their neighbourhood CHAS GP clinic and subsidies for their screening follow-up consultations. The Tan children are also now able to enjoy the same CHAS benefits that their parents and grandparents already enjoy. These changes will potentially save the family more than $200 each year, assuming one follow-up consultation for each adult and four visits to the CHAS GP for each child.",47,407,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00407
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"For Grandpa Tan who suffers from chronic back pain, the higher subsidies will greatly help with his out-of–pocket costs for his visits to his orthopaedic specialist in the public hospitals, his medication and when more expensive tests like an MRI scan need to be done. He would first see his annual subsidised bill reduced by about 40%, from $460 to $280. As a Pioneer Generation elderly, he will see a further 50% reduction in his bill to $140 – a saving of $320. He can use his Medisave to further reduce the co-payment for his MRI scan which further reduces his overall out-of-pocket payment from $140 to $35.",48,408,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00408
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"If Grandma Tan unfortunately becomes disabled and requires long-term care at home, she will receive monthly payments of $300 from insurance, or $3,600 a year, if she is covered by ElderShield. With the new Pioneer Generation Disability Assistance Scheme, she will receive an additional $1,200 per year which will help the family pay for the long-term care arrangements.",49,409,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00409
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"When MediShield Life is introduced, this will mean that the entire Tan family is covered for life. This includes Grandma Tan, who was not insurable due to kidney failure, but can now look forward to benefiting from MediShield Life coverage.",50,410,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00410
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Overall, with these new initiatives, the Tan family can expect to receive more than $500 in additional subsidies a year off their medical bills, and close to $2,000, if one of them requires long-term care. More flexible Medisave use will further reduce their cash outlay. With MediShield Life and premium subsidies, the family would enjoy even more savings, together with enhanced coverage under MediShield Life.",51,411,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00411
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"As part of this shift in healthcare financing, we have committed to increasing the Government's share of healthcare spending and also increasing collective responsibility for one another's healthcare costs. Government's direct spending on healthcare is projected to increase to $7.5 billion in FY2014, up from $4 billion in FY2011 – almost doubling in a short span of three years. If we include Medisave top-ups into Singaporeans' Medisave accounts to help with their future healthcare needs, Government's total expenditure this year is estimated to be about $8 billion, and will continue to increase in future. As a proportion of national healthcare expenditure, Government's share will increase, from 33% in 2012 to 40% or more going forward, depending on the pace of increase of healthcare costs at the national level.",52,412,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00412
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"With rising life expectancy, we will also need to set aside more Medisave for our old age needs. To support this, we will increase employer Medisave contribution rates by one percentage point, as announced at the Budget. This will help ensure that current and future generations of working adults have sufficient Medisave for their future healthcare needs, and also support more flexible use of Medisave.",53,413,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00413
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"To ensure that healthcare remains affordable in the long term, we need to carefully manage healthcare costs, as Mr Heng Chee How and Mr Low Thia Khiang have noted.",54,414,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00414
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"I am glad that in the MediShield Life Review Committee's consultations, many Singaporeans have also recognised the risk of driving up overall healthcare costs as we expand the role of Medisave and MediShield. We must continue to ensure we pay for quality and effectiveness, bearing in mind that spending more does not necessarily bring better health outcomes.",55,415,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00415
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"As Mr Laurence Lien and Mr Gerald Giam have suggested, we need to spend each healthcare dollar smartly, and pay providers to deliver quality care. Our current funding approach is designed to drive providers to adopt a patient- and outcome-centric approach in delivering care. In the home care sector, we are, in fact, piloting the idea of providing a fixed amount of funding per elderly per month, and Senior Minister of State Amy Khor will touch on this further.",56,416,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00416
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"For inpatient admissions, the public hospitals are funded to deliver a bundle of services required for a patient and a particular condition. This is then aggregated and provided as a block budget, which encourages the clusters to improve productivity, and provide high-quality and cost-effective treatments to improve outcomes. A blend of aggregated block funding and some fee-for-service component achieves a balance of incentives – managing overall costs while retaining incentives for higher productivity.",57,417,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00417
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"To complement the funding approach, MOH drives quality improvement using the National Standards for Healthcare (NSHC) framework. This ensures that healthcare services are appropriate for patients' needs, based on current evidence and clinical knowledge. The framework is also used to help assess the providers' own performance and prioritise their quality improvement efforts.",58,418,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00418
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Government also provides additional support for Regional Health Systems initiatives that involve the management of patients outside of acute care in the hospital setting. An example is Alexandra Health System's (AHS) Ageing-in-Place initiative, as I had shared earlier. We will carefully study how various funding approaches can be adapted to these new care models to drive cost-effectiveness.",59,419,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00419
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We will continue to maintain strong clinical protocols among public-sector healthcare providers. Drugs are subsidised if their clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness are proven. We are also introducing Health Technology Assessment for medical devices and implants to ensure they are cost-effective. MOH also has in place a framework to assess new costly technologies, based on their track record in terms of treatment outcome and cost-effectiveness.",60,420,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00420
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Mr Heng Chee How had also asked about drug procurement. To lower costs, our public health institutions procure standard drugs as a group. This has resulted in savings of $180 million since 2001, which have been passed on to patients. We will study how to build on this to achieve even lower drug prices for Singaporeans.",61,421,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00421
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Mr Low Thia Khiang asked whether we can increase transparency in doctors' charges. I agree that this is essential in order to empower patients and allow market forces to work more efficiently. All clinics are required to display their charges, and hospitals must provide financial counselling at the point of admission to help patients make informed decisions. The MOH website also provides comparisons of total hospital bill sizes.",62,422,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00422
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"To provide additional transparency on the bill component attributed to doctors' charges, MOH is working towards publishing information on the amounts charged at our public sector hospitals under this component for common procedures. This enhanced transparency will provide more information to help patients make informed decisions.",63,423,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00423
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"On an individual level, we still need to preserve the focus on personal responsibility. Staying healthy is the best way to keep healthcare cost down. I also agree with Mr Laurence Lien that while seeking to enhance affordability, we still need to guard against over-consumption, by focusing on providing basic and essential healthcare for all Singaporeans. Even as we shift towards greater collective responsibility, co-payment will remain a very important cornerstone of our healthcare financing framework.",64,424,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00424
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The transformation of our healthcare financing system through higher Government subsidies, greater Medisave flexibility and MediShield Life will help reduce the burden of healthcare cost on the patients and keep healthcare affordable for all. But beyond the numbers and the schemes, more importantly, this shift reflects the Government's commitment to help Singaporeans, especially those who are more needy and vulnerable, and build an even more inclusive and caring society. It is the Government's assurance that we will keep healthcare affordable for all Singaporeans. I am confident that with all stakeholders playing their part, we will be able to forge a closer social compact.",65,425,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00425
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We will be better able to cope with future challenges and strengthen the foundations of our healthcare system for generations of future Singaporeans to come. This way, we can help Singaporeans not only to live long, but to live well and with peace of mind.",66,426,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00426
2014-03-12-T-003,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Madam, with an ageing population, MOH has responded positively and pledged to enhance and expand healthcare facilities – increases in bed spaces, step-down care and home-care capacities and putting in place additional facilities can be expected. With these investments in healthcare, demand for manpower will also rise accordingly. Moreover, with the increasing demand for high-touch services, such as home care, the need for manpower is further exacerbated as these settings have lower efficiency of scale.",1,427,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00427
2014-03-12-T-003,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Faced with an already tight labour market and increased constraints on foreign manpower, how will MOH address this need? How will MOH help the public health sector compete for local aspiring Singaporeans to take up a career in this sector? Will MOH also increase local student enrolment in medicine, nursing and other allied health areas? How will MOH leverage innovations to align with the Government's overall drive to reduce foreign manpower reliance and increase productivity? How will MOH reconcile the tension between the need for human touch in healthcare and the need for technology to raise productivity?",2,428,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00428
2014-03-12-T-003,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, some senior doctors in public service are concerned that many Singaporean doctors are leaving for the private sector due to push factors, like having twice as many cases compared with the private sector, having to spend much time on non-clinical work and coping with stressful organisational and training changes, such as the residency programme. Nurses and other allied healthcare professionals, too, find conditions in the private sector better, with private employers spending more to attract locals due to foreign work pass quotas. While the Ministry in 2012 announced pay increases for public sector employees, many feel that this may not help much, especially in the long term.",1,429,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00429
2014-03-12-T-003,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),Failure to stem the tide of attrition means that Singaporean patients at public health institutions are dealing more often with foreign staff and experience some language barriers. Is the Ministry concerned and are there any further reviews to look at how to better retain Singaporeans in the public sector?,2,430,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00430
2014-03-12-T-003,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam,"Madam, the Government has acknowledged that nurses are not ""low skilled"" workers, a point brought up by the Deputy Prime Minister during the Population White Paper debate last year.",1,431,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00431
2014-03-12-T-003,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam,"""How important nurses are in the hospital  they are trained, they are critical to the whole system – highly skilled, highly professional,"" Prime Minister Lee said in a Straits Times report on 13 February 2013.",2,432,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00432
2014-03-12-T-003,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam,"Florence Nightingale defined nursing as ""the act of utilising the environment of the patient to assist him in his recovery"".",3,433,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00433
2014-03-12-T-003,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam,"A nurse is a healthcare professional who is focused on caring for individuals, families and communities, ensuring that they attain, maintain or recover optimal health and functioning. They are also the important frontline workers in the health industry.",4,434,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00434
2014-03-12-T-003,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam,"When we compare the remuneration of nurses in Singapore with hospital nurses in other countries, they lag behind their counterparts in Europe, Australia and Japan, even though Singapore has one of the highest GDP per capita in the world.",5,435,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00435
2014-03-12-T-003,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam,"It is time that the Government review the career pathways and salaries of our nurses to ensure that they receive a pay commensurate with their skill set and expertise after their in-house competency tests, to provide more advancement opportunities and career pathways and to value-add our healthcare system in Singapore which should be in the form of a nursing, leadership and senior specialist track.",6,436,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00436
2014-03-12-T-003,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam,"More support should be given to healthcare in this regard. I would like to propose that the Government earmark a sum of around $40 million to enhance the competitiveness of our healthcare sector. Under such a framework, the Government can then consider more competitive wages for nurses.",7,437,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00437
2014-03-12-T-003,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam,"The Government could then conduct a salary restructure and review of our nurses' salaries in accordance with their skill level, similar to the career structure that was developed, such as for teachers in the education service.",8,438,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00438

2014-03-12-T-003,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"Madam, I wish to express my heartfelt thanks to MOH and the public healthcare clusters for embarking on a series of wage reviews and adjustments and positive collective agreement settlements for both nursing and non-nursing staff. However, the current workload at our public hospitals and polyclinics is mounting. Impending load with upcoming new hospitals and healthcare facilities that are shared will strain manpower resources. In the Graduate Employment Survey 2013 for fresh graduates released last week, nursing was ranked 74th out of 78 jobs.",1,442,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00442
2014-03-12-T-003,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"I wish to ask MOH if they can embark on a more systematic and regular review of healthcare staff compensation and benefits to attract and retain staff. This should include both nursing and non-nursing staff, such as those in allied, admin and ancillary positions. I am equally concerned about the compensation and benefits of those in our private hospitals and whether they are also picking a leaf from MOH's concerted moves. By the same token, step-down care, such as eldercare and other intermediate to long-term care workers, should also have their compensations and benefits kept up to speed with the public healthcare clusters. Why? Because we need to continue to attract and retain staff in these very crucial jobs.",2,443,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00443
2014-03-12-T-003,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"Finally, I congratulate the Healthcare Cluster Tripartite Workgroup's work in the past 18 months which has led to the implementation of the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) for the lower-wage healthcare staff. Besides ""upping"" productivity, they have also ""upped"" the careers and wages for more than 2,500 of them last year. I hope our tripartite partners will continue to work together to roll out the PWM for the higher level PME jobs as well.",3,444,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00444
2014-03-12-T-003,Fatimah Lateef,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef,"Madam, families and communities form the best source of support, love and sense of belonging for those who need long-term care-giving. It is best to keep those needing long-term care in an environment they are familiar with. Home-based care provides a model for satisfying and wholesome care which can enable the affected to accept the disability, celebrate life and make it as meaningful as possible. To ensure optimal home-based care, carers and family members need to be educated, empowered and knowledgeable in the area of care-giving, its challenges, the labile emotional changes and stresses that they can face. Trained personnel and family members need to be familiar with the home-care environment, the ergonomics, where things are kept, clothes are kept, managing toileting and bathing needs, cooking, washing and even safety issues in the home. They are the ones who will need help, those needing care to adapt, for example, and we want to make them as comfortable in their home environment as possible. Those who need long-term care need assurance and confidence to cope.",1,445,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00445
2014-03-12-T-003,Fatimah Lateef,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef,"With our rapidly ageing society, the elderly needing care will also continue to increase. What further resources can MOH help provide, for example, in terms of financial support, equipment, diapers, milk feeds and so on? Will we see an enhancement in the existing types of caregiver courses available? The Japanese 3Cs approach is pretty good for us to emulate, which comprises comprehensive care, capacity-building and caregiver support. It is a good model to go by. Are there any other strategies and collaborative models MOH can offer those providing and involved in home-based care?",2,446,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00446
2014-03-12-T-003,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Madam, like other developed countries, Singapore faces the challenge of achieving a good healthcare system while controlling escalating healthcare costs. Home-based care is an integral part of right-siting of care.",1,447,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00447
2014-03-12-T-003,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Currently, a mix of private and voluntary welfare organisations provide various forms of home-based care. To realise its true value and potential requires a review on acceptance, awareness, availability, accessibility and affordability.",2,448,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00448
2014-03-12-T-003,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,I believe that home-based care is acceptable and welcomed by the elderly. It saves elderly patients the trouble to travel to the clinic. Home is also an environment that patients are familiar with and conducive for their health and recovery.,3,449,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00449
2014-03-12-T-003,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"However, home-based medical care is a departure from the normal setting in which most medical doctors provide care. Hence, a change of mind-set will be needed for the acceptance of such medical care. A new remuneration scheme for medical personnel that takes into account medical services provided in the home setting should also be effected.",4,450,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00450
2014-03-12-T-003,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"For home-based care to become fully integrated into the healthcare delivery chain, greater awareness is needed.

2014-03-12-T-003,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"To improve the availability and efficiency of home-based care, an effective use of infocomm technology is desirable. In the Intelligent Nation 2015 blueprint by IDA, the aim for the healthcare industry is to digitalise medical data to achieve ""seamless information exchange among different members of the healthcare network"" and improved ""convenience for patients through better and more information services"". To what extent have these been realised? Next, telemedicine is another area that can extend the reach of home-based care, but this area appears to be still in its infancy.",6,452,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00452
2014-03-12-T-003,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Currently, the points of referral for home-based care are the hospitals, clinics and medical social workers.

Funds in the account may be used to pay for approved products and services associated with active ageing and learning, or simply growing old, based on the choices of the seniors among goods and services that will help keep them healthy and active, offered by the public, private or people sectors. Perhaps, these may include courses to encourage lifelong learning, exercise programmes, health screening packages, alternative medical treatments to maintain well-being, and cover daily expenses, such as mobility aids, reading glasses and adult diapers.",5,459,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00459

We have been building community hospitals next to our general hospitals, but in terms of number of beds, the community hospital is only a fraction of the general hospital.",5,465,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00465
2014-03-12-T-003,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"According to 2012 MOH statistics, we had 11,000 beds in acute hospitals and specialty centres. We have roughly the same number of beds – also 11,000 – in the intermediate and long-term care sector (ILTC), of which the vast majority, about 9,500, are nursing home beds.",6,466,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00466
2014-03-12-T-003,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"This ratio of roughly 1 1 between hospital and ILTC beds needs to be addressed quickly. The average patient stays in a nursing home for months if not years; a community hospital patient stays for weeks and an acute hospital patient only stays for a few days. It is not, therefore, uncommon to hear that patients in acute hospitals are waiting for days if not weeks for a bed in the ILTC sector.",7,467,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00467
2014-03-12-T-003,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Hence, I am glad to note that MOH will devote much more resources to developing the ILTC sector, especially the nursing home sector, because the need is there and also, it is far cheaper to build and run an ILTC bed than an acute hospital bed.",8,468,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00468

Like what Minister Khaw Boon Wan mentioned about the integrated healthcare hub in Woodlands, these homes need to take into account the needs and expectations of not just today's elderly, but also those in 20 to 30 years' time. I note that the standard configuration for these nursing homes that are being built is an eight-person cubicle, similar to what has been in existence for some time.",12,472,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00472
2014-03-12-T-003,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Madam, It is one thing to stay for a few days in a six- to eight-person cubicle in a general hospital, and it is another thing altogether to spend one's final days staying for many months, if not for several years, in a nursing home also in eight-person cubicles without any personal space and privacy.",13,473,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00473

Even if we cannot afford a cubicle for each resident, can we not consider housing the residents in smaller cubicles of two to three beds?",14,474,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00474
2014-03-12-T-003,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"This is just one such aspect of addressing the privacy and dignity needs of our patients.

We can hold our own against the best general hospitals in the UK, Australia, Japan, Sweden, Denmark and so on. But when it comes to nursing homes, the impression I get is that our nursing homes lag behind the best in the world.",17,477,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00477
2014-03-12-T-003,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Madam, I would like to suggest that MOH operate a few nursing homes itself, similar to how MOE is now running a few kindergartens. Such a move will achieve a few purposes. MOH-run nursing homes can set the standards for others and be at the forefront of innovation in developing new services and systems in the nursing home sector.",18,478,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00478
2014-03-12-T-003,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"With operational experience, MOH can then develop a better regulatory framework. MOH can better understand the operational constraints, funding realities and manpower shortage that nursing homes now experience.

There is nothing like being at the frontlines, feeling the heat of battle on a daily basis.",19,479,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00479
2014-03-12-T-003,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Madam, at the beginning of the Budget debate last week, I mentioned that politicians and public servants should not be out of touch. Since my first participation in the Budget debate in 2012, I have consistently chosen to speak on broader themes that I have felt will always be relevant in politics, whether for now or well into the future. I did the same again this year. I have chosen this COS health debate to revisit this out-of-touch topic, because the highlight of this Budget is really about the Pioneer Generation Package, which is about healthcare. The Pioneer Generation Package could not have been invented overnight.

Actually, if you add in the $8 billion dollars allocated for the Pioneer Generation Package, which is essentially about healthcare, the total amount comes up to $15.1 billion.

In particular, there is lack of assistance to caregivers, neighbours and the community who have to constantly be faced with the fears and frustrations of being in close proximity to those with mild to severe depression and severe psychiatric cases, such as paranoia to those with anger management issues. Oftentimes, the Police are called in to manage them but, if they are not violent or behave in a disorderly manner, the Police do not have the powers to refer them for psychiatric assessment or treatment. Often, the victims – who can be neighbours, those living in the community or caregivers – are left helpless and have to bear with it without any recourse. I am aware AIC, in partnership with VWOs, has been successful to help counsel and get the family members of those with the condition to seek treatment. The problem arises when those with the condition refuse medical treatment and do not have family support. These sufferers require daily medication and regular check-ups but many do not go for follow-up treatments or consume their daily medication. Can MOH share how it intends to resolve such cases and ensure these sufferers are sent for treatment and are better treated?",1,544,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00544

2014-03-12-T-003,Fatimah Lateef,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef,"Madam, according to World Bank data, Singapore has the highest proportion of older residents and the fastest ageing population in Southeast Asia. Economists and demographers state that this means greater demand for healthcare and eldercare services and also the need for more elder-friendly infrastructure.",1,641,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00641
2014-03-12-T-003,Fatimah Lateef,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef,"Seniorhood is often viewed as the years when there are multiple morbidities, often associated with multitude of chronic illnesses, adverse consequences, complications, disabilities, institutionalisation, increased utilisation of healthcare resources and poor quality of life. Well, that is all wrong and, indeed, a negative mindset.",2,642,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00642
2014-03-12-T-003,Fatimah Lateef,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef,"Being old or a senior is not a disease. It is a part of life, which can be planned, prepared for and celebrated as the golden years, with the inculcation of a positive and successful ageing vision. With early preparation, planning and focus, seniors can lead an empowered, holistic, healthy and active life. After all, many studies have shown that having a positive attitude and mindset is half the battle won against most diseases or for disease control.",3,643,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00643
2014-03-12-T-003,Fatimah Lateef,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef,"Preparing for a healthy seniorhood starts now. Regular assessments and a health screening, a healthy lifestyle, correct food choices, regular exercises and positive psychological health are all important. Some of the happiest countries in the world also report a strong sense of social support, freedom to make life choices and a widespread culture of generosity and graciousness.",4,644,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00644
2014-03-12-T-003,Fatimah Lateef,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef,"Integrated care and health promotion are thus critical. At the same time, regulatory and financing frameworks must align. MOH, HPB, Council for Third Age and other like-minded organisations must continue to strengthen our shared narrative on why integrated and holistic healthcare matters. Our vision must be persuasive enough to convince the most sceptical, who still think it is better to die early. Risks and needs stratification must be done in more detail to ensure meaningful results and outcomes all round.",5,645,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00645
2014-03-12-T-003,Fatimah Lateef,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef,"Integrated healthcare for seniors is a combination of top-down and bottom-up approach, meeting half way. More collaborative models must be made available. Seniors must be taught to take more control of their health and well-being. It is in their hands. Can we help them understand the many policies, schemes and programmes they may not be aware of and have difficulty understanding? In the next two weeks, for example, I have got eight Pioneer Generation dialogue sessions in my constituency with the seniors to empower them and make sure they understand. Assessing the healthcare system is relatively easy, I would say, but negotiating it can be daunting for the seniors. How do we break down the barrier and simplify their job? I hope that we can actually make this a lot easier for the seniors. A positive and mature attitude is, indeed, important for seniorhood.",6,646,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00646

2014-03-12-T-003,Seng Han Thong,Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio),"Madam, it is said that, in the coming years, Singapore's healthcare system will come under pressure from the ageing population. And as our population is ageing rapidly, some have even described it as a ""silver tsunami"". However, there is this Chinese saying ""家有一老，如有一宝” or an elder at home is a treasure for the family. Both are right from different perspectives. Indeed, as more and more of our aged are suffering from dementia and other ageing-related diseases, we need to gear up for this challenge.",1,648,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00648
2014-03-12-T-003,Seng Han Thong,Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio),"If you visit nursing homes and hospices, and meet with the seniors who are no longer able to do simple things, you would agree that this is a real challenge. However, more and more of our senior citizens are also active agers involved in various voluntary and community activities. If you visit community clubs and neighbourhood parks and meet with seniors who enjoy line dancing and tai-ji, you tend to agree that they are our treasure and many of them are what we now call the Pioneer Generation.",2,649,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00649
2014-03-12-T-003,Seng Han Thong,Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio),"Thus, the reality is in between. We need to step up our effort to engage more seniors with many more creative and innovative activities so that after each and every engagement, they will go back to their own home where all the family members treat them as treasures. If we can engage more seniors as early as possible with the right knowledge on mental health and healthy tips, more will enjoy a healthy body and healthy mind and do not need to end up in a nursing home.",3,650,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00650
2014-03-12-T-003,Seng Han Thong,Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio),"HPB and the People's Association and many other voluntary welfare organisations have been working closely to engage our seniors in the areas where they work, live and play. As our population is ageing, we need to have a public education programme to promote the right image of ageing and the right approach to the issues not only among the seniors, but also within the whole population as, like it or not, we will all be old one day.",4,651,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00651

2014-03-12-T-003,Seng Han Thong,Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio),"If you visit nursing homes or hospices and see those old people who cannot look after themselves, you tend to think that old people particularly have many problems. But if you go to the community clubs or parks and see those seniors dancing and practising qigong, you would think that we should look at ageing more positively.",7,654,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00654
2014-03-12-T-003,Seng Han Thong,Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio),"It is a good thing that our community clubs can draw many seniors to participate in various healthy activities. But if one day they are not coming, then it is a bad thing. It is a good thing that the parks can draw many seniors to exercise voluntarily; but if one day they are not coming, you will have to visit them in the hospital, then it is a bad thing.",8,655,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00655
2014-03-12-T-003,Seng Han Thong,Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio),"HPB, under MOH, and many voluntary welfare organisations will face greater challenges to ensure the physical and mental well-being of the elderly. The biggest challenge we face is how to look at the ageing problem positively. Being old is not the problem; the problem is the way we look at them. Some say they are treasures; some say they are liabilities. No matter what they are, we should all work together to make their golden years enjoyable.",9,656,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00656
2014-03-12-T-003,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"Seniors need to adopt a positive mindset towards ageing. We also need to create an environment that our seniors feel welcomed and included so that they can live a happy and healthy life. Many seniors and soon-to-be seniors also want to remain engaged and independent as they age. Madam, we need to have more programmes and initiatives that can support these seniors to stay healthy and active. Could the Ministerial Committee on Ageing (MCA) and MOH provide an update on how it is promoting active ageing and also tell us whether such programmes have benefited our seniors?",1,657,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00657
2014-03-12-T-003,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech on Pg xxxxx.] We often say that, ""An elder at home is a treasure for the family."" We also say that health is the real treasure. If you are old and healthy at the same time, then you are really a ""double treasure"". But if you are old and sickly, then you become a medicine bag. Hence, before providing various quality healthcare services to our elderly, the Government should also provide more resources for them to stay healthy, so that our elders can become more vigorous with age, instead of being infirm and sickly.",2,658,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00658
2014-03-12-T-003,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Madam, the Wellness Programme has been implemented nation-wide in all divisions. I would like to know how have the results and impact been so far, and has the programme been proven to be a good and effective platform to promote active ageing. Have any studies been done to assess the key benefits of the Wellness Programme? While the Wellness Programme is a flagship active ageing initiative, we need to also work with other partners and platform to widen the overall reach of our active ageing initiative. What are the initiatives that MCA and MOH have in place, other than the Wellness Programme, to reach a wider pool of seniors? How have these initiatives benefited our seniors? We must remember that senior citizens have spent their whole life raising families, being part of the workforce and shaping Singapore to what it is today. It is not enough that we make sure that they can retire but rather to be able to retire with dignity and passion. Being old does not mean a man should stop bettering the life of himself or those around him.",1,659,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00659

2014-03-12-T-003,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao,"Madam, participation in regular health screening for common chronic illnesses as we age, is one way to enable early detection and early intervention, and helps keep the individual healthy, as well as keep the long-term healthcare costs to society low.",1,663,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00663
2014-03-12-T-003,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao,"In Singapore, we have the Integrated Screening Programme (ISP), which invites Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents in the target age groups for health screening.

2014-03-12-T-003,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao,"Research has found that one of the key factors preventing Singaporeans from taking part in regular health screening programmes is the cost of screening. Could the Government provide more incentives to individuals to overcome this barrier so that we may achieve a collective good? Perhaps, it could be in the form of subsidies to targeted age groups, or Medisave top-ups, or reduced MediShield premiums for regular participation in screening programmes, or for taking part in healthy living activities.",3,665,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00665

Exclusive breastfeeding rate, however, is very dismal, partly due to cultural resistance.",3,668,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00668
2014-03-12-T-003,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"Madam, the nutritional and health benefits of breastfeeding have been much spoken about. However, not as much has been said about its long-lasting emotional benefits. A breastfeeding relationship cements a very strong emotional bond between mother and child. From the very start in life, because the mother is always close to the baby, the baby adapts to life outside the womb better, secure that the mother is always near. More importantly, it is well-documented that this close interaction and sense of emotional security persist not just in childhood but also in adulthood as well, helping in the make- up of well-adjusted, balanced individuals.",4,669,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00669
2014-03-12-T-003,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"For this reason and to enhance the emotional health of Singaporeans, I call upon HPB to do more to promote, educate and encourage breastfeeding, provide the necessary support and facilities both at home and at work, and to remove the cultural resistance and ignorance that Senior Minister of State Amy Khor had talked about. This public education should be targeted at fathers and other members of the family as well because it is well-documented that when there is family support, mothers tend to breastfeed and for longer periods.",5,670,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00670
2014-03-12-T-003,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"The other concern I have with the emotional health of young Singaporeans is reflected in the PQ I submitted late last year on the increasing rates of suicides among young people.

2014-03-12-T-003,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"It is interesting to me that a school in Thailand has been teaching its young students relaxation techniques at the start of the day, and it seems to have borne results. The students display a more positive mindset and have a more composed outlook towards life. I believe our young people here would benefit from such life skills. Further, it has been long established that a physical ailment is often a result of suppressed emotions, like anger and frustration, and science is only beginning to recognise this mind-body connection between what we think, how we feel and our illnesses and diseases.",7,672,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00672

I urge MOH to think beyond exercise and diet and in discouraging smoking in our healthy lifestyle campaigns and provide life skills that support young people in dealing with their emotions because real healthcare is about dealing with the underlying causes and not just pharmaceuticals and hospitals.",9,674,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00674

It is too late to think about your low bone density when you are 68 years old and have already sustained an osteoporotic hip fracture from a fall.

All of us are ageing because that is part of life, part of growing up. Instead of associating ageing with disease or disability, we should focus on how to keep ourselves healthy, active and happy, because all of us will likely be leading longer lives going forward. In fact, a 65-year-old in 2012 has a life expectancy of 20.4 years, compared to 14.2 years for a 65-year-old in 1982.

2014-03-12-T-003,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"First, an update on the National Wellness Programme. To promote health and wellness in seniors, the People's Association has rolled out the Wellness Programme to all 87 constituencies in Singapore since 2012. Seniors can stay physically active through activities, such as brisk-walking, and socially connected through ground-up interest groups. So, that would be an example of a ground-up interest group, and as Members can see on the screen, they are having a great time.",5,690,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00690
2014-03-12-T-003,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"A 12-month impact study conducted last year in collaboration with Duke-NUS validated that seniors benefited from their participation in the Wellness Programme. Compared to the general senior population in Singapore, those seniors who participated regularly in the Wellness Programme became more physically active and socially connected. They increased their participation in physical activities by an extra 48 minutes per week, compared to the general population which reported an increase of 23 minutes a week. Wellness Programme participants also felt healthier and adopted more positive health behaviours. They were also more likely to participate in health screening – which is a point emphasised by various Members – and to follow up on any abnormal screening results.",6,691,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00691

2014-03-12-T-003,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"Next, on keeping our seniors mentally engaged and active, several Members have highlighted the subject of lifelong learning and seniors' development. We are, indeed, making available more lifelong learning programmes and opportunities for senior volunteerism and employability. By participating in these programmes, seniors can stay mentally engaged and enjoy greater mental well-being. Seniors can also gain a greater sense of purpose and show that ageing is a fulfilling process. And this will improve our overall societal mindsets towards ageing, which is like a point that Members like Mr Seng Han Thong and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang also emphasised.",10,695,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00695
2014-03-12-T-003,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"We will continue to work through the Council for Third Age, or C3A, to promote and support lifelong learning activities. C3A collaborates with like-minded VWOs like YAH!, which stands for Young-at-Heart!, Community College and Fei Yue Community Services to bring lifelong learning courses to the community. C3A itself also launched the Intergenerational Learning Programme, or ILP, in 2011.",11,696,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00696

It bridges intergenerational gaps and promotes mutual understanding. A survey of 804 senior and youth participants on this programme showed encouraging results. Ninety-seven percent of the youths said that the programme improved their perception of the older generation, while 94% of the seniors on the course felt the same towards the younger participants. To date, 1,040 youth and 830 seniors have participated in and benefited from this programme.",12,697,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00697
2014-03-12-T-003,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"In recognition that many seniors have skills and experience, and can and will want to continue to make meaningful contributions, C3A has also funded senior volunteerism programmes, such as those by the RSVP's senior guiding programme where seniors can volunteer as guides at public places, such as airports and hospitals. The YAH! College also encourages graduates from its programmes to volunteer in different capacities.",13,698,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00698
2014-03-12-T-003,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How,"To share another example, 68-year-old Che Ah Kau attended a YAH! programme in 2008 and, since then, has been an active volunteer. Before he retired in 2006, he worked in the previous 25 years as a hawker. At that point, he was reserved and had difficulty expressing himself freely and fully. But, after attending the YAH! College course, he became more confident and articulate. And he was inspired through that programme to volunteer and is now helping in Taman Jurong to serve elderly residents within that community. He even joined 99 other seniors and students from the Republic Polytechnic in a fun activity, a flash mob at the Jurong Point Shopping Centre, last October. So, certainly, he is much less reserved now; he is enjoying life a lot more, and he has shown us that ageing can hold many fun and exciting opportunities.",14,699,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00699

The C3A collaborates with employers, unions and organisations, such as HPB, to provide talks for mature workers. These talks are aimed at encouraging workers to adopt a positive mindset towards ageing and to stay employed. It has reached out to more than 900 mature workers since June of 2013. Through these talks, we hope to help our seniors plan better for their retirement and healthcare needs so that they can enjoy ageing with the assurance that their financial needs are taken care of. We will also work on attracting seniors back into the workforce through various initiatives, such as the Place-and-Train programme mentioned earlier by Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor.",15,700,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00700

We are, therefore, working with the HPB to deliver health promotion programmes at the workplace to reach out to seniors better. And we will take an occupation-based approach to customising the programmes to the health issues that are unique to each occupational type. So, for example, we could design ergonomics programmes for retail assistants as they tend to develop musculoskeletal disorders.

2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Thank you, Madam. First, let me explain that hospital bed projections had been done in the past, and we review it regularly, taking into account population projection, the pace of ageing, as well as the potential changes in disease patterns. But there are many, many variables that would determine the demand for healthcare services. Ageing is one, but lifestyle changes are also another factor that we have to take into consideration. Lifestyle changes are a lot harder to predict. What kind of diseases would occur as a result of lifestyle changes? Family structure is also another factor that we have to take into account – whether family members are more able to take care of their elderly, their frail, and their patients, or whether they would rely a lot more on the acute hospitals' facilities.",1,797,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00797
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"There are many factors involved and it is not only about the direct impact on demand of hospital beds, but also about how we can discharge patients from hospitals, including to step-down care facilities, and whether we are able to create sufficient capacity for the step-down care facilities or whether patients are willing to be transferred to these recovery and rehab facilities rather than to stay in hospital. It also has to do with the cost to patients. With the subsidies in hospitals, some patients may prefer to remain in the hospital rather than in a step-down facility. And we have, therefore, enhanced the intermediate and long-term care subsidies in 2012 in order to provide greater support for step-down care.",2,798,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00798
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Having said that, I think the important thing for us now is in looking at hospital capacity, to at the same time look at how we can transform the care model to rely less on acute hospital capacity which is very expensive, very intensive and it is actually not in the interests of patients to remain in hospitals when they no longer need to. Many patients require some time to recover after an acute episode. It would be better for them to recover in the step-down facilities like community hospitals, nursing homes or even at home. That is why this afternoon, we spent a lot of effort talking about how we can expand home care capacity to address this issue. Looking ahead, other than building hospital capacity, we also need to continue to transform our care model. We need to continue to build community and home care so that, collectively, as a system, we would then be able to meet our healthcare demand going forward.",3,799,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00799
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Mr Low also asked whether waiting at hospitals will still happen and whether there will still be queues at our acute hospitals. I think I also mentioned in my reply that hospitals not only need to cater to our long-term underlying demand needs for healthcare services, they also need to be able to respond to emergency situations when there is a surge in bed demand. This could be because of some emerging diseases, or dengue, or it so happens that, for a particular period, there are more people going to the A&E and, therefore, more hospital beds are needed. So, the hospital has ways and means to adjust itself to be able to respond to demand surges. We have seen some of these and we have shared with the House what are the measures the hospitals have put in place to respond to the surge in demand from time to time.",4,800,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00800

When a patient arrives in the A&E, they will be triaged and assessed and, for the urgent cases, they will be attended to immediately. Even for warding, there is also prioritisation. For patients who are more urgent and require earlier warding, they will be admitted earlier, and allocated a ward earlier. So, the A&E departments in the hospitals manage patients actively. On the ground, they respond to situations when they warrant.",5,801,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00801

One example can be incentivising MediShield premium rebate with certain ideal BMI or certain good control of chronic diseases.",1,802,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00802
2014-03-12-T-003,Lily Neo,Dr Lily Neo,My second clarification is on right siting of medicine. The Minister has said earlier the importance of right siting. May I ask him to elaborate on the measures in place right now for right siting and whether we can enhance it further to have better right siting?,2,803,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00803
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Madam, first on the MediShield rebate for achieving certain health indicators or targets. First, MOH is quite keen to encourage healthy living and to encourage Singaporeans to stay healthy, adopt a healthy lifestyle, and we will continue to evolve incentives and programmes to encourage Singaporeans to maintain a healthy lifestyle and maintain good health. But to provide a rebate for MediShield would mean that we would have to take the funds from the MediShield pool, which means the premiums will have to go up in order to be able to pay the rebate. So, it is better for us to think about other ways to encourage healthy living, and MOH is quite happy to look at alternative programmes and to provide necessary funding, if need be, to incentivise healthy living.",1,804,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00804
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"On right siting, it is an issue that the Ministry has been discussing over the last few years; how do we ensure that patients are given the appropriate level of care. If they do not need higher level, more expensive care, they should not be using the more expensive care because that will drive up healthcare costs. But right siting is something that we will continue to do, and all our public hospitals are very mindful of that. Whenever they prescribe certain treatment, they will always be very mindful of the cost involved and what is appropriate for the patient clinically. And there are regular reviews among the peers within the hospital, as well as within our polyclinics, to ensure that there are certain guidelines and protocols that they will follow, in terms of right siting.",2,805,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00805
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Let me give Members one example. Many of my residents, patients or Singaporeans whom I come across ask me, ""Why do we only give subsidy to patients who have been referred by polyclinics to Specialist Outpatient Clinics, and not walk-in patients to Specialist Outpatient Clinics?"" One of the key reasons is because of right siting. We want patients to be assessed by a primary physician and if the doctor assesses that a patient requires specialist attention, he will then be referred to the SOC and he will benefit from the subsidies. Therefore, this is one way for us to encourage our patients to be assessed before they access a higher level of care. In this way, we ensure that they are provided with the appropriate level of care without over-consuming healthcare services.",3,806,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00806
2014-03-12-T-003,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Madam, I was glad to hear the Minister's assurance during his speech that private Shield plans are not allowed to refuse coverage once the policyholders are enrolled. But then his response to Dr Lam just now got me a bit worried. Can I clarify if private Shield plans are allowed to drop coverage of specific illnesses upon renewals – for example, if a patient gets prostate cancer – are the private Shield plans allowed to refuse coverage of that cancer if there is a relapse the next time? If so, is the Minister okay with this?",1,807,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00807
2014-03-12-T-003,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,Second clarification  I am happy to hear the introduction of the flexi-Medisave. But I think the Minister did not address my request to expand the CDMP list of approved Medisave conditions to all medically necessary treatment that is of proven value and is cost effective.,2,808,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00808
2014-03-12-T-003,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Last clarification  I think it is good that the Eastern Health Alliance is conducting home visits for patients, or even hospital visits. Are the patients made to pay for these visits? I hope not. And are there plans to use telehealth to monitor activities like medication compliance because this can reduce costs and extend the reach of such interventions?",3,809,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00809
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Madam, let me just clarify with Mr Giam on the IP coverage. If you are covered today by the Integrated Plans and if you develop any disease, the Integrated Plan must continue to cover you. So, what I was talking about is, if you already have exclusions, you will still be covered by MediShield Life. So, I hope that clarifies.",1,810,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00810
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The second question that he asked is about Medisave coverage for CDMP, or the Chronic Disease Management Programme. Currently, we cover 15 diseases. We continue to review them. I think we just added five recently. So, we will continue to review them and we will add additional diseases when the Review Committee thinks that it is appropriate. Even with the current 15 diseases under the CDMP, we have already covered more than 90% of the chronic diseases. So, I think it is adequate. In addition to that, because we are going to introduce flexi-Medisave, it will also be able to cover additional expenses that one does incur because of diseases not covered by CDMP. I hope that answers his second question.",2,811,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00811
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"On his third question, he asked about the Changi General Hospital's home visit programme. These programmes are conducted by CGH and they will assess the needs of the patients. As far as I understand, there are no charges, but I have to verify that. But even if there are charges, if the patients are not able to afford, there will be schemes that will provide the necessary assistance to ensure that affordability is not an issue for the patients, if they need to access these home visits. But for home therapy, of course, there will be therapists' charges. These therapies will be subject to the normal subsidies that already are in existence.",3,812,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00812
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"For telehealth, I have mentioned in my reply that we are exploring various models. And the monitoring of compliance to medication is one area that we are exploring to see whether we can step up on medication compliance. But, very often, we find that it is not just a single issue. When patients have compliance issues, they tend to be associated with other social issues as well. So, telehealth will also have to be done together with a suite of services to ensure that the patients will be looked after well at home.",4,813,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00813
2014-03-12-T-003,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Madam, a clarification for the Minister about the acute bed situation. In Singapore, we benefit from a combination of universal access to public healthcare, as well as patients' choice. The patients can choose where they go for their acute care. In many healthcare systems, that is not the case, where either legislature or the funding structure removed some of that choice. So, I would like to ask the Minister  how much of what is perceived as acute bed crunch is a result of some asymmetry in where the bed capacity is available and where patients are going to? Going forward, as we increase the total bed capacity, are there some considerations to smoothen out the demand or redistribute some of demand to match capacity, and I am not, by the way, advocating for a restriction of access. I think that is one of the commendable things that we have in our public healthcare system.",1,814,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00814
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Madam, it is right that, today, we have a free choice of beds and, of course, given that the public hospitals are subsidised, many patients still come to the public hospital. And because the quality of our public hospitals is very good, the choice is, therefore, quite obvious. But going forward, even currently, we do have collaboration with the private hospitals to see how we can better spread the load and we have, as I mentioned in my reply, collaborations with Parkway Hospital and West Point Hospital to tap on their capacity. I think this is also one way of spreading the load but, eventually, I think the key is to ensure that it is not just the acute hospitals but also different settings that we need to continue to develop and also encourage patients to opt for step-down facilities for them to recover better.",1,815,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00815
2014-03-12-T-003,Lee Li Lian,Ms Lee Li Lian,"Madam, two clarifications for the Minister, please. The first one – are there plans to conduct a review of IDAPE? The current payouts of $150 and $250 are too low. Next, will the Ministry consider releasing a list of what are the types of new cancer treatments not classified as chemotherapy that are currently allowed under Medisave? This will provide greater clarity for the public as well as our frontline healthcare staff.",1,816,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00816
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We are currently reviewing both ElderShield as well as IDAPE. As I explained in my reply, the review is rather complex because it involves deciding what kind of benefits ElderShield should provide and every benefit that we want to provide has an impact on the premiums. We have to ensure that the premiums remain affordable. As much as we have done for MediShield, as you can see, it is quite an elaborate exercise. Currently, we are reviewing ElderShield, together with IDAPE. In due course, we will share with Members the status of the review.",1,817,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00817
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"On drugs that are not covered  from time to time, we will include standard drugs that are covered under subsidy for chemotherapy. But for drugs that are not covered, there is a Medication Assistance Fund that we have provided. Even if it is not a standard drug that is included, you can still have access to the Medication Assistance Fund, if the doctor determines that this is the drug that you need to use for your specific treatment, whether it is for cancer or any other illnesses and that you are not able to afford the drug. The key is for patients to discuss with the doctor. If the drug or treatment is necessary and you cannot afford it, we would encourage you to discuss with your doctor and the institutions will then apply for Medication Assistance Funds where necessary.",2,818,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00818
2014-03-12-T-003,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam,"Would the Minister consider lifting the Medisave cap of $5,000 for patients in rehabilitation at hospitals, as most patients are elderly who need longer hospitalisation and when they come out of hospital, they have to pay thousands of dollars out of their pocket, even though they are under MediShield plan?",1,819,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00819
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Madam, let me put it this way. I would suggest that for specific cases, if they have an extensive stay in our rehab hospitals or community hospitals, we will encourage them to discuss with the hospital administration. If they need help with their out-of-pocket payment, we have schemes including Medifund that would be made available to help them, especially for the low-income who are not able to afford the out-of-pocket expenses, rather than to adjust overall caps.",1,820,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00820
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The overall cap on claims has an impact on the premiums. For specific cases, if we raise the overall caps, it may impact the premiums that will affect everyone. On a case-by-case basis, if the patients are needy, we will be happy to look at it. I encourage Mrs Chiam to encourage the patients to discuss with the hospital or let me know specifically, and we will look into it on a case-by-case basis.",2,821,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00821
2014-03-12-T-003,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Madam, earlier on, the Minister explained the difficulty in hospital bed demand projection. I wonder whether MOH planned for emergencies and spikes in patient numbers who may need acute hospital care. Madam, this is not a new issue. In 2005, nearly 10 years ago, I raised the same issue in this House. The then-Minister for Health answered that, ""Our hospital beds are crowded out by foreign workers who are being dumped at Tan Tock Seng Hospital at the expense of others who require emergency care and beds."" Today, we have a new Minister for Health telling us a different reason of difficulty in projection. Perhaps, the Minister may want to explain the factors that are taken into consideration now and 10 years ago since 2005 when the issue was raised.",1,822,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00822

2014-03-12-T-003,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Yes, okay. So, I ask the current Minister to clarify what he has been doing, since the issue was raised in this House in 2005. I would also like to know from the Minister what he thinks is a reasonable waiting time for a patient to wait for a bed in the hospital, or whether he could assure us what would be the waiting time that a patient can expect when he needs the hospital bed for admission. We have feedback that there are patients who have waited for eight hours, or some for as long as 23 hours. I think this is just too long. It is not something which we would expect in a First World country, right?",1,824,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00824
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Madam, that is why we have introduced Healthcare 2020 two years ago, having looked at the capacity planning and looking at the projection for our population, as well as the profile of our population and the pace of ageing. Healthcare 2020 will include capacity building that will meet the demand, going forward. It is not just about acute hospital beds; it is also about the entire healthcare system, as well as the model of care.",1,825,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00825
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Coming back to the waiting time that Mr Low has asked, as I have explained, the waiting time will depend on the situation from day to day. For a normal day, we should not expect the patient to wait more than a few hours. For patients who are more urgent, in fact, they will be warded immediately. They may be sent to ICU immediately, even before warding.",2,826,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00826
2014-03-12-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"What is more important is that even while they are waiting, their care and safety will not be compromised. We have in-patient teams that will be on hand, and even at the A&E, the observation ward, to keep watch over them, to provide them with necessary treatment. The treatment will start even before they were warded if the waiting is too long. We will have to assess the situation. When there is a spike in demand because of various factors, for short periods of time, the waiting time may be a little bit longer. So, I hope that Singaporeans will understand. Under normal circumstances, patients can expect a normal waiting time.",3,827,2014-03-12-T-003-S-00827

Four of her older children, aged six to 13, had been attending our CATCH Plus programme, as mentioned by Mr Seah Kian Peng earlier.

Giving them ComCare assistance will only solve their difficulty for the short term. What they really need is micro-interventions to attain a longer-term solution. We need the system to better help them help themselves. This is particularly useful for the young families. Will MSF consider taking such an approach, especially for young families in need? This method will seek out the underlying root causes of poverty and then work with the families to change the course of their lives for the better.

NCPG has some powers from the Casino Control Act and these pertain to exclusion orders and visit limits. But would using these be too little and too late?",3,883,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00883

This authority was established in 2001, taking over the gambling regulation once handled piecemeal by 54 different Norwegian bureaucracies. The Authority is considered an active regulator and may even appear to be a bit of a nanny state in their anti-gambling measures.

Again, is MSF also having to deal with the issues downstream, where the tools are focused on financial assistance, which itself is not the most ideal type of help in the long term for these families?",5,885,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00885

2014-03-12-T-004,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,I would like to ask the Minister whether his Ministry would consider administering the basic infant care and childcare subsidies to overseas Singaporeans via a registration and reimbursement facility that the cost of childcare expenditure incurred in a non-Singaporean jurisdiction can be subsequently claimed back.,4,915,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00915
2014-03-12-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Mr Chairman, in new and rapidly growing estates, such as Punggol, there is an increase in demand for childcare and infant care. This is seen as long waiting lists persist at most centres even as new facilities are being opened; and we do welcome the new facilities.",1,916,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00916
2014-03-12-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"As families relocate to new towns, access to assistive care arrangements, such as grandparents or extended families, can become problematic, especially for families that do not own a car. Many parents in the demographic in constituencies like Punggol are young and they are dual-income working households and many of them work irregular hours. There is an increase in demand, not just for childcare, but also for full-day childcare facilities.",2,917,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00917
2014-03-12-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Apart from distance, there are other issues that affect the ability of grandparents to assist in the care of their grandchildren. For some, the problem is that they are still working as the retirement age, both in law as well as in our social norms, goes up. There is another group of grandparents who have a very large age gap between them and their grandchildren. For these seniors, their own health and physical mobility limit their ability to help.",3,918,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00918
2014-03-12-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Overall, the number of grandparents who can effectively help in the care of their grandchildren may be significantly lower than we had planned for and may be a decrease in the proportion of families as we go forward. Some of the old social norms and social assumptions may be changing as our demographic is changing. This may need some new planning norms about the proportion of families for whom we have to provide subsidised childcare.",4,919,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00919
2014-03-12-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"If I could just provide two examples, Mr Chairman. I have two families. One, the father is a regular in the SAF and the mother was a nurse who took some time off to bring up their newborn baby. Getting full-day childcare was a limiting step for her to return to work. We do not have enough nurses and here is a nurse that needs to go back to work. The longer she stays away from the workforce, the higher the chances that she is de-skilled and the more difficult she would be in reintegrating. The thing preventing that from happening was the provision of full-day childcare. Even as a new centre opened in her estate, there was just not enough teachers to ensure maximum capacity.",5,920,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00920
2014-03-12-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I have another family living in a rental block. This is the family I mentioned in my initial Budget debate speech where the father is quite unwell and is on dialysis and unable to work. The mother was supporting the family until she became pregnant and had a baby. This family, through the good work of various Social Service Officers, was receiving a lot of help. But if she could go back to work, so much less help would be needed and the long-term future of this family would be much more secure. Again, we found a place for the child, but it was not full-day childcare. This meant that she could not go back to the types of jobs she was skilled for as they require her to work longer shifts and have her child in full-day childcare. There is a real and urgent need for this provision.",6,921,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00921
2014-03-12-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),We need physical spaces for childcare centres as it has already been mentioned.

It is not directly related to my cut, but I would like to record my appreciation and thanks to the Social Service Officers on the ground. They do hard frontline work and I have always been impressed that they have served with humility and a real sense of helping fellow Singaporean in need and being part of the society that they serve.

2014-03-12-T-004,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Sir, I refer the Minister to the KiFAS portion of my Budget debate speech. I am puzzled that after review, KiFAS can only be used on kindergartens operated by MOE and anchor operators. Those that qualify for KiFAS form less than half of the some 500 kindergartens here. More than 95% of qualifying kindergartens belong to just PCF. Other than PCF and MOE centres, are there actually any other centres that are KiFAS-approved today?",1,930,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00930
2014-03-12-T-004,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"There are many good kindergartens, some with long history, like the ones my siblings and I attended some 40-50 years ago. KiFAS should apply to all registered kindergartens, just like its sister scheme, CFAC. CFAC can be used on all childcare centres. MOE also saw it fit to support aided schools with religious affiliations. This Government has prided our recent Budgets for being inclusive. I believe we can be more inclusive to allow more, if not all, kindergartens to be KiFAS-supported.",2,931,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00931

For childcare, the subsidies are between $110 and $300. I would like to request that the Ministry reconsider the suggestion to allow parents to claim these subsidies when their children are cared for by grandparents. My parliamentary colleagues had made similar suggestions over the years, the latest just last year, but have always been turned down for the reason that such care, although highly valued and appreciated, is not quantifiable and that there is already symbolic recognition in the Grandparent Caregiver Relief of $3,000 per year given to working mothers.",1,932,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00932
2014-03-12-T-004,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Sir, I do not understand why the Government is indirectly subsidising infant care and childcare operators, which are mostly commercial, but not the grandparents.

2014-03-12-T-004,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"If the Ministry's concern is that the level of grandparent care is not the same as that provided by professional or institutional caregivers, we could organise childcare training courses at community centres for these grandparents. They can be certified on an annual basis, if necessary, before they can claim the monthly subsidies. Not only will this help to ensure that they are up-to-date with the latest healthcare and childcare information, such courses can also help ensure that grandparents and parents are on the same page on childcare practices today and reduce the potential for conflict. The training classes would also provide a wonderful platform for grandparents in a neighbourhood to interact with one another and strengthen community bonding.",3,934,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00934
2014-03-12-T-004,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Actively engaging grandparents in this role promotes active ageing and strengthens family and intergeneration bonding.

2014-03-12-T-004,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"In fact, it would be even better if the subsidy could be extended to non-related caregivers, that is, babysitters. This will also help unlock the latent workforce in our heartlands  housewives whose children are grown up and for some reason are not taking care, or not yet taking care of grandchildren. There are housewives who could also cope even when their own children are still very young. My mother, for example, was a babysitter to our cousins when I was in Primary school.",5,936,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00936
2014-03-12-T-004,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"I guess an area of concern could be the difficulty of enforcement or checks that the grandparents are, indeed, the caregiver. I think as long as the child is below seven years old and both parents are working, we can safely assume that there will be an adult caregiver. For a start, we can disqualify parents who employ a domestic helper. It is quite certain the child would be under the care of a grandparent or babysitter if he is not already in an infant or childcare centre.",6,937,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00937
2014-03-12-T-004,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),This change would recognise the contribution grandparents and babysitters make in bringing up the future generation and the hard work involved. I appeal to the Ministry to reconsider this.,7,938,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00938
2014-03-12-T-004,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"Sir, one often forgotten and forsaken group of our community are the stay-at-home mums. As of 2013, there are 312,000 females not working due to childcare, caregiving and home tending. There is still a lack of societal and Governmental cognisance of the critical role stay-at-home mums play in our society supporting the basic family unit and, sometimes, even the extended family. They should not be seen as unproductive or contributing less to society. From those with infants to those with kids in Primary school and those with older children or even with elderly parents to care for, these mothers need targeted support at different life stages and I ask that society, community and the Government reward, recognise and reassure them.",1,939,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00939
2014-03-12-T-004,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),We should look at how we can fund pro-family measures to recognise the economic and social value provided by the stay-at-home mums. The measurement of her economic and nation-building contributions should not be understated. Stay-at-home mums who are expecting their second and subsequent children could be given benefits in lieu of maternity leave as there are currently no direct subsidies or support for stay-at-home mums who plan to have more children. There are also no transport subsidies for stay-at-home mums as they bring their children along while running different errands for the family.,2,940,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00940
2014-03-12-T-004,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"As both a pro-family and procreation support, it would be worthwhile to add on a stay-at-home mums package to the current Marriage & Parenthood Package. It would be even better if we can equalise some of the stay-at-home mum benefits to match those that working mothers receive, especially those relating to childcare or kindergarten subsidies and maid levies. Childbearing and child-caring are a 24/7 labour of love. Try looking after two or more children at home. It is as demanding as any job in the marketplace. I seriously suggest the Government consider granting childcare subsidies for those who wish to send their third or subsequent children to childcare while they look after their first two. Without domestic help, looking after them is no joke.",3,941,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00941
2014-03-12-T-004,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),Another area in which we can do more for them is in terms of tax reliefs or rebates for stay-at-home mums. The working mother's child relief can be extended to stay-at-home mums and these reliefs can be shared with their spouses to alleviate the financial burdens of a single-income family.,4,942,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00942
2014-03-12-T-004,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"I am also worried about the future medical needs of stay-at-home mums. They do not have regular CPF and Medisave contributions. Hence, I would like to repeat my calls again this year for the stay-at-home mums to be given top-ups in their Medisave and Special Accounts to meet their healthcare and retirement needs. One way is to provide Government dollar-matching top-ups if the stay-at-home mum's working husband is contributing to her CPF account instead of the working mother's child relief, which may not benefit a mother who does not even earn a taxable income.",5,943,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00943
2014-03-12-T-004,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),Some stay-at-home mums with older children also need part-time jobs and freelance positions to supplement their income or even work-at- or work-from- home alternatives and that can be considered as employment.

2014-03-12-T-004,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Chairman, let me first declare my interest as an Executive Secretary of the Education Services Union. Many early childhood educators that I spoke with are passionate about their jobs and want to do better in their roles. We need to quickly implement solutions to attract, develop and retain them. The Minister last year announced a Continuing Professional Development Masterplan for Early Childhood Educators to update their skills, knowledge, attain key competencies and gain experience. In last year's COS, I also proposed designing incentives for teachers who complete certain professional development courses. I am heartened to know that this component is included in part of the Masterplan. My question is  will the Minister be able to share more details of the recognition and incentive scheme, and its implementation dates?",1,947,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00947
2014-03-12-T-004,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"My second cut is on stress management. Teaching can, indeed, be rewarding and stressful at the same time. For example, many childhood educators share that they face lack of resources at the workplace, not enough break time, tight manpower at the centre, lack of recognition at the workplace and having to deal with unreasonable demands from various individuals and groups. Can the Ministry share if there are better measures or new measures in place to help them better manage stress faced at the workplace? Of course, this should not be the sole responsibility or domain of MSF and I hope that whatever solution that the Ministry comes up with will involve the roles and participation of other stakeholders as well.",2,948,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00948

With changing demography, leading to smaller family sizes and the rising trend of dual-income families, the phenomenon of latchkey kids has once again become an area of concern. There has, therefore, been a corresponding increase in demand for care arrangements for school-going children as both parents are in the workforce.",1,949,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00949
2014-03-12-T-004,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"The transit from childcare to kindergarten now has another element, that of pre-school to Primary school.

Similarly, families using full-day childcare services today will likely also require student care for their children, to provide for homework supervision, as well as before and after-school care.",2,950,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00950
2014-03-12-T-004,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"The current 407 Student Care Centres (SCCs) across the island cater to this growing need. However, I would like to know if the Ministry deems this to be sufficient capacity and if there are plans to further boost available places. How are standards being upheld as the industry is not required to be licensed? MOE has increased the number of school-based SCCs from 50 to 80, with 14 of the centres set up in January of this year. How does the Ministry and MOE plan to better engage the industry to provide for more SCCs and ensure that the majority of operators outside of schools continue to provide affordable services?",3,951,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00951

2014-03-12-T-004,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"First, I would like a progress update on the Family Matters Initiative which was launched last year with the intent of providing more support for people to pursue a positive family life. A sum of $40 million was set aside to help provide funding to schools and workplaces to run pro-family programmes. How many companies or organisations have taken up this funding and to what extent has this helped promote pro-family programmes?",2,958,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00958
2014-03-12-T-004,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"Second, I would like to also ask for more support for families that are undergoing divorce and post divorce, as their children may be affected when relationships turn sour. Currently, parents who are in the midst of divorce proceedings must attend mediation and counselling at Family Court if they have at least one child below 14 years old. I feel such a restriction is unnecessary. In any divorce, all children would be affected, and so I opine that the need for mediation and counselling should be made compulsory as long as they have any children who are aged 18 years or below.",3,959,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00959

I think more agencies are needed to also provide support in this aspect. Beyond mandatory mediation and counselling, there could be better support for the family and children, both in terms of financial assistance and socio-emotional support. Could the Ministry share its views and the measures on this? My next cut, on single parents.",4,960,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00960

2014-03-12-T-004,Lee Li Lian,Ms Lee Li Lian (Punggol East),"In last year's COS, I called for the same maternity leave to be extended to single parents. Currently, a married woman is entitled to 16 weeks of paid maternity leave while an unwed mother is only entitled to eight weeks of paid maternity leave. Maternity leave is particularly important for the child as well as the mother to recuperate physically and emotionally from child bearing. A mother's marital status is irrelevant. Because of this, single mothers will have to quickly get back to their workplace while they are still struggling and recovering to find infant care assistance for their very young babies.",2,968,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00968

They are also not eligible for housing subsidies. Housing is a basic necessity and single parents need to provide themselves and their child a roof over their heads, too. This often leaves them with no choice but to rent or purchase from the open market. With hefty rental rates, such families may have to cut back on other expenses, such as medical and food for their children. I have come across cases in Punggol East where they have difficulties looking for a place to stay. They have to stay in an overcrowded flat or move from month to month to stay with their relatives or friends.",3,969,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00969

There must be better legal protection for abused elderly, especially the infirm elderly. Perhaps, we can have an Act similar to the Children and Young Persons Act (CYPA). CYPA prescribes counselling, psychotherapy, assessment and treatment. CYPA also requires care centres to report suspected cases of abuse. CYPA protects informants on suspected cases of those being abused from personal liability.

When the judge asked the brothers during their parents' divorce just a few years ago whether these brothers were supporting their elderly mother, these brothers went missing in action for a few months – for many months, in fact. Just for Members' information, the father was abusive and, hence, the mother filed for divorce despite their old age, so it is not a matter of the mother not playing her part. At last, the elderly mother was unwilling to apply for MPA for fear of straining an already strained relationship. The brothers continued scot-free, knowing fully that nobody can do anything about it. Suddenly, filial piety is being outsourced to the Government.",7,995,2014-03-12-T-004-S-00995

It should be considered. But this cannot happen if there is no opportunity to do so. For instance, it can be done during mediation where a neutral mediator can be witness. Hence, will the MSF consider allowing neutral third parties to apply for MPA on their elderly parents' behalf? Proper guidelines can be established. For example, before an application is approved, the third party needs to help show proof that the children have neglected or abandoned their elderly parents to the extent that the elderly's survival or well-being has been compromised.
