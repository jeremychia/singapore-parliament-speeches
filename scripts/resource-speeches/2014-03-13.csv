2014-03-13-T-002,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Madam, on the support for our taxi driver ferrying people with disabilities, the London Cab Taxi Service is a good scheme for the disabled, especially those on motorised wheelchairs. This year, at the Budget, many also welcome the enhanced subsidies announced. It is important that we ensure such good schemes and subsidies reach its intended recipients. Will the Ministry consider working with the relevant agencies to better match the services of these taxis with their potential clients? Perhaps, there can be more tie-ups with non-government organisations, VWOs and hospitals to ensure that the services and subsidies reach the physically disabled users so that at the end of the day, this Budget that wanted to reach out to these intended recipients will be able to provide them better services as they move around Singapore.",1,5,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00005
2014-03-13-T-002,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Madam, what do Isaac Newton, Vincent Van Gough and Aristotle have in common? They were epileptic. What about Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Albert Einstein and Richard Branson? Dyslexia. Thomas Edison and Beethovan? They were hearing-impaired. Claude Monet, Stevie Wonder and Yeo Sze Ling? Visually-impaired. Stephen Hawkings, Roosevelt and Dr William Tan – wheelchair-bound, but like the rest, spirit and intellect-unbound! Need I say more?",1,6,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00006
2014-03-13-T-002,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"When Starbucks opened its 100th store down the road from here, it chose to hire autistic people.

2014-03-13-T-002,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Madam, disabilities can be special abilities, but a lot of time their potentials are only limited by our mindset and our imaginations. We are the ones who need to make a paradigm shift to see the flourishing of these amazing abilities. We need bold big moves to unleash their potentials.",3,8,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00008

2014-03-13-T-002,,The Chairman,"Mr Ang Wei Neng, you have two cuts, please take them together.",1,13,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00013
2014-03-13-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Mdm Chair, the Enabling Master Plan 2012 to 2016 was introduced by MSF two years ago. It was announced two years ago. We are now at the halfway mark. We would appreciate if the Minister could provide an update of the progress made.",1,14,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00014
2014-03-13-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Meanwhile, MOE had announced additional measures to help students with disabilities, including the setting up of disability offices at ITE, Polytechnic and University. This is a welcome move. However, MOE officials have also on various occasions made it clear that the responsibilities of finding employment for these students after their graduation lie with MSF and other VWOs.",2,15,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00015
2014-03-13-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"To this end, we are glad that SG Enable is formed to help find jobs for the Persons With Disabilities (PWDs), amongst its other functions. I had visited the new SG Enable premises last year and noticed that it now occupies the sprawling ground of the previous e2i campus. I understand that SG Enable is trying its best to tie up with companies that are willing to employ PWDs and attract social enterprises to set up shops at its campus, but it is facing an uphill task due to various factors.",3,16,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00016
2014-03-13-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"We hope that the Government could provide more incentives for private companies, quasi-Government and Government agencies to tie up with SG Enable to provide more employment opportunities for the PWDs. These incentives could include lower rent for social enterprises to set up shop at SG Enable campus or more relaxed foreign worker quota or even better tax incentive for firms that hire a significant number of PWDs.",4,17,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00017
2014-03-13-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"We hope that the SG Enable campus can be the incubator for social enterprise start-ups that seek to employ PWDs, much like Block 71 at Ayer Rajah is the incubator for IT start-up companies.",5,18,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00018
2014-03-13-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Madam, on the cut on transport for persons with disabilities, we are pleased that MSF will soon offer PWDs a continuum of transport options from discount on public transport to subsidies for dedicated transport.",6,19,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00019
2014-03-13-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"PWDs with lower mobility typically need to take dedicated transport, including wheelchair-friendly vehicles, to gain access to schools, day care centres as well as clinics or hospitals for medical check up. With the new subsidy, we can expect the demand for dedicated transport services to increase significantly.",7,20,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00020
2014-03-13-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"It would make sense to stretch the subsidy dollars so that the sector as a whole could provide an extensive, efficient and effective transport dedicated to PWDs. I recommend that the disability sector pool their resources together to reap the economy of scale rather than having each individual VWO buy its own vehicles to ferry the PWDs.",8,21,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00021
2014-03-13-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"To this end, MSF could help to set up a coordinating committee to develop a plan to minimise duplications, possibly stagger demand so as to maximise the usage of limited resources, namely, the vehicles and the drivers. With the strategy, the coordinating committee can then call a tender to engage a few transport operators to provide the dedicated transport service for PWDs.",9,22,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00022
2014-03-13-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Mdm Chair, at the other end of the spectrum, PWDs with higher mobility could enjoy a 25% discount when they take public buses and trains. This is a generous gesture which will be appreciated by PWDs and their caregivers. However, the public also need to understand that PWDs have special needs and may unintentionally upset other commuters. At times, they might be deliberately taken advantage of by some commuters. I would like to urge MSF to consider working with Singapore Kindness Movement to launch a campaign to educate the public so that all could have a better and more pleasant ride on the public transport.",10,23,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00023
2014-03-13-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Chair, it is never easy to be last. Perhaps, it is both a pleasure and honour to deliver the last cut for this fruitful Budget. Madam, first let me declare my interest as a member of the National Committee on Youth Guidance and Rehabilitation to which the Central Youth Guidance Office serves as the Secretariat.",1,24,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00024
2014-03-13-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"CYGO, for short, as an inter-Ministry setup comprising officers seconded from MOE, MHA and MSF, has been looking at early intervention strategies to prevent youth at-risk from committing crime. Over the last few years, CYGO has implemented a number of programmes and pilots, including Youth Go!, YES, YIS, and the YEARS programmes. They have been aimed at re-engaging youths who are at risk.",2,25,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00025
2014-03-13-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),I would therefore like to enquire how these programmes have progressed and what has been the result of the efforts. What more can the Ministry do to further reach out to vulnerable youths?,3,26,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00026
2014-03-13-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"A Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega Gasset once said, ""There may be as much nobility in being last as in being first, because the two are mutually necessary… one to complement the other."" So, with this last cut for 2014, I thank you for your indulgence.",4,27,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00027
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Madam, let me first thank all Members of the House for their support, suggestions and encouragement for the work of MSF. In particular, I would like to thank three groups of people today.",1,28,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00028
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"First, the many agencies that work with us upstream to prevent the problems from arising in the first place. These include MND, MOE, MOH and many other agencies because it is all this preventive work that allows MSF to have less work downstream to manage. The second group of people that I would like to thank are the partners who walk the last mile with us. These include many of the partners who work with us on the ground – Family Service Centres, VWOs and grassroots leaders, including many Members of this House. Third, we would like to record our thanks to all the professionals in our sector. They are at the centre of everything that we do. They are also at the centre of everything that we do for tomorrow because they set the foundation today.",2,29,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00029
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Let me at this juncture also humbly say that the success of MSF is not due to MSF's efforts alone. Like many Members of this House have mentioned, our success depends on our partnerships in working upstream with many other agencies. Our success depends on your support and, perhaps, this is the reason why for this year's COS, the sequence is organised in this way. We have many different agencies working together but united in our goal to better serve Singaporeans.",3,30,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00030
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"MSF also does not judge our success on the amount of handouts that we give people or the number of people we have helped. In fact, many social workers and professionals have told us we judge our success by how able we are to get people out of the difficult circumstances they are in. We want to promote independence, not dependence. We want to promote resilience, not reliance. We want to mobilise the community and everybody else who cares for fellow Singaporeans but not to outsource our responsibility.",4,31,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00031
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"MSF has always maintained a three-pronged vision. The first is that we want to have, as some of you have said, the whole-of-society approach where we mobilise all the agencies upstream to work together to prevent the issues from emerging downstream. The strongest aspect of our social safety net is the fact that we can give our people meaningful jobs, good housing, good healthcare, good education so that we minimise the problems downstream. Even to the level which HDB designs its own flats and precincts will have an implication on the social issues that we will face in the coming years. This is where we want to put much effort in the coming years, especially as our population ages rapidly.",5,32,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00032
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Beyond upstream work, the second prong of our vision is integrated service delivery. We know that in every society, regardless of how wealthy or how poor, how advanced or how developed, there will always be a segment amongst us who will need a bit more help. It is inevitable that such things happen in society for various reasons. But circumstances do not define us. Our responses to circumstances define us and this is where we want to integrate and harmonise all the efforts at the local level to care for these people amongst us who may need that bit of help.",6,33,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00033
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"The third prong of our vision is that we want to establish the conditions for future success. Nothing is more important than investing in our people for tomorrow's success, to meet tomorrow's needs. We want people in the sector to have deep and broad competencies. Deep in their respective areas because the issues are complex; broad because we want them to be able to work as an integrated team across different domains to provide the integrated service we so want for our beneficiaries.",7,34,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00034
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Let me talk about the priorities for 2014 on these three prongs. First, our priority is to maintain the currency and ensure the adequacy of our social support policies. Second, it is to continue our efforts to establish an integrated system for effective execution and last-mile delivery. Third, our priority is to establish conditions to meet our future needs. We want to invest in a wider group of social service professionals and we want to groom the next generation of leaders and professionals.",8,35,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00035
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Let me start with the first priority, which is to maintain the currency and adequacy of our social support policies. Our population and our demographics are evolving rapidly. The public's expectations are also evolving very rapidly. On the other hand, family support is also changing rapidly. What used to be an extended family is now increasingly giving way to a nuclear or post-nuclear family where people tend to stay on their own, with less extensive support from their relatives.",9,36,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00036
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"The first thing we are going to do is that we are going to update and refresh our ComCare scheme. But I want to emphasise once again that the measure of success of our ComCare scheme is not the amount of money that we hand out to people. It is how able we are to use the ComCare scheme to allow people to stand on their feet again. It must come as an integrated package that looks into not just the financial assistance, but also the jobs, the housing, the education and so forth.",10,37,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00037
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"For this year, we will revise the ComCare assistance qualifying criteria from a household income of $1,700 to $1,900 or from a per capita income of $550 to $650. This will allow us greater flexibility in helping many people at the margins. We will also have greater flexibility to offer for the period of assistance according to each need. In response to Dr Lily Neo's suggestions, for the elderly who receive CPF payouts and can qualify for the PA scheme, they need not worry. They will still be eligible for the PA payout and we will just top up the difference between their CPF payment and the PA scheme. For elderly with small CPF payout but do not qualify for the PA scheme, but still require assistance, we will find other ways through the ComCare short- to medium-term assistance schemes to help them. Very often, they would have some other family issues which we must try to help resolve as well.",11,38,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00038
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Next, I move on to the early childhood services. We know that the lifestyles and working patterns of our families have changed. It has changed very rapidly. Five years ago, only one in six families would require early childhood services. Today, it is one in three. In a few years' time, it will be one in two, and perhaps even more. We would need to respond to this. We want good quality childcare services and early childhood services so that we can give our parents the peace of mind to go about doing their work, which is why ECDA's and MSF's mantra has been accessibility, affordability and quality.",12,39,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00039
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"For accessibility, we are happy to update Mr Ang Hin Kee that we are on track to grow another 20,000 childcare places by 2017. We built 60 last year, providing about 7,000 places. We will have at least another 45 this year, providing about 5,000 more places.",13,40,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00040
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Dr Janil Puthucheary asked about the childcare centres in the heartlands. We have just appointed three new anchor operators. They are now working closely with ECDA to expand the capacity, especially in the high demand areas. We will look for new and innovative places to site the childcare centres, including in Mr Seah Kian Peng's ward, where we were able to find a place at the old bus interchange and converted it into a new childcare centre with about 200 places. We will continue to work closely with the grassroots leaders to identify such suitable sites. We also have a scheme to encourage kindergartens which are under subscribed to convert their premises to childcare places. We hope that many more will take up this scheme and put the spare capacity to good use.",14,41,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00041
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"In terms of affordability, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman has announced that we will revise the Kindergarten Fee Assistance Scheme (KiFAS). We will raise the maximum subsidy from $108 per month to $160 per month in 2015. This will extend our coverage from households with income of $3,500, to households with income of $6,000. This means that in the past, only one in three will qualify for KiFAS. In the future, one in two will be able to qualify. For the lowest income group, the lowest 10%, they will be able to send their children to kindergarten with no more than $1, $2 or $3 per month. That is what we hope to achieve. And even if they cannot pay $1, $2 or $3, the community leaders will find ways to raise that amount and help them to go through kindergarten so that every child will get a good start.",15,42,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00042
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"In terms of quality, we intend to further uplift and harmonise the quality across all the early childhood services. There will be a new legislative framework under a new Act in 2015. All kindergartens and childcare centres will be licensed under the same Act. There will be new and revised provisions to raise the quality and we will work closely with all the operators to ensure a smooth transition.",16,43,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00043
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"We will also improve the Singapore Pre-school Accreditation Framework (SPARK). The assessment process will be streamlined with the feedback by the operators. Then we will have a clearer rating system to distinguish centre quality by the end of 2014. Mr Patrick Tay spoke about stay-at-home mums. We cannot agree more with him the important role that the stay-at-home mum performs quietly behind the scene. It is something that I do not think money can buy. I understand. My wife gave up her career and her job to take care of our three children many years ago. They face many challenging circumstances, and I am sure MOF and the other agencies would have heard Mr Patrick Tay's feedback and take them into account in their future plans.",17,44,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00044
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Mr Baey Yam Keng also mentioned about home-based care and if we should give some subsidies to grandparents and babysitters. As Mr Baey Yam Keng said, it is not easy to execute this. The standards are varied and there will be different practices across different homes, different relationships. It is not easy. There are executional challenges. So, let us mull over this. More importantly, I think, philosophically, we have to think through this very carefully. The issue is, we do not want to inadvertently create unintended consequences by trying to monetise a lot of these personal relationships and work done. So, I will mull over his suggestion, but I must say that it is not something that is straightforward to execute. At the same time, it is also something that we have to think deeply about because sometimes we run the danger of monetising many of the things that should not be monetised.",18,45,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00045
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),Mr Yee Jenn Jong and Mr Alex Yam asked about student care services. The Minister for Education has already announced some plans to expand the student care services in the schools in the coming years. MSF will work closely with MOE to bring this about.,19,46,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00046
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Many Members of the House have rightly pointed out that the main crux of the issue will be manpower, not just numbers, but quality. The question is  how should we regulate the sector and, going forth, should we add new rules to regulate the sector but yet not make it too onerous to discourage other people from coming in to join the sector? This is something that MOE and MSF will work closely in the coming years to solve. We all understand that the demand for today's childcare will be the demand for tomorrow's student care because our lifestyle has changed. Many families now have both parents working and, hence, it is natural that the demand on today's childcare will be translated into demand for student care tomorrow.",20,47,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00047
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"We will also work with WDA to offer training and potential courses to either new entrants or existing teachers in the student care services. Having said that, I think we must also mobilise the community to see how we can come together to provide new and alternative sources of manpower for this very important sector because they care for our children and they would set the foundation for our future.",21,48,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00048

2014-03-13-T-002,Low Yen Ling,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Mdm Chair, I would like to thank all Members who have spoken yesterday and today and highlighted the needs of vulnerable groups in our midst. We are committed to strengthen the nation's social safety net so that no one gets left behind.

2014-03-13-T-002,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"In 2013, Singapore ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This was made possible by the strong collaboration and support among VWOs, Government agencies, the private sector and persons with disabilities. This milestone ratification boosts our aim of making Singapore a place where persons with disabilities are empowered and enabled and are also given full opportunities to become important and contributing members of our society.",1,55,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00055
2014-03-13-T-002,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Starting with the young, we all know early intervention is crucial for preschoolers with learning needs. Over 1,000 preschoolers with mild developmental delays received early intervention and help through the Development Support Programme (DSP) that ran in 200 mainstream preschools last year. DSP provided these children with classroom support and therapy intervention. MSF will continue to improve on such programmes.",2,56,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00056
2014-03-13-T-002,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"We have also improved assistance to young children with moderate to severe disabilities, including cerebral palsy – Mr Png Eng Huat spoke about this yesterday. The Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC) provides learning and therapy support services to this group of children. The Minister for Finance had announced the expanded coverage and subsidies for EIPIC that will amount to $32 million each year, which is an increase of 74%.",3,57,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00057
2014-03-13-T-002,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Just to recap  taking effect from October this year, first and foremost, MSF will raise the universal subsidy for EIPIC from $300 to $500 and this is universal subsidy. Every Singaporean child attending programmes at EIPIC centres will get this subsidy. In addition, we will broaden the per capita income eligibility level from $1,500 to $3,000. This means that 80% of those in the EIPIC programme will receive subsidies, compared to half today. The quantum of subsidies will also be increased. Families will pay less in out-of-pocket expenses for EIPIC. For example, middle-income families will pay about $100, compared to $300 for a similar level of service.",4,58,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00058
2014-03-13-T-002,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Just to give Members an example. Vera is one of the children who will benefit from this move. She has a developmental disorder and congenital medical conditions. She attends EIPIC at the AWWA Early Years Centre. Currently, Vera's parents have to pay $200 monthly, after subsidies from the Government and AWWA. With the recent boost in Government subsidies for EIPIC, Vera's parents will pay half of what they used to pay, that is, $100 a month. These subsidies will help the family as they incur high medical costs for her many other conditions. Such subsidies will enable VWOs like AWWA to also serve more children with disabilities.",5,59,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00059
2014-03-13-T-002,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"These changes improve the accessibility and affordability of early intervention services by catching those who fall through the cracks. We will also increase the capacity and quality of EIPIC, as highlighted by Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Ms Mary Liew. In the last two years, we have brought down the average waiting time from six to four months. The number of EIPIC places will grow 7.5% from today's 2,500 places to 2,700 places by end 2015.",6,60,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00060

2014-03-13-T-002,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"We are certainly pressing on to do more for those with disabilities. As Miss Penny Low pointed out, we can harness assistive technology to overcome the challenges posed by disabilities. Currently, the Assistive Technology Fund helps persons with disabilities defray the high costs of mobility and communication devices like wheelchairs and hearing aids, just to quote some examples. The number of applications from the fund has grown by over 30% in 2013. MOE also provides assistive learning devices to students with disabilities. At MSF, we are studying how to better leverage this area of technology to make it easier for those with disabilities to study well, gain new skills and become employable.",8,62,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00062

As a start, MSF and SG Enable are organising a community event next month and this event is called ""Enabling Community CoLab"". This aims to develop ideas to empower persons with disabilities. How does it work? For instance, some daily tasks can pose very serious challenges to persons with disabilities, such as moving around a supermarket with narrow aisles and also high racks. So, the CoLab will look into such difficulties and encourage innovative ways to address such needs. We will also bring in private players to support such solutions.",12,66,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00066

Ms Denise Phua suggested tiered funding for day activity centres to better cater to the varying types and severities of adult disabilities. I want to assure Ms Denise Phua that MSF is looking into this as we continue to ramp up the care services for adult disabilities. By the end of this year, 2014, there would be 140 new places in day activity centres that provide care and skills training for adults with higher care needs.",14,68,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00068

The Foreign Domestic Worker Grant and Levy Concession defray the costs of hiring domestic helpers to care for their family members with disabilities. To provide more affordable and flexible care options, we have recently extended funding support to also cover part-time day care services. MSF is also looking into home-based care services which will also provide caregivers with respite. In the area of long-term care, the Ministry is building four new adult disability homes. And the first home to be completed in 2017 will be located at Sembawang Walk. It will serve persons with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Over the next few years, we will also expand the present capacity of current homes.

Starting from October this year, the means-tested taxi transport subsidies will benefit those with a per capita income of $1,800 or less.

We want to ensure that transport cost will not be a barrier to those with disabilities. Instead, the ease and affordability of transportation to their place of work, school or care will bring them closer to achieving their hopes and also enjoying quality of care. Caregivers will also benefit from these three transport subsidies because of the accessibility and the ease of bringing them to school or the place of care.",21,75,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00075

However, the family cannot afford her monthly transport fee to school and the transport allowance from VWOs ends this coming June. With the newly announced transport subsidy, Zulaikha can now continue to receive her early intervention and care through EIPIC at Chua Chu Kang.

We share Mr Alex Yam and Mr Seah Kian Peng's concerns that families facing divorce need extra support. The breakdown of a marriage can be traumatic, especially for the child.

She refused to stay in her flat because she believed that her rental flat was haunted. She changed her adult disabled child in public, causing quite a bit of embarrassment to the passers-by, but she did not think anything was wrong with it. The grassroots leaders and the Family Service Centre have, over the years, over many years, tried to get her into a new flat. HDB was willing to help her get a new flat, but she refused.",4,118,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00118

But that was not the end of it. Mdm Lim did not believe that this was the best solution for the child. Mdm Lim continued to give a lot of trouble to the home who was trying to help to manage the child's condition. Even until today, we have no good resolution for this issue, not for Mdm Lim and her habits, her housing issue, not for the care of her child.

Some of them are being helped, but they provide a different story. Some of them have very complicated situations which may not be alleviated in the short term. Our policy has never been to reveal names publicly, but our job is to continue to help these people as much as we can, for them to achieve independence, and not dependence. For them to be resilient, and not to grow their reliance. For the community and the family to own the problem and challenges together, and not to outsource to somebody else. This is the reason why we have set up the Social Services Offices (SSOs) across the entire island. We want to provide more integrated services, and we want to provide more localised services.",10,124,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00124

For some Members, you may have attended our sessions already where we call upon everybody from the community to come together, to sit down together, to do something very simple – get to know each other. Get to know each other to know the kind of services in the community, and to get to know the challenges in the community, so that we will be able to sit down as one community to resolve these challenges.",12,126,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00126

In Jalan Kukoh and Jalan Minyak, the officers from the SSOs, together with the partners, walked day and night – and I mean day and night – to find out the challenges in the community. My officers told me that they needed youth guidance services. I asked them how did they know. They told me, ""I know, because for the last few nights, from 12 midnight to four to five o'clock, I was there. I saw a number of youths hanging out and I talked to them and I know what is troubling them.""",13,127,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00127

With that, they are able to mobilise the Police, grassroots leaders and the VWOs to come together to tailor solutions to the local community. We will do that, and we will do more. Because for each community, we will need to get in there, spend time to find out the unique needs to develop those unique solutions.

We all need to work together. One of the things that the SSO officers will do regularly and have already started in those communities they are in, is to do the integrated case management conference, weekly and, as necessary, to talk about all the complex cases like the one that I have shared earlier. So that different agencies can come together to share how they are helping those respective cases, and where we can do better. As Ms Denise Phua said, ""so that nobody will be over served, underserved or not served"", so that each and every case will get the attention necessary from the SSOs, the community, VWOs and FSCs.",15,129,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00129

We will input the data and the case histories for all the families in it. Why are we doing this? We are doing this for a very simple reason. For the people looking for help, they just need to tell their story once. For the people providing the help, they know what help has been given to the families or the individuals across the entire time span. No different from the medical history that we get when we see a doctor. So that in the future, when someone goes and sees a social service professional, they, too, will have their equivalent social history record available to them. This will make it more efficient for us.",17,131,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00131

Very often, there are very complicated stories behind each and every story, each and every case. Very often, the social workers and the community have been working quietly behind the scene, helping these families in need without fanfare.

Progressively, as we take on the hardest cases, it will free up resources for us to take on yet more cases. We are going to change the way we want to tackle some of these most difficult cases in society.

Whenever I talk about social service, I talk about the SSOs, I talk about the FSCs and I talk about the institutional homes run by MSF. But there is one more, one more important ring in the entire social service chain, and that is the community. We need more organised community partners that can serve as the first line of defence to pick up cases which might be vulnerable and alert the SSOs, FSCs and so forth before the families get into trouble. We also need community organisations that can serve as a vehicle for families to be reintegrated back into the community.

We are all one big family.",16,157,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00157
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In the short term, we will expand the professional and leadership development programmes. We will offer more postgraduate studies in a wider range of disciplines and will continue to allow our social service professionals to enjoy the Sabbatical Leave Scheme, so that they, too, can take a break from some of the very emotionally challenging work.",17,158,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00158

2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The Social Service Training Institute has been re-organised as Social Service Institute to provide more dedicated focus to the way we develop our social service sector professionals and leaders, and they will continue to expand the career pathway for the people and the professionals working in the sector.",19,160,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00160
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Last year, we had also done our surveys and benchmarks for the salary scales. We have widely shared with all the VWOs the benchmarks and the scales and encouraged them to revise their Human Resource framework and their salary framework. MSF, on our part, has also adjusted our funding norms to enable our VWOs to remunerate their social service professionals better. As I have always said, our social service professionals did not join this sector because of money. But neither should we have them leave the sector because of money. We are committed to making sure that we pay them fairly and properly.",20,161,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00161
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Beyond the current effort to manage the people who are already with us in the sector, we have also heard feedback that requires us to think of a new approach to complement the existing approach that we are taking. Some of this feedback from the sector includes the desire for social service professionals to be cross deployed to better understand the bigger picture to build the networks across different VWOs so that they can work closer together.",21,162,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00162
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We also want to open up the pipeline for people to join us even if they are in their mid-career already. For the younger social workers and social service professionals, they asked if they can have a better system to manage their career development and deployment. Some want to specialise, others want to be given opportunities to understand the sector, from governance to execution, so that they can better prepare themselves to be leaders in the sector in the years to come.",22,163,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00163
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We have heard them and there is support for a new complementary scheme for us to do this. I have spoken to NCSS, and NCSS told me that, this year, they will start a new scheme, together with the many like-minded VWOs, including the big ones and the small ones. A new scheme that will recruit, develop and deploy the social sector professionals as an integrated body, where they will be centrally recruited, decentralised to the various agencies and have their careers tracked by this shared and pooled service from NCSS and the VWOs.",23,164,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00164
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"This is akin to what MOE is doing, where teachers are employed by MOE but they are deployed to the SPED schools and the independent schools. We have thought long and hard about this scheme and I am prepared to support NCSS and the VWOs to give it their best shot, to develop a new career scheme to complement the existing career scheme. So, NCSS will work with the many VWOs to design the scheme to centrally recruit, deploy and expose these officers to wider sectoral challenges. NCSS will be making available more information in the later part of this year.",24,165,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00165
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In order for us to make a breakthrough in this, everyone has to think of the sector first and not the individual VWOs. That we can do this together to pool our resources to make the sector first and foremost more attractive, more inviting for the newcomers to come and join us; that everybody will benefit because the respective officers in the VWOs will be able to benefit from the exposure across different VWOs, across different agencies, from Government agencies to NCSS, to different VWOs. We hope that this will also accelerate the sharing of ideas across different VWOs. But most importantly, we hope that in 10 to 15 years to come, we will groom a new generation of social service leaders – leaders who are not just deep in their respective professional knowledge but leaders with the breadth of expertise and exposure who can lead the entire sector.",25,166,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00166

Bee Lian is someone who commands respect in the sector because she has been through NCSS, and she has been through MSF. When she speaks, every one of us, including myself, we pay attention because of her depth of experience, because she understands what goes on across the entire sector. When she makes a recommendation, it is often with deep insights and experience.",26,167,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00167

When we talk about quantity and quality, they are actually linked together. Good quality professional development will attract good people to come and join us and enlarge our ranks. On the other hand, poor quality, poor professional image, will cost us to lose even more people from the sector, which is why the push for quantity and quality goes hand-in-hand in our plan to develop the early childhood professionals.",28,169,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00169

We will implement the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Masterplan this year. In fact, it has already started in February this year where we have rolled out courses to strengthen the tools of our early childhood professionals. The take-up rate by the teachers and professionals has been encouraging and we will roll out more courses this year to meet the demand.",29,170,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00170

But in order to do this, we understand and appreciate the manpower challenges in the existing system, which is why we are building up a pool and database of relief teachers very much like the MOE system so that we can provide time off and opportunities for our teachers to go for training and upgrading.",30,171,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00171
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Having done all these, may I also urge parents to work closely with our teachers? Our teachers are very committed to what they do but they need the support of our parents. We have many positive examples of parents working closely together with the teachers. When I visited the centre in Punggol, they told me how they mobilised the parents to come in and help the teachers to take care of the children, to organise activities and really build the community. Yet, at the same time, I also have my fair share of negative examples from parents who would write long letters of complaints to ECDA and demand investigations because, on a particular day, the child went home with two mosquito bites.",31,172,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00172
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"It takes up time, energy from ECDA but, more importantly, it damages the relationship of trust between parents and teachers. And I want to emphasise again that every time when I talk to my teachers in the childcare sector, the first thing that they always ask is how I can strengthen their professional image and to build the trust with the parents. Those are the first things that they tell me, because they desire respect, they desire a partnership with our parents.",32,173,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00173

Very happy for individuals like Ms Zaqia, who after many years as an edu-carer, went on to take up her diploma and continue to upgrade herself, not because she wanted higher pay, but because she desires to do better for the children under her charge.",33,174,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00174

2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The first is to work hand-in-hand with many agencies upstream – MND, MOE, MOM and all other agencies, so that we minimise the number of issues downstream, as many of you have suggested. And indeed, we have started this journey with the many agencies. Today, before a new precinct is built by HDB, all the social needs will be incorporated into the designs upfront, down to the level whereby in 20 years' time, when we have an ageing population, there is a place for our elderly to gather, to socialise, to build networks. This is the attention to detail that we must put in place now for the future. As I have mentioned at the beginning of this debate, our social safety net is not dependent just on MSF's efforts. The strongest social safety net that we can provide for fellow Singaporeans is to make sure that we have a strong system of education providing them with good jobs, meaningful jobs, providing them with good housing, affordable housing, quality housing, affordable healthcare, quality healthcare. These are all the upstream work that we are committed to do. This year, the sequence of the Budget debate is perhaps a small reflection of this desire for us to work closer together to achieve our aim to better take care of all Singaporeans.",35,176,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00176
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The second thing that we will do is to make sure that we have effective last-mile delivery. Mobilising the community resources, integrating the work of the SSOs, FSCs and the other VWOs in the respective communities to deliver localised and integrated services so that each and every community will get the special attention that is required for the respective communities to take ownership of the challenges that they have, to take care of the respective families in need that we have within our community.

2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Let me just recount three little episodes that just came to me last week. Last week, I received a letter. The letter-writer said he saw a seemingly homeless person in the north-western part of Singapore – a Chinese man, seemingly homeless, with his bag of belongings, looking a bit haggard. And then he said he saw an Indian lady going up to this old man, trying to speak to him in Hokkien to try to understand if he was, indeed, homeless.",37,178,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00178
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The old man ignored her but the lady kept trying. After many rounds, the lady asked the letter-writer to help keep an eye on the old man and to translate. Finally, she moved on, after she was satisfied that he was not a homeless person. After that and many episodes later, I found out this lady happened to be one of my officers on her off-day visiting her relative. I was very proud of her. It was her day off. She was not a social service officer by name. But she had it in her DNA to keep a look out for fellow countrymen in need.",38,179,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00179
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Likewise, I was very proud of one of my VWO officers, and there are many of them, who brought in a young lady who was having self-harm behaviour at 11.00 pm at night, stayed with her all the way until 5.00 am in the hospital and police station to stabilise her case.",39,180,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00180

They go that extra mile to do what we call ""mobile MPS""; we do not just worry about those people who come to look for us; we worry more about those people who cannot come and may not know how to come. Very often, these MPS helpers, when they go on their rounds, they find out more issues that are required to be resolved than meet the eye.",40,181,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00181
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"All these are examples that come to my final point about the success and failure of our social service system in Singapore. It is all about people, people and people. People are at the heart of what we do and people are also the key reason why we are able to do what we do. I thank all Members of the House for your support, for the challenging work in MSF. I can only promise you that we will take in all your suggestions and your words of encouragement and your words of admonishment to try and do better in the coming years.

2014-03-13-T-002,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"A few clarifications for the Minister. First, he shared about some incidents that are posted on various websites or reported in the news. He mentioned that as a policy, MSF does not reveal details. I can understand the sensitivity. But at the same time, I think when we adopt this approach, it is very unfair to all the social workers and the good work that the Ministry and various FSCs are doing. There must be a way to correct some of these wrong perceptions and inaccuracies because the Members in this House may understand the wrong perceptions. But the ill-will that is created through such reporting makes it very tough and creates a wrong impression for the general public. So, I hope the Minister could rethink and review this, selectively.",2,185,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00185
2014-03-13-T-002,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"The second clarification is on single parents  Parliamentary Secretary Low Yen Ling mentioned that some progress has been made. Indeed, there are several, but I would like to just push the envelope further and ask, particularly for the single, unwed parents or parents who are not married. There have been some adjustments made but whether we could push the envelope further, that for those who have a child, can we review some of the housing schemes? Also, could some of the financial tax and reliefs be accorded to them? So, I hope the Minister could address that.",3,186,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00186

2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Madam, I thank Mr Seah Kian Peng for his clarifications. On the first issue, I think there is no easy solution to this. And I would like to follow up with what Ms Denise Phua mentioned yesterday. Those who genuinely want to help – never mind if they post the story on the Internet or what not – we will be most happy to work with them.

We have just started this; let us take a step at a time and see if it works well and then whether there is a further need for us to raise the age. I would just want to say that adults can often get into trouble, disagree, but let us always remember the child who is always at the centre, caught in between, powerless to dictate terms or even to share his or her perspective.

One, about families of adults, especially adults with moderate to severe disabilities. I was wondering if the Ministry could clarify, often these families are very helpless, frustrated, anxious and worried. How can we help these families in a more structured way to help themselves? Perhaps, help them do mapping with an end in mind; how to help these adults reach financial independence, physical well-being, social well-being and continued education as well. So, I was wondering if there are some more structured ways to do so or if there are plans to do so.",1,196,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00196
2014-03-13-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Moulmein-Kallang),"And the second clarification is really about social service delivery. I understand now from what Minister has shared, the SSOs play a very pivotal and central role in the whole social service landscape. Can Minister clarify what the roles of the other players that hitherto have been very active as well, for example, the CDCs, FSCs, People's Association (PA), grassroots volunteers and other individuals and so forth? How do we structure it such that, like the Minister said, we are sharing the same goal and so that people are not over served, underserved or not served at all?",2,197,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00197
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Madam, on the first issue of adult disability, let me say that I know and I agree that we have a gap, especially for the moderate to severe disability group. In the last two years, through the Member's efforts and the efforts of many of the VWOs – we have taken a step in that direction by tackling the mild to moderate adult disability group first. We are very lacking in our support and expertise to manage this group. This is something that we want to grow so that we can provide better support for the families with adult disability, especially the severe to the moderate ones.",1,198,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00198

2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the second issue about the SSOs' role versus FSCs and grassroots leaders (GRLs), maybe the best way that I can illustrate this is what I usually say at some of the sharing sessions with the communities. Imagine a five-ring Olympic ring in the social service chain. The first ring is a community ring. The community is the first line of support, the first line of detection. This is where we want to mobilise more community groups to provide that integration. This is where PA, this is where CDCs, and many other kind-hearted individuals come in because they mobilise the community support group. This community support group is important not just for the social service. In time to come, this community support structure will have to extend to taking care of our elderly and even some of the mentally unstable partners in our community. So, this is a community group. The PA, CDCs and GRLs are working hard on this.",3,200,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00200
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The second ring is the SSOs. The SSOs deal with the more straightforward cases and, very often, financial cases. But the SSOs are also the first port of call for many of these families with emerging issues. The SSOs will be able to link up the families in need with the more specialised agencies to do intervention work. The SSOs will be the first one to do the triage in this entire system.",4,201,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00201
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The third ring is the Family Service Centres (FSCs). They are staffed with many professional social workers and counsellors. They do social work intervention for many of the complex cases. Together with the SSOs, they sit down together with the agencies, the Government agencies, to work out each and every respective case management for the families in need; from HDB to MOE to MOM for jobs and so forth because their job is to provide that holistic and integrated support. So, between the SSOs and the FSCs – especially the FSCs – they will provide the specific intervention.",5,202,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00202
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The fourth ring is the specialised FSCs. There are some specialised FSCs that deal with specialties or niche areas, for example, elderly abuse, gambling addiction, or PAVE for family violence. These are the specialised FSCs that work beyond the teamwork of the normal FSCs. Today, we have about 43 FSCs. We have a handful of FSCs that specialise in some of these areas  TRANS Safe Centre, PAVE and Thye Hua Kwan Moral Society for gambling addiction.",6,203,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00203

These are the homes – the destitute homes and the juvenile homes – that are run by the Government as part of our statutory duties. So, there are five rings of intervention – from the first line of support at the community, to the SSOs doing the simple intervention. SSOs are not staffed with all social workers; many of them are social assistance professionals. Then, we have the FSCs to provide social service intervention; next, we have the specialised FSCs looking after family violence, gambling, elderly abuse and so forth. And then there is the fifth ring, which represents the institutional homes that look after cases like the destitute, child abuse and so forth.",7,204,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00204

Firstly, I agree with the Minister mentioning that the SSO officers need to have a helping DNA in them. Nevertheless, I believe that besides DNA, expertise is also a vital component. I would like to know from the Minister whether the officers at the SSOs are social-work trained. If yes, what is the proportion of social-work trained to non-social-work trained officers at the SSOs?",1,207,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00207
2014-03-13-T-002,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Secondly, in my cut, I had called on MSF to initiate a joint collaboration effort with HDB, in particular, the Credit Operations Department, in identifying high-risk families from being homeless and work towards drafting preventive measures. Will the MSF look into it?",2,208,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00208
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Madam, let me say that not all officers in the SSOs are social-work trained. SSO officers go through our in-house training to provide the basic level of social assistance and care. Some of my SSO officers are social-work trained, for example, the General Manager of the SSO at Chua Chu Kang. She is social-work trained. We have different people with different capabilities in the SSOs.",1,209,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00209
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the Member's second suggestion, indeed, this has already been done.

2014-03-13-T-002,Lily Neo,Dr Lily Neo (Tanjong Pagar),"Thank you, Mdm Chair. Two clarifications for the Minister, please. May I ask the Minister whether he will take up my suggestion to better assist lower-income families to help themselves by adopting the hands-on approach, to micro manage each case in order to find long-term solutions for each family, especially young families?",1,211,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00211
2014-03-13-T-002,Lily Neo,Dr Lily Neo (Tanjong Pagar),"On my second clarification, the Minister earlier said that there will be assistance for retirees who are on subsistence living due to very low CPF payouts, and that now this group will be eligible for Public Assistance or ComCare. I would like to thank the Minister for that. May I ask the Minister whether he knows the number of such cases that had been rejected by CDCs or MSF for the past few years, as I had quite a few in my ward, and whether such cases now can be recalled to give them the due assistance?",2,212,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00212
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Madam, the answer to Dr Lily Neo's first question is yes, definitely, which is why we started the vulnerable families pilot, which is why we started the SSOs. As the Member has said, we want each case to be managed according to their needs. What the Member has also mentioned very importantly is this  it is not just the cash payout that is important. What is most important is to solve the underlying issues  Is it one of holding down a job? Is it one of health issue? Housing issue? Education? And so forth.",1,213,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00213
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"This is the reason why the SSO has taken upon itself to do the case management for the community. This is the reason why we want to start the vulnerable families pilot with 500 families as the pilot in the first place to allow the different agencies, including MND, MOE, Police and so forth, to come together to look at the specific issues faced by the individual or family; to help them stabilise their situation, and then they move out from there. Our long-term goal is not to have more and more people on the ComCare scheme. Our long-term goal is to have ComCare act as a bridge for them to get to a better future.",2,214,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00214
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the second issue  that has already been on-going for a very long while. First and foremost, we see whether the person qualifies for public assistance. If the person qualifies for Public Assistance and if the person has CPF, we will then just top up the difference. If the person does not qualify for Public Assistance, we will then look into why they did not qualify for Public Assistance. Is it because they have family support? Or is it that they have other sources of income?",3,215,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00215
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We will look through the cases, but one of the very difficult challenges that we always face in such issues is that they do have what we call family support in the traditional sense. That is, they have children; they have people who are family members who are able to help them. But very often, there is a breakdown in the family relationship. Very often, before we can even do that handout, we have to mediate and try to get the family members to come and join us in this work. Very often, sadly, we are not always successful to get the family to come and play their part.",4,216,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00216
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"For some of these cases, we have no choice but to come in to help. Our ultimate aim is not for these family members to outsource their responsibilities to someone else but to help the family to reconcile, so that they can help take care of each other. I am sure many Members will know that this is very challenging work. Sometimes, we run a risk. Because we are helping and these very unfilial family members know that we are helping, they harden their hearts. It is a very difficult thing, but it requires a fine balance of judgement in how best to help these families in need.",5,217,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00217
2014-03-13-T-002,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Thank you, Madam. I have two areas of clarifications. The first is that I have not gotten any answers for my Budget speech and COS cut on KiFAS. I want to know exactly how many new centres have we added to the schemes. Is it only the five MOE kindergartens added to the 235 already-qualified PCF centres? That is 240 out of 500 existing centres.",1,218,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00218
2014-03-13-T-002,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Previous KiFAS qualifying criteria required operators to be non-religious, non-racial, non-profit, and with more than $5 million paid-up capital. Has this changed, because the three new anchor operators include one Christian non-profit organisation and two private operators? Can religious, racial non-profit organisations and private operators be included under the new KiFAS consideration? What are MSF's new criteria for selecting eligibility? I did not see that there was any call for new players recently.",2,219,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00219
2014-03-13-T-002,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"The second area of clarification is in student care. The Minister said that the childcare of today will be the student care of tomorrow. I wish we could wait till tomorrow, but the fact is many of the childcare users have already graduated to become the users for student care, and the demand has far outstripped the supply. Many of the large capacity centres in schools are already full —",3,220,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00220

2014-03-13-T-002,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"What is the timeline that MOE and MSF have for finalising the plans, and whether there will be, within the plans, grants for fees, like in childcare, because it is financially unattractive to run student care?",1,222,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00222
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Madam, on the first question by Mr Yee on KiFAS, all new anchor operators are eligible for this. They are in the process of setting up their centres and we will have to see how many centres they are able to set up and will qualify.",1,223,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00223
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Let me go back to a more fundamental point about how we give out subsidies and for what reasons. That is even more important. All subsidies are public money. We can only give out subsidies and use public money if we can assure ourselves of a few things, and we need to put in place these before we give out the subsidies.",2,224,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00224
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"One, the subsidies should be targeted at those most in need of help. Two, the subsidies should not lead to a situation of price escalation without a corresponding change in quality. Three, there must be some assurance of the quality standards of the institutions that enjoy the subsidies. These form our basic philosophy.",3,225,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00225
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,Will we expand the scheme? Let us do it carefully. Let us make sure that whoever we give the subsidies to – both in terms of operators and in terms of the parents – meet those criteria that I have just suggested.,4,226,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00226
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"One, it is targeted at those who are most in need of help, not just to get the next better, or perceived to be better, course for our children. Two, it must not lead to an issue of price escalation without a corresponding quality increase. Three, there must be some quality assurance. All anchor operators who pass our quality assurance will be entitled to join the scheme. I have gotten feedback from some anchor operators that they will be expanding the number of centres that provide such services. I welcome that. But I will need to put in place that quality framework and ensure that the subsidies are well used and well targeted.",5,227,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00227
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The second thing about student care, the Minister for Education has already announced the plan. We all want to do it faster, but we must not compromise the quality of care for our students. As we expand the number of student care places, we must correspondingly look at the number of teachers and volunteers that we can mobilise to do this.",6,228,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00228
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"It is a big change that we have undergone in the last five to 10 years. As I have mentioned, five years ago, it was one in six families that did not have extensive family support. Five years later, one in three. Five more years later, one in two. Yes, we will do our best to meet this demand. But I must caution that it is not a one-for-one translation from childcare to student care. It is not a one-for-one demand because some people when they finish childcare and go to Primary school, there may be other alternative arrangements. Yet, there will be other people who may need new arrangements. So, it is not a one-for-one demand.",7,229,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00229
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I can assure Mr Yee Jenn Jong that the Minister for Education and I are both looking very closely at this. Moving forward, we want to put in place a structured and quality framework for student care services, so that we can give our parents peace of mind when they put their children in the centre.",8,230,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00230
2014-03-13-T-002,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee,"Thank you, Minister. Earlier, you mentioned that there will be more support on stress management. I think many in the pre-school industry operate in a so-called “良心事业”, a career of conscience. I am calling for more support, especially for teachers who face stress at the workplace. I hope the Minister can elaborate a little more.",1,231,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00231
2014-03-13-T-002,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee,"The Minister mentioned earlier about simplifying and refining SPARKS and the accreditation process. That particular process also adds certain stress to already over-worked teachers and administrators. I look forward to MSF giving more support in the process of ensuring quality, but also understand that a lot of these professionals are already over-worked at the workplace.",2,232,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00232
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the first clarification, some of these modules will be incorporated into the continuing professional development courses that many of the childcare professionals go to. I have consulted many of the operators and professionals in the sector. In the past, we focused our professional development on how to teach better and how to relate to the child better. But the Member is right. Many of them have given feedback that these are necessary, but we need to go even one step further. That one step further is to provide the emotional support and the counselling skills for the childcare service professionals, to get the centre's support for them to manage some of these stresses.",1,233,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00233
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"One of the biggest challenges that they have highlighted to me is not the stress dealing with the children. It is the stress managing a small group of parents that takes up a disproportionate amount of their time. Even parent management skills, parent-teacher relationship building, are subjects that we will incorporate into the new curriculum for our teachers.",2,234,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00234
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the second point about SPARK, yes, indeed, that is the reason why we wanted to simplify the entire framework. Over time, as we increase the capacity in the sector, we will be able to more clearly delineate the teaching track from the professional management track. Not very different from what MOE has done over all these years with more resources. Teachers are able to focus on the teaching and, yet, we have other people to complement their work in terms of administration, quality control and so forth. Those will be the things that we will be working on in the coming years.",3,235,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00235

I have seen marked progress, especially the whole-of-Government way of social service delivery. I want to also thank him for the work in the childcare sector.

2014-03-13-T-002,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low,"First, the Minister talked about the upgrade in professionalisation of people in the social services. I think that is really something that is necessary and should be urgently conducted. But he mentioned that this will apply to all the social workers in the VWOs. I am wondering whether this should also be extended to organisations that are registered as not-for-profit, but not necessarily VWOs, or under ROS, or registered as charity. So, would this upgrade and professionalisation of services extend to not-for-profit organisations not registered as charity?",2,238,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00238

2014-03-13-T-002,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low,"I will do that, Madam. The Minister said that the IT upgrade would be extended also to VWOs and the social sector. I had sought various clarifications on that, but there was no clear answer as to whether it would also extend to the NPOs that are not registered as charity. So, could the Minister also clarify on that?",1,241,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00241
2014-03-13-T-002,Penny Low,Miss Penny Low,"Last but not least, on my cut on disabled employment and assistive technology, would the Minister consider developing studies into how we can convert special needs to special abilities and train them in that light? So, it is not a one-size-fits-all kind of skills training but really specialised according to the kind of special needs and abilities.",2,242,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00242
2014-03-13-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Madam, three quick answers. On the first question about extension to the professionals – anyone who is involved in the social service profession will qualify. We look at the social service professionals, not the organisation that they come from. So, it is the social service professionals. Two, on the IT upgrade. Our first phase of focus is on building the database for the people involved in social work per se. I am not sure about the non-profit organisations that are not involved in social work. So, I think they probably will not have that in the first phase, because the first phase is really to build up something akin to MOH's medical records, for us to provide more integrated help to the people who require social services. Third, yes, we agree that for all special needs people, we have to deal with them as individuals, and we have to look at each and every of their abilities to see how best we can help them. And I always remember this word that one late special needs person told me  ""Don't look at people with disability – spelt 'disability'. Look at them with ‘this ability'."" Because of that, we are able to appreciate what they can do and not what they cannot do.",1,243,2014-03-13-T-002-S-00243

2014-03-13-T-005,Ng Eng Hen,The Leader of the House (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"If we compare hon Members' speeches when the Twelfth Parliament first opened in 2011 and during the past two Budgets with their speeches this year, some conclusions can be gleaned. Then, Members asked if we were doing enough for the poor, for older Singaporeans, for the disabled, for PMETs and lower-skilled workers. Then, Members pushed the Government to find ways to narrow the wealth gap. Then, Members echoed residents' dissatisfaction with housing, the transport system and healthcare affordability. Members were also not pleased with our over-reliance on foreign labour and called on the Government to slow down immigration and improve productivity.",3,284,2014-03-13-T-005-S-00284
2014-03-13-T-005,Ng Eng Hen,The Leader of the House (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"From this year's speeches, it would be fair to say that there have been significant improvements in some areas as the Government rolled out measures to deal with the issues that Members raised in previous years. This Budget's $8 billion Pioneer Generation Package (PGP) won universal support from all Members in this House and the general public – both old and young alike. PGP could easily have been called ""Peace-of-Mind and Gratitude Package"" for Singapore's Pioneers. Many Members in this House have also noted that what was extraordinary was not only the Package but that it could be funded entirely. By doing so, this Government has set a virtuous precedent of not making grand promises for subsequent Governments to bear the cost. This is something that few, if any, governments around the world have done or can do.",4,285,2014-03-13-T-005-S-00285

They received the most cuts and, together, took up nearly a third of our Committee of Supply time. In all, Members filed 452 amendments, 6% less than last year. For MOH, the attention was expected, given our concerns with a rapidly ageing population and many Members wanting to give inputs for MediShield Life. For Transport and Manpower, the added attention reflected work-in-progress on areas that the Government will need to improve on over the next few years. Members were happy that bus travel had improved, but train rides had not yet turned the corner to win approval. For wages, Members noted that median wages have risen but wanted an economy that provided even better jobs and higher wages, especially for low-wage and older workers. Members here have rightly recognised that the key to both aspirations was more innovation and higher productivity, and urged economic agencies to redouble efforts to help, especially our small and medium-sized enterprises, in the face of Singapore's economic restructuring.",6,287,2014-03-13-T-005-S-00287

In this task, many Members have cautioned that we must not become insular, not to become the proverbial frog in the well, staring only at our piece of the sky, thinking that it is the entire universe.

The Ministry of National Development, which used to dominate in previous years' COS, must be quite relieved that they were not the star this year, largely because of the tangible progress that has been made in addressing Singaporeans' housing concerns. By the way, Minister Khaw, if you have found a way to remedy your eye bags, please share with us. Many of us need it also.",4,297,2014-03-13-T-005-S-00297

During the COS period, I continued with my house visits at night and many residents were still unaware about the Pioneer Generation Package and elderly residents continued to raise concerns about healthcare.

2014-03-13-T-005,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"This year, Members had heeded the advice which I gave last year to pace your speech and there were few bullet trains whizzing through Parliament during the debate this year. Last year, I also touched on the need for more judicious use of slides and videos. Unfortunately, the usage of such visuals had intensified this year. I accept that visuals have their uses, like the ones showing useful charts or figures or where such aids help in the better understanding of an idea that would otherwise be difficult to comprehend. However, a more sparing use of them would create greater impact as this is after all a debate. Sometimes, I feel like I am going through a PowerPoint presentation in a meeting. I also urge Ministries, especially those with multiple office-bearers replying to cuts, to divide your time well as I could see that some were under time pressures this year.",8,301,2014-03-13-T-005-S-00301

I also wish to thank my two helpful and reliable Deputy Speakers, Mr Charles Chong and Mr Seah Kian Peng, for their assistance. And my thanks also go to our Parliament staff who have been working very quietly but tirelessly behind the scene to ensure that Parliament runs smoothly throughout the COS debate.

2014-03-13-T-007,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"In one case, an online netizen impersonated a doctor and posted provocative and offensive comments in her name on Facebook. No one waited to see if what was posted was true. The doctor did not get to defend herself. Allegations were swiftly followed by attacks. Many netizens harshly criticised the doctor for the comments. Some online netizens even uncovered her personal information and posted photos of her online. Really, Members have to ask if that is fair and acceptable.",6,333,2014-03-13-T-007-S-00333
2014-03-13-T-007,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"In another case, cyber bullies targeted the baby of a blogger. The blogger gave birth prematurely because there had been a life-threatening condition during her pregnancy. Cyber bullies called her baby an ""alien"". They said the baby should be euthanised. This was really quite sickening behaviour. It comes from the basic bullying instincts of some, unchecked by any notion of civil conduct and aided by anonymity. Comments like these go beyond what any decent human being would consider to be the proper exercise of free speech.",7,334,2014-03-13-T-007-S-00334
2014-03-13-T-007,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"I have also been receiving emails from members of the public after news of this Bill came out. The majority of them are women, recounting their personal experiences and welcoming the Bill. One writer described her harrowing experience with a fellow colleague. After she had rejected his advances, this colleague began spreading rumours about her at the workplace. It was said that she was a lesbian, and was a loose woman. This caused the writer to feel very harassed for several years and, of course, her colleagues reacted negatively towards her. Despite all that, the writer did not leave her job as she needed to support her family. Another writer feared for her safety as her employer, who was the harasser, had a violent temper. A third writer told us that she was a victim of harassment and stalking from about five years ago and that her life has never been the same since. She continues to be traumatised until today. The writers went through serious trauma and that left indelible marks in their lives.",8,335,2014-03-13-T-007-S-00335

The emails have been redacted to remove personal particulars and also some other information they have set out. Coming back to bullying amongst our youth, a recent Microsoft Study surveyed 25 countries on the issue of bullying amongst youth aged eight to 17.

The Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (MOA) makes harassment a criminal offence. However, the way the law has been interpreted by the Courts, it is not clear if it would apply to harassment online. We also have other legislation, for example, the Women's Charter and the Moneylenders Act. But these are specific – covering harassment in the context of family violence or unlicensed moneylending – rather than covering general harassing conduct. For example, the harassment of an ex-girlfriend will not be caught by the Women's Charter.",18,345,2014-03-13-T-007-S-00345

This was in addition to the survey which showed that 85% of the broad public wanted tougher legislation to deal with harassment.

Participants, including AWARE, told us that this would send a clear signal that harassment is a social scourge that our society will not and should not tolerate. And the fact is that our existing civil remedies and self-help avenues are also limited. The High Court's recent decisions in AXA Insurance (AXA Insurance Singapore Pte Ltd v Chandran s/o Natesan [2013] 4 SLR 545) and its earlier decision in Malcomson (Malcomson Nicholas Hugh Betram and another v Mehta Naresh Kumar [2001] 3 SLR 379) cast doubt as to whether one can even bring a civil action for harassment in Singapore.

First, the Bill makes clear that harassment and related anti-social behaviour are offences, whether committed in the physical world or online; and that must be so.

However, damages will still be recoverable if the same acts also contravene clauses 3, 4, 5 or 7. Such damages will be quantified by the courts in accordance with existing common law principles.

Earlier, I have said that clauses 3 to 6 exist under current law; and that clause 7 on stalking is new, but the remedies that the victim can get were very limited. Now, we are looking at Protection Orders and Expedited Protection Orders. The purpose of the Protection Order is to protect victims from further harassment. In this context, we also took reference from the 2001 Singapore Academy of Law Reform Committee's Report on Stalking.",59,386,2014-03-13-T-007-S-00386
2014-03-13-T-007,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"What is the effect of the Protection Order? Such an order may require harassers to, first, desist from doing that which is stated in the order  for example, stop sending the unwanted gifts or loitering outside the victim's house; second, remove harassing publications and other forms of communication, if these were the cause of the harassment  for example, to remove a nude photograph of the victim which the harasser had uploaded on an online forum without the victim's consent; third, require the harasser or the victim or both to attend counselling or mediation.",60,387,2014-03-13-T-007-S-00387
2014-03-13-T-007,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Where the harassment arose from published communication, the Protection Order may also require third parties, for example, a publisher or website administrator, in addition to harassers, to remove the offending communication. This seeks to address the nature of online communication, especially over the Internet.",61,388,2014-03-13-T-007-S-00388
2014-03-13-T-007,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"These measures are in line with public sentiment. As I have stated earlier, 83% of those polled by REACH support tougher measures to deal with harassment, both online and offline. They are in favour of giving the Courts powers to order that online comments be taken down if they amount to harassing conduct. The overwhelming public view is that if the harasser does not take those comments down, the Courts should be given the power to do so. The Protection Order achieves this result. Obviously, the underlying point is that the conduct must amount to harassment. And harassment is not a new concept; it already exists in our law. What this legislation does is to make it clear that harassment is harassment, regardless of the means by which it is committed, whether online or offline.",62,389,2014-03-13-T-007-S-00389
2014-03-13-T-007,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"And if you can prove harassment – that is, illegal conduct – then you will get a set of remedies to try and deal with the illegal conduct. If you are sending flowers repeatedly, you can be asked to stop. If you are persistently outside the girl's house, following her about, you can be told to stop. If you have uploaded a nude photograph, you can be told to take it down, and website administrators can be told to remove it and not put it up again. That is what we seek to do.",63,390,2014-03-13-T-007-S-00390

2014-03-13-T-007,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"In cases of urgency, the court may grant an Expedited Protection Order (EPO) under clause 13 against harassers and third parties, as the case may be. The effect of the Expedited Protection Order is similar to that of the Protection Orders, which I have explained earlier. EPOs can be granted where the offending conduct is likely to have a ""substantial adverse effect on the victim or the victim's day-to-day activities"". Examples of such effect could be changing routes to work, work patterns or daily routines; if the victim is forced to change how he/she goes to work; or the victim is forced to put in place additional security measures in his/her home; or the victim has to move out of his or her home; or the victim is forced or withdraws from social interaction. But, of course, the Court also has to look to see whether the victim is behaving unreasonably or whether, indeed, the conduct amounts to harassment vis-a-vis a reasonable person. And this list is not exhaustive.",65,392,2014-03-13-T-007-S-00392
2014-03-13-T-007,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),The absence of any of the types of conduct or changes of patterns of conduct that I have outlined does not necessarily mean that an Expedited Protection Order may not be granted. It really depends on the facts in each case and the approach we have taken in the Bill is to give the discretion to the courts. That is how our laws have always worked.,66,393,2014-03-13-T-007-S-00393

One of the comments that repeatedly came out from the conference and following the conference, is that going to lawyers and going to the Courts both take time and money, and often the victims will not be in a position to do so. We are very mindful of this, and this is really focusing on the man or woman in the street who is harassed and victimised. Therefore, we will try and make sure that a set of processes are put in place which will simplify applications to the Court as far as possible, even without the need for lawyers, and to have expedited processes in Courts which can give orders immediately within a matter of a day, or two days, sometimes. Victims really should not be frustrated by the process in their bid to seek redress.",67,394,2014-03-13-T-007-S-00394

There are many victims who will feel that as long as there is some redress, without having to claim damages, they would be satisfied because their feelings of alarm or distress would be settled or as long as the truth is set out.",69,396,2014-03-13-T-007-S-00396

Our view really is that we should not criminalise all such conduct, and that we really should keep to the definition of harassment, which already exists in the law, and simply give greater remedies. So, to be criminal, the conduct must fall under the categories listed in clauses 3 to 7. We have not changed the law, only updated it, as I have explained.",70,397,2014-03-13-T-007-S-00397

Some victims of harassment may well choose that route instead of having to make a criminal complaint, as I said earlier, or launch a civil claim and claim damages. They just want the truth to be out and they do not want to escalate the matter further, and we should allow that. So, it is a lower tier of remedy rather than having to go to the criminal and civil law all the time and make claims.",71,398,2014-03-13-T-007-S-00398

If you choose not to file a criminal complaint, if you choose not to make a civil claim, if you choose to, say, look, I just want to clarify or correct it in some form, and the manner of correction is left to the court, then that is all that you will get.

Now, if the threshold for insult and distress is set too low, a very wide range of behaviour may be inadvertently criminalised. For example, in the course of a football game, it is quite normal for colourful language to be used against opposing team members, referees and, sometimes, even your own team mates. Such language is often ""insulting"" and may cause ""distress"" to the victim.

2014-03-13-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"In relation to stalking, I note that section 7 specifies unlawful stalking. I am not sure if there is a distinction between unlawful stalking and normal stalking. For example, would this section potentially criminalise the work of private investigators? They generally follow the victims and, if the victims were aware they were being followed, they would probably be distressed. Private investigators are often involved in contentious matters. So, they might find themselves subject to allegations of stalking if and when the victims realise that they are being followed and a report is submitted. It might be good to clarify whether such behaviour would be considered reasonable conduct as well.",16,443,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00443
2014-03-13-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Some actions taken by private investigators may well be unreasonable and may well qualify for criminalisation. I do not wish to constrain the courts too much. I think there is a potential, with broad wording, for unintentional conduct to be included as well.",17,444,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00444
2014-03-13-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I do not have straight answers to whether or not these situations should be dealt with in the Bill or whether they can be dealt with in subsequent legislation.

2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak on the Protection from Harassment Bill. As the Minister had highlighted earlier, this is a topic that has generated huge public interest over the last few weeks.",1,446,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00446
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"This Bill is a welcome move for victims of harassment, stalking, abuse and insult, who, prior to this Bill, would have had little or almost no means of help from the law. I have spoken in Parliament on the need for laws to protect the ordinary citizen from harassment and bullying online on three occasions and I hope that this fourth occasion does not qualify my doing so as harassment to the Speaker or the Minister.",2,447,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00447
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"In the past year, I have come across two such cases at my MPS. In the more severe case, a female resident had been stalked by a former boyfriend at home and at work, harassed online, even receiving veiled threats to her safety and that of her family through instant messaging. Despite making Police reports and compiling the incidences and messages for the Police, there was nothing the Police or the law could do to protect her further.",3,448,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00448
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"One day, as she was on her way home, she was nearly hit by a falling object. Not too long after, she received an SMS from her ex-boyfriend who somehow knew she had a close shave. In that message, it said that, next time, she may not be so lucky. But because the thresholds of the existing laws are vague, the Police were also unable to help.",4,449,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00449
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),I can fully understand that feeling of being at a loss even when the Police are not able to assist because the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order & Nuisance) Act is not effective in handling online harassment and stalking.,5,450,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00450
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Having handled such cases, I therefore support the Protection from Harassment Bill as it provides a consolidated law that will offer greater protection and remedies for victims, such as the resident I mentioned. The Bill provides greater clarity on the thresholds, offences and remedies for harassment in the real world or the online world - where threatening, abusing, insulting the victim, loitering near a victim's home or messaging daily will be criminalised.",6,451,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00451
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I am also supportive that the Bill creates a statutory tort that will make it possible for victims to take out civil proceedings against perpetrators for harassing or stalking them and to claim monetary compensation if their suits are successful. This provides a stronger avenue for civil recourse by victims, giving them greater empowerment to take action against perpetrators on their own.",7,452,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00452
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The introduction of the Act is, therefore, timely, given the context of today's use of the Internet and social media. Penalties for harassment offences have been enhanced to reflect today's context. The penalties take into consideration the amplification power that social media offers, which sees higher monetary penalties and jail terms, with repeat offenders also facing heavier penalties.",8,453,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00453
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Yet, the Bill also strikes a good balance – and this is what I support – to empower the Court with flexibility to make community orders, including treatment order at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH). This reflects an element of realism that, at times, the cause of these offences vary, ranging from stress and mental health issues, to juveniles who may need a more time-nurturing treatment and understanding.",9,454,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00454
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"On cyberbullying, often cited in the media – and raised earlier by the Minister as well – is the worldwide study by Microsoft in 2012 that showed Singapore to be one of six countries where bullying among youth aged eight to 17 was particularly pervasive. This Bill is also timely, as Singapore was ranked second behind China in terms of cyberbullying among that age group. Given that the social media landscape is still maturing, I am in support of the Bill which provides greater bite to counter cyberbullying before this culture goes out of control. But the approach we take has to be one of raising awareness among youths and the public and, at the same time, create a ""zero-tolerance for bullying"" in our schools – whether in the physical or online realm.",10,455,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00455
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The impact of bullying in school – whether on the Internet or in the physical realm – has a significant impact on a child. Just two weeks ago, I handled a bullying case at my MPS involving a young girl who was allegedly bullied in Primary school. I say ""alleged"" as the case is still ongoing. Since the incident, she has refused to attend school. Speaking to her, I also noticed discomfort when you speak of school and of going back to class. I have kids of my own and, as a parent, I have also noticed how conscious my children are of social media and try to avoid situations that could result in being shamed and being the ""talk of the town"". Through our own experience, we all know that the emotional development of a child can be impacted negatively as a result of peer pressure. Unfortunately, in this age of social media, this environment has been made even harsher.",11,456,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00456
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"My hope is that in this new law, we can create a sense of awareness and promote greater education on cyberbullying and harassment. At the same time, we should promote a zero-tolerance environment for bullying in school. I hope that MinLaw and MOE can do more to set the tone and guidelines to put everyone – our children, families, teachers, school administrators and counsellors – on the same page on acceptable behaviours, what to expect with this new legislation and what we should do about bullying behaviour in school and outside school. We need to handle such cases with the right touch and reason.",12,457,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00457
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"As children, they may not understand that some of their actions or the way they communicate online may constitute as harassment. Thus, I am also heartened that the law provides a range of measures to provide this balance and take a nurturing approach in community orders like counselling, psychiatric treatment or probation.",13,458,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00458
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I stand with many parents for being concerned – whether one is the parent of the victim or the parent of the accused. As a parent of a victim, the child today, will be accorded greater protection from harassment and bullying. For parents of those who may have been the harassers or the bullies, the child is also protected by law to be treated fairly and with a slew of softer measures that could help nurture the child to obtain the necessary support and education.",14,459,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00459
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"On misinformation  Madam, I welcome the introduction of laws on false statement of facts. This now entitles ordinary people to seek the judgment of the Court for publishers of statements allegedly containing falsehoods to remove the statements, or display a suitable clarification or rebuttal. Public figures and celebrities, on the other hand, are better equipped than the common person to manage the replies and rebut. Thus, I am sure that they are also aware of the negative implications of invoking this law too often, or if at all.",15,460,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00460
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I am in support only for the ordinary citizen who is or has been victims of cyber bullying, harassment or misinformation by legitimate or anonymous publishers and is unable to fend for themselves as the balance of reach and coverage in the online world is not in their favour. I support this as long as it is not a tool to be used in any manner to censor information and responsible views – alternative as they may be – on the Internet.",16,461,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00461
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"With the new Bill, the Court can issue take-down notices to websites which publish offending material deemed as harassment. I agree with the overall approach that if a victim wishes to claim in Court, the burden of proof of establishing the facts lies with the complainant. I think this is a fair process and the Courts are also empowered to direct sites to issue alerts to their readers over falsehoods made against victims.",17,462,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00462
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I have a concern for the Minister to address in terms of the form of notification for the Courts. We know how fast information or misinformation travels on the Internet, so I would like to ask how cumbersome the process is and how many cases can our Courts handle at the same time and how long and what kind of time schedule will this process take. Does the law cover only content publishers, content site owners or aggregators as well? There is a difference each may claim in terms of culpability. If a publisher is anonymous or refuses to comply, is the site owner or aggregator then responsible?",18,463,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00463
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),The next concern I have is when an application is made. At which point does the Court issue a take-down? Will the Court issue an immediate take-down or Protection Order at the point when the application is made to the District Court? And will it be in force until a resolution is made as to whether the information is fact or fiction? Or will the take-down order be made after the Court has decided that the complainant has established the facts and that there was an error?,19,464,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00464
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Madam, in the era of social media, even three days, three weeks, even three months is a long time, by which time misinformation can be viralled and shared across different Internet platforms. Thus, even with this measure, if taken too long, damage would be done. Even if the main site has taken down the wrong information, or is required to publish a rebuttal, the take-down or rebuttal does not follow through the channels where the information may have been viralled or shared by other users or sites.",20,465,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00465
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),May I also seek the Minister's clarification if the Court's powers extend to sites that republish or users that have shared or viralled false contents or content involved in cyber-harassment or cyberbullying? Is this a loophole to the law being enacted?,21,466,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00466
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"However, conversely, enforcing a take-down immediately every time a complaint is made may also be seen as promoting censorship. However, the advantage that content and service providers have are that, if proven that they were correct, the posts can still be posted and potentially viralled anyway. Thus, I think publishers and content providers still have the advantage. So, I stand on the side of the ordinary person who is disadvantaged with limited reach and influence online.",22,467,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00467
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Madam, next, on the extent of the law from sites or anonymous users from overseas. Under this Bill, the law also applies to acts committed from outside Singapore as long as certain conditions are fulfilled, for example, when an offender who is overseas can harass or bully a victim in Singapore and knows that the victim would be in Singapore at the point in time. We are certainly aware of many overseas platforms whose owners are anonymous and anyone, including from Singapore, can post on these sites or platforms anonymously, too. What kind of measures is available to the Court to enforce non-compliance of Court or take-down orders? Will the Court have the authority to block the site for local consumption – as it is not made clear in the Bill on what measures can be undertaken by the Court in such a scenario?",23,468,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00468
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Madam, on the issue of Public Workers  I am heartened that harassment involving indecent, threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour against a Public Servant is also extended to Public Service workers. Many speculate – as the list has not been confirmed – that public healthcare workers, public transport workers and frontline service staff, like bus drivers and MRT train personnel, are likely to be covered.",24,469,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00469
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I propose that in this list, we should also include workers that perform any public service function which involves enforcement responsibilities or fee collection functions under any Act or law in Singapore. As a Town Council Chairman, I hope that Town Council officers and contractors be also covered as they have constant contact with residents and have to perform enforcement functions, summons and fee collections – not too dissimilar from any public servant. From a citizen's point of view, they also belong ""to a prescribed class of employees or workers that provides any service which is essential to the well-being of the public or the proper functioning of Singapore"".",25,470,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00470

2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"On harassment at the workplace  Madam, I am heartened and I noted AWARE's campaign in relation to this Bill in championing for a safer work environment for women against sexual or other forms of harassment at the workplace. I certainly fully agree and support, as I had mentioned in my MOM COS speech as well, that we need to strengthen our agencies, such as TAFEP, to have more bite in the workplace to ensure fair employment practices.",27,472,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00472
2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"This new Bill can address and, I hope, be a new thrust, in providing workers greater protection against harassment and abuse in the workplace. I am aware of AWARE's position of greater accountability by employers. However, this is where my view differs in that I support this Bill but believe that the law must be aimed at individuals, rather than employers. I am sure all employers have human resource (HR) core values and codes of conduct that do not condone harassment of any kind in the workplace. What I hope is that this law will prove its effectiveness and send a clear signal to all employers that our workplaces should be free from any form of harassment or abuse – for both men and women.",28,473,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00473

2014-03-13-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Madam, in conclusion, I support the Protection from Harassment Bill for the objective of protecting our people against various forms of harassment, whether online, in our social environment or at the workplace. The Bill reflects and sets the tone of today's context of how pervasive online content and communications are in our lives today and how the online mechanism can amplify the act of bullying and harassment. The Internet has provided us with a lot of good in developing society, being communities together, and enhancing our work environments. Unfortunately, it also offers sanctuary to the anonymity of perpetrators. I hope this Bill provides a beacon of light to brighten this space and offer hope to victims, past and present, that the law today has caught up with technological advancements to counter harassment and bullying behaviour.",30,475,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00475

In recent years, there is a rising trend of online harassment, and victims are mostly children and teenagers. The harm caused by cyber bullying can be more serious than physical bullying. The bullies hide behind the veil of anonymity and vent their anger on innocent victims, without being caught and punished. To them, this may just be a cruel game, but unfortunately, some victims find cyberbullying so unbearable that they choose to commit suicide.",2,479,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00479

As a result, these victims played truant or had intentions to play truant. In comparison, only 22% of victims of physical bullying did so or had similar intentions. Among the victims of cyber bullying, 28% contemplated suicide. Hence, one should not underestimate the intangible harm caused by words.",3,480,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00480

2014-03-13-T-009,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"It is evident that the application of sections 3 and 4 of the Bill that cover intentionally causing harassment, alarm or distress; and harassment, alarm and distress respectively, may not be so straightforward to apply in practice, notwithstanding egregious conduct. For this reason, I hope prudence is the guiding principle of the authorities in the exercise of its powers under this Bill and I welcome the Minister's remarks that the strong arm of the law will be employed in egregious cases.",11,496,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00496
2014-03-13-T-009,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"On definitions, I seek some clarification whether ""persons"", as used in the Bill, is to be broadly read to include corporate entities as under section 2 of the Interpretation Act, or whether our Courts will be left to determine this point. I ask this as there is case law from the UK, which in applying the UK Protection from Harassment Act, rules that on a proper construction of the term ""person"", the Act does not embrace a corporate entity.",12,497,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00497
2014-03-13-T-009,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I wanted to ask the Minister what were the thought processes of the Ministry that led to a change in the maximum sentences under the MOA covering the new sections 3, 4, 5 and 6, but I note from the Minister that this was partly in response to the feedback from the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) Conference on Harassment and public opinion on this point.",13,498,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00498
2014-03-13-T-009,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"But I do note that with regard to the relevant provisions under the MOA and the sentences of the sections under this Bill, section 41 of the Criminal Procedure Code already provides additional legislative muscle to address violators of sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Bill through the execution of a bond proportionate to an accused person's means, with or without sureties, for a period not exceeding two years.",14,499,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00499
2014-03-13-T-009,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, the illustrations to a number of sections in the Bill cover the acts of school children, with sections 4 and 7 featuring prominently. It is evident that the Bill was drafted to also address the issue of bullying in schools. Research by the Singapore Children's Society in 2006 and 2007 on school students revealed that bullying is not infrequent, with about one in four Secondary school students and one in five Primary school pupils having been bullied by their peers.",15,500,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00500
2014-03-13-T-009,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In a previous parliamentary reply to the hon Member Mr Laurence Lien, the Senior Minister of State for Education replied that schools educate students on bullying through the formal curriculum as well as school-based programmes and students are also taught skills to handle challenging situations. The new Character and Citizenship Education curriculum also teaches students to report cases, seek help and to care for others. Anti-bullying awareness programmes, organised in many schools, empower students to help themselves and support their peers who are bullied.",16,501,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00501
2014-03-13-T-009,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"While I applaud these efforts, I would like to ask the Minister if these initiatives are applied with equal vigour across all schools. I ask this question not to knock these initiatives but to state my opinion that bullying, in both the real and online worlds, is best addressed through sustained and aggressive educational efforts both at home and in schools. It is my view that hard law will not succeed in altering norms and behaviour among school-children, as compared to sustained education efforts in schools where each student knows how to respond to cases of bullying and harassment instead of being overcome with feelings of guilt and suffering in silence. In the converse, education should also allow students to instinctively identify when his/her conduct is unbecoming and causing distress to someone else.",17,502,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00502
2014-03-13-T-009,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"While I acknowledge the work done by MOE and other groups in this regard, in the main, I do hope we can address the issue of bullying in schools outside the legal domain, with this Bill employed as a last resort on students who are at a stage in their life where mistakes are made and poor judgement is exercised, a reflection of youthful folly.",18,503,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00503
2014-03-13-T-009,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Section 7 of the Bill covering unlawful stalking is probably the most challenging area as it breaks new legislative ground and is potentially open to much interpretation when applied. Section 7(3), which lists examples of acts or omissions associated with stalking, is generally identical to section 111 of the UK Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 which explicitly added new sections on stalking to the Protection from Harassment Act 1997.",19,504,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00504
2014-03-13-T-009,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The potentially problematic nature of a stalking law has been seen in the application of the UK Protection from Harassment Act, which created an offence of pursuing a ""course of conduct"" which amounts to harassment of another. For example, a UK newspaper reported that in 2001, the UK Protection from Harassment Act was employed to prosecute protestors outside a US base who were deemed to have distressed American servicemen by holding up a placard that said ""George W Bush? Oh dear!"" In 2004, police in Kent arrested a woman under the Act for sending two emails to an executive at a drugs company begging him not to test his products on animals. In 2007, the residents of a village in Oxfordshire were injuncted from protesting against a power company's plan to fill their lake with ash, in case they caused alarm or distress to the company's big-sized security guards. In fact, anti-stalking laws may conceivably be used against political activists, market researchers and religious organisations, especially if individuals or organisations are not fully apprised of the meaning of ""course of conduct"", as established by section 7(10) of the Bill.",20,505,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00505
2014-03-13-T-009,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, while these examples are extreme and perhaps fleeting, it is not too far-fetched to imagine section 7 of the Bill being used for purposes that stretch Parliament's intent far beyond the illustrations provided in section 7 of the Bill, which have to do with an individual repeatedly sending emails, flowers and circulating revealing photographs, notwithstanding the Minister's point that the illustrations are only some examples of the wide application of the Bill.",21,506,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00506
2014-03-13-T-009,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"While this issue does not offer straightforward solutions, the point remains that the law against unlawful stalking may also find itself to be a victim of unintended consequences. I would like to seek the Minister's assurance that this Bill will not be used for such purposes.",22,507,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00507
2014-03-13-T-009,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In fact, it is not too difficult to envisage a wide range of situations in the local context. I remember visiting a wake at my ward in late 2011 over a period of time when there was a spike in the number of deaths at the Bedok Reservoir, with the media wondering why this was so. In my case, the family of the deceased was rather distressed that some journalists were keeping a watching brief of the number of people who came and left the wake before approaching them for a sound bite. By ""watching brief"", I also mean hiding behind pillars and taking active steps to avoid detection. This information inevitably made its way back to the distressed family, and as the law is drafted, would the Minister comment on the possible employment of section 7 against journalists and investigative reporters?",23,508,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00508
2014-03-13-T-009,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Section 7 of the Bill makes the offence of unlawful stalking subject to reasonableness. However, this is likely to be a challenging moral and ethical exercise, made even more challenging by a lower standard of proof in civil matters. I am concerned that the Bill may be subject to abuse, especially by individuals who seek to use the law as a weapon, as seen by the UK examples and, on the other extreme, for illegitimate reasons, like avoiding or strategically delaying public scrutiny which some journalists or bloggers may seek to pursue.",24,509,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00509
2014-03-13-T-009,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Finally, while I do believe the law is a positive step forward in terms of putting a symbolic focus on harassment and society's abhorrence of such behaviour, I do query what the effect of the law is on alternative dispute resolution means, such as community mediation, especially in the case of neighbour disputes, and separately, the number of prosecutions and civil cases with the passage of this Bill.",25,510,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00510

Employers, in particular, should be minded to draw up these policies in view of the diversity of Singapore's population and our privileged position as a meeting point between East and West and the different cultural values that intersect at the workplace, where a hug or a pat on the shoulder may be misinterpreted by some employees, intentionally or otherwise, as sexual harassment.",28,513,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00513

A straw poll conducted by Cyber Wellness also found that cyberbullying has risen in the past four years. What is even more alarming is that these are the kids who are only in Primary and Secondary schools. This group of students, who are our future generation, are partaking in cyber bullying or being bullied or harassed. What will become of them when they reach adulthood?

2014-03-13-T-009,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Therefore, it can be seen that this two-pronged approach will allow the authorities to deal with offenders effectively while, at the same time, providing the requisite protection to victims of harassment and cyberbullying.",23,553,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00553
2014-03-13-T-009,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Additionally, the creation of a new offence of unlawful stalking would also be effective in ensuring that individuals do not overstep the boundaries of acceptable social behaviour.",24,554,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00554
2014-03-13-T-009,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"This Bill provides clarity as to what constitutes stalking by providing examples of acts and omissions which are typically associated with stalking, as well as useful illustrations of behaviour that could constitute unlawful stalking. Under our current laws, there is arguably a lack of clarity as to what constitutes unlawful stalking, and thus, this is a welcome clarification on the state of the law.",25,555,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00555
2014-03-13-T-009,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Apart from being an effective form of deterrence against potential offenders, by clearly setting out the general characteristics of undesirable social behaviour, this Bill could form a basis for parents and teachers to educate their children and students about acceptable social behaviour in our society.",26,556,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00556
2014-03-13-T-009,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Often times, these individuals might not be aware that their actions could amount to stalking or cyberbullying.

2014-03-13-T-009,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Lastly, the abolition of the common law tort of harassment will ensure that harassment, cyberbullying and unlawful stalking are dealt with under the proposed Protection from Harassment Bill. This will make certain that a coherent and consistent legal regime is established to deal with these offences firmly and expediently. It will also send a clear message to society about the seriousness of these offences and it provides timely clarification about what constitutes acceptable social behaviour, whether in the real or cyber world. Madam, I support this Bill.",28,558,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00558
2014-03-13-T-009,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill. The old adage ""sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never harm me"" could not be more wrong. Words can wound deeply, and, in some cases, irreparably. Just as we are entitled to live our lives free of crime against our person and property, we should also have the right to live our lives free of harassment and bullying.",1,559,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00559
2014-03-13-T-009,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Does harassment and bullying occur? Of course, they do. And as the Minister and a number of Members have pointed out, in a 2012 Microsoft Study, Singapore is found to have the second highest rate of cyberbullying in the world. Should we help and protect the victims? Of course, we should. Harassment can take place in the physical and online space, and take many forms, such as sexual harassment, stalking and bullying in schools. But no matter what form it takes, harassment has severe repercussions on the victim's physical and emotional well-being. Technology – and the immediate, direct, multiple and extensive communications it enables – has exacerbated the problem.",2,560,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00560

2014-03-13-T-009,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The harassment took many forms. For example, his former boss' baby son had died.

2014-03-13-T-009,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The learned judge held that, in common law, a person is said to have committed the tort of harassment if he  (a) intentionally embarks on a course of conduct; (b) that was sufficiently repetitive in nature; (c) as would cause worry, emotional distress or annoyance to the victim; and (d) the harasser ought reasonably to have known that his conduct would have that effect.",7,565,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00565

When he did not receive payment, he began to persistently send emails and make phone calls to his insurance company's employees and external lawyers. Some of these emails were abusive.

2014-03-13-T-009,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Before I deal with some points about the specific provision of the Bill, I would like to respond to some criticisms that have been made about it.",11,569,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00569
2014-03-13-T-009,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"First, some have alleged that this law is targeted at curtailing speech, especially online of the anonymous variety, and is, therefore, politically motivated. That would be a misrepresentation of the law. The law makes no distinction between conduct online or in the physical world, nor should there be any distinction. Indeed, other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, have enacted legislation against harassment, including online harassment. Why should accountability and the rules of human decency be different online? If we agree that a person should be made accountable for causing harm to another by making hurtful statements and uttering falsehoods in the physical world, why should he obtain a free pass simply because he does it online and anonymously? There are no provisions in this Bill which stifle legitimate criticisms and free speech.",12,570,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00570
2014-03-13-T-009,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Second, if not this law, then what is the alternative? Status quo? That is clearly not a desirable remedy and many in this House have said so. And I have not heard any sensible alternatives.",13,571,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00571
2014-03-13-T-009,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I do, however, accept that this law may give rise to some difficulties and uncertainties because harassment is not easy to define. However, that is not a reason for us not to find ways to protect victims and provide meaningful remedies. This Bill does as good a job as any I have seen doing that. But it is not a silver bullet and we have to be prepared that there may be practical difficulties in its enforcement.",14,572,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00572
2014-03-13-T-009,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I now wish to make the following specific points about the Bill, which I hope the Minister will respond to.",15,573,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00573
2014-03-13-T-009,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"First, the Bill creates both criminal offences and provides civil remedies for the same conduct. That is useful. But I am concerned that victims who turn to the Police may be asked to take civil proceedings instead. That may not be a viable avenue for many Singaporeans who do not have the resources or stamina to conduct litigation or even may be intimidated by the process. Even with the simplified approach which the Minister spoke about, many people may not wish to take that step. In that event, the assurance intended by the Bill may prove illusory. Will the Minister clarify or provide some guidance as to when the Police will take action and when they will advise complainants to turn to civil remedies?",16,574,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00574
2014-03-13-T-009,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Second, there are two practical difficulties when the provisions are applied to cases of cyber harassment. The Bill does not address the difficulties associated with identifying the perpetrators of cyber abuse. Even though the provisions have been worded to take into account harassment made via online communications, and also to account for offenders in foreign jurisdictions, the cloak of anonymity that cyber-bullies hide behind may prevent the Bill from being effectively enforced. Therefore, we must beef up the resources of the Technology Crime Division of CID so that they can conduct investigations into technology-related offences beyond the Computer Misuse Act. Will we be putting more resources in these departments or other departments?",17,575,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00575
2014-03-13-T-009,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Similar difficulties arise when victims of cyber-harassment pursue civil claims. If the perpetrator is anonymous, civil remedies may prove ineffective. Again, the victim may have to expend much time and resources to discover who is behind the attacks, and that may be beyond the means of many. Is there a way the Government can assist in such technical matters at no or low cost if the applicant is able to demonstrate a good case?",18,576,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00576
2014-03-13-T-009,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"My third point has to do with the remedies set out in the Bill for false statements. Currently, we have defamation laws to address false statements but, then, only in cases where a person's reputation and standing have been damaged. Those laws also require legal proceedings to be brought, and the only remedies the Court may grant are damages and an injunction against further publication. Contrary to popular belief, the Court cannot compel the defendant to apologise or to publish a correction. But, sometimes, all that may be required is a simple clarification, correction or response. This Bill, therefore, provides a wider range of solutions, such as publishing corrections. It is, however, doubtful how effective these will be in the online space. In the time it will take for the Court to determine if the statement of facts complained of is false and for the remedy to be effected, the false statement would have travelled around the world many times over.",19,577,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00577
2014-03-13-T-009,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mdm Speaker, in conclusion, let us be clear about what this Bill is about. It is to protect vulnerable people from those who seek to harm them mentally and emotionally. There is no good reason to deny such victims protection of the law; neither should we ignore what is already going on in the real world and online world as well. This is not a problem for parents or educators to solve, at least not on their own. It requires intervention by this House and we would be derelict in our duty if we stood by and did nothing. I support the Bill.",20,578,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00578
2014-03-13-T-009,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Madam, I stand to support this Bill because I stand to support the need to protect the innocent and I believe that this House will also stand to support the need to protect the innocent and also to preserve justice in our society.",1,579,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00579
2014-03-13-T-009,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"There are many cases that have been highlighted in this House. There are many examples that we have shared to illustrate the importance of this Bill and how it will help innocent Singaporeans protect their dignity, protect themselves against, I would say, some very malicious-intent people out there.",2,580,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00580
2014-03-13-T-009,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Cases that involve physical and verbal harassment are probably relatively straightforward because these are in the real world, these are tangible. But cyber bullying and cyber-harassment are more complex. Firstly, any content that is posted online spreads instantaneously, exponentially and has far-reaching effects. They are harder to contain or control. Some sites operate outside our jurisdiction and these can be loopholes that scheming perpetrators can use to their advantage. For example, it is relatively difficult for the victim, or even sometimes the authorities, to try to identify the perpetrator. And it is also, many a time, hard, difficult, challenging to request for site owners to remove content, some even at a fee.",3,581,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00581
2014-03-13-T-009,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"There is also an asymmetry of power because it is easy for anyone to post anything online but to get the offensive content to be removed, the burden of proof is on the victim, especially in cases where the content has gone online and viral, the ability to claw back such content, to limit the damage, is, indeed, very limiting. Some sites – and I will give an example later – even demand a removal fee and this is a hefty amount. And even the original poster – the person who originally posted the comment – may find it difficult to try to retract that content later.",4,582,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00582
2014-03-13-T-009,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Cyber predators hide behind anonymity and they are emboldened when they know that they can get away with it relatively easily. Many cyberbullying and harassment cases are also sexually explicit, even towards minors. There are a few of such forums and platforms that we can find online and there is no lack of new examples even on a daily basis.",5,583,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00583
2014-03-13-T-009,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Let me just share an example. In March earlier this year, there was a photo of a young girl on the MRT and her photo was being posted on this forum. She did not realise that her photo was being taken. Ensuing that were comments in the tens in the same minute – tens of comments just started to flood the forums – commenting from her legs, rear, to her front and face. I am sure this is not something that we would proudly declare in public nor is it something that would bring any comfort to the lady involved in the picture.",6,584,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00584
2014-03-13-T-009,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"The Internet has also become the platform for revenge and malicious mischief. One example is the fiance of my resident. Her ex-boyfriend uploaded very compromising photos of her. These photos were taken while they were still in the relationship. These photos were then uploaded onto websites, such as ""revenge porn"", which the Minister had mentioned earlier, and, luckily, it has been outlawed by California. These sites are hosted overseas. There were many unsavoury comments by people she knew and did not know, and, after a while, even her friends started to notice it and came to her to ask about it. Imagine the shame, imagine the embarrassment, imagine the kind of distress that she had to go through. Perhaps, let me quote what my resident wrote to me in an email, and I quote  ""To complicate matters, the website is hosted in the United States. The company is registered in Amsterdam and even the individual, who happens to my fiance's ex-boyfriend, who uploaded the photo is unable to remove them without the website host's approval who, ultimately, would only do so if the removal fee is paid. Since then, my fiancé has lost sleep, could not eat or work in peace, especially not while witnessing the links to her compromising photos appear on search results while looking up her name.""",7,585,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00585
2014-03-13-T-009,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"All of these instances are distressing and alarming to the victims. These victims often times are harassed by people who they know or do not know on sites of origin or, worse, in some instances, being reproduced on other sites. In vengeful instances, the perpetrator is simply using the Internet and its netizens to exact his revenge, and in Chinese, I would say this is “借刀杀人“.",8,586,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00586

The results showed that about 69% of such online harassment victims are girls, and this was in 2010. And this statistic of 69% went up from 48% in year 2000. It also revealed that distressing harassments, as well as repeated harassments, have also been on the rise over the years.

2014-03-13-T-009,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Second, to what extent can this Bill influence or demand sites to remove offensive content, especially if sites are hosted overseas? ""Revenge porn"", even though it has been outlawed in California, is an example of sites whereby the recalcitrant site owner had refused to remove the content despite it being offensive because the owner wanted to extract a removal fee from persons who may or may not have been affected, but the fact is that they can become very recalcitrant.",12,590,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00590

2014-03-13-T-009,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Fourth, what kind of self-help is available for cyber victims, for instance, and, very specifically, cyber sexual or related harassments?

Victims, especially if they are minors, may not have adequate financial resources to hire lawyers to help them seek justice.",14,592,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00592
2014-03-13-T-009,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Fifth, on Expedited Protection Orders. I understand that the Minister earlier had mentioned that it can be within one to two days, but for cases online – cyber cases – speed is crucial because, within one minute, it can viral out many, many times. And, so, how long will it take for this Expedited Protection Order to be granted in such cases? Can it be even faster than just one day?",15,593,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00593
2014-03-13-T-009,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"The sixth question I have is this  Is it provided for, under this Bill, to allow the MDA to step in immediately to block sites first while investigations continue and allow the due process, as set out in the Bill, to proceed?",16,594,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00594
2014-03-13-T-009,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Madam, freedom is for everyone. The right to be protected from malicious behaviour is as important as, if not more than, the right to free expression by those who have malicious intent. For some of those who may worry about being deprived of the freedom of expression, I would say that if the post – if the content of the message – is constructive, has no malicious intent, then there really is no cause to worry at all. Otherwise, responding to this, having doubts on this Bill really is, in my opinion, somewhat “此地无银三百两” – basically, pointing to a spot saying that I never bury 300 taels of silver in this spot.",17,595,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00595

The right to be protected from malicious behaviours is as important as, if not more important than, the right to freedom of expressions by people who have malicious intent, and, I stress, malicious intent.

2014-03-13-T-009,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"I also welcome the Bill seeking to define ""harassment"" as conduct causing or likely to cause alarm or distress although the use of ""harassment"" itself in defining harassment is somewhat puzzling. But that is a minor point. More importantly, this criminalisation of harassment and unlawful stalking is important because it draws the line where previously there was none. It should help prevent egregious conduct, which might otherwise go unpunished without this new law. The Bill also makes clear that speech can be harassment in the appropriate circumstances.",3,599,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00599

2014-03-13-T-009,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"I also welcome the extra-territorial reach of the proposed new law.

2014-03-13-T-009,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Clause 7(10) generally defines a course of conduct as being actions that take place on at least two occasions. Although the Bill does not specify what period of time should elapse between the two occasions, my sense is that we should not adopt a pedantic or dogmatic reading. In my view, a pragmatic approach is necessary. Thus, if the behaviour complained of has ceased, even for a short period of time, and then resumed either in the same or a different form, this can certainly constitute a course of conduct. By the same token, acts that are some distance apart in time can also constitute a course of conduct. It goes without saying that each case will fall to be determined on its own facts.",6,602,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00602
2014-03-13-T-009,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"What this means is that, often, it may not be immediately apparent that separate incidents are connected as a course of conduct. It is, therefore, important that the Police are alert to the possibility that incidents could form part of a course of conduct, and to take this into account during the investigation of each incident, making whatever inquiries seem appropriate, to determine whether the incident is, in fact, part of a course of conduct.",7,603,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00603

Can this aiding, abetment and procuring of conduct amount to a ""course of conduct""?",8,604,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00604
2014-03-13-T-009,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),I welcome the Bill's providing for both criminal offences and civil remedies. Conduct caught by the proposed new law can be subjected to a claim in civil proceedings under clause 11. This can be useful if the evidence was insufficient to succeed under a criminal prosecution but may be enough to support an action for statutory tort.,9,605,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00605
2014-03-13-T-009,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"In civil proceedings against the perpetrator, clause 11 empowers the court to award damages to the victim. One can envisage, for example, financial loss from the harassment. For example, victims have been known to alter their lifestyle choices and daily routines, move homes or change jobs, and even restricting their social activities.",10,606,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00606
2014-03-13-T-009,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"However, it is pertinent to ask whether such a claim would include damages for emotional injury. Can the Minister clarify if this is so? I would argue that clause 11 should not be read narrowly and that, in the appropriate cases, emotional injury can be covered. Otherwise, the civil remedy would be rather inadequate.",11,607,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00607
2014-03-13-T-009,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"When one considers the offence of harassment or unlawful stalking, it is very often the fact that such acts cause, in the words of the Bill, ""alarm,"" ""distress"" or the actions are ""threatening"" or ""abusive"". Could the Bill then be explicit in providing that damages may be awarded for anxiety, alarm, distress and other associated feelings caused by the harassment or unlawful stalking?",12,608,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00608
2014-03-13-T-009,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"The protection and expedited Protection Orders found in clauses 12 and 13 respectively are to be welcomed. Such non-harassment orders are essential to stop harassment and unlawful stalking. As such, I appreciate the Minister's assurance with regard to clause 19 on the civil proceedings framework envisaged as enabling the victims to obtain the Protection Orders without having to incur high expenses or the need to engage lawyers. This injunctive relief would be next to useless if the Protection Orders are hard to obtain and the process expensive and emotionally draining.",13,609,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00609
2014-03-13-T-009,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"In addition, it must be said that the Protection Orders will be difficult to obtain where the identity of the perpetrator is unknown to the victim. Nonetheless, the power of the court to grant take-down orders and correction notification orders for false and malicious online content is crucial. In this regard, it is important to be circumspect as to what the proposed law can do and cannot do.",14,610,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00610

2014-03-13-T-009,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Clause 10 provides for the penalty in respect of non-compliance with the Protection Orders. Could the Minister also clarify how enforcement action will be taken where there is non-compliance? Who has to initiate action when a Protection Order is breached? Is it the victim or will the police do so? Should not a breach to the Protection Order be a seizable offence? This will provide the Protection Order with sufficient bite, otherwise the Protection Order will be a mere paper judgement.",16,612,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00612
2014-03-13-T-009,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Madam, I would like now to touch briefly on a matter not strictly within the ambit of the Bill but certainly relevant to its effectiveness since the Bill's long title states that the legislative intent is ""to protect persons against harassment and unlawful stalking"". This relates to the evidential requirements in prosecuting cases under this Bill.",17,613,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00613
2014-03-13-T-009,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Cases involving unlawful stalking and harassment can be difficult to prosecute. Sensitive handling, especially with regard to victim care, is important. I hope the Police will be equipped with the necessary skillsets and empathy to handle complaints of the alleged victims. Another major area is evidential in nature. Here, again, the Police must be adequately trained to ensure that the relevant evidence is gathered properly so that the victim's case can stand up to legal scrutiny when it is presented to the Court.",18,614,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00614
2014-03-13-T-009,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"This requires, in turn, the proactive building, management and execution of a case.

I trust that there will be the necessary capacity and competency in the Police to this end.",19,615,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00615
2014-03-13-T-009,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Madam, I now turn to what I call the ""oddities"" in the Bill. Clauses 7(7) and 7(8) seek to immunise what would otherwise be unlawful stalking but for the purposes of national security, national defence or the conduct of international relations. This provision prevents surveillance targets from taking out private prosecutions against those keeping surveillance and so expose their identities to a larger audience. However, it is probably hard to envisage circumstances where there will be a need for such a certificate to be issued by the relevant Minister.",20,616,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00616
2014-03-13-T-009,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Nonetheless, it would be helpful if the Minister can assure the House that such certificates, when issued, relate only to high-level operations concerning terrorism, major crime syndicates or very serious crimes.

2014-03-13-T-009,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"The Bill provides in clause 12(3)(c) that the District Court, in making a Protection Order, can refer the respondent or the victim or both to attend counselling or mediation. If the District Court is satisfied that a respondent has committed harassment or unlawful stalking, as defined in the Bill, what is there then to mediate? Why should the victim be expected to compromise? What is there to compromise in the first place? What is there to mediate? Is there the expectation for both parties to make up? Much as I appreciate the virtues of alternative dispute resolution, I am somewhat perplexed that mediation is envisaged. Could the Minister clarify what is the intent and what outcomes are sought in mediation in cases where there is unilateral harassment and unlawful stalking?",22,618,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00618
2014-03-13-T-009,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"In future reviews of this Bill, I hope the Ministry will consider enhancing the penalties where the victim is physically harassed or stalked in or near his or her home or at their workplaces.",23,619,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00619
2014-03-13-T-009,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"A further improvement is to make it a legal requirement for companies to put in a framework for handling harassment at the workplace. While the Bill covers harassment at the workplace, the power asymmetries that exist between a superior and a subordinate and the fear of losing one's job, as well as the negative and unnecessary publicity that would accompany the victim even in a criminal prosecution, make it onerous for the victim to seek redress, whether via the criminal or civil route.",24,620,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00620
2014-03-13-T-009,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Had the Bill provided for companies to do more, then a major source of harassment, especially of a sexual nature, can be better tackled. Some companies do have workplace harassment policies but the Bill could have made it mandatory for all companies to institute workplace harassment policies. We can also then reduce the likelihood of workplaces becoming hostile environments.",25,621,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00621

However, this duty is limited to harm that is foreseeable. I hope this Bill raises the bar where an employer's duty at the workplace is concerned.

This Bill is, indeed, welcome as it seeks to create safer environments both in the physical and online worlds. It includes aspects of harassment faced by society today at the workplace, in our community and online. Acts which are threatening, abusive, insulting, causing alarm, distress and fear to victims are harassment. Stalking is also included as an offence in this Bill.",1,626,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00626
2014-03-13-T-009,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"While turning to the law should not be the first response to addressing acts of harassment, laws do set the tone of what is acceptable or unacceptable behaviour in society. Recognising the seriousness of the problem, it is important that those that are harassed have protection. The sad reality is that harassment is real. I have come across several cases where residents in my constituency have been harassed. These situations caused much anxiety and distress to the victims and/or their families.",2,627,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00627
2014-03-13-T-009,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"In one incident, a resident who was stalked could not get any help to prevent the perpetrator from harassing her despite her reporting the matter.

The Bill does try to strike a balance on the extent to which a law should intervene and the extent to which we should leave the situation to self-help remedies. The Bill expands protection to include workers who deliver public healthcare and transport services. This is certainly welcomed as it allows these workers safer work environments as they provide essential services.",4,629,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00629

With this Bill, the existing penalties for harassment offences will be increased to include a fine and/or imprisonment to reflect the seriousness. Offenders can also be ordered to seek treatment at the Institute of Mental Health. There will also be enhanced penalties provided for repeat offenders. The Court will also be empowered to make community orders in appropriate cases.",5,630,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00630

These include children, the elderly and those with special needs. Online harassment can involve a range from general ""meanness"", for example, teasing/name calling, to bullying and negative behaviour with clear intentions to hurt. Those who experience online bullying can suffer damaging mental and physical health consequences.

Here, Madam, I must declare my interest. I am an employee of Microsoft and I am citing a study that was commissioned by Microsoft. In 2012 Microsoft commissioned a study to understand the pervasiveness of online bullying. Young people from age eight to 17 in 25 countries were polled. The study showed Singapore to be one of the six countries where online bullying was particularly pervasive.

It sends a strong message to would-be offenders that we do not tolerate such conduct, which is often perpetrated anonymously and is, indeed, very cowardly. It also provides an assurance to victims of such harassment that they do not necessarily have to go through a long protracted trial, often reliving the same offending material which caused them so much distress in the first place. It is often not a ""win"" in Court that these victims seek, or even damages which may be awarded later. All they want is for there to be a ready platform which can render access to justice and for the appropriate reliefs to be dispensed quickly.

Owing to this, our lifestyle and daily routine have changed dramatically. We do not dare to even step out of our house, for fear that we would bump into him.

The challenge is when harassment happens in a power relationship, such that a superior has power over the career of the victim. These cases tend to go unreported.

What may seem acceptable to one may not be acceptable to others, regardless of the number of occasions, frequency and duration of the acts. Nobody knows when stalking begins – there is no cut-off point. Experience in the United Kingdom, where there is such legislation, showed that many victims are too often reluctant to act; unsure of whether they are being stalked or just avidly pursued. Perhaps, we would also like to consider setting up a national helpline for stalking to give victims the confidence to act and to create greater public awareness.

She was startled when she heard someone shouting loudly at her. She eventually realised that it was a lorry driver who was angry that her company vehicle was blocking his vehicle from going into the back lane. After unloading his vegetables, the driver approached her aggressively and continued shouting at the old lady. Unprovoked, he punched the defenceless lady cleaner on the face!

The man, later joined by his son and his wife, shouted and screamed at her to cancel the ticket. They followed her to obstruct her from carrying out her duties, causing her great distress and only stopped after the Police came.

Madam, I believe employers must bear greater responsibility to protect their employees against harassment at the workplace. Of all cases of harassment at the workplace, sexual harassment is perhaps the most complex, the most ambiguous, subtle and highly subjective. Hence, could we make it mandatory for companies to clearly define and educate their employees on what would constitute harassment in the workplace? Are there appropriate avenues that the employee is able to take if he or she would like to disclose cases of harassment in full confidence, even those involving top management? Would companies be guided to set up disciplinary structures that promote internal action before bringing it up to become a court case?

This is because stalking cases are difficult to detect and, when victims make their first report, usually it appears trivial and does not constitute an immediate threat and, therefore, does not require prompt action.",20,706,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00706

2014-03-13-T-009,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Mdm Speaker, thank you for the opportunity for me to debate on this timely Bill that seeks to address an existing gap in our current law. Although we may not be forerunners in this area of the law globally, credit must go to the Minister for Law and the Attorney-General's Chambers for putting up this Bill. This is, indeed, a comprehensive Bill, which would go a long way of according new levels of protection to victims of harassment and stalking, both in the real and cyber world. Indeed, it is a long time coming that our current laws need to catch up with social media and new crimes in the cyber world.",1,712,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00712
2014-03-13-T-009,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"In a 2012 Microsoft study, Singapore had the second highest rate of online bullying after China among young people. Where traditional bullying was confined to verbal or physical intimidation, the social media has given the bullies a longer arm to torment, harass and humiliate their victims, even right into their own bedrooms.",2,713,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00713
2014-03-13-T-009,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),This Bill comes most appropriately at a time when there is rising concern that cyber bullying is on the rise. This is sufficiently serious to warrant the authorities to take notice and provide victims access to protection and justice.,3,714,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00714
2014-03-13-T-009,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"As shared by the Minister earlier, there were many news reports, from other countries and Singapore, where teenagers and even adults have been driven to harmful actions, even suicide, from cyberbullying and harassment. This is not something which Singapore should have the ignominy of experiencing.",4,715,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00715
2014-03-13-T-009,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"A Bill like this needs to balance the rights of free speech and the need to protect victims from harassment. Although I am confident MinLaw works hard at striking that balance, may I add my observations which I believe more can be done for victims? In particular, I will be touching on the difficulties of identifying the perpetrator of harassment or stalking, especially when the acts are done through social media, which is pervasive in our society.",5,716,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00716
2014-03-13-T-009,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Legislating against the wrongful acts is one thing, but enforcement is another. While there can be clear legislation as to what acts are prohibited under the new Act, there is still a need, under the provisions of the Act, for the perpetrator of the harassment or stalking to be identified before action can be taken. On a related note, while the authorities have the power to compel the taking down of material which contravenes the Act, we need to keep in mind that the vast majority of social media is located overseas, and the foreign service providers are often slow and careful in taking down material, unless the person who posted the material gives instruction or takes it down himself. This also requires the identification, if not the presence of the perpetrator. And this is where some difficulty lies.",6,717,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00717
2014-03-13-T-009,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"A lot of harassment and stalking can be done through the anonymity of the Internet, through social media websites like Facebook, which have massive penetration in Singapore. The short messaging system Whatsapp is said to be adding one million new users daily. It is easy for harassers to create new accounts and use these accounts to commit acts of harassment, without betraying their true identity to the victim.",7,718,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00718
2014-03-13-T-009,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"I fear that pulling the perpetrators out of the shadows may be as difficult as finding a needle in a haystack. A lot of emotional, psychological and physical harm inflicted through the harassing acts committed online can also propagate very quickly through social networks. A single innocuous post in a social website can be re-posted in multiple websites within minutes, if not hours, and removing the material from one website is scant comfort for a victim, if the same material had been reproduced ad nauseam. It may thus be necessary for the eventual Act to be effective in combating harassment, especially online harassment, to give the authorities the ability to respond quickly to allegations of harassment.",8,719,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00719
2014-03-13-T-009,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"While the Bill's original intent is noble enough, the execution may exacerbate the pains victims felt. Victims may face extreme difficulty in identifying who the perpetrator is, especially when it is done through the Internet.",9,720,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00720
2014-03-13-T-009,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Victims do not have the powers or means to conduct investigations on their own and find out who the perpetrators are, before reporting the matter to the Police.",10,721,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00721
2014-03-13-T-009,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"For all intents and purposes, the perpetrator may not have broken any law yet for the Police to make an arrest. All they can usually do is to report to the Police that someone is harassing or stalking them, and provide only online identities. We cannot expect victims of harassment or stalking to be able to identify their tormentors, or even be able to give much information about the identity of the perpetrators.",11,722,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00722
2014-03-13-T-009,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Police should not simply turn away or file away such cases on the basis that there is no suspect identified, but should consider devoting some resources to investigating such cases, especially where the incidents of harassment are serious. This is especially so since the Police have far more thorough investigative powers as compared to individuals. For individuals to hire private investigators is usually prohibitively expensive.",12,723,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00723
2014-03-13-T-009,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"It is also a safety issue, since harassment and stalking can subsequently lead to violent acts, both on the part of the victims who may self-harm themselves in despair, or taking their own violent action against the perpetrator; or, on the part of the perpetrators with unfulfilled longing leading to violence. All such outcomes should be avoided as far as possible.",13,724,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00724
2014-03-13-T-009,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"It is heartening to see that some of these concerns, especially about public safety, have been addressed in the Bill, with the introduction of Protection Orders for victims of harassment and stalking. This is a logical and effective extension of the Women's Charter protection regime, and useful experience can be gleaned from that well established framework. The Women's Charter also provides for a quick and relatively inexpensive way for women under threat to obtain Personal Protection Orders, without the need for lawyers, unless the allegations are fiercely contested. This ensures that those people who are in need of such Protection Orders can obtain them expeditiously and without taking a hit on the pocket. It would be good if such a framework is also put in place for victims of harassment or stalking, which would go towards allowing them quick access to protection without having to expend much resources of their own.",14,725,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00725
2014-03-13-T-009,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"On a related area, I note that the Bill does provide for civil remedies, like damages, for acts of harassment or stalking. Under the law of torts, in the common law, a claim can be made by the victim for ""nervous shock"" or ""pain and suffering"" which the victim suffers arising from the perpetrator's acts. The Bill appears to be silent on this aspect, on whether claims for such psychological harm can be made by victims of harassment or stalking. Such harm commonly occurs to victims, and it would provide clarity for the public for the Government to state whether such claims are allowed under the eventual Act.",15,726,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00726
2014-03-13-T-009,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Under the existing Criminal Procedure Code, the Courts have the power to order persons convicted of any offences to pay compensation to victims injured by their crimes. It would be useful, for public knowledge, for the Government to clarify that this power extends to persons who are sentenced by the criminal courts for harassment or stalking offences.",16,727,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00727
2014-03-13-T-009,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Madam, notwithstanding what Home Affairs Minister had assured this House of the adequacy of the Home Team, we are all aware of the tight labour shortage all sectors of the Singapore economy is facing. I fear that there may be little additional manpower that may be allocated to the policing of harassment, especially cyber harassment.",17,728,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00728
2014-03-13-T-009,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Moreover, we need to guard against an environment of paranoia, of being over-protective, or having people who think they are victims of harassment and make reports at the drop of a pin. Not everything which is irritating or bothersome is harassment. Hurtful or insulting statements may not always be harassment. Checking up another person's profile on a social media website may not, by itself, constitute stalking.",18,729,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00729
2014-03-13-T-009,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"The general public need to be educated as to what constitutes harassment or stalking. We need to ensure that criticism is not stifled. For example, if an artist's work is heavily criticised online and in a non-gentle manner, this, while possibly impolite, is not harassment. Similarly, given the open nature of comments posted on social media websites, for example, Facebook, comments which may put a person in a bad light, but not specifically directed at a person's webpage, that is public gossip, also may not be harassment, even though the person being commented upon may not feel too good, and may be considering using the law.",19,730,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00730
2014-03-13-T-009,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"It is all about a matter of degree. The Protection of Harassment Bill needs to have the deftness of water finding its own level, regardless of the form of its container. It is about striking a fine balance of protecting the public while not stifling free speech. It is legal taichi. With that, I support the Bill.",20,731,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00731

2014-03-13-T-009,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech on Pg xxxxx.] As a lawyer, I have been providing pro-bono legal advice to the community for the past 30 years. At times, I had helped female victims who suffered sexual harassment at the workplace, as well as women who were harassed or sexually harassed by strangers or even people familiar to them; some victims were young girls. Hence, the debate on the Protection from Harassment Bill is one that I have been looking forward to; it is also one that I fully support and is long overdue.",2,733,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00733
2014-03-13-T-009,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"At present, the victims of harassment can seek legal recourse or protection under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act or the Women's Charter. If the act of harassment includes serious threats or even sexual offences, then offenders would have contravened provisions pertaining to criminal intimidation under the Penal Code.",3,734,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00734
2014-03-13-T-009,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"However, to the unfortunate victims whom I know, these provisions are completely useless. The problem is that the victims and their families cannot afford the expensive legal costs involved in applying for a protection order, injunction or expedited protection order to get the offenders to stop harassing them immediately. To the victims, the law puts the onus on them to provide sufficient evidence. This is very challenging, especially when the offenders are their supervisors at the workplace, whose words are unquestionable to others. Colleagues will not dare offend them either. Even if colleagues witness the entire incident, they will generally choose to remain silent to protect their livelihood. As for engaging a private investigator to gather evidence, victims often abandon that option as they cannot afford the high costs. As for children, it is even more difficult because they are often doubted and most cases are left unresolved.",4,735,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00735
2014-03-13-T-009,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"Some victims are even suspected of dressing provocatively to attract the attention of the opposite sex, so they ""deserve it"". Victims deserve sympathy for their suffering. Yet, accusations by family members and those around them only serve to add salt to their wounds. Victims often become depressed under such circumstances and are unable to continue to seek legal recourse, they feel very helpless and find it very unfair.",5,736,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00736
2014-03-13-T-009,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"During my tenure as the Vice President of the Singapore Association of Women Lawyers, a single lady who was not young, average-looking and did not dress provocatively, came to me at the insistence of friends. She had a very unusual request, because she was charged in Court for harassing her boss. The truth is, she was the victim. Her boss was a foreigner who started off harassing her in the office, then sexually assaulted her, forcing her to become his mistress and eventually made up an excuse to dismiss her. In the end, she had to reveal her boss' true colours, but nobody believed her. After understanding her situation, I felt that the best option for her was to defend herself in Court. However, as she had no money to engage a lawyer, I decided to help her prepare the Court papers and also take care of all the complicated procedures, as well as the pre-trial preparations.",6,737,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00737
2014-03-13-T-009,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"A year later, she managed to win the case and justice was served. But, by then, she was very drained and depressed because the Court case took a toll on her. From the victim's point of view, to resort to legal recourse is a painful process. Her experience in this case clearly illustrates that the Protection from Harassment Act can provide better protection for the victims, as the victims can apply for protection orders on their own and do not need to be represented by a lawyer. This targeted Bill means that the victims can save legal costs and put an end to the harassment earlier.",7,738,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00738
2014-03-13-T-009,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"However, the Bill does not list protection from harassment as the legal responsibility of employers so as to better protect women at the workplace. Personally, I feel that what the Government has done is not comprehensive enough. The Government should ask companies or employers to conduct legal workshops regularly, so that employees understand their rights, employers know their responsibilities and the definition of harassment.",8,739,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00739
2014-03-13-T-009,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"Without harassment, employees' productivity will also improve.

There is overwhelming support for the Bill outside this House and unanimous support for the Bill in this House for all of its provisions. The questions raised by Members can be grouped into several common themes, which I will now address.",1,743,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00743
2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Mr Zainal Sapari asked how we can differentiate between the expression of one's viewpoint online and the publication of anti-social comments online with malicious intent. Mr Vikram Nair has also raised similar questions.,2,744,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00744
2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Whether or not a particular conduct amounts to harassment under the Bill depends on the factual matrix of each case. Reasonableness of conduct is a defence to all of the offences under the Bill and the Court will have to consider, inter alia  the nature of the allegedly offending act in question; the context in which those acts occurred; and the effect of those actions on the victim. These have to be considered in their totality before deciding whether an offence is made out, or whether other civil remedies should be ordered. Let us remind ourselves of the way in which the provisions are structured – these provisions are not new – they are already part of the Miscellaneous Offences Act. Our courts have, in the past, interpreted the meaning of these words. And so have the UK courts. So, we can rely on the body of case law.",3,745,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00745
2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The key point is this  it is not the medium; it is whether the actions amount to harassment. We all accept that harassment should be treated as criminal conduct. And indeed, it is a crime under the Miscellaneous Offences Act. We are now making it clear that harassment is a crime – regardless of the medium – whether it is physical or online. The law was not so clear on this point previously. It must also be ""just and equitable"" before remedies, such as Protection Orders, can be made.",4,746,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00746

Mr Tay is concerned with clarifying more precisely the ambit of harassment, but there are just far too many situations to be exhaustively covered in an FAQ. Further, really, whether something is or is not an offence, will have to depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the conduct or the communication at hand. And it is not desirable for us today to fetter the discretion of the Courts in these matters.",5,747,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00747
2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Pritam Singh queried if the term ""person"" in the Bill extends to corporate entities.

2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Patrick Tay raised a technical issue about extraterritorial effect. He said that if a person harasses another while both were out of Singapore, whether this would be caught by clause 17 of the Bill. Depending on the offence, extraterritorial jurisdiction can be founded on the offending acts being committed in Singapore, or the harassing effect being felt in Singapore, or some other similar criteria. So, acts of harassment which occur entirely outside of Singapore, without any nexus whatsoever to Singapore, should not be caught. And this is consistent with international law principles on extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction.",7,749,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00749

If I may refer Members to Annex E which was handed out, it shows the other countries which have passed legislation relating to stalking and you will see that it has been quite extensively dealt with.",12,754,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00754

With the exception of section 13D, which relates to harassment of public servants, the current penalties under sections 13A to D of the MOA only carry a fine. These penalties have not been reviewed since their introduction in 1996. The Bill, therefore, increases the maximum fines for offences under clauses 3, 4 and 5. It includes imprisonment as an option for offences under clause 3, which is intentional harassment; and, clause 5, which is harassment involving threat or provocation of violence.",16,758,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00758

For instance, if a juvenile, say, a child between seven and 16, is convicted of an offence which is punishable by fine or imprisonment or both, the CPC provides that the Court may deal with the juvenile in accordance with the Children and Young Persons Act. This allows the Court to make an order, for example, for counselling or probation, where appropriate.

2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Several Members spoke about workplace harassment, including educational efforts and workplace guidelines to deal with such conduct. The Bill prohibits harassment committed at the workplace. It is broader than that, but workplace harassment is covered.",25,767,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00767
2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"MOM has been working with NTUC, the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF), as well as the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP), to address issues of workplace harassment. There are also workshops to better educate employers on these aspects. And these reinforce certain key principles, including the importance of treating complaints seriously; and taking corrective action where necessary.",26,768,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00768
2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Protection from harassment has to be an ongoing conversation between many different stakeholders – the victims as well as the employers – and it cannot end with this Bill. Issues like codes for employers, other measures, such as legislatively requiring employers to institute policies against workplace sexual harassment, would have to be part of this conversation. And, really, the feasibility of these will have to be considered; some may be feasible, some may not be feasible. So, we will have to take this one step at a time.",27,769,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00769
2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Zaqy Mohamad both touched on the removal of offensive content online and whether the Bill provides for such removal and, if so, when this would take place. I think this can be addressed at two levels. If the offensive content contravenes one or more of clauses 3 to 7, and if the requirements set out in clause 12 of the Bill are satisfied, a Protection Order may be made. As part of a Protection Order, the court can order that no person can publish or continue to publish an offending communication. This would, of course, include requiring the removal of the offending content and for there to be no further publication of that content.",28,770,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00770
2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Protection Order can be obtained on an expedited basis, and Expedited Protection Orders can even be obtained within the same day if the court agrees that it is urgent. Thereafter, the publication of the communication would be proscribed. That is at the first level.",29,771,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00771
2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"If, supposing the offensive content does not cross the threshold set out in clauses 3 to 7, or if for some reason the victim does not wish to avail himself or herself of clauses 3 to 7 and wishes to proceed with the lesser remedy, in either of those situations, the victim can obtain a court order under clause 15 to make sure that the falsehood is set right and the true facts are brought out clearly. The idea behind clause 15, as I have earlier explained, is to let readers judge the facts for themselves, and the court is given substantial discretion under clause 15 to decide how that should be done. That is at the second level. So, it is a tiered response – clauses 3 to 7 carry a higher level of penalties; clause 15 no penalties, just correction, clarification, whatever the Court thinks is necessary to bring the truth across. So, we try to strike a balance between the competing considerations.",30,772,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00772
2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Ms Tin Pei Ling raised a query as to whether the Bill would apply to cyber-lynching by groups of people and whether site blocking would be possible – really, site blocking is under MDA and we will pass on Ms Tin's questions and suggestions to MCI. I think the different parts, whether it is MCI or others, will have to work in sync with what we are trying to do here, so that there is a clear central message on harassment, protecting victims from harassment and, where there are falsehoods, making clear those falsehoods and bringing them to light.",31,773,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00773
2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Assoc Prof Eugene Tan queried whether a campaign of collective harassment by two or more people can fall within clause 7. In such cases, the general principles of accessory liability under the criminal law would apply. In addition, multiple Protection Orders can also, of course, be sought against the various perpetrators in question and, in any event, if there is a Protection Order against one person, and if others have knowledge of it, and if they go ahead and contravene, then they are also contravening the Court order – that is quite serious.",32,774,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00774
2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As I say all these, I do want to put in a caveat. This Bill is not a panacea for all the ills that people face. It is not going to change behaviour overnight. It will set in place some serious standards, some pretty stiff penalties, it will make people more aware. But there will be a wide variety of cases, and the Bill will cover a large number of them, but it does not immediately mean that in some of the instances that have been highlighted – everyone is overseas, somebody is doing something – whether there can be a complete and effective remedy; it depends. It is not possible to say today that we will be able to cover everything, and people should not go away thinking that everything can be covered. But it is an important first step. Let us look at it, let us see how it applies, how it works out and whether further amendments are necessary.",33,775,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00775
2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Assoc Prof Eugene Tan sought clarification on the outcomes sought in mediation in cases of harassment and stalking. His point really is when it has come to that, why bother with mediation? I think the point is it can be ordered, may be ordered, either in itself a part of a Protection Order, or together with other directions that the Court sees necessary, such as orders prohibiting certain conduct. Mediation and counselling can also help the harasser understand the impact of his actions on the victim. We are not putting it in substitution of other orders. The latter consideration is particularly important if the harasser and victim know each other and, perhaps, have to continue to have future interactions. Then, in such situations, maybe mediation is an option. If it does not work, it does not work.",34,776,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00776
2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"If you look at the remedies, we have tried to create tiered responses  mediation, criminal penalties, civil penalties, and also self-help without damages to try and deal with different situations so that we do not have to run to the criminal law in all cases. That would really rupture the relationship completely. Nor do we have to run to the civil law and claim damages all the time. We see what is possible, and mediation where it makes sense for the parties to try and move on without any of this.",35,777,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00777
2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Several Members raised the issue of cost of obtaining relief, as well as the ease with which that can be done. We have tried to craft this Bill to make sure that the remedies are quick, easy, inexpensive and accessible to victims. For example, the procedural rules for obtaining Protection Orders and expedited Protection Orders are intended to be simple – a concern which Ms Ellen Lee had raised.",36,778,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00778
2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Let me put it this way. I am not sure that you can completely remove the sight of lawyers from these things, as much as many would like that. Whatever you do, lawyers pop up everywhere – whether they are likeable or not likeable. But we will try to keep it simple and the Bill envisages subsidiary legislation. One of the things that we have in mind is to have a set of procedures which are simple, easy, effective, such that you can go and do it yourself without having to use lawyers. But the other side might get lawyers.",37,779,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00779
2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The intention in the way that we will draft the rules is that expedited Protection Orders can be obtained. ""Can be"" obtained does not mean it will ""always be"" obtained because if the other side turns up and they oppose and they have valid arguments, then the Courts may well feel obliged to hear them. Sometimes, the Courts will say, ""I do not need to hear. I will give the Protection Order first and then I will hear the arguments later."" That can be a sensible approach. Sometimes, the Courts may say, ""Let me hear both quickly.""",38,780,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00780

That is why I have said that it is not a full panacea for everything that Members have highlighted. It is because of the nature of the medium that we are dealing with. Let us put this through and see what happens. Meanwhile, the other legislation that can be looked at will be looked at to see whether we need to better buttress the approach here through other amendments.",39,781,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00781

2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I accept Mr Hri Kumar's basic point that we need to make sure that our Police should be able to investigate into technology-related offences. Demand for investigations into such offences will undoubtedly grow. Police are looking into strengthening their capabilities in cyber and technology-related crimes. But we also need to be aware of the severe limitations that the Police are under, in that, like the rest of Singapore, the Police are also struggling to find people of the appropriate quality to join the Police Force. There is a general shortage all around, and they will work within very, very severe constraints and, so, people have to understand that.",42,784,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00784

We will continue to see how we can do better, but not all of these things are within our own control. It depends on others cooperating with us as well.",43,785,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00785
2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Members like Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Ms Jessica Tan raised the issue of anonymity in cyberspace, in particular, identifying perpetrators online. This is not unique to offences of harassment under the Bill. Law enforcement agencies face similar challenges in tackling cyber crimes and transnational crimes. The Bill does take several modest and cautious steps in addressing these challenges. It provides for rules to be made to allow victims to take out Protection Orders even though the harasser's real name is not known. That is significant. Not only does it go towards ensuring that victims' efforts at self-help would not be stymied by anonymous harassers, anonymous harassers can be identified in appropriate cases by the Police and by the Courts.",44,786,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00786

2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Zaqy Mohamad queried if the Court's powers will extend to third parties who republish offending communications. The answer is yes. Protection Orders, expedited Protection Orders and clause 15 orders may be granted against all publishers. The Court can direct, generally, that ""no person"" can repeat the offending publication. The prohibition goes beyond publication of the original statement to cover republication by third parties. Victims need not go back to Court to obtain additional Court orders. That could save much time and effort. At its heart are the nature of the impugned conduct and its impact on the victims in question. In line with this, the processes, like I have said earlier, will be kept as streamlined as possible.",46,788,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00788
2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Zainal Sapari and Assoc Prof Eugene Tan also queried whether damages for emotional distress will be available under civil remedies provision in the Bill. The Bill does not expressly deal with this, and the intention is that we should leave it to the Courts to decide on the categories of damages which should be ordered in each case. There is no prohibition in the Bill against ordering such damages for emotional distress. So, let me make that clear. Whatever the common law allows, the Courts can order. There is no prohibition. But whether such damages ought to be awarded really depends on the facts of the case and existing principles. If the Court regards damages for emotional distress as appropriate, it can make an order.",47,789,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00789

2014-03-13-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Assoc Prof Eugene Tan also asked why the breach of a Protection Order is not an arrestable offence. What we have done is in line with the First Schedule of the CPC for which non-Penal Code offences are generally non-arrestable if they carry a maximum penalty of less than three years' imprisonment. Whilst the offences are non-arrestable, this does not mean that the Police will not take action in such cases. It really depends on the nature of the cases and also, given that Protection Orders are orders of Court, if there is non-compliance, the Courts can also take action.",49,791,2014-03-13-T-009-S-00791
