2014-04-14-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,asked	 the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs with regard to the recent Woodlands Checkpoint breach on 8 March 2014 (a) what are the security measures that failed to prevent the breach; (b) why does it take the Police hours to track down the vehicle and driver following the breach; and (c) whether Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) or the Police have personnel or vehicles on standby to chase vehicles or persons who breach our immigration checkpoints.,1,6,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00006
2014-04-14-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,asked	 the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs if he can provide an update on the review following the unauthorised entry by a Malaysian driver through the Woodlands Checkpoint on 8 March 2014 and what steps will be taken to prevent such incidents.,1,7,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00007
2014-04-14-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"Mdm Speaker, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 1 and 2 together?",1,8,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00008
2014-04-14-T-002,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,9,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00009
2014-04-14-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"On 8 March 2014, at about 4.00 pm, a Malaysian driver, after having cleared Singapore immigration, drove his Singapore-registered car to the secondary clearance area for security checks. When an Auxiliary Police Officer (APO) was inspecting the boot of the car, the driver suddenly got into the car and drove off. The APO immediately pressed the alarm, which triggered the activation of the security barrier. The car's progress was stopped by the barrier. Several officers at the scene responded to the alarm and an APO was injured in the process of stopping the car from leaving. However, the driver persisted in trying to drive across the security barrier. He managed to force his car over the security barrier and exit the checkpoint.",1,10,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00010
2014-04-14-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Police confirmed the identity of the driver within 15 minutes of the incident and activated an island-wide search for the driver and the vehicle. Taxi drivers were also asked to look out for the car. Meanwhile, Police continued to establish and follow leads to precisely locate the driver and the car. Police steadily closed the ring around the driver and subsequently arrested him five hours after the incident. His car was separately recovered at another location prior to his arrest. He has been charged in court for offences under the Penal Code and Vandalism Act. He is also being investigated for contraband goods smuggling and other offences under the Customs Act.",2,11,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00011
2014-04-14-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Our investigations revealed that the security barrier initially stopped the car, but failed to stop the car from leaving because hydraulic fluid leaked from one of the cylinder seals for raising and maintaining the position of the security barrier. The security barriers are checked and serviced every three months, and the last servicing was done on 18 February 2014. Following the incident, ICA is replacing the hydraulic components in all the security barriers and is also conducting daily checks to ensure that the security barriers function properly.",3,12,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00012
2014-04-14-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Mdm Speaker, this was the second incident in two months in which a car had successfully breached Woodlands Checkpoint. After the first incident on 17 January 2014, various immediate measures were implemented to strengthen the security at Woodlands Checkpoint, including tightening the coordination between ICA and Police, improving the response protocols and conducting drills and exercises to validate the response plans and enhancing the supervision of the APOs. Other measures, such as installation of additional CCTVs and enhanced security barriers, are being expedited.",4,13,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00013
2014-04-14-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,ICA and Police will also be deploying mobile crash barriers and tracking vehicles as additional lines of defence to stop suspect vehicles from fleeing the checkpoint and apprehending all suspects.,5,14,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00014
2014-04-14-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"The two breaches show the scale and complexity of the checkpoint operations. This requires a team of officers able to carry out robust and effective measures to prevent and deal with a wide range of threats, including attempts to get through the primary or subsequent layers of security at our checkpoints. At the same time, our land checkpoints have to facilitate the swift and secure clearance of people and goods. Finding the right balance is not easy.",6,15,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00015
2014-04-14-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"A Ministry-level review committee, chaired by Senior Deputy Secretary Khoo Boon Hui and comprising senior representatives from ICA, Police, ISD and other Home Team agencies, has been formed to comprehensively review the security measures at our checkpoints and identify any systemic issues and rectify them. This Committee has updated me on the progress of the review, including enhanced security measures already undertaken – which I had listed earlier – and the need for interim arrangements while wider systems are further improved.",7,16,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00016
2014-04-14-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"MHA views each and every single security breach seriously. If there are gaps and failings in our security regime, be they structural, systemic or individual, we must quickly and thoroughly address them. Commissioner ICA and the other relevant Home Team Department heads have given their full commitment to take concrete actions at all levels to quickly put right any weaknesses, and implement measures to ensure that our border security is tight and effective to keep out all threats. MHA HQ will give them our full support.",8,17,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00017
2014-04-14-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his reply. I understand this is a complex issue, and I also see that structural facilities are being enhanced to improve security. So, I just have two questions. Firstly, if a vehicle should breach the checkpoint, should there not be other standby vehicles to chase them down? The fact that Singapore is small, the five hours spent to find the vehicle is too long, especially if we have a potential terrorist threat, for example. Secondly, manpower is an issue today. Is it difficult to recruit Police officers and has that contributed to some of these lapses?",1,18,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00018
2014-04-14-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Indeed, five hours is a long time. We have looked at the measures and we will be instituting additional measures to take care of this issue. Those who are travelling through the Causeway may see an additional line of barrier. The first objective is to try and prevent people from exiting the checkpoint and to contain cars and individuals within the checkpoint. We are also putting in vehicles which will be able to follow any suspect vehicles that leave the checkpoints. Those are being put in place.",1,19,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00019
2014-04-14-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"In this particular case, Police was able to identify the subject within a very short time because he had cleared immigration. And so, we knew his identity, his address and various other things. They were actually tracking him quite closely after the breach. They localised him and then arrested him. Very early on, Police was able to come to an assessment that this case was not likely to be terrorist-linked.",2,20,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00020
2014-04-14-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Deputy Prime Minister, may I have the reply to the second question on manpower?",1,21,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00021
2014-04-14-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"As I had mentioned in the Committee of Supply (COS) debate, manpower for the checkpoints and at ICA has increased quite substantially since we did a review in the mid to late 2000s. A substantial increase in manpower had been provided at that point in time. I would say that our major constraints today are infrastructural because the checkpoints themselves were built some time ago and it is a very tight space. They were built before September 2001. Many of the security measures that are being put in place had been added on to the existing infrastructure at the checkpoints. These measures have, therefore, resulted in some delays to the clearance of particularly vehicles through the checkpoints.",1,22,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00022
2014-04-14-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"We have done a number of things to maintain security while increasing the capacity at the checkpoints. For example, since then, we have reopened the old Woodlands Checkpoint and put in new facilities there, including four additional counters for lorries and 20 additional counters for motorcycles in 2008 and 2009. We are putting in 30 additional car counters by 2016. Today, ICA is already opening up 20 of these car counters during peak periods, Sundays and public holidays. We try to maintain a balance between tight security as well as making sure that we clear cars as smoothly as possible through the checkpoints.",2,23,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00023
2014-04-14-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Motorcycles contribute another very large volume of traffic at the checkpoints. There are more than 72,000 motorcycles passing through every day. Thirty percent of motorcycles today use the automated self-clearance system. They come up to the immigration counter and both the rider and the pillion clear through automatically. ICA will continue to channel more passengers and vehicles to use these self-clearance modes. We are now going to bring all Work Permit and S Pass holders to be automatically enrolled on ICA's Automatic Clearance System by the middle of this year. This will make 95% of all Malaysian motorcycle trips eligible for automatic clearance.",3,24,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00024
2014-04-14-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"What this will do is it will help to speed up clearance of motorcycles, reduce the queues for motorcycles, and, therefore, free up some of the existing capacity for other vehicles. Again, this will help us strike a better balance between speedy clearance as well as tight security.",4,25,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00025
2014-04-14-T-002,Nicholas Fang,Mr Nicholas Fang (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, one supplementary question for the Deputy Prime Minister. I understand the latest news is that there was another attempt yesterday of another driver from Malaysia attempting to make an illegal entry at Woodlands. Are there any indications, in the review and investigation, why there seems to be a heightened increase in frequency in recent months of these sorts of attempts? Is there any indication whether this is an upward trend that is likely to continue, or is it too early to say?",1,26,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00026
2014-04-14-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"The Member asked if there was a case yesterday of a Malaysian who attempted to evade immigration checks. He was stopped according to the procedures and was arrested. Police will take the appropriate action against him. He came through, so far as we know, with no travel documents on him. We are investigating the matter. This incident shows that we do require tight checks on both sides of the border to make sure that there is some redundancy in our checks.",1,27,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00027
2014-04-14-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"There will always be attempts by people to evade customs or immigration checks. This is not unique to Singapore. People will present false documents, they might sneak in and so on. Overall, I would say that our border security is very tight. Although we have detected instances of people either attempting to or inadvertently passing through immigration or customs without proper clearance, we have managed to contain most of them.",2,28,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00028
2014-04-14-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"In the three cases that have evaded and exited the checkpoints, the persons were subsequently arrested and appropriate action was taken. I would say that the measures that have been taken at the checkpoints have been reasonably effective in deterring and containing entry into Singapore by persons or goods that are not allowed to.",3,29,2014-04-14-T-002-S-00029
2014-04-14-T-003,Mary Liew,Ms Mary Liew,asked	 the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the frequency of our usage of Interpol's database of Stolen and Lost Travel Documents (SLTDs); (b) whether ASEAN members use the SLTD database for their border checks; (c) whether ASEAN members do submit information on stolen and lost passports to INTERPOL's database; and (d) whether there are any regional security collaborations with ASEAN members to stem the trade of SLTDs in our region.,1,30,2014-04-14-T-003-S-00030
2014-04-14-T-003,David Ong,Mr David Ong,"asked	 the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the number of passport infringements for both incoming and outgoing passengers at Changi Airport in the last three years; and (b) whether ICA has taken measures to prevent future possible lapses, in light of the MH370 incident.",1,31,2014-04-14-T-003-S-00031
2014-04-14-T-003,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,"asked	 the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many Singapore passports are reported lost, missing or stolen each year for the last five years; (b) what is the average time lapse, at each stage, between the filing of the missing passport report, cancellation of the passport by ICA, and the reporting to Interpol of the missing passport for inclusion in its database; and (c) whether the ICA will step up public education efforts to encourage Singaporeans to better protect their passports and what they should do when their passports are lost or stolen.",1,32,2014-04-14-T-003-S-00032
2014-04-14-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,asked	 the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs what precautions does ICA take at our checkpoints to ensure that there are strict procedures to prevent detection failure of fake passports.,1,33,2014-04-14-T-003-S-00033
2014-04-14-T-003,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,asked	 the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether ICA has been checking the passports of all outbound and inbound travellers at all ports of exit and entry against Interpol's Stolen and Lost Travel Documents (SLTD) database in the last three years; (b) how many travellers have been caught using lost or stolen passports which are not their own; and (c) what punishments have been meted out for the commission of such offences.,1,34,2014-04-14-T-003-S-00034
2014-04-14-T-003,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),,1,35,2014-04-14-T-003-S-00035
2014-04-14-T-003,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,36,2014-04-14-T-003-S-00036
2014-04-14-T-003,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"All persons entering or leaving Singapore are subject to stringent checks at the checkpoints, which include travel document examination and identity verification. There are several layers of checks to detect stolen or fraudulent passports.",1,37,2014-04-14-T-003-S-00037
2014-04-14-T-003,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"ICA actively taps into its network of global partners to exchange information on lost and stolen travel documents to prevent undesirable persons from using such documents. Since 2008, ICA has been using the INTERPOL's database containing over 40 million travel documents reported lost or stolen by 167 countries, in the passport document examination process. Singapore is one of several INTERPOL member states that cross-check travellers' passports against this database, accessing it about 29 million times a year, to determine if a passport presented had been reported lost or stolen.",2,38,2014-04-14-T-003-S-00038
2014-04-14-T-003,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Over the past five years, about 7,000 Singapore passports are reported lost or stolen each year. Once a report is received, ICA will immediately cancel any reported lost or stolen passport, update its database and convey the relevant information to INTERPOL.",3,39,2014-04-14-T-003-S-00039
2014-04-14-T-003,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Over the past five years, across all our checkpoints, an average of about 350 travellers per year have been detected to be in possession of forged or tampered travel documents, or had presented a travel document that did not belong to him or her. Under section 47 of the Passports Act, anyone found guilty of offences relating to false foreign travel documents shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or to both.",4,40,2014-04-14-T-003-S-00040
2014-04-14-T-003,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"To deter forgery or tampering with Singapore passports, Singapore is one of many countries which have issued new passports with stronger security and protection features, such as biometrics. These passports comply with the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) recommendations and requirements, including security standards to ensure the integrity of biometric passports.",5,41,2014-04-14-T-003-S-00041
2014-04-14-T-003,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"It is an offence under the Passports Act not to report any loss of passport. A Singapore passport is an important document and highly valued by local and foreign criminals. During the passport application and collection process, and in public outreach and community engagement through talks and exhibitions, ICA constantly reminds Singaporeans of the importance of safe-keeping their passports and the need to report any loss of their passports immediately.",6,42,2014-04-14-T-003-S-00042
2014-04-14-T-003,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"ICA maintains our security with tight controls at our borders over persons who present stolen or lost passports. At the same time, the security features of our Singapore biometric passport, and the education efforts and strict enforcement of laws regarding lost and stolen passports, help ensure that Singaporeans who travel, face fewer queries and delays due to inquiries regarding their passports.",7,43,2014-04-14-T-003-S-00043
2014-04-14-T-004,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"asked	 the Minister for Communications and Information what more can be done to make popular sports programmes, such as the World Cup soccer matches, more accessible to Singaporeans.",1,44,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00044
2014-04-14-T-004,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,asked	 the Minister for Communications and Information with regard to the broadcast of World Cup matches on TV (a) how does Singapore compare with other developed countries with similar-sized populations as well as countries in our region in terms of (i) free-to-air availability and (ii) pay-TV pricing; (b) whether it is beneficial for our sports culture to leave the pricing of the match viewings to market forces; and (c) whether MDA's cross-carriage measure has achieved its objective for consumers' interest.,1,45,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00045
2014-04-14-T-004,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"asked	 the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what are the factors behind the recent announcement by a telco to charge pay-TV viewers a significant increase in rates of $104 for the FIFA World Cup screenings in June 2014; (b) whether the continued signing of exclusive content for soccer events at high bidding prices renders the cross-carriage regime ineffective; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider reviewing its cross-carriage policy to mitigate high subscription prices of sports events and ensure that major sports are accessible to all, including low-income earners.",1,46,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00046
2014-04-14-T-004,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"asked	 the Minister for Communications and Information with regard to the local pay-TV rates for the FIFA World Cup 2014, whether the Ministry will consider conducting a thorough review of the regulatory framework and policies that govern the broadcast of popular soccer and sporting events in Singapore so as to better protect the interests of the viewing public.",1,47,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00047
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Minister for Communications and Information),"Mdm Speaker, with your permission, I would like to take Question Nos 8, 9, 10 and 11 together.",1,48,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00048
2014-04-14-T-004,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,49,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00049
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, on 12 March 2014, SingNet announced that it had acquired the exclusive broadcast rights to the FIFA World Cup 2014. SingNet announced that it would sell the World Cup 2014 content as a standalone channel, at $105. Since then, they have offered an Early Bird price of $88. This Early Bird price is the same price charged by the pay-TV operators for the 2010 World Cup. That is the regular 2010 price, so this year's Early Bird price is the same as the 2010 regular price. Furthermore, for those who commit to subscribe to the Barclays Premier League (BPL) content for two years till 2016, SingNet will provide the World Cup content at no extra charge. In other words, the average price paid per subscriber for World Cup 2014 will be significantly lower than $88, once we add the subscribers who will obtain it at no additional cost.",1,50,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00050
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"With cross-carriage, all SCV subscribers would be able to enjoy the World Cup package through their SCV set-top boxes at the same $88 Early Bird price offered by SingNet. And this is precisely the purpose of the cross-carriage measure – to widen the distribution of exclusive content across all qualified pay-TV retailers.",2,51,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00051
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Indeed, cross-carriage has been successful in reducing content fragmentation in the Singapore pay-TV market. Back in 2010, there were only seven channels available on both pay-TV platforms. Consumers had to install multiple set-top boxes from different retailers to enjoy the content they wanted. Today, there are over 60 channels available on both SingNet's and SCV's platforms. These include entertainment and sports channels, such as Celestial Movies, National Geographic Channel, FOX Sports and STAR Sports. Pay-TV retailers have also shifted their strategy to compete for subscribers on value-added services, like mobile apps that allow subscribers to watch TV on the go.",3,52,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00052
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"From this perspective, the cross-carriage policy has achieved its objectives. The policy has just been introduced and we will want to continue to review and see how it can be further fine-tuned and improved. I would like to remind Members that the intent of cross-carriage is not to regulate content prices. So, we should not judge its effectiveness in terms of whether content prices have dropped.",4,53,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00053
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In fact, the acquisition and provision of top-level sports content on TV is not just left to market forces alone. The Government is committed to ensure that key sporting events, particularly those of national significance, are available to all Singaporeans, and not just on pay-TV. This is why MDA supports MediaCorp's provision of sports programming featuring Team Singapore athletes, including the Summer Olympics, the Commonwealth Games, the SEA Games, all of which through Public Service Broadcasting (PSB) funding.",5,54,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00054
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"MDA also puts such events on the anti-siphoning list and this was updated only last year, following a public consultation. An event on the anti-siphoning list means it must be available for Free-to-Air TV broadcasters to acquire. And I should explain that placing an event on the anti-siphoning list does not mean that the programmes will be free. It simply means that pay-TV retailers cannot acquire the content on an exclusive basis, therefore, giving the Free-to-Air broadcaster an opportunity to acquire these rights.",6,55,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00055
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For the World Cup, MDA included four key matches, which are the opening, the semi-finals and the finals in the anti-siphoning list. They also included matches featuring Team Singapore, but that is not relevant in our context, so, the four key matches are the opening, the semi-finals and the finals. For the upcoming World Cup, Singapore viewers will be able to watch these matches on MediaCorp. Besides the matches on the anti-siphoning list, I also understand that the People's Association (PA) is in talks with SingNet to screen the World Cup matches for free at several Community Centres across the island.",7,56,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00056
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Some Members have asked for more regulation of subscription prices for sports content. But the key is that content owners like FIFA are not obligated to sell their content at a price they do not agree with. It is not something we welcome, but on this issue, we are unfortunately a price-taker, and not a price-setter. We cannot wish away the fact that the cost of premium sports content has been rising globally, not just in Singapore. Broadcasters around the world are paying anywhere from 20% to 40% more for the broadcast rights to the World Cup 2014 compared with the previous edition.",8,57,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00057
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Comparisons of subscription prices across different jurisdiction are also inherently fraught, as the operating circumstances in each country are different. There are wide variations in terms of the size of the pay-TV market, as well as the potential advertising and sponsorship revenue available to broadcasters.",9,58,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00058
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Some have asked why MDA did not put all World Cup games on the anti-siphoning list. I think the rationale is that if you have an overly long list of World Cup matches on the anti-siphoning list, that may lead to unintended consequences. In particular, pay-TV operators will then have little incentive to acquire the matches. Instead, the cost burden will then have to be borne largely by the Free-to-Air broadcaster. Doing so would then divert a significant portion of PSB monies which are used to support a diverse range of programming covering varied interests and genres, including support for minority channels, as well as programmes that promote Singapore's culture and heritage.",10,59,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00059
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In conclusion, MDA has to achieve a delicate balance. It should not be hasty to adopt populist measures that ultimately backfire, leaving consumers even worse-off.",11,60,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00060
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I would, however, like to assure Members that MDA will continue to review its policies, including cross-carriage, as I have mentioned earlier, and the anti-siphoning list. Cross-carriage will be reviewed as part of a larger review of the Media Market Conduct Code later this year. As for the anti-siphoning list, the public was last consulted on this in 2012, and will also be reviewed in due course and I would encourage Members to provide feedback during the review of these policies.",12,61,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00061
2014-04-14-T-004,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I would like to ask one supplementary question. I note the Senior Minister of State's reply that we are a price-taker, not a price-setter. However, football is very popular among Singaporeans and there are many countries which telecast World Cup free-of-charge, such as Japan, South Korea and even neighbouring countries like Thailand, Indonesia and Cambodia. Can the Ministry look into doing more for fellow Singaporeans who do not subscribe to those paid channels?",1,62,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00062
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, I understand where the Member is coming from in terms of the popularity of the sport and also the concerns about pricing. We have to understand, as I have mentioned earlier, that, inherently, this is an issue where the rights owner, the property owner, calls the shots. And they have been doing so across all jurisdictions because broadcast payment has gone up 20% to 40% around the world, not just in Singapore. Some countries are able to offset that in a more effective way because they have bigger markets, they can get more sponsorships and more advertising revenues. So, different countries find different ways to price the content to the consumers but, across the board, the acquisition cost has gone up. All the countries are paying more to FIFA and that is, I think, how the business has evolved over the recent years, in terms of premium sports content, in particular, football.",1,63,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00063
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"It is something we have to review. As I have said, we are going to review our anti-siphoning list. We are going to review our cross-carriage measures as well. I am not sure that these would inherently change the dynamics of the game because these are internal measures. In the end, however we adjust, somebody has to pay FIFA this amount of money. We have to look at it in two aspects  one, understand the realities of the football market today. This is what is happening. We are, unfortunately, a small market with a high interest in football. And we may not have enough of a subscription base or an advertising revenue base to offset the cost, unlike other countries. In such a dynamic, in such negotiations, ironically, the more desperate we are to acquire, the more the rights owner on the other side will feel that they have the ability and the leverage to charge us at a high price. So, we have to understand the broader dynamics that are happening in the negotiation as well.",2,64,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00064
2014-04-14-T-004,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State whether he is able to share or confirm that MediaCorp has to pay to broadcast the four matches under the anti-siphoning list and how their rates compare with what SingTel pays. In the scenario where we were to include all matches under the anti-siphoning list, what is the impact of this on the pricing that MediaCorp, as a Free-to-Air station, has to pay, versus a pay-TV operator?",1,65,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00065
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, I think these are relevant questions that people have been asking. It is true that MediaCorp has to pay SingNet to acquire the four matches and that is only simply because FIFA does not bundle and separate out its package  four to sell to MediaCorp; the rest, to sell to SingNet. FIFA does not do that. FIFA sells the entire package to one purchaser. That purchaser can be a pay-TV operator; it can be a Free-to-Air broadcaster. It does not matter. For them, they look at the market, the purchasing power of the market. They will sell to whoever bids for it as an entire package.",1,66,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00066
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"How the person who bids for it then breaks it up into the different channels and the different events, that is not something that FIFA looks at because that depends on the domestic rules  what is in the anti-siphoning list and what are the cross-carriage measures.",2,67,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00067
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In this case, MediaCorp will have some ability – it already has worked out an arrangement with SingNet – to acquire the matches that are on the anti-siphoning list – the opening, the semi-finals, the finals. I will imagine that there will be some cost apportionment between SingNet and MediaCorp, and they will work out the cost. And MediaCorp, through its sponsors, through its advertising revenues, would then be able to acquire these matches.",3,68,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00068
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,I cannot reveal the specifics of the pricing because these are commercially-sensitive figures. But that would have been worked out between SingNet and MediaCorp.,4,69,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00069
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I would also say that SingNet, based on all the revenues that it is getting from the World Cup content, actually is not able to recover the costs of acquiring the content today. So, this is not a matter of SingNet profiting or getting a handsome dividend from acquiring this package. For all the revenues that SingNet is getting from the World Cup content, it probably will not be able to cover the costs.",5,70,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00070
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The question the Member also asked was  what about having all the matches put on the anti-siphoning list, having a Free-to-Air broadcaster bid; or, for that matter, as some have suggested, why not make a joint bid? But, as I have said, this does not matter from the FIFA perspective. From a property owner perspective, they look at the market, meaning the entire country, and what the country can afford. And whether it is a joint bid, a Free-to-Air broadcaster bidding or a pay-TV operator bidding, those may have a little bit of an impact on the negotiation dynamics but it will not materially change the game, which is that they will look at the overall purchasing power of the market, that is what FIFA looks at. And as I have mentioned earlier, fundamentally, that price has been going up across the board, not just in Singapore.",6,71,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00071
2014-04-14-T-004,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Three supplementary questions for the Senior Minister of State. Firstly, in view of what he has said, will MDA mandate that all contracts signed between telcos and content providers for exclusive content be wrapped up 12 months prior to the staging of the event, like in many other countries which seal the arrangements early, so telcos can offer lower charges to the viewing public in view of the lead time available to source for more advertising revenue to subsidise the costs of content procurement?",1,72,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00072
2014-04-14-T-004,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second question  has the Ministry considered whether Singapore Pools, the only legal lottery operator which benefits from World Cup punting, could contribute towards subsidising the Singapore viewing public in reasonable proportion to its soccer-related betting collections and payouts?",2,73,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00073
2014-04-14-T-004,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"And, finally, would the Minister clarify if the Programme Advisory Committee for English programmes (PACE) made any specific recommendation or advised MDA on measures to reduce the costs of watching the World Cup to Singapore consumers in light of the escalating costs from the 2010 experience?",3,74,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00074
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, on the regulations or proposed regulations that the Member asked for, to require that negotiations or the contract be wrapped up 12 months earlier, is something that MDA can look at. I would say that MDA is not opposed to looking at any form of regulation but it will always apply a cost-benefit to these regulations, meaning to say, what is the benefit of making a regulatory move and weighing that against the costs, which may include inadvertent consequences to commercial operators, and the perceptions that it will create in our pay-TV market.",1,75,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00075
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In this instance, I am not familiar with the details but I would imagine that one would ask the question  if MDA were to impose such a requirement, would it end up with a situation where the pay-TV operators, or whoever submits a bid, may actually end up paying a higher price inadvertently, because you are forcing them to negotiate and wrap up within a certain time limit. I am not sure, but it is something that MDA would have to answer or look at, weighing the benefits and the costs of the regulatory measure.",2,76,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00076
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Singapore Pools does contribute. I do not have the details with me but they do contribute and they do provide support through a wide range of different schemes in the sense that it is not just for MediaCorp but also for the community centre viewing. They provide some support, as I understand, to various platforms to allow Singaporeans to view the World Cup. I do not have the details of how much they provide. That is something we can take separately, but they do provide support for the World Cup viewing.",3,77,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00077
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"PACE – I do not have details, too, but I would imagine that they would have given feedback if it was something that mattered to them in terms of consumer pricing and the concerns that occurred even before the EPL and the World Cup experience the last round.",4,78,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00078
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But as I said earlier, fundamentally, the challenge is not something that you can overcome because the fundamental nature of this is that the rights owner, FIFA, has a monopoly over the rights. It is a content owner who has increased in popularity around the world and they are now having the ability to charge higher prices to all markets. And in a market like Singapore, which is small, which has high demand for football, they will look at that market and say, ""Well, I think you have the purchasing power to pay a high price"", and they will do so accordingly. They cannot do this indefinitely because, at some point in time, if we are prepared to say, ""Look, we will walk away"", then they will realise that the dynamics are changing. But until then, until such time that this happens, it is very hard to change the fundamental dynamics, which is, that they will look at us as a market that can afford this rate.",5,79,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00079
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"It is something that we have to bear in mind when we do our review, that this is the reality of the landscape. As we do our review for cross-carriage, anti-siphoning or any other regulatory suggestions and measures that Members may have, we will have to think through how best to structure this because, ultimately, then somebody has to pay. It may not be the consumers but it may be the taxpayers, but somebody will then have to pay FIFA for the rights until the dynamics fundamentally are altered.",6,80,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00080
2014-04-14-T-004,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Thank you, Madam. I gather from the Senior Minister of State's answer that there are two factors here affecting the pricing – one would be the purchasing power of the market, Singapore's market; and, secondly, a bidding war would lead to higher pricing. So, in theory, if MediaCorp were mandated to show all matches under the anti-siphoning list, there will be no interest for SingTel or StarHub to go into a bidding war, and only MediaCorp would have interest to purchase the rights. So, would that not be something within our control that can affect the negotiations and, hence, probably, a reduction in the price that MediaCorp has to pay to FIFA?",1,81,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00081
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, to a large extent, I think the unhealthy dynamics of competitive bidding, causing prices to go up, have been addressed through cross-carriage, in the sense that whatever the entity that bids for it recognises and knows that that product has to be cross-carried on other platforms at the same price. So, it does not matter whichever price you pay for and whichever operator gets the rights to broadcast, if he chooses to do so on an exclusive basis, under cross-carriage, that content has to be carried at the same price on other platforms. So, that, to some extent, would already have ameliorated some of these internal bidding dynamics that the Member talked about.",1,82,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00082
2014-04-14-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"That is why I say, even if you have a joint bid or if you have MediaCorp coming to it, yes, I acknowledge it may have some impact, it may help to reduce marginally, but I do not think it will significantly move the needle. We know from the assessment of the pay-TV operators, who have been in this game and business, that there is basically a range where FIFA is looking at in order for us to secure these rights to broadcast the World Cup; that is where they are looking at. This is the range; it is a narrow range, but you need to pay that amount of money in order to get the rights.",2,83,2014-04-14-T-004-S-00083

Geylang Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC) has about 160 Police officers, and that is about 60% more than the manning levels in other NPCs. In the evenings, especially on Fridays and weekends, additional Police fast response cars are deployed to augment the regular fleet, for incident management and to enhance Police response in and around the Lorongs in Geylang. In addition, Special Operations Command (SOC) troopers are deployed in the area to project a strong Police presence on a regular basis. In 2013, SOC troopers were deployed in Geylang on 41 occasions and there were more than 1,000 anti-vice operations conducted in that area. CCTVs and street-lights were added to the back alleys and side lanes to deter streetwalking and other illegal activities.",2,86,2014-04-14-T-005-S-00086

2014-04-14-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The first is on the Commissioner of Police's comments, and I think she is referring to his comments in the context of the Committee of Inquiry on the Little India riot. I think we should be quite clear about the context of that comment because that would help to put things in perspective. Firstly, I think it was in the context of the Commissioner seeking to share with the members of the Committee Police's strategies and tactics in dealing with some of the challenges they face across Singapore and, in this instance, he was highlighting not just Little India but also Geylang as an example. In the context of Geylang, I thought there were three points that were important to note, and I think this would go some way in addressing the Member's questions and the concerns of her residents.",2,93,2014-04-14-T-005-S-00093
2014-04-14-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The first is that the situation in Geylang, with its complex social ecosystem, does pose specific policing challenges and that was the point that the Commissioner was making. Second, is that the Police recognise this challenge and that is why there have been these specific additional measures that have been dedicated to enforcement efforts in Geylang. I think that is borne out by the numbers, both in terms of the deployment of resources and the outcomes we have seen. The trend is downwards. Of course, more can be done and residents would certainly prefer more to be achieved.",3,94,2014-04-14-T-005-S-00094
2014-04-14-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"And, thirdly, I think it is also about the Police having to continually evaluate different operational needs on the ground, from the policing perspective, and from the law and order perspective, in allocating resources. And that is also an important point to recognise – that this is the level of resource allocation dedicated to Geylang because there is an assessment of an operational need on the ground, and the Police will adapt and respond to situations as it evolves. I thought that it is important to clarify so that the Member is also able to reassure her residents on the context and the intent of the comments made by the Commissioner.",4,95,2014-04-14-T-005-S-00095
2014-04-14-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Secondly, with respect to what the Police are doing in terms of addressing the other disamenities and so on, in general – I think as the Member is aware, and to share with Members of the House – Police focus on law and order, crime issues and related matters. But, as part of an overall strategy in Geylang, Police also coordinate their activities with other agencies, as I elaborated, whether it is MOM, URA, NEA and so on. And I think the intent is to continue to work on this sort of joint efforts whilst the Police focus, in particular, also on crime and law and order concerns, and I would add that, apart from what I have already shared, the Police also have certain targeted efforts in, for example, other kinds of criminal activities which are not captured in the general enforcement statistics that I have shared with all of you today.",5,96,2014-04-14-T-005-S-00096

ITE is also catering better to students with different needs, abilities and aspirations, and expanding student counselling and services to better support its students holistically. This year, ITE also introduced the Enhanced Nitec Foundation Programme (e-NFP) which includes an additional year to strengthen the foundation for the students so that they will successfully complete their Nitec courses. Team-building programmes to foster a greater sense of belonging and support among students have also been expanded. ITE also closely monitors and assists the weakest students by giving them additional remedial lessons and counselling. With time, many of these programmes and measures should ensure that more ITE students successfully complete their course of study.",8,108,2014-04-14-T-006-S-00108
2014-04-14-T-006,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the answer. It is heartening to hear that drop-out rates have decreased over the years. I have two supplementary questions. To what extent are parents engaged, especially for these at-risk students and for those whose parents are absent and not around, who would be the guardians, who would be taking care of them, that the school engages? The second question is  for Primary and Secondary schools, are there sufficient allied educators who may work closely with such at-risk students to ensure that their behaviour is monitored?",1,109,2014-04-14-T-006-S-00109
2014-04-14-T-006,Hawazi Daipi,Mr Hawazi Daipi,"Madam, I thank the Member for the supplementary questions. ITE works closely with organisations that may be able to help students. The Enhanced STEP-UP Programme run by MSF, for example, works very closely with voluntary organisations, Family Service Centres and organisations that can help reach out to both the students as well as the parents, if necessary. So, it is working with organisations that have already the ability to reach out to parents that may prove useful. ITE is also working with voluntary organisations to run programmes that can help raise the motivation of the students who are in danger of dropping out. Based on the ITE reports, we are pleased to note that the programmes run by the two organisations are effective.",1,110,2014-04-14-T-006-S-00110
2014-04-14-T-006,Hawazi Daipi,Mr Hawazi Daipi,"On allied educators, yes, almost all of our schools are supplied with allied educators for various reasons. Some are meant for classroom teaching and some allied educators are counsellors or helping the school with counselling work. We leave it to the school to decide on which type of allied educators they need and want to deploy.",2,111,2014-04-14-T-006-S-00111
2014-04-14-T-006,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the answer. Following up on Mr Alex Yam's question, I would like to ask  is there any engagement by the school or the Ministry to engage those who have left school – whether there is any visit to the house to meet up with the parents or the students themselves to encourage them to go back to school?",1,112,2014-04-14-T-006-S-00112
2014-04-14-T-006,Hawazi Daipi,Mr Hawazi Daipi,"Yes, Madam, in my reply, I did say that schools and ITE work with organisations to encourage those who have left school to return. Some of them are given the early foundation – the additional year that ITE gives to the students who are academically weaker. It may be useful to help those who may be in danger of dropping out or those who may drop out later, to return with some foundation that may be useful for them to pursue the courses that they are sent to.",1,113,2014-04-14-T-006-S-00113
2014-04-14-T-007,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng,asked	 the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether the Government can include partnership with local companies as a condition in the tender specifications of key infrastructure projects so that these local companies can build up necessary expertise and track records to help them secure a foothold in overseas projects.,1,114,2014-04-14-T-007-S-00114

2014-04-14-T-007,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Josephine Teo),"To help Singapore companies take part in Government procurement, our focus has been and continues to be on strengthening their capabilities and competitiveness and improving their productivity. For example, to strengthen local capabilities in construction and help local firms build track record, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) topped up the $250-million Construction Productivity and Capability Fund with another $30 million.",2,116,2014-04-14-T-007-S-00116
2014-04-14-T-007,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Where there are synergies in working together for overseas projects, Singapore companies can work as a group and leverage IE Singapore's Global Company Partnership framework that allows them to undertake projects jointly and to share costs. For example, companies can engage consultants to conduct feasibility studies or to prepare bids for an overseas project, with IE funding up to 50% of eligible costs.",3,117,2014-04-14-T-007-S-00117

2014-04-14-T-007,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng (Nominated Member),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. The point is about us being a WTO member and having to comply with fair bidding. However, we also hear that construction companies are coming from developed countries; in fact, they are coming here to bid at very low prices, and yet it is very hard for our companies to bid for contracts in their countries. So, it seems that this WTO agreement is not presenting a fair, level playing field, especially for big construction companies from developed countries.",1,119,2014-04-14-T-007-S-00119
2014-04-14-T-007,Teo Siong Seng,Mr Teo Siong Seng (Nominated Member),"The other point is about bringing the smaller companies in. Is there any scheme for the Government-linked companies (GLCs) to work with smaller companies overseas and, together, they bid for contracts?",2,120,2014-04-14-T-007-S-00120
2014-04-14-T-007,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mdm Speaker, I thank Mr Teo for his comments. On the point that he made about the foreign contractors coming to bid for jobs in Singapore and whether Singapore contractors equally can access jobs overseas, I take the point about participating as a member of WTO, indeed, is to enlarge the space that our companies are able to operate in and also to enlarge the market that they can take part in. If we were not members of this organisation, then the market size in Singapore is even smaller and it would be even harder for our companies to build up the capability and to spread their activities abroad.",1,121,2014-04-14-T-007-S-00121
2014-04-14-T-007,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"So, I think there are two sides to the argument of being a member of WTO. On the one hand, you remain open, and it means that you have to allow foreign contractors to take part in Government procurement in Singapore but, at the same time, you enlarge the playing field that your own contractors can take part in.",2,122,2014-04-14-T-007-S-00122
2014-04-14-T-007,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"There are many schemes that companies can avail themselves of. But I think the point that has also been considered is that operating out of Singapore is clearly very different from operating within Singapore. The rules are different; the partners are going to be very different; the way you organise your business is going to be very different, and where IE Singapore is concerned, my understanding is that they will extend all support and help wherever necessary, and if the trade associations and chambers have got suggestions on how else the Government can be of help, I think these will certainly be considered favourably. I would suggest that we engage in a conversation on more specific details of how the Government can be more supportive.",3,123,2014-04-14-T-007-S-00123
2014-04-14-T-008,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,asked	 the Minister for National Development whether HDB can consider giving priority to families with children in applications for larger BTO flats such that a couple with two children gets an extra chance for a 4-room BTO flat application and a couple with three children gets an extra chance for a BTO flat of four rooms and above.,1,124,2014-04-14-T-008-S-00124
2014-04-14-T-008,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Madam, we do give priority to families with children in their flat applications through two schemes. First, under the Third Child Priority Scheme, HDB sets aside up to 5% of the flat supply for families with three or more children. Second, under the Parenthood Priority Scheme, HDB sets aside 30% and 50% of the public flat supply in Build-To-Order and Sale of Balance Flats exercises respectively for first-timer families with at least one young child, or who are expecting a child.",1,125,2014-04-14-T-008-S-00125
2014-04-14-T-008,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Under both schemes, a fixed quota of flats is set aside for these families. This ensures a better chance of success, as compared to giving them more ballot chances.",2,126,2014-04-14-T-008-S-00126
2014-04-14-T-008,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),HDB also does not restrict the priority given to families with children to only 4-room or larger flats. This is to allow them to choose the flat type that best suits their budgets and needs.,3,127,2014-04-14-T-008-S-00127
2014-04-14-T-008,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),I thank the Minister for his clarification. May I know how many applicants currently in the queue are non-first-timers? When will HDB be able to satisfy all of them?,1,128,2014-04-14-T-008-S-00128
2014-04-14-T-008,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Madam, I used to carry such figures at the top of my head, but now I am unable to recall them. We have largely cleared the queue for first-timers. But the objective to satisfy every second-timer's demand for a new flat is a commitment I cannot make. I have the responsibility to try to meet the demand from first-timers as much as we can.",1,129,2014-04-14-T-008-S-00129
2014-04-14-T-008,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"However, for second-timers, they have options. They already have a flat and they have choices. They can take their time to buy another one, from resale or some other accommodations. As we clear the queue for first-timers, the opportunity to satisfy other applicants with other needs has enhanced.",2,130,2014-04-14-T-008-S-00130
2014-04-14-T-009,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,asked	 the Minister for National Development in respect of the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (a) what is the formula for pricing the rental rates for flats under this scheme; (b) what are the costs involved in providing these rental flats; (c) What has been the number of applications for 3-room flat types; and (d) Whether the rental rates can be lowered to encourage the take-up rate for the bigger flat types.,1,131,2014-04-14-T-009-S-00131
2014-04-14-T-009,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Madam, the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS) provides an additional option for families to rent a flat from HDB while they wait for their new flat to be completed. In setting the rents, we consider various factors, such as the flat type and also the location. PPHS rents are 40% to 60% lower than market rents in the vicinity.",1,132,2014-04-14-T-009-S-00132
2014-04-14-T-009,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The cost of providing PPHS flats includes the cost of retrofitting the flats before they are let out, and also the cost of managing and maintaining the flats.",2,133,2014-04-14-T-009-S-00133
2014-04-14-T-009,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The number of applications per month peaked at 409 last September, but has since dropped to 81. More than 900 of the 1,150 PPHS flats have been taken up. There are some larger flats still available. We are considering allowing some couples to co-rent, in other words, to share, these larger flats.",3,134,2014-04-14-T-009-S-00134
2014-04-14-T-010,,Assoc,the Minister for Health whether the use of Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) and its subsidies can be extended to cases where primary care doctors have to make house visits to manage elderly or sick patients.,1,135,2014-04-14-T-010-S-00135
2014-04-14-T-010,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Health),"Madam, today, home-bound patients with medical needs may be referred through the Agency for Integrated Care for a MOH-subvented home healthcare provider to deliver home medical service by a doctor. These patients can already receive means-tested subsidies of up to about $133 per visit. In 2013, more than 1,300 patients received home medical service under MOH-subvented home healthcare providers. The majority are patients with long-term care needs, but some are also home-bound patients with shorter-term needs, such as those recovering from complex wounds post-discharge.",1,136,2014-04-14-T-010-S-00136

2014-04-14-T-011,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan,asked	 the Minister for Trade and Industry how can the Government encourage bigger businesses to give local smaller firms an equal chance to become a preferred provider that will provide these smaller players a useful head start to evolve into our next generation of global enterprises.,1,138,2014-04-14-T-011-S-00138
2014-04-14-T-011,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Teo Ser Luck) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"It has always been our objective to have the big companies work with the smaller ones in a partnership format or by forming a consortium to go overseas for projects, as well as to develop the smaller start-ups to increase their capabilities. We have developed several schemes and programmes for that purpose, one of which is the Partnerships for Capability Transformation (PACT) programme. It was introduced in 2010 with a budget of about $250 million under EDB to incentivise large companies to work with smaller companies to raise the capabilities of the smaller companies and enable them to become preferred providers or suppliers.",1,139,2014-04-14-T-011-S-00139
2014-04-14-T-011,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Teo Ser Luck) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"The PACT programme was further expanded last year. We have an additional $60 million over three years set aside for SPRING to engage these companies beyond manufacturing sectors. We enhanced it, broadened the sectors, so that more sectors would be able to use it. They support co-innovation projects between the large and smaller businesses.",2,140,2014-04-14-T-011-S-00140
2014-04-14-T-011,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Teo Ser Luck) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"PACT also helps smaller firms in three ways. First, PACT helps large firms to identify and partner local suppliers, local SMEs and helps these smaller suppliers learn best practices from the large companies. Second, PACT provides support for SMEs to upgrade their capabilities to meet global standards and become qualified suppliers of large companies. Third, PACT supports co-innovation projects, which I have mentioned, where large companies and SMEs work together to test-bed new types of technologies or innovation. This helps SMEs build up their portfolio and track record.",3,141,2014-04-14-T-011-S-00141
2014-04-14-T-011,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Teo Ser Luck) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"The take-up rate for PACT has been quite positive. Over the last year, 40 large organisations signed up for more than 50 projects, with another 70 projects in the pipeline. The on-going PACT projects are expected to benefit more than 300 smaller companies. Of course, we can do more. With 160,000 or 170,000 SMEs, we continue to encourage big companies to work with the smaller ones to tap on these schemes.",4,142,2014-04-14-T-011-S-00142

IE's Global Company Partnership (GCP) grant supports companies working as a group to land overseas projects, allowing large companies to undertake internationalisation activities jointly with smaller companies, and they can share the costs. Support under the GCP includes prototyping and market testing for products, as well as overseas attachments to large companies to acquire new technologies and capabilities.",5,143,2014-04-14-T-011-S-00143

We strongly encourage these companies to use them, as well as the programme where they can tap on the network of resources to find out more information about the overseas market. The Government helps to defray some of the costs incurred in finding out the information.

2014-04-14-T-011,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"In terms of the PACT programme, when you look at innovation and co-development, do you also look at the payment terms? When it comes to big companies, they typically have economies of scale and they can demand longer payment term cycles. I have done SME dialogues where SMEs would complain that big companies expect longer payment terms and very harsh conditions of contract. This could be looked into. This is one aspect.",2,146,2014-04-14-T-011-S-00146
2014-04-14-T-011,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"My second question is  in terms of putting all these companies together – it is related to the earlier question – how can we facilitate more to come together, especially when they have very varied interests in terms of objectives?",3,147,2014-04-14-T-011-S-00147
2014-04-14-T-011,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck,"For co-innovation projects, usually there will be some costs upfront that would need to be paid. If let us say it is a cooperation between a large and a small company coming together to develop the project, we usually try to encourage them to tap on some of our research institutes or agencies like A*STAR and so on to help to facilitate the whole process so as to help not just the cash flow but, more importantly, the content of the innovation project. How we can help both sides.",1,148,2014-04-14-T-011-S-00148
2014-04-14-T-011,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck,"SPRING, A*STAR and IE are agencies that are there to help facilitate the process, including resolving some of these issues. It is important for the SMEs, or even the large companies, to surface these issues so that they can work it out. We have done it before. We have overcome such challenges before to facilitate the process of bringing big and small companies together, especially going overseas.",2,149,2014-04-14-T-011-S-00149
2014-04-14-T-011,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck,"These are companies with a very small market. The size of that company is only that big. If they individually go out there to bid for overseas projects, sometimes their probability of success is very low. We always encourage them to form consortiums, look at major projects, because at the government-to-government level, we have very good relations and the trade growth has increased in many ways, say, for example, in big markets like China. But the project in China is relatively large. We need these smaller companies to group together, look at the opportunities and go for them. And many other countries, for example, the Taiwanese, Japanese and Koreans, are doing the same.",3,150,2014-04-14-T-011-S-00150
2014-04-14-T-011,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck,"In order to help facilitate that, we are now reviewing some of our programmes, schemes and policies to facilitate that process. At the same time, we are also trying to empower the associations that have been set up overseas, like SinCham, the different offices that are set up, empower them to be able to bring their companies that are overseas together. Essentially, it is both ways. Both here and there, we have to coordinate. SPRING and IE undertake such a role to facilitate this whole process. And we definitely want to beef up our resources to do that.",4,151,2014-04-14-T-011-S-00151

About half of these cases were employment-related, covering claims for salary or overtime payments. The remainder included well-being issues, such as employers failing to ensure that their workers had acceptable accommodation, as well as work injury compensation-related issues, such as non-payment of compensation. As of 2013, just to give us a sense of proportion, this essentially represented less than 1% of the total non-domestic work permit holder population.",1,155,2014-04-14-T-013-S-00155

In 2013, about 3,800 local workers lodged cases with MOM for such matters, compared with an average of 3,400 such cases annually in 2012 and 2011. Is there a particular reason for this increase? A lot of it has got to do with increased awareness. We have stepped up our efforts to make sure that our workers understand their rights considerably and this has been the impact of that.",4,158,2014-04-14-T-013-S-00158

There are egregious practices and there is, certainly, always room for improvement. My Ministry stands ready to assist any worker with a rightful claim, regardless of the nationality, but it is also important to emphasise that we also do not tolerate attempts to game or to take advantage of our system. People will be taken to task if they do so. Over the past three years, we have taken action against about 100 workers for making false declarations to our officers.",5,159,2014-04-14-T-013-S-00159

2014-04-14-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"This year, MOH has also planned a series of public education efforts including television commercials, newspaper advertisements, and roadshows to spread the message of organ donation and to encourage individuals to discuss their views and decisions on organ donation with family members and loved ones. Through this open sharing, we hope that the family members would then be more ready to honour the organ donation decisions of their loved ones when called upon to do so.",3,163,2014-04-14-T-014-S-00163

I note his comments about the Ministry's efforts in the past and pending this year to educate the general public on the implications of the law. I wanted to ask whether the Ministry also tracks the outcomes of the efforts so far. In other words, what is the general awareness level existing in the population right now. Despite all these efforts, is awareness high, low or what is it?",1,166,2014-04-14-T-014-S-00166
2014-04-14-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Secondly, I recently came across a case of a resident of mine who passed away and she qualified to be a cadaveric donor. The family narrated to me that they were very shocked about the implications of the organ donation law. I would like to ask the Minister whether such expressions of surprise or shock from families is commonplace in hospitals currently and is that how the Ministry is stepping up its efforts.",2,167,2014-04-14-T-014-S-00167
2014-04-14-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Madam, I thank the Member for the supplementary questions. We have been tracking the outcome of our public education programmes. We have done surveys from time to time to better understand the awareness of HOTA and what are the implications. I do not have the exact numbers with me but from our studies and our surveys, we find that the majority of Singaporeans know about HOTA. They may not know all the implications of HOTA but we do know that a significant proportion of Singaporeans do understand the implications of organ donation under HOTA, and the possibility of opting out.",1,168,2014-04-14-T-014-S-00168
2014-04-14-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"To start with, we are sending letters to all Singaporeans and PRs reaching 21 years of age, to inform them of the option to opt out if they wish to. From time to time, when family members come into contact with the incident of a loved one passing away and they are confronted with the decision about organ donation, they may find it surprising and shocking at the point when they have just lost their loved ones. That is an encounter that we face from time to time at the hospital. When a person passes away, the family members are grieving. At the same time, the doctors and clinicians have to race against time to ensure the viability of the transplant. Therefore, they have to discuss with the family members on this issue that is sometimes very sensitive and very emotive. Therefore, we conduct training programmes for hospital staff so that they are better equipped in dealing with such issues to be able to understand the families' concerns and to manage the process in a more sensitive way.",2,169,2014-04-14-T-014-S-00169

The C-130 aircraft arrived at the search area at about 2.00 pm that same day. Minister Ng Eng Hen also spoke with his counterpart, Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, to see what else we could do to help. We subsequently deployed a Victory-class Missile Corvette (RSS Vigour), a Formidable-class frigate (RSS Steadfast) with a Sikorsky S-70B naval helicopter embarked, as well as a submarine support and rescue vessel (MV Swift Rescue) with divers on board to assist the search efforts in the South China Sea.

2014-04-14-T-015,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mdm Speaker, I think this incident is rather unprecedented. Various members of the ASEAN community have tried their best to provide assistance that would be useful to the Malaysians and the other parties involved in the search. For the ASEAN community, we do share tracks especially in shipping.

The answer was that the commuters enter the MRT stations and get the information there. I think that would not be very useful, because we are talking about an integrated public transport system. It would be useful for commuters at the bus stops to know what is happening at the MRT stations. If there is going to be a disruption, they can make plans on the spot rather than go into the MRT stations and find out then that their service is disrupted. I hope the Ministry can consider this.",1,186,2014-04-14-T-016-S-00186

LTA is indeed currently studying ways to enhance the provision of real time public transport service information including through an integrated platform for both bus and train service updates. On service delays for trains, there is already a requirement under the Code of Practice that LTA has out up for the operators to make the information available to the public in a timely manner. Going forward, it is really looking at how we can integrate the provision of bus and train information.",1,187,2014-04-14-T-016-S-00187

2014-04-14-T-018,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr S Iswaran),"Singapore has low unemployment. Therefore, allowing selected skilled labour from ASEAN to work temporarily here enables us to fill our skill gaps without compromising the job opportunities of our PMEs. Measures are in place to foster a level playing field for PMEs in the workplace. For example, the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) introduced by MOM will take effect in August 2014. This framework seeks to send a signal to employers on the importance of considering Singaporeans fairly for job opportunities.",2,192,2014-04-14-T-018-S-00192
2014-04-14-T-018,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr S Iswaran),"At the same time, the ASEAN agreement also facilitates Singaporean PMEs to work in ASEAN countries and gain regional experience.

Last year, the Indian government officials have publicly stated that Singapore's curb on foreign manpower had possibly violated our bilateral CECA Trade Pact. I am concerned whether there will be any agreements in our current negotiations with ASEAN that will be too loosely worded that may lead to misunderstanding in future. So, I would like the Minister's assurance that all these will be factored in and that the definitions will be very clear.",1,195,2014-04-14-T-018-S-00195

2014-04-14-T-019,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Mdm Speaker, MOE seeks to keep tertiary education affordable and accessible to our students, by providing significant subsidies for all students and by providing a range of financial assistance. The Government provides substantial subsidies for tertiary education, at about 75% and 85% of the total education cost at the Universities and Polytechnics respectively.",1,198,2014-04-14-T-019-S-00198
2014-04-14-T-019,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Over the past five years, from 2009 to 2013, costs at the publicly-funded tertiary institutions have increased on average by about 4% per year. In contrast, fee adjustments for these institutions have been modest over the same period. Under the cohort-based fee system, undergraduates pay the same fees throughout the duration of the course. The average annual fee increases were lower, at 1% to 1.6% per year for each student cohort for the bulk of the courses. Polytechnic fees, which are lower, rose by $50 or about 2% on average over the past five years.",2,199,2014-04-14-T-019-S-00199
2014-04-14-T-019,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"We review and adjust the tuition fees on an annual basis, taking into account the cost of delivering quality tertiary education, while mindful of the prevailing economic situation. Where economic conditions have been difficult, the tertiary institutions have deferred fee increases, such as in Academic Year (AY) 2009 due to the economic downturn. The fee increases help institutions to partially defray rising costs. The revised fees compare favourably with overseas tertiary institutions.",3,200,2014-04-14-T-019-S-00200
2014-04-14-T-019,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"From AY2014, the Polytechnics will adopt the cohort-based fee system. This means that the student will pay the same fees for the entire duration of the course. This is a significant change, as the fee structure provides tertiary students with greater certainty regarding tuition fees and helps them to better plan the financing of their studies.",4,201,2014-04-14-T-019-S-00201
2014-04-14-T-019,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"MOE periodically reviews the Government financial assistance schemes to ensure that these are adequate for Singaporean students in need. MOE is significantly enhancing the Government bursaries from AY2014 for students studying at tertiary institutions. With the enhancements, the household per capita income cut-off to qualify for the Government bursaries has been raised from $1,700 to $1,900 per month. This means that more students will qualify for the bursaries. The bursary quanta have also been increased by between $200 and $700. With these changes, undergraduates can receive up to $3,600 per annum and Polytechnic students can receive up to $2,000 per annum, depending on their household income.",5,202,2014-04-14-T-019-S-00202

2014-04-14-T-019,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"With the Government subsidies and the range of financial assistance schemes, a Singaporean student from the bottom two-thirds of households by income, for instance, need not worry about direct cash outlay, as up to 100% of the tuition fees and a portion of living expenses can be covered through a combination of financial assistance and Government loans. Students from the 75th and 90th percentile can similarly tap on such loans to finance the bulk of their education cost, which are interest-free during the course of study.",7,204,2014-04-14-T-019-S-00204

The sampling technique used by OECD is such that scores at the individual and school level are not statistically meaningful. The test scores of individual students are not disclosed to the participants or to schools. Students do not have to make additional preparations for these tests. So, our participation in this study is unlikely to create stress to students.",3,210,2014-04-14-T-020-S-00210

Among others, this means equipping them with the moral compass and the navigation skills to apply their knowledge and exercise their creativity in various contexts and situations – including those which are unfamiliar and complex. The various PISA scores give us an additional source of input and an international benchmark. The more detailed PISA findings in terms of the proportions of our students achieving at various proficiency levels also enable us to review the effectiveness of our teaching and learning strategies in levelling up the competencies of all students.",4,211,2014-04-14-T-020-S-00211

Teachers have also made learning relevant and engaging, and ensured that students learn to use their knowledge and skills in real-life situations.

Beyond green buildings and the points that have been mentioned, I would like to ask one question. There have been reports that paper that is commonly used in offices for photocopying and so on sometimes comes or is procured from or manufactured by companies that do not practise sustainable oil palm production. And in view of the fact that we are very concerned about transboundary haze, pollution and things like that, can there be at least greater vigilance and commitment towards this particular area of green procurement?",1,228,2014-04-14-T-022-S-00228

2014-04-14-T-023,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance),"Mdm Speaker, in 2013, for the lowest 20% of households by income, on average, about half of their GST paid would have been offset by the regular GST Voucher. If we include the one-off GST Voucher Special Payment announced in Budget 2013, the benefits from the GST Voucher would have covered over 90% of their GST paid.",1,231,2014-04-14-T-023-S-00231

The GST Voucher is part of a progressive system of taxes and benefits, that ensures that lower-income households get back far more benefits than the taxes they pay, including GST. These include childcare subsidies and financial assistance from school to tertiary education, Workfare, special and additional housing grants and healthcare subsidies. The GST that they pay is hence far more than offset by the benefits they receive.",2,232,2014-04-14-T-023-S-00232

Or is it meant to just partially offset it?",1,233,2014-04-14-T-023-S-00233
2014-04-14-T-023,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member),"I understand the Senior Minister of State's point that there are other vouchers and other subsidy schemes that would help to offset the cost of living, but specifically for the GST, does the Government see it necessary to fully offset the GST paid by the lower income, in recognition of the fact that it is a regressive tax? Because that was the understanding and the impression that I had when the GST Voucher Scheme was launched.",2,234,2014-04-14-T-023-S-00234
2014-04-14-T-023,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for his question. The GST Voucher Scheme is a permanent scheme. When the scheme was introduced, the idea was to ensure that even for lower-income households where they paid GST, there would be some form of permanent support for these households. But it does exist as part of a broader set of benefits that are provided to different households. And it is within this context that the GST Voucher Scheme is designed. So, we look at the benefits that are provided to households holistically and provide the support where it is most meaningful to them.",1,235,2014-04-14-T-023-S-00235

It is encouraging to see that 37% of the FDWs interviewed received a weekly rest day. In comparison, a 2010 survey of more than 900 foreign domestic workers showed that only 13% of FDWs received a weekly rest day. We also found that about 61% of those interviewed received at least a monthly rest day, compared to 53% in the 2010 survey. FDWs who forgo their weekly rest days have to be compensated with additional payment, as required under the law.",2,241,2014-04-14-T-024-S-00241

This included an information kit and rest day implementation guide, mailed to all FDW employer households. Employment agencies were briefed and given a recommended template for facilitating the written rest day agreement between FDWs and employers before commencement of employment, to allow expectations to be clearly communicated upfront. All first-time employers and FDWs were informed of the weekly rest day provision through the mandatory Employer Orientation Programme and the FDW Settling-In Programme.",3,242,2014-04-14-T-024-S-00242

This means that all FDWs will be on new employment contracts that will have to abide by the requirement. MOM hopes to see the rest day arrangement work well for employers, their families and the FDWs. A rest day provides FDWs a reprieve from their duties, much like how all of us Singaporeans need a break from our work. Ultimately, this will contribute to more well-adjusted FDWs who can better perform their jobs, benefiting our Singaporean families.",5,244,2014-04-14-T-024-S-00244

In relation to the replacement contracts, the start-up kit and the settling-in programme, does MOM understand that in some situations, the maids are in unequal bargaining positions and whether these programmes and start-up kits or literature create a buffer needed to put the maids perhaps on a more equal footing in terms of rest days?

2014-04-14-T-024,Hawazi Daipi,Mr Hawazi Daipi,"Madam, let me take the second question first – whether MOM can make the compulsory rest day truly compulsory. It is actually compulsory. Employers are supposed to provide one rest day a week to their domestic worker, if the Work Permit was issued on or after the 1 January 2013. Those who were under the old agreement can continue with whatever arrangement they had agreed to before but come 1 January 2015, all maids will come under the new agreement that will require employers to provide one day off a week. So, it is compulsory.",1,251,2014-04-14-T-024-S-00251

2014-04-14-T-024,Hawazi Daipi,Mr Hawazi Daipi,"So, is there truly an imbalanced relationship between the two? Maybe. But then, there are avenues for them to resolve their differences. The employment agency, because they are a party or the facilitator to the mutual agreement, can continue to be the facilitator. MOM cannot be there all the time in every household we have about 210,000 maids. We would have to work with the agencies to facilitate whatever differences that may happen or may arise between the two parties, but we will still be there if the maid comes to MOM for assistance.",3,253,2014-04-14-T-024-S-00253

2014-04-14-T-025,Lee Yi Shyan,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Lee Yi Shyan) (for the Minister for National Development),"Mdm Speaker, the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) is a $5 billion programme to equip HDB blocks without direct lift access with lift access on every floor. Within this budget, the implementation of LUP has to be subject to reasonable cost caps.",1,256,2014-04-14-T-025-S-00256
2014-04-14-T-025,Lee Yi Shyan,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Lee Yi Shyan) (for the Minister for National Development),"LUP has over time covered 98% of flats in blocks built without direct lift access in Singapore, benefiting some 500,000 households from 5,000 blocks. The remaining 2%, however, are difficult for LUP because of the block configuration and other technical constraints, resulting in very high costs per unit. Nevertheless, HDB tried its best and found some solutions for these flats. It successfully reduced the initial 1,000 such blocks to about 200 blocks through the adoption of new technologies and innovative solutions.",2,257,2014-04-14-T-025-S-00257

2014-04-14-T-025,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The second question is, under the original LUP, there is economy of scale. Going back to only these 200 blocks, if you were to implement just for these 200 blocks, would it not be more expensive than if the implementation for these 200 blocks not be put under the original LUP programme?",2,260,2014-04-14-T-025-S-00260
2014-04-14-T-025,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Well, Madam, 200 blocks still is a sizeable number as far as realising the economies of scale is concerned. But I think the issue is not really economies of scale. The issue is out of this very difficult configuration and sometimes the benefiting units are in between units that have lift access, how do you demolish existing balconies and punch through lift access shafts and so on? So, these are the kinds of challenges.",1,261,2014-04-14-T-025-S-00261
2014-04-14-T-025,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"The cost is not just marginal. Some of the costs are as good as building new flats itself. It is a very difficult cost-benefit situation. Based on some of the solutions that we are experimenting with, such as what we call the pneumatic vacuum elevator and the vertical platform lifts, some of these are being tried out. They still have not been installed but we will install them. Some of these really require user feedback to see how robust they are in serving traffic when it is installed in HDB flats rather than in special venues.",2,262,2014-04-14-T-025-S-00262
2014-04-14-T-025,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"The overall approach we take is one that, within our means, we will adopt innovative solutions that can mitigate or help solve some of these problems. In fact, some of them will not turn out very ideal because the blocks per se, if you build certain lift shafts, it becomes very convenient for residents at large but it may affect certain units facing the lift shafts in particular. So, there is no perfect solution. But the short answer is we will continue to try.",3,263,2014-04-14-T-025-S-00263

2014-04-14-T-025,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Also, it is not so much design. We cannot blame it totally on design. I remember distinctly when I was growing up and living in HDB flats for 20 years, there was a period of time people generally disliked choosing units next to the lifts because they value privacy more than anything else so they would choose units that were further away. So, the needs and lifestyles have changed. We have come to such a point that lift access becomes of great importance and becomes appreciated. We have to continue to adjust and see how our flat configurations can suit the new needs. In this case, it is retrofitting. I am sure our new flat design has all taken into consideration accessibility and universal design to aid mobility.

The first is the deadline for the LUP project, a nationwide LUP project. The second is the cost cap. My question is, after the deadline, should there be advancements in engineering, advancements in the manner in which we can install lifts, thereby reducing the amount payable per unit to something in the region of the cost cap or, perhaps even below that, would the Government be still willing to consider putting lifts in? And I use as an example, Sunset Way, where it was previously above the cost cap and then we looked at it and we looked at it again. And then a solution was found. So, would there be open-mindedness on the Ministry's part for that?",1,272,2014-04-14-T-025-S-00272

2014-04-14-T-026,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Teo Ser Luck),"Industrial rentals have been relatively stagnant from 2000 to 2006. Rentals saw an uptick in 2007, but declined during the Financial Crisis. In the second half of 2009, rentals started rising from a low base as our economy recovered. Rentals have since stabilised from last year. In general, rentals constitute between 3% and 7% of business costs for SMEs in the manufacturing sector but, of course, it depends on the different industry, different sectors where rental can be of a larger component. Over the next three years, an average of 500,000 sqm of multiple-user factory space will come on-stream annually. This is double the average annual space demand for such space in the last three years and is also expected to moderate industrial rentals further.",2,278,2014-04-14-T-026-S-00278
2014-04-14-T-026,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Teo Ser Luck),"For retail space, URA's shop rental index rose by 2.9% and 2.6% in 2010 and 2011 respectively, before declining by 0.3% and 0.9% in 2012 and 2013. As retail leases are generally renewed every two or three years, tenants may experience increases at the point of lease renewal. Based on data from January 2012 to May 2013, the median increase in rentals upon renewal was in line with inflation. About one in 10 tenants experienced cumulative increases in rental of more than 50%, and these tended to be tenants renewing their leases after more than four years, or who had units in more attractive locations. Also, for about one quarter of tenants, rentals either remained unchanged or actually declined.",3,279,2014-04-14-T-026-S-00279
2014-04-14-T-026,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Teo Ser Luck),"We expect retail rentals to moderate further. Over the next three years, about 145,000 sqm of new shop space will be completed each year. This is more than double the average annual demand for such space in the last three years.",4,280,2014-04-14-T-026-S-00280
2014-04-14-T-026,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Teo Ser Luck),"The Government has, in the past, provided also tax rebates to help reduce business costs during severe economic downturns. Such rebates were provided from July 2001 to December 2002, and more recently, in 2009. In view of the current economic conditions which are relatively sound and rentals are also expected to moderate, such rebates and subsidies may not be necessary at the moment. I will continue to monitor the situation and determine if there is a need in future.",5,281,2014-04-14-T-026-S-00281
2014-04-14-T-026,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Teo Ser Luck),"REITs are not leading players in the rental space market, as they currently own about 13% and 16% of retail and industrial rental spaces respectively. REITs typically select properties in locations that are more attractive, and invest in asset enhancement as well as undertake marketing efforts to increase foot traffic. These factors help explain why REITs are able to charge higher rentals. So, like any other landlords, they have to compete in the rental market to attract tenants.",6,282,2014-04-14-T-026-S-00282
2014-04-14-T-026,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Teo Ser Luck),"As rentals are driven by demand as well as supply, SMEs which operate in locations that are becoming more attractive will experience higher rentals. The Government is looking into publishing more comprehensive rental data for retail and industrial space to make the information more transparent so there is a sense of comparison and so as to provide the information on the overall rental market and also help businesses make some informed decisions and to make sure there is a fair practice so that they can consider their different options.",7,283,2014-04-14-T-026-S-00283
2014-04-14-T-026,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister of State  for the 5,000 sqm that come into the market annually, is this space developed by private developers or by Government agencies? I just had my dialogue session with SME owners who are my residents two days ago. Many expressed their concerns on rising rentals. I would like to ask the Minister of State if it would be possible to bring back the previous JTC kind of factories that were leased directly to the SMEs. The other thing is, will HDB be building more shops and more office space to lease directly to the SMEs?",1,284,2014-04-14-T-026-S-00284
2014-04-14-T-026,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck,"Madam, it is not 5,000 sqm. It is 500,000 sqm – that is double the annual demand. That is both JTC development as well as private development, which means that it would be through the Government Land Sale (GLS) Programme. What JTC is trying to do now is to play a more developmental role which is really to help SMEs and start-ups. Recently, we launched a larger area for new businesses and start-ups. We are also clustering spaces by industry, for example, goods manufacturing. Industries that seem to lag behind in the productivity movement, we help them to intensify space usage, or we can call it land intensification. We will cluster and build purpose-built factories for these companies to use and keep a balance. The supply of space will increase tremendously. That should moderate the general industrial space demand.",1,285,2014-04-14-T-026-S-00285
2014-04-14-T-026,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck,"For HDB, I guess I have to leave it to MND to answer that question. Through the SME Workgroup, we have MND and HDB representatives in there. We are all coordinating to make sure that we are monitoring all rentals throughout the different space, to make sure our SMEs do not face tremendous increases in terms of rentals. For reasons of making sure that there is fair practice and also making sure that the inflationary measures that may impact the rental cost, are reduced.",2,286,2014-04-14-T-026-S-00286
2014-04-14-T-026,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck,"We are looking at all these different measures to see what we can do. Within this year, we will come up with more transparent data and more information in terms of a rental index to make sure that both tenants and landlords have a sense of where their rates are and how they can have a sense of comparison to make sure that rentals are fair throughout the location.",3,287,2014-04-14-T-026-S-00287

2014-04-14-T-026,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck,"I do not have the information at the moment. We will now have to plan to see how much out of the 500,000 sqm is for GLS and how much for development by JTC. I do not have that information; I could provide that later.",1,289,2014-04-14-T-026-S-00289
2014-04-14-T-026,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Moulmein-Kallang),"I would just like to ask the Minister of State what is the source of his information that the rental rate increases are generally aligned with the inflation rate? There seems to be some perception issues that are on the ground. I think it is quite important to address that. No matter what the Government says, that perception seems to be persisting. There are quite a number of data points that suggest that when retailers negotiate for a tenancy that is about to expire, they tend to get demands for increases as high as 100%. That kind of information goes around in the market. If that is the perception, I think that perception has to be addressed.",1,290,2014-04-14-T-026-S-00290
2014-04-14-T-026,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Moulmein-Kallang),"My second question would be when this data would be published. Do we have to wait until everything is available? If not, can it be done as soon as possible so that, again, that perception is addressed?",2,291,2014-04-14-T-026-S-00291
2014-04-14-T-026,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck,"The data and the information that I have got is an aggregate, which means it is averaged out. There are different experiences and practices between landlord and tenants because of the contractual arrangements. At different locations, they will experience different commercial practices. The landlord may have a different mix of shops and tenants that they want, and so there are different types of contractual arrangements. That determines some of the rates that may apply to the tenants.",1,292,2014-04-14-T-026-S-00292
2014-04-14-T-026,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck,"We are unable to go into such specific breakdowns such as by buildings. But on the whole, the intent is that as far as we can, we are looking for the sources that make sense. Perhaps by geographical points, within an area, and we can say how high or how low the rental index is in that area by comparison. We are still determining the sources and we are collecting the data and information with the help of associations and Government agencies. It is not just data from the Government agencies, but also from associations, practitioners and stakeholders of the market. We intend to do this and complete it within this year. We hope to do it as soon as possible, but we have to make sure that the data is accurate, comprehensive and complete.",2,293,2014-04-14-T-026-S-00293

2014-04-14-T-027,Lawrence Wong,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Since the Do Not Call rules came into effect on 2 January this year, the Personal Data Protection Commission has received some 3,000 valid complaints. The Commission has been following up on these and enforcement action continues to be taken, with over 200 written notices issued by the Commission to warn organisations of non-compliance. For more serious breaches, offers of composition have been made and accepted by two organisations. The Commission also continues to investigate one organisation with the most serious breaches, with a view to prosecution. Further details of the case will be provided by the Commission once investigations are complete. For complaints relating to illegal activities such as unlicensed money lending matters, the Commission has referred these cases to the Police for their attention.",2,296,2014-04-14-T-027-S-00296

2014-04-14-T-027,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"The second question is, I understand from the Senior Minister of State's reply that the Personal Data Protection Commission refers the moneylending SMSes to the Police instead of investigating them under the Data Protection Act. Does the PDPC follow up with Police on the number of such complaints and how they are being followed up by the Police?",2,299,2014-04-14-T-027-S-00299
2014-04-14-T-027,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"The third supplementary question is, the Minister of State has said that for one case, MCI may bring the case for prosecution in the Courts.

2014-04-14-T-027,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, on the first question on registration, whether they are up to expectations, I would say that we have had a good response so far. It is difficult to say what the expectations were from the outset, but generally, we have had good response and feedback from the implementation. We will continue to publicise the scheme to make sure that there is widespread awareness from the public.",1,301,2014-04-14-T-027-S-00301
2014-04-14-T-027,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the second point on unlicensed moneylending cases, unlicensed moneylending is a serious criminal offence. And so, the PDPC would want to work with the Police or to refer these cases to the Police to follow up on. We will continue to track them but we do want to make sure that the cases are dealt with in a serious fashion because of the gravity of these offences. The PDPC does not take unilateral action but they will work with the Police to make sure that there is follow-up on these cases.",2,302,2014-04-14-T-027-S-00302
2014-04-14-T-027,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the third point about composite fines, and the fact that there was only one case with a view to prosecution and what would be the follow-up for the other cases, this will again depend on the seriousness of the offence. As I had mentioned, offers of composition had been made for two so far. And quite a number may also end up in this category. The very serious cases, the PDPC will certainly continue with prosecution. I am unable to give a breakdown today because investigations are still on-going for many of the cases.",3,303,2014-04-14-T-027-S-00303

In 2013, around 65,000 Singaporean students were on financial assistance in our schools. This was about 1.5 times the number of beneficiaries five years before, largely owing to changes to the criteria which enabled more students to be eligible.

In Academic Year (AY) 2013, around 47,000 Singaporean students in these post-Secondary institutions received the CDC-CCC bursaries and MOE bursaries. This was about 2.5 times the number of beneficiaries five years before, largely due to the changes in criteria in AY2011 that enable more students to qualify. From AY2014, these bursaries have been enhanced to significantly increase the bursary quanta and raise the income eligibility threshold to benefit more students. In addition, students in our publicly-funded Polytechnics and Universities can also take up the Tuition Fee Loan and Study Loan to cover their tuition fees and supplement their living expenses.",4,310,2014-04-14-T-028-S-00310

These requirements will be consistent with the relevant FATF recommendations, including the obligations to perform customer due diligence and transaction monitoring on customers, and to consider whether it is necessary to file suspicious transaction reports.

In fact, these factors are already part of today's regime and will be retained. The amendments we are proposing aim to enhance the current regime through setting higher eligibility criteria. This includes requiring an applicant to be a fit and proper person, not to have been convicted of any offence involving fraud or dishonesty with imprisonment for three months or more, and not to be an undischarged bankrupt. So, the current amendments build on existing requirements, which already incorporate Mr Dhinakaran's suggestion.",3,366,2014-04-14-T-029-S-00366

I should explain that the enhanced regime does not enlarge the categories of persons that are allowed to register. Members of the old professional bodies that we currently allow have carried out their duties satisfactorily thus far, and there are no strong reasons to exclude any one of these professional bodies. Under the enhanced regulatory framework, members of these bodies however, who do not meet the requirements will no longer be registered. So, this will help to ensure that the quality of services provided by our Corporate Service Providers is not compromised.",5,368,2014-04-14-T-029-S-00368

2014-04-14-T-030,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,I will now take the House through the main features of the Bill.,13,401,2014-04-14-T-030-S-00401
2014-04-14-T-030,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Part IV of the Bill establishes a system of registration for GIs. The aim of having a system of registration is to improve the certainty of protection given to GIs. Registration will give the holder certainty that a term is recognised as a GI and is, therefore, entitled to all the protections enjoyed by a GI, without needing to confirm this before the Courts. This will facilitate the enforcement of these rights.",14,402,2014-04-14-T-030-S-00402
2014-04-14-T-030,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The proposed GI Registry will reside within the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS). When established, the Registry will examine applications for GI registration in respect of  (a) wines and spirits; and (b) selected categories of agricultural products and foodstuffs, such as cheese, meat and seafood.",15,403,2014-04-14-T-030-S-00403
2014-04-14-T-030,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,Registration will be a three-stage process that seeks to be transparent and fair. The process is similar to the trade mark registration system in Singapore and comprises the following,16,404,2014-04-14-T-030-S-00404
2014-04-14-T-030,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"First, application. Among other things, applicants will be required to specify the quality, reputation or characteristics of the good in question and how that is attributable to the geographical origin.",17,405,2014-04-14-T-030-S-00405
2014-04-14-T-030,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Second, there will be examination. There will be a detailed examination of each application to ascertain that they fulfil certain fundamental requirements. These are largely similar to what is mandated under the present Act and TRIPS.",18,406,2014-04-14-T-030-S-00406
2014-04-14-T-030,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Third, publication and opposition. Thereafter, the application will be made public for a period of time. This is to allow third parties an opportunity to object to the registration, for example, on grounds of ""generic-ness"", meaning that the GI has become a common name for describing that product in Singapore. In this respect, GI terms which are proven to have become common household names in Singapore may not be registered.",19,407,2014-04-14-T-030-S-00407
2014-04-14-T-030,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Registration of a GI will last for 10 years initially. Like the trade mark registration system, this can be renewed for further periods of 10 years. To protect existing rights, GI registration will also follow the ""first in time, first in right"" principle. This means that a new application for GI registration may not invalidate a prior conflicting GI or trade mark which already exists.",20,408,2014-04-14-T-030-S-00408
2014-04-14-T-030,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Trade mark owners today using terms similar to GIs being registered will thus not be inconvenienced. However, the GI can still be registered if consent is obtained from the owner of the prior conflicting trade mark. Consequential amendments to the Trade Marks Act will be made to align the current Trade Marks regime with this position.",21,409,2014-04-14-T-030-S-00409
2014-04-14-T-030,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"There will also be exceptions for existing users of GIs so that their business operations will not be disrupted. For instance, if a person has continuously used a GI term in Singapore for a sufficiently long period of time, or has previously used the term in good faith, he or she may continue to use the term, even if the GI is subsequently registered.",22,410,2014-04-14-T-030-S-00410
2014-04-14-T-030,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"We do not foresee a significant impact on consumer choice, as the majority of products labelled with GIs in the local market are already of the correct geographical origin.

That is the first main change.",24,412,2014-04-14-T-030-S-00412
2014-04-14-T-030,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The second relates to the enhanced protection for registered GIs. Under the TRIPS two-tier system of protection, wines and spirits enjoy an enhanced level of protection. This enhanced level of protection means that protection is conferred even if consumers are not misled as to the products' true geographical origin. Clause 4 of the Bill will extend this enhanced level of protection beyond wines and spirits to all successfully registered GIs, including agricultural products and foodstuff.",25,413,2014-04-14-T-030-S-00413
2014-04-14-T-030,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The third change relates to border enforcement measures. Under Part VI of the Bill, owners of all registered GIs will have access to improved border enforcement measures.

These measures are generally based on those in the Trade Marks Act, with modifications to suit the situations involving GIs.",26,414,2014-04-14-T-030-S-00414

2014-04-14-T-030,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,The GI Registry will be established only if the EU Parliament ratifies the EUSFTA. The enhanced protection for all categories of registered GIs will only kick in when the benefits of the EUSFTA is provisionally applied both ways. Improved border enforcement measures will only be effected within three years after the EUSFTA enters into force. This will give Customs time to build up capabilities to undertake enforcement action.,28,416,2014-04-14-T-030-S-00416
2014-04-14-T-030,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,The staged implementation ensures that any potential disruptions to local businesses dealing with or using GI products do not kick in before the benefits of the EUSFTA start to accrue.,29,417,2014-04-14-T-030-S-00417
2014-04-14-T-030,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"It will also give businesses time to make the necessary changes to adjust to the new GI regime, including, for example, the re-labelling of products for sale in the local market, which is what some local businesses are already in the process of doing.",30,418,2014-04-14-T-030-S-00418
2014-04-14-T-030,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"When the new GI protection regime comes into force, it will not over-ride or undermine any rights which GI holders already have under the existing regime. These rights will co-exist with those under the new regime.",31,419,2014-04-14-T-030-S-00419

2014-04-14-T-030,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mdm Speaker, a geographical indication, or GI for short, is a legal term that refers to a sign or indication that identifies a good as originating from a particular location. These GI products are typically characterised by a special quality, reputation or unique characteristic. Well-known examples of GIs include Darjeeling tea, Champagne and Parma ham.",1,425,2014-04-14-T-030-S-00425
2014-04-14-T-030,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"It is essential that we respect the geographical origins of these products as they represent a guarantee as to the quality of the products that are being purchased. Beyond that, these GIs may also promise a specific taste, aroma, appearance or characteristic which consumers are willing to pay for. Equally, should there be goods produced in Singapore, their Singapore-linked GI should be respected. What I am about to do to your menu is, well, tongue-in-cheek! For example, if under the starters we had Ghim Moh chwee kway, or under the mains we had Katong laksa, or under the desserts we had Geylang ondeh ondeh, or under the beverages we had wines. The broader point I am making here is we, too, should not only have to protect GIs of other countries but, should the time come, reciprocity should be accorded to our country, Singapore, by countries in terms of relevant goods produced here or eventually produced here.",2,426,2014-04-14-T-030-S-00426
2014-04-14-T-030,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"As such, it is essential that we honour the GIs of goods and products that are being sold on our shores or that are being exported or imported through our ports.",3,427,2014-04-14-T-030-S-00427

He had actually also highlighted an example which I think I should address because it illustrates what is meant by Geographical Indications. So, for example, Katong laksa would not, unfortunately, qualify as a GI, the reason being that, in order to be a GI, its components would actually have to be grown or originate from Katong. So, the laksa leaf would have to be a Katong laksa leaf, the rice flour would have to come from rice grown in Katong, the tau pok would have to come from the soya bean that was grown in Katong and the clams would have to be harvested there as well.",1,446,2014-04-14-T-030-S-00446

The feedback from the consultations largely revolved around particular GIs of interest to various producers from different parts of the world. The feedback related to issues that have been debated in other countries, such as whether certain GI terms were viewed as generic and can be registered. The takeaway from the exercise was to confirm the need for us to create a transparent and fair system for registration, which would examine each GI application on a case-by-case basis. This we have done through the three-stage process for registration. I have described this process in my earlier speech.

2014-04-14-T-034,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,asked the Prime Minister in view of the recent National Climate Change Secretariat survey (a) what are the likely reasons for the decline in public concern and the lower sense of personal responsibility and action on climate change issues; and (b) what strategies are being envisaged to better reach out to Singaporeans on climate change issues with a view to enhancing personal responsibility and action.,1,465,2014-04-14-T-034-S-00465
2014-04-14-T-034,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) commissioned a survey from September to October 2013 to gauge public perception on climate change. The survey found that about seven in 10 (70.2%) respondents were concerned about climate change, marginally (3.6%) lower than the previous survey in 2011. However, only 39% of respondents felt that individuals should be mainly responsible for taking action on climate change, compared to 56% in the previous survey.",1,466,2014-04-14-T-034-S-00466
2014-04-14-T-034,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"The results could have been influenced by the severe transboundary haze that affected Singapore in June 2013. This is because half of the respondents (50.6%) cited ""clearing of forests"" as the key contributor to climate change. As there is not much that an individual could do to prevent transboundary haze, this could have led to more respondents looking towards the Government to take action.",2,467,2014-04-14-T-034-S-00467
2014-04-14-T-034,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"On the other hand, over 80% of respondents indicated that they adopt climate-friendly behaviour – they turn off electrical appliances at the mains when the appliances are not in use, choose appliances which carry an energy label, use public transport or car pool when possible and practise the 3Rs, that is, Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. This is an improvement over the 2011 survey where over 70% of respondents said that they were doing so.",3,468,2014-04-14-T-034-S-00468

2014-04-14-T-040,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"While growing operational demands will mean that more may have to be recruited in future, we are mindful that there are natural limits to how much further we can grow the Police Force, without compromising the standards that are expected of our officers. Indeed, we will find it challenging to recruit enough officers and enough good officers, due to our ageing population and fewer Singaporeans entering the labour force each year. It is, therefore, important that we not only look at adding to quantity but also make the best use of our Police Officers by deepening their capabilities, by deploying superior operating models and strategies and by leveraging more on technology as a force multiplier and recruiting civilian officers to take on specialised roles, such as in crime scene investigation, where such civilian officers can be deployed to complement uniformed officers.

Students are not likely to drop out because of high fees as MOE provides subsidies for students who need to repeat subjects for up to an additional year beyond the normal course duration of two years. ITE students who need financial assistance can also tap on Government bursaries. MOE has announced that from AY2014, these bursaries would be enhanced significantly, with increases in the bursary quanta, as well as changes to the income eligibility criteria, which would allow more students to qualify. With these changes, full-time ITE students can receive up to $1,200 per annum, depending on their household income, which is more than sufficient to cover the fees payable.

2014-04-14-T-045,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Assault cases span a wide spectrum. The Police will make preliminary enquiries to establish the facts and circumstances for every case that is reported. An arrest would be effected if an assault results in grievous injuries. As for cases where there are minor or no injuries, Police will classify them as voluntarily causing hurt (VCH). Such cases can range from a slap during a family dispute to the use of physical force during incidents of road rage.",1,516,2014-04-14-T-045-S-00516

Such cases comprised about 9% of the reported VCH cases over the past three years. Upon the conclusion of investigations, the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) will make the final prosecutorial decision, based on the evidence available.

In some cases, the parties involved do not want to pursue the case even after a police report has been made by them or a third party. This is especially true for cases involving family members or friends. It is also often difficult to obtain objective evidence as it may be the word of one party against the other.

Over the same period, the number of reported UML-related cases fell by 55.5% from 18,649 cases in 2009 to 8,306 cases in 2013. These improvements are also attributable to the strong support given to the Police by the community.",1,522,2014-04-14-T-046-S-00522

2014-04-14-T-047,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Flat owners who bought a subsidised flat directly from the HDB or had taken a CPF Housing Grant for a resale flat are referred to as second-timers, and have to pay a resale levy when they buy a second subsidised flat. This is to reduce the second housing subsidy, and maintain a fair allocation of subsidies between first- and second-timers. The same treatment applies to second-timers who take over ownership of a subsidised flat by way of transfer, including inheritance upon demise of the former lessee.",1,527,2014-04-14-T-047-S-00527

A local study based on Singapore's suicide statistics from 2000-2004 had reported that relationship problems were associated with one-third of all suicides and financial or employment issues were associated with a further one third. For suicides amongst elderly, gradual physical disability and suffering were important risk factors especially if coupled with the lack of adequate community and family support. However, it is important to note that it is often not just one factor but a combination of several factors interacting with each other which may trigger suicidal behaviour.",1,533,2014-04-14-T-049-S-00533

2014-04-14-T-055,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The Net Investment Returns (NIR) framework allows the Government to tap the investment returns of our reserves for budgetary spending in a sustainable way. Under the framework, the Government can spend up to 50% of the long-term expected real return from the net assets managed by GIC and MAS, and up to 50% of the net investment income from Temasek and other assets.",1,583,2014-04-14-T-055-S-00583
2014-04-14-T-055,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Government generally budgets to take in 50% of Net Investment Return Contribution (NIRC) at the start of each Financial Year (FY). The actual NIRC taken in at the end of the FY may vary due to changes in the fiscal position and to differences in the actual outturn for the maximum NIRC compared to what was budgeted at the estimates stage.,2,584,2014-04-14-T-055-S-00584
2014-04-14-T-055,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"From FY2009 to FY2013, the actual NIRC taken in has been close to the maximum 50%, with the Government taking in, on average, slightly above 47% of the NIRC. We expect to take in the maximum 50% of NIRC in FY2014, in view of an expected overall budget deficit.",3,585,2014-04-14-T-055-S-00585
2014-04-14-T-055,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The NIRC has been able to supplement the Budget by $7 billion to $8 billion annually.

2014-04-14-T-057,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"The Member is incorrect in suggesting that the IDA audits mobile network traffic logs by using drive and walk tests. It is illogical to use network traffic logs to measure network coverage since by definition, network data logs can only measure performance within the network and cannot possibly measure coverage in an area if it is not covered by the network. Hence, to measure network coverage, IDA uses drive-walk-cycle tests. Measurements for call success rates and drop call rates are based on the operators' network traffic logs.",1,594,2014-04-14-T-057-S-00594

2014-04-14-T-058,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"IDA determines the drop call rates by auditing the mobile operators' respective network traffic logs. For example, in August 2013, the drop call rates on the operators' network were 0.27% (for M1 and StarHub) and 0.41% (for SingTel). Since the figures are derived from total set of network transactions, they are measuring the actual experience of the subscribers on the ground for that month.",1,596,2014-04-14-T-058-S-00596
2014-04-14-T-059,Lee Li Lian,Ms Lee Li Lian,asked the Minister for Communications and Information how does IDA conclude that the drop call rate is a measure of the availability of radio channels to handle and maintain established phone calls when there have been no tests done or monitored for the availability of radio channels based on IDA's Quality of Service (QoS) standards and performance results.,1,597,2014-04-14-T-059-S-00597
2014-04-14-T-059,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Even if the channel is not available, the operators' network equipment will be able to register that a call was being attempted. This, together with calls that were established, goes into the calculation of IDA's call success rate under the 3G QoS standards. Availability of radio channels is more relevant to mobile operators to diagnose network congestion to further improve on their networks.",1,598,2014-04-14-T-059-S-00598

Under the CHAS scheme, GPs can also make subsidised referrals for those with abnormal results to have further tests done at the public hospitals, such as colonoscopy.",2,639,2014-04-14-T-069-S-00639
2014-04-14-T-069,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Those who do not wish to go for FIT may opt for colonoscopy once every 10 years to screen for colorectal cancer. Medisave can be used to pay for colonoscopy. However, the procedure is not without risks as one in 10,000 may have perforation of the colon or other complications.",3,640,2014-04-14-T-069-S-00640
2014-04-14-T-069,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Based on data from the Health Behavioural Surveillance Survey in 2013, 33.8% of Singaporeans aged 50-69 years old were screened for colorectal cancer with either FIT or colonoscopy within the recommended period. While this is an improvement from screening coverage of 26.8% in 2011, we will continue to step up our efforts to raise screening coverage with either FIT or colonoscopy. We will ensure that there are sufficient specialists and facilities available to perform colonoscopy for those with abnormal FIT results.",4,641,2014-04-14-T-069-S-00641
2014-04-14-T-069,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Under the ISP, we will continue to encourage eligible Singaporeans to undergo screening, not just for colorectal cancer, but also other cancers, as well as for chronic diseases. We recognise that ""prevention is better than cure"". Hence, MOH and HPB have been stepping up our efforts on encouraging healthy living in the population over the past years, including having a balanced diet, doing regular physical activity, leading a smoke-free lifestyle and going for regular health screening.",5,642,2014-04-14-T-069-S-00642
2014-04-14-T-069,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"To further consolidate these efforts and to make healthy living accessible, natural and effortless for all Singaporeans, MOH has developed a Healthy Living Master Plan which aims to keep Singaporeans healthy and free of illness for as long as possible through the adoption and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle.",6,643,2014-04-14-T-069-S-00643

2014-04-14-T-070,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Training for Singaporeans to work on board commercial ships is primarily provided by Singapore Polytechnic and its Singapore Maritime Academy.

2014-04-14-T-071,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan,asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider working with relevant taxi operators to rethink the job structure for taxi drivers so that they can also look forward to CPF contributions from their employers.,1,646,2014-04-14-T-071-S-00646
2014-04-14-T-071,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Today, taxi drivers prefer to be self-employed and are, therefore, responsible for their own CPF contributions. Nevertheless, under the Drive-and-Save Scheme initiated by the National Taxi Association in 2011, taxi drivers who contribute at least $15 a month to their Medisave accounts receive a co-contribution of $15 from their companies.",1,647,2014-04-14-T-071-S-00647

2014-04-14-T-072,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The COE system is intended to control the population of vehicles in Singapore at a level that can be sustained by our road network.

2014-04-14-T-073,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"LTA's assessment is that current traffic conditions at Queen Street are manageable and that, based on the projected demand, a purpose-built facility for buses and taxis plying between Singapore and Malaysia is not needed in the near to medium term.

2014-04-14-T-074,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,The Singapore Preschool Accreditation Framework (SPARK) was introduced in 2011 as a voluntary accreditation scheme to help raise the quality of our preschools. It also serves as a quality benchmark for parents when choosing a preschool for their child.,1,655,2014-04-14-T-074-S-00655
2014-04-14-T-074,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Today, one in six preschools are SPARK-certified. One in four kindergartens and one in seven childcare centres are certified.",2,656,2014-04-14-T-074-S-00656
2014-04-14-T-074,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Anchor operators are leading the sector in terms of having their centres SPARK-certified. Among existing anchor operator kindergartens and childcare centres, more than one-third are SPARK-certified. These centres make up two-thirds of all SPARK-certified preschools.",3,657,2014-04-14-T-074-S-00657
2014-04-14-T-074,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Going forward, ECDA will continue in its efforts to encourage more centres to be SPARK-certified. We have taken steps to make SPARK assessment more accessible to centre leaders and teachers.",4,658,2014-04-14-T-074-S-00658
2014-04-14-T-074,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"First, a SPARK Information Pack has been developed and distributed to all centres to help centres understand SPARK better.

2014-04-14-T-075,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan,asked the Acting Minister for Manpower what are the key principles on information sharing that management and unions in unionised companies should follow in order to facilitate constructive discussion and settlement of disputes during negotiation for collective bargaining.,1,660,2014-04-14-T-075-S-00660
2014-04-14-T-075,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,The key principles to guide information sharing between management and unions in unionised companies are articulated in the Code of Industrial Relations Practices jointly formulated by the Tripartite Partners.,1,661,2014-04-14-T-075-S-00661
2014-04-14-T-075,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,Unions and management should have regular platforms where relevant information can be shared and discussed in an open and honest manner. There should also be a clear understanding and agreement on the type of information that can or cannot be shared and on how relevant information can be used by the parties involved especially during negotiations.,2,662,2014-04-14-T-075-S-00662
2014-04-14-T-075,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I am happy to note that by and large, management and unions have observed the principles on information sharing articulated in the Code of Industrial Relations. Many have also held regular sharing sessions or dialogues to share relevant information and discuss issues of mutual concern. Sharing of relevant and timely information facilitates constructive dialogue and negotiation in good faith and helps build stronger trust and respect between management and unions. It also helps to strengthen labour management relations at the company level, thereby benefiting both workers and the company.",3,663,2014-04-14-T-075-S-00663
2014-04-14-T-076,Fatimah Lateef,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef,asked the Acting Minister for Manpower what can be done for low-income workers who are not able to bear the fees of detailed medical reports in order to claim for work injury compensation or reimbursement.,1,664,2014-04-14-T-076-S-00664
2014-04-14-T-076,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA) offers workers a no-fault, expeditious and low-cost route to compensation for any injury arising out of and in the course of employment.",1,665,2014-04-14-T-076-S-00665
2014-04-14-T-076,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Employers are required under WICA to pay for their worker's medical leave wages, medical expenses and compensation for permanent incapacity or death, where applicable. For medical expenses, which include fees for medical reports to support work injury compensation claim, employers are liable to pay up to $30,000 or one year from date of accident, whichever is reached first, as long as treatment is considered necessary by a Singapore-registered doctor. Injured worker who has paid for his medical reports or treatment from his own pocket can seek reimbursement from his employer.",2,666,2014-04-14-T-076-S-00666
2014-04-14-T-076,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Local workers who require financial assistance while waiting for their compensation claims can apply for the Special Relief Fund1 administered by the Singapore Labour Foundation.

2014-04-14-T-077,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Acting Minister for Manpower how does the Government plan to raise the wages of local low-wage workers in industries other than cleaning, security and landscaping given that that there are around 110,000 employed residents in Singapore earning less than $1,000 per month (excluding part-time workers) and the enforcement of the Progressive Wage Model in these three industries is expected to impact only about 80,000 low-wage workers.",1,669,2014-04-14-T-077-S-00669
2014-04-14-T-077,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I have talked about the need to raise the incomes of lower-wage Singaporeans for a few years now and we have been putting in place measures to do so. It requires a holistic and wide-ranging effort. As a key first step, we need to keep the economy healthy, competitive and vibrant so that a wide range of jobs is available.",1,670,2014-04-14-T-077-S-00670
2014-04-14-T-077,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Secondly, our tightened labour market helps to keep unemployment low and put some upward pressure on wages. Thirdly, we have enhanced Workfare, which now supplements the incomes and retirement savings of more than 400,000 Singaporean workers earning less than $1,900, and encourages them to work regularly and up-skill. Through the Inclusive Growth Programme, low-wage workers benefit from companies' productivity gains through higher wages. MOM has also raised the full-time equivalent (FTE) salary for full-time local workers from $850 to $1,000 in July 2013. The FTE salary is used to determine how many local workers a company has, as a basis to calculate the foreign worker quota that the company is entitled to. It also ensures that local workers are employed meaningfully and are not paid token salaries just to pad the numbers.",2,671,2014-04-14-T-077-S-00671
2014-04-14-T-077,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"However, it is important to also understand that raising incomes has to be based on productivity improvements, to be sustainable in the long run. Mandating the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) to support wages at the very low end is a highly targeted intervention applied to specific sectors where there is a particular problem with the labour market, such as prevalent cheap-sourcing coupled with a lack of union representation for the workers. We are applying the PWM requirement through legislation in the Cleaning, Security and potentially the Landscape Sectors. But this legislation approach will not be appropriate for all sectors and occupations. A better approach for other sectors is NTUC's on-going efforts to work directly with employers to develop progressive wage structures and career progression pathways for rank-and-file and even PME workers.",3,672,2014-04-14-T-077-S-00672
