2014-05-27-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Before I proceed to call the first Member, I would like to remind Members that if, in the course your speech or in the course of your clarification, you need to make a reference to another Member, you would need to refer to that Member by the name of the Member – Ms, Madam or Mr – or by the constituency which the Member comes from, instead of referring to the hon Member as ""he"" or ""she"". This is just a reminder to Members, to upkeep the decorum in this House. Dr Chia Shi-Lu.",1,5,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00005
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. The President, in his speech to Parliament, spoke from his heart about his vision for how Singaporeans can build a better life for themselves and their children amidst a challenging and changing environment. Just over two years previously, when he spoke during the Opening of this Parliament during its First Session, he likewise called on all Singaporeans to be as one, to build an inclusive and inspired society.",1,6,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00006
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"I rise today to speak to thank him for his wise words, as I did then during the Opening of the First Session of Parliament. Singapore has not stood still since that day in October, and, likewise, this Government has been hard at work all this time listening to the people, working with the people and working for the people.",2,7,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00007
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Back then, one of the measures several of my colleagues and I pushed for was to give our seniors greater peace of mind where healthcare was concerned. I asked for greater subsidies to be given to senior citizens and that this should be calibrated to their age  the older a Singaporean is, then the more healthcare financial support he or she gets. The announcement of the Pioneer Generation Package and also MediShield Life which will provide universal healthcare insurance to all Singaporeans regardless of pre-existing illnesses, have exceeded all my expectations and then some, and have been warmly welcomed by all. These are the sort of bold moves by the Government which make me truly proud to be part of this governing party and to be a Singaporean.",3,8,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00008
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"There was a time that whenever we spoke of the Singaporean Dream, there was the inevitable mention of the dreaded 5Cs  cash, credit card, condo, car, country club. Even then, I found it difficult not to feel a little bit sheepish when I was talking about this, because it seemed as though this was all that Singaporeans aspired to. Certainly, these are things that many of us would still like to have, but I am happy that the younger generation seems to have started to move beyond these material aims.",4,9,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00009
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Is there a new definition of the Singaporean Dream? I suppose there are many viewpoints about this but why not let us try Happiness, Health and Hope, and a respect and appreciation of Home and living with Heart?",5,10,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00010
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"A central pillar of this new Dream is Health. The landscape of healthcare in developed societies is transforming from that of disease treatment to that of health maintenance and wellness. All of us are aware that each of us is personally responsible for our own health, but this does not mean that the Government should not act to nudge us towards being better keepers of our own health. Freedom of choice is important but, sometimes, it may not be a bad idea to save us from making less than wise decision where our well-being is concerned.",6,11,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00011
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),Tobacco and smoking legislation is a widely accepted form of governmental oversight which has had far-reaching positive public health effects over the past few decades. Let me here take the opportunity to laud the Health Promotion Board's recent efforts to raise the legal age for buying tobacco products.,7,12,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00012
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"The other clear and present health risk facing modern societies lies in the food we eat. There have been many calls in recent years for the Government to act more decisively in making the food we eat more healthy. There are many rules and regulations which safeguard food safety in terms of freedom from toxins and harmful biological agents like bacteria, but what about unsafe nutritional choices? In developed countries, diseases related to poor diet, such as excessive sugar, salt and fat, present a far greater public health burden than that posed by food poisoning and related problems.",8,13,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00013
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Let us look at a few examples. Britain's Food Standards Agency, between 2001 and 2011, set targets for the reduction of salt in various food categories and got food companies to achieve these targets over time. Over this period, sodium consumption in the UK fell by 15%. But what was more important was that this was accompanied by a significant decrease in the average blood pressure of the British. This was also accompanied by a 40% drop in deaths from heart attacks and a 42% drop in stroke deaths. Reducing the salt content in our food gradually over several years means that it is less likely consumers will taste the difference and also helps to shift our preference away from salty foods.",9,14,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00014
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"The work by the British Food Standards Agency mirrors the success seen by other countries, like Finland and Japan, which have managed to reduce sodium consumption through various government-led measures and consequently enjoyed substantial reductions in heart attacks and strokes.",10,15,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00015
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Admittedly, some similar measures have met with less success. For example, Denmark's fat tax and New York City's scuppered attempt to outlaw oversized sodas, but that should not deter us from continuing to push for healthy eating choices. Continue to highlight healthy hawker cooking, or perhaps have advisory health notices on unhealthy foods, like we now do on cigarette packaging. These are critical moves we have to make as a nation. The crisis is not so much that we have an ageing population but whether we are an ageing and also unhealthy nation.",11,16,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00016
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"The Government Parliamentary Committee on Health last year delivered a position paper on Healthcare Affordability to MOH based on numerous dialogues with the public and healthcare professionals. Since then, many of the concerns and proposals contained in that paper have been addressed by MOH, for which we are, indeed, grateful. But as we move to an era of even more affordable and accessible healthcare, we will also have to learn as a nation to utilise healthcare appropriately. This is not just about dollars and cents, but using healthcare in an unwarranted and excessive manner may do us more harm than good.",12,17,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00017
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Let me share one cautionary tale. In one state in the United States, they conducted an experiment where certain of the citizens were given expanded health insurance coverage through a lottery system. The hope was that if the citizens did not have to worry about healthcare expenditure, then, they would actually try to stay healthier by going to see the doctors more regularly. However, the researchers found the converse. They actually found that these ""lucky"" people – so to speak – who won the lottery, ended up making even more visits to Emergency Rooms at hospitals, and often for simple conditions that could be treated by their general practitioner or GP. In fact, their self-reported health scores were worse than before they won the lottery.",13,18,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00018
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"More and newer is not always better. Many health supplements and even some forms of health screening have little if any health benefits, and overuse of certain medications have risks. There are countries where, because of the pattern of reimbursement for antibiotics, they saw a high incidence of resistant strains of bacteria because of the change in the pattern of prescription.",14,19,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00019
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),These are some things that we have to be mindful of even as we make our healthcare more affordable and more accessible.,15,20,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00020
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"But universal, state-backed health insurance, such as that which is to be offered through MediShield Life, is, nonetheless, vitally important to plug certain healthcare financing gaps. There are certain conditions which incur significant costs to the patient and the family which require better coverage than what is offered today, such as cancer treatment and kidney dialysis. I hope that these needs will be met through MediShield Life or other supplementary programmes.",16,21,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00021
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Let me now turn my attention to how we prepare for an older Singapore. However much attention we place on our health, we will grow old. Singapore is growing old, and her people are growing old even more quickly. But as I have said on many occasions, growing old is not something to be feared but to be embraced. Going back to the 5Hs I mentioned earlier, we hope to grow old not only Healthily, but also Happily and with Hope in our own Homes. Mdm Speaker, in Mandarin, please.",17,22,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00022
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Though I do feel that retirement homes and villages are useful and serve specific needs, I hope that Singapore will not develop into a country where there are enclaves for the young and for the old. The elderly should age gracefully and actively within the community, and the community should provide an environment which allows this to happen.",18,23,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00023
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),I am glad that an Inter-Ministerial Committee has been set up to strategise a whole-of-Government approach towards preparing Singapore for an ageing society.,19,24,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00024
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"The President, in his speech, noted that our seniors did much to build today's Singapore and deserve our full support, and we have a duty to help the elderly remain active and healthy. Progress is inevitable.",20,25,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00025
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"As we become an increasingly connected and ""smart"" city, we will expect to see fewer traditional bank branches, post offices or, indeed, coin- or card-operated phones in the community.",21,26,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00026
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"We will have to help our seniors navigate these unsettling paths of change, leveraging on the very same technological advances that have caused these disturbances. Redesign automated cash machines and tellers to be more senior-friendly, and create simplified technological solutions within neighbourhoods so that seniors can access information services.",22,27,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00027
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Perhaps, provide staff during certain hours of the day at these otherwise self-service, automated facilities to guide seniors to utilise this new-fangled technology.",23,28,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00028
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"(In English)  I have just described how we can perhaps adapt the community to make it more senior-friendly. The other problem we will face is that we can expect to see more seniors growing old alone. While we can do many things to keep seniors engaged within the community, the Government should look into using technology also to monitor the well-being of such seniors, in as unobtrusive and respectful a manner as possible.",24,29,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00029
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"I am thankful to MOH for disbursing the City for All Ages grant to allow communities to promote Ageing-in-Place. In my ward in Queenstown, we have been using this grant to understand the needs of seniors, provide services, such as shuttle buses to the nearby polyclinic and, later, to embark on a small pilot programme to provide personal or home monitoring for seniors who live by themselves. Presently, we have alarm systems in some homes which can be activated in case of emergency, but there may arise situations when the resident is unable to activate this system. There are now simple, cost-effective monitoring systems which require no deliberate actions from the resident. For instance, many of us now use wearable technology, such as these little armbands that help our activities during the day. There are sensors that detect movement and appliance use, or the usage of electricity and water within a given home. These smart systems may be used to alert the community when something of concern might have occurred to a resident who lives in that home but, at the same time, these systems are relatively private and relatively unobtrusive.",25,30,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00030
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"A final point I wish to make is that, aside from the hardware and the software that are needed to make our society senior-friendly, the Government has to maintain its effort to engage and communicate with seniors. The Pioneer Generation Package is a wonderful programme and it is heartening that the relevant Ministries have really gone all out to reach out to these seniors to explain what it means to them.",26,31,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00031
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"However, judging from recent feedback from the ground, some seniors are still unsure of other Government policies, such as the periodic raising of the Minimum Sum requirements for CPF. I would submit that, perhaps, it would be worthwhile to turn these stories on their head and to focus on the fact that the key reason why we are doing this is because, as a nation, we are more healthy and the average life expectancy has risen. So, if we focus on this good piece of news, then it will be easier for us to understand that because we are all living longer, we may then need more in our CPF accounts to prepare for this longer period of life.",27,32,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00032
2014-05-27-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"The President called on us to keep Singapore Special and Unique, by being ""united in engaging our hearts and minds"". I am confident that Singaporeans will work together to make this so and grow from strength to strength, staying Happy, Healthy and with Hope in the Home we love and with all our Heart. With this, I support my colleagues in this Motion of thanks to the President.",28,33,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00033
2014-05-27-T-001,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"Mdm Speaker, I support the Motion to thank the President for his Address. Before the local media reported that Singapore was named the best place in Asia for mothers, there is already a group of residents in Woodlands who believed that it is true that Singapore is the best place for them and their families and for women and girls as well. This group included many women grassroots leaders, women residents who regularly took part in our community activities with their family members, foreign wives and new citizens, all of whom acknowledged that their children benefit from being born and raised in Singapore.",1,34,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00034
2014-05-27-T-001,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"Singapore's top spot is due to the Government's efforts to improve services for mothers and children  maternal mortality has been cut by 80%, child mortality decreased by 25%, gross national income per capita doubled and the percentage of women in Parliament increased six-fold over the past 15 years.",2,35,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00035
2014-05-27-T-001,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"I attend international parliamentary conferences regularly and have also hosted foreign parliamentarians in Singapore. The high percentage of our women parliamentarians and the safety for our women and girls generally are widely admired by even the most advanced countries in Europe, Australia and New Zealand.",3,36,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00036
2014-05-27-T-001,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"From feedback I have gathered on the ground, what is important to many mothers is not the affluence our children would inherit, but the care and concern they would receive as they grow up and the amount of care and concern they would show others when they become adults.",4,37,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00037
2014-05-27-T-001,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"The President's Address has also touched on the Government's proactive approach to improve the nation, including how we would continue to make Singapore a Caring Society. There is a great deal that our Government can deliver in terms of affordable housing, good healthcare, equal educational opportunities and secure employment, which are close to Singaporeans' hearts. When it comes to building a caring society, Singaporeans need to be convinced that they, too, must play their part and that they cannot rely on the Government to make it happen or expect a change equivalent to our remarkable achievement in making our nation the best place for mothers and women.",5,38,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00038
2014-05-27-T-001,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"What the Government has done and should continue to do is to promote courteous and considerate behaviour at all fronts – the workplace, in schools and in neighbourhoods. In recent years, customer service standards across many Government agencies rose significantly. Singaporeans have become more aware of the extensive social services we provide for the less fortunate in our midst. In addition, the National Service (NS) Review Committee has recommended more benefits in recognition of NSmen's contributions to the country. The proposed changes show more than due consideration towards Singaporeans who defend us and our homes. They are proof that the nation places great priority on furthering options that will increase their well-being as well as their family's well-being which, in turn, strengthens their sense of belonging to our nation.",6,39,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00039
2014-05-27-T-001,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"Anecdotally, since last week's announcements on the proposed increased benefits for NSmen, some mothers have begun telling their sons – and wives, their husbands – to work harder at staying fit so that the families will benefit overall.",7,40,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00040
2014-05-27-T-001,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"While I am heartened by the NS Review Committee's recommendations to strengthen National Service, I would like to urge the Government to help develop more ground-up initiatives to deepen the sense of belonging to our nation. Allow the community to play a greater part by giving them more resources to pursue the cause of promoting care and concern for one another.",8,41,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00041
2014-05-27-T-001,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"We can further enhance existing activities and programmes to emphasise kind thoughts, kind words and kind actions every day. Membership could be as varied as possible; it could be based on age groups, common interests, life phase, alumni or adopted charitable organisations. The key to success is consistency so that such groups are given sufficient resources to interact regularly. The promotion of care and concern among Singaporeans should also be enlarged to include caring for the environment and animals.",9,42,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00042
2014-05-27-T-001,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),There is among some of our youths a certain cynicism that showing care and concern towards others works against their own interests. They argue that they may end up as victims of their own altruism. This pessimistic view of others often drives able young people to focus solely on what matters most to their future – excellent academic qualifications. There is a need for us to address this dreadful pessimism.,10,43,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00043
2014-05-27-T-001,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"School pastoral programmes have to pay greater attention to this aspect of character development. Our children must be imbued with a strong sense of confidence about their future. They must believe that their future is co-created with their friends and how good their future is depends on how much they can complement and support each other. It is no doubt a difficult balance to strike when we subscribe to meritocracy as a society and have an entrenched belief in the value of individual diligence. But it is a balance we have to achieve, and the sooner we begin on this tough job, the better the outcome will be for all of us.",11,44,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00044

His speech, to many Singaporeans, including myself, was very inspiring. Indeed, the Government must work hand-in-hand with the people to build a better and more caring home. While the Government works towards attaining economic achievements, we must also unite as one people, young and old, to live happily and confidently together.",13,46,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00046

2014-05-27-T-001,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"Singapore is a small nation. It is a fact we cannot change. Hence, we cannot take our nation's defence for granted. To recognise the contributions of our NSmen, the Committee to Strengthen National Service has proposed a series of measures. Some residents feel that the benefits currently provided under the NS Recognition Scheme are a very powerful way of showing recognition. For many parents, their children need to have financial ability before they can marry and have children. An additional amount in their bank accounts after National Service means that they can get an apartment earlier.",17,50,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00050
2014-05-27-T-001,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"Occasionally, I will hear young men saying jokingly that girls enjoy many advantages over boys because she graduates two years earlier and will have more savings after graduation. To be honest, it is not difficult to understand their sentiments. Our children are brought up in a culture of fierce competition and they believe that hard work leads to success. When they encounter seemingly unfair situations in education and work, they cannot help but feel a bit unhappy. The proposal of the Committee is the right one. Six thousand dollars is not a small amount. However, what matters is not the number, but the message that is being conveyed, which is recognition of our NSmen and their families' contributions. It is with the support of their families that they can complete their National Service successfully, a noble duty of a male citizen towards the country.",18,51,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00051

Those who achieve Gold will receive $500; Silver $300; and those with a pass will be awarded $200. This must be a rare reward system in the world. Interestingly, I have heard of some Singaporeans who tell their sons or husbands to work harder, so that the whole family can benefit if they get the cash reward.",19,52,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00052

By doing so, not only can we get to know the views of the students but, more importantly, we can instil in them the right values. This is not to trivialise the spirit of National Service, as the contributions of our NSmen cannot be measured by money.

Some do it on an ad hoc basis whilst others are systematic, and the best ones have policies to back up their intent. Sixty percent of the rated companies re-employ older workers as a matter of norm, that is, better than ad hoc. So, whilst the survey is ongoing, I can see that such a strong labour market result goes to show the recognition by both workers and companies of the value-at-work that our older workers create.

When the details of MediShield Life are released, I think there is an important opportunity for employers, workers, unions and insurers to work together to minimise duplication of coverage, if any.

The periodic review to determine the optimal allocation among these sub-accounts, taking into account factors like the different needs of different life stages, will help determine what is optimal in the entire portfolio and help to ensure that what is put aside as one goes through life, saving up for retirement, would, in fact, be adequate, which was the core purpose of CPF in the first place.",24,108,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00108

For instance, many people may have forgotten or may not be aware that they can pledge their property, subject to conditions, for up to 50% of the Minimum Sum at age 55. And if they do so, then it lessens the need to transfer Ordinary Account savings into their Retirement Account. If the communication and administration aspects within the CPF system like these could be further enhanced, then it will certainly help to smoothen the process for many and also reduce the confusion.",25,109,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00109

We have debated issues close to the hearts of Singaporeans and many of us urged the Government to address the people's unhappiness over housing, transportation and cost of living. I am happy to note that the Government has taken decisive action. The Government ramped up its HDB building programme and, at the same time, took steps to control rising speculation in the private property market. Many young couples today have greater certainty about when they can get their HDB flat of their choice. Those aspiring to buy private property are also better placed to assess whether they can afford to do so.",2,112,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00112

It has increased its speed of transport infrastructure development, added new buses and, most recently, applied a new model to managing our bus services. These are proof that the Government is willing to do everything it reasonably can.",3,113,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00113

2014-05-27-T-001,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Opportunities for all. One of the factors that had underpinned Singapore's rapid progress as a nation is the fact that our meritocratic system allowed anyone who puts in effort to rise up. There are innumerable stories of people from humble backgrounds rising up to lead our nation – in public service, in industry and in academia. Our education system is open to all, and there are many pathways where people can take time to discover their strengths, learn to maximise their strengths, and use them to build a good livelihood for themselves. But to make opportunities open to all, we have to go beyond formal education. We have to recognise that no matter how fair and open a system is, there will always be some who do better and some who are left behind.",5,115,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00115
2014-05-27-T-001,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"But Singapore did not rise to where it is today by accepting the status quo. We have always been fighters, working against the odds, to turn the improbable into reality. That is the same spirit that we will need to apply to address some of the inequalities that exist today. The best of these opportunities that we work so hard to create – in our schools, at our workplaces – must be accessible to Singaporeans. At the same time, Singaporeans must have the fighting spirit to challenge themselves, in the face of competition from other Singaporeans, and also from foreigners. This is a fact of life, but this fact of competition should be managed such that it is a competition among those who each has a fighting chance of making it. So, I urge the Government to continually focus on providing opportunities and resources to Singaporeans, so that we can build ourselves up – through world-class education and training and continuing training – and so that we are able to stand tall among any worker anywhere in the world.",6,116,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00116

We came this far because we worked hard. And the journey ahead is not going to be easier, but, in fact, much harder. Harder because education and training become redundant more quickly because of rapid changing technologies and industries. Harder because there are cheaper and faster options elsewhere. And harder because the motivation for hard work, in an era of plenty, is lower. So, it is not time for us to rest on our laurels and think that we have arrived. Far from it. In fact, it is probably a fact that we Singaporeans will always have to work hard, to continually improve ourselves, to fight competition and to do better than others.",7,117,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00117

But this means that our attitude as workers and as employers cannot be to admit defeat at the first sign of a challenge, but, rather, to rise up to the challenge, overcome it and make a better life for ourselves and for our family.

Over a couple of years, I have observed that there has been a change in the attitudes and behaviour of some Singaporeans. By and large, we are still a gracious Asian society – respectful of our elders, welcoming of our visitors, adapting to change as best as we can. But there is also a segment of our society that is louder, more demanding and less willing to accommodate changes, especially online. These people make arguments against foreigners. But they not only make arguments, they are also stoking distrust and hatred by making allegations about foreigners, their contributions and their motives here.",16,126,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00126

There are other more bizarre allegations that are made online. It all makes for very interesting reading, but, if you ask me, it belongs in the realm of pulp fiction novel, rather than for any serious consideration. But bizarre or not, to me, the fact that so many people, even those well-educated and well-established in their careers, are willing to believe what are clearly untruths and fabrications is cause for worry. I worry that they believe this untruth because they do not believe the truth that is presented.

As such, social issues these days have never become more complicated. Singaporeans' mindsets and behaviours are visibly transforming. Singaporeans are more educated, more vocal, and, with the access to more arenas for expressions, human interactions and communications have become more messy and thorny.

It has been very good at managing its own risks but less so the risks faced by our citizens. It pegs the CPF Minimum Sum amount to inflation but does not do the same for CPF Life Annuity payouts to the elderly. It raises the CPF drawdown age which helps preserve the value of CPF balances but leaves many retirees struggling to make ends meet despite decades of contributions to CPF. Even a risk-sharing scheme like MediShield, which is supposed to be a form of social health insurance, is run more on commercial and social principles. The MediShield Fund had a capital adequacy ratio of 161% in 2012, which is more than 40% higher than what the MAS expects commercial insurance funds to hold. The loss ratio of MediShield averaged just 63% from 2001 to 2012. This means that it is collecting a lot more in premiums than it is paying out in claims.",3,138,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00138

There are negative consequences for transferring too much risk to citizens. If Singaporeans face very high uncertainties in their lives, they will be less willing to start a business or volunteer their time to serve others. Their minds will be so preoccupied with survival that they find it hard to engage in innovative, creative or compassionate thinking. Instead, they will be under tremendous stress, worrying about how to cope with the rising cost of living and the increasing responsibilities of work and family.",4,139,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00139

I am glad that in the last two-and-a-half years, there has been a shift in mindset and policy and the Government is starting to bear a larger share of the risks. The HDB says that it has delinked BTO flat prices from resale market valuations. The LTA has just announced that public bus services will undergo a nationalisation of their infrastructure and operating assets, with operations contracted out to private operators under stricter service standards. Changes are underway in healthcare to distribute more risks through universal insurance.",5,140,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00140

In Singapore, almost all Government assistance is strictly means-tested and time-bound. Most Members would have seen cases at their Meet-the-People Sessions where a struggling resident with a family to support is given a small amount in financial assistance, sometimes as little as $50 a month by the Community Development Council and has to repeatedly appeal through the Member of Parliament for it to be renewed every few months. I presume the purpose of this is to motivate such residents to work harder and reduce their reliance on Government handouts. However, in many of these cases, the resident is already working as hard as she can but her income is simply not enough to maintain her children and elderly parents while paying off utility bills, service and conservancy charges and medical expenses, just to name a few. The Government cannot expect that by making them jump through hoops to receive financial assistance, they will suddenly be able to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, especially when incomes at the lower end are not rising at a fast enough rate. Some struggling families need to be given financial assistance on a longer term basis until their circumstances change, for example, when their siblings graduate or their children graduate from school and start working.",9,144,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00144

However, these incentives should not only be focused on welfare recipients. We must be on guard against rent-seeking behaviour in our society, especially in major industries that have an impact on our economy. The Economist magazine defines rent-seeking as cutting oneself a bigger slice of the cake rather than working to make the cake bigger. In other words, trying to make more money without producing more for customers. Rent-seeking may or may not be illegal. Some examples of rent-seeking include forming cartels or lobbying for changes in regulations that benefit one's own company at the expense of customers.

We should continue to keep taxes low for income derived from engaging in value-adding activities which bring technological advancement and create good jobs for Singaporeans. This rewards hard work and incentivises productive activity and entrepreneurship. However, if there is a need to raise more revenue to make up for future Budget shortfalls, the Government should look first to increasing the Net Investment Return contributions or taxes on profits derived from economically non-productive activities.

In other words, we are here to discuss what our Singapore Dream is and what we must do to achieve it.",3,155,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00155

It has enhanced healthcare affordability through, for example, enhanced Senior's Mobility and Enabling Fund, Community Health Assist Scheme and enhanced outpatient subsidies, on top of the 3M framework. MediShield Life, which will come on line next year, is also something that is on the horizon and that is here to help Singaporeans better afford large bills.

It has and it should also pay attention to ensuring the mental well-being of our elderly through efforts to heighten awareness of age-related conditions, such as dementia, and to build social infrastructures and networks to provide high-touch care and support.

The majority of our elderly and pioneers today belong to a generation who had limited education as Singapore went through tough times. Many may also have lost their family members for various reasons and are now living alone fending for themselves. Hence, it is imperative that we help our elderly to navigate our complex and seemingly daunting healthcare system, so that they can seek the treatment they need without fear. What is the point of having these wonderful measures and packages if these beneficiaries do not know of them and, therefore, cannot benefit from them?",10,162,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00162
2014-05-27-T-001,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"In this regard, I must applaud the Government for the Pioneer Generation Package, which is highly focused on healthcare – a top concern amongst elderly Singaporeans. The generous package honours a generation who has given so much for Singapore, but who has gotten back so little in comparison. The Pioneer Generation, despite their selfless contributions to Singapore, does not have a legal claim over the benefits offered in this package. But we have a moral duty to thank them, honour them and take care of them. The package does this and signals our desire for Singapore to be a better society.",11,163,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00163

To encourage prudence, this option can be capped at, say, five times. Fiscally, the Budget should remain pretty much the same but, practically, our elderly pioneers will have an additional help resource to use in times of need.",13,165,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00165

Apart from concerns over losing physical and mental strength, there is a real concern over retirement adequacy. The CPF is our main device to ensure retirement adequacy in Singapore; it has served us well and it should continue to stay. Recent media coverage and the Minister for Manpower's blog post have explained how CPF works and why certain restrictions are necessary. I am grateful for the explanation that the Minimum Sum is necessary to ensure that Singaporeans will have enough when they retire.

I urge the Government to evaluate the feasibility of guaranteeing a higher rate of return on our CPF monies, so that it can better withstand inflation and ensure Singaporeans' CPF monies will be well above the Minimum Sum. I also urge the Government to make the rules governing the use of CPF money more flexible, so as to allow mature Singaporeans genuinely in dire straits to take care of their immediate needs, such as HDB mortgages and their children's education.",15,167,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00167

Does it mean that there will be a higher risk that some Singaporeans will not have enough in their old age?

Because of our rigorously well-designed education system, Singapore has been able to nurture generations of knowledgeable and skilled Singaporeans. Singapore has also been able to capitalise on our talented human resource to transform our nation from a Third World to First World within one lifetime.

For instance, computer science is slated to become part of England's primary school curriculum this September. The article further noted that, ""Many other places are beefing up computer-science teaching, too. Israel was an early adopter, updating its high-school syllabus a decade ago; New Zealand and some German states recently did the same.

I am not saying that teaching coding is definitely the way to go; but it is important that our education planners adopt a future-oriented attitude in curriculum development. The consequences are dire for our young if our education does not match the needs of the economy. The case of Europe is perhaps a grim warning for all of us.,23,175,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00175

There is a demand for labour in jobs requiring STEM knowledge, that is, Scientific, Technical, Engineering and Mathematical knowledge. However, many young Europeans are not educated enough in these areas and, despite having a degree, they are finding it difficult to secure a proper job.

We can invest more in those who start off further behind, and we can create more pathways and entry points for them.

We want to use the market and competition to drive innovation and novel solutions, we reduce central control in the hope that it results in better health. But there is a problem. In order for an efficient market to drive the right outcomes, we need two key factors. First, the ability of citizens to make a choice by choosing their healthcare provider. This is happening. Singaporeans are not tied to a provider by location, where they live, or by a primary care gatekeeper, like in some advanced economies. The public health insurance is truly portable across a variety of providers and, in addition, the citizen can choose to access private healthcare. This comprehensive access and mobility are a strong and important part of our system. But the second factor is based on information. In order for a market to function efficiently, the consumer, the patient, must have enough information in order to make valid comparisons.",28,214,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00214

Regulatory authorities and agencies have difficulty in assessing the professional performance of healthcare providers. Not for lack of trying, not because they are not collecting, analysing and publishing large amounts of data. It is just that this information does not truly reflect the underlying quality of the provider. Could it be that one of the reasons that healthcare costs continue to rise is because of this very significant information asymmetry, leading to inefficient market mechanisms?",30,216,2014-05-27-T-001-S-00216

It is the least bad solution to the problem of public healthcare services. Yet, should we invert the situation? Should we move to have a diffused, market-based competitive environment to drive the key human behaviours around things like diet and exercise that result in better health, and a centralised command approach to the complex acute expensive care so that inefficiencies are removed and the information asymmetry is no longer a problem?

You are asking a patient to take a substance with side effects, sometimes unpleasant side effects, in order to prevent a problem that they have not yet suffered. Right now, sitting in front of you, they feel fine. One example is hypertension, high blood pressure. Usually picked up on a health check, the patient feels completely normal. Untreated, this can lead to serious problems, perhaps even to death. You have to persuade the patients that they have to change their lifestyle, get some exercise, watch their diet, take this pill, suffer the side effects now. All to deal with something that they have not yet experienced. ""But, doc, I feel fine."" It is not easy to make those changes, to accept those trade-offs. No wonder there is a thriving industry making money persuading people that everything will be okay, just take this herb, this ""koyok"". All natural, organic even, no side effects, cures everything. People want to believe it is that easy for everything to be okay.

It would look like pretending that healthcare workers are heartless automatons, rather than deeply caring human beings who are doing their best to care for the public. Above all, it would look like ignoring the excellent health and healthcare outcomes that we, as a nation, have achieved and will continue to achieve.

2014-05-27-T-003,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Thank you, Madam. I just want to clarify a point that Dr Janil said in his speech earlier on. I never said or suggested that health insurance payouts should be more than the premiums collected. But for a social health insurance scheme which is what MediShield Life should be, the premiums collected do not need to be so much more.",1,267,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00267
2014-05-27-T-003,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"As a point of comparison, the US Affordable Care Act, the new ObamaCare, mandates a minimum loss ratio of between 80% and 85%. Ours is, on average, 63% over the last 11 years, and it was 75% in 2012. So, the US Affordable Care Act mandates that the minimum loss ratio should be between 80% and 85% and that insurers who do not spend 80%-85% of their premiums in healthcare costs must now issue rebates to consumers. And these are all commercial insurers. These are not social health insurers.",2,268,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00268

2014-05-27-T-003,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Thank you, Madam. Mr Giam brings up some very good points. And if I could take them in reverse order. Firstly, we are talking about a public social insurance and he is comparing it with a private, for-profit environment in the United States. So, I do not think his comparison is valid.",1,270,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00270
2014-05-27-T-003,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Secondly, I am loath to use the United States as the be-all and end-all for a model of where our healthcare system should evolve to. Even the policymakers and office holders in the United States would readily admit that the short-term electoral outlook significantly constrains their ability to take a long-term strategic vision for the healthcare system of their nation.",2,271,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00271
2014-05-27-T-003,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Lastly, I would like to make one point, which is  what if he is wrong? What if Mr Giam's supposition that we could increase payouts is wrong and we should compare that to what if the current situation is the wrong decision? If the current situation where, as he puts it, the payouts are far less than the premiums collected, that is the wrong decision. We save a little bit too much. If he is wrong, and we pay out more, if we pay out more and he is wrong, what is the worst case scenario? The worst case scenario is that our public healthcare financing becomes insolvent and we are unable to support the healthcare needs of a generation possibly.",3,272,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00272
2014-05-27-T-003,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"This has happened in many other countries. The intellectually honest thing to do is to compare risks versus risks, benefits versus benefits, and worst-case scenarios against worst-case scenarios – not to cherry-pick the benefits of your proposal against the potential risks of the proposal in front of you. Thank you, Madam, for your indulgence.",4,273,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00273
2014-05-27-T-003,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Madam, I am glad he made that clarification. In fact, I cited ObamaCare precisely because of the US health system and the trouble that it is in today and the fact that it is a commercial insurance scheme rather than a social insurance scheme. In fact, a social insurance scheme should have a much higher loss ratio than a commercial insurance scheme because commercial insurance wants to make money, whereas the Government is not in the business of making money. In fact, MediShield is supposed to be a not-for-profit insurance scheme.",1,274,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00274
2014-05-27-T-003,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Secondly, he asked about the grave scenario if payouts become more than the premiums collected. Now, in the case of medical insurance, it is relatively easy to be able to project what are the likely payouts to be and compared to, let us, say, earthquake insurance or something that has a much lower frequency compared to health insurance, where you are able to see the trend and the cost of medical expenses over the years and be able to project what the payouts should be.",2,275,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00275
2014-05-27-T-003,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"So, the question is  if it comes to the point where, because of the miscalculations, we aim for a 90% or 80% medical loss ratio but, for some reason, there is SARS that year or something like that happens, then we have a situation where the Government would have to step in to subsidise a bit more of the cost and the premiums can rise behind the increase in cost, not before you know that the costs are going to increase, then you raise the premiums.",3,276,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00276

2014-05-27-T-003,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Madam, because we are talking about a social public good, it is, therefore, incumbent that we take a longer term, prudent approach, past one electoral cycle. I am glad that Mr Giam feels that medical expenditure is predictable. I and my professional colleagues would completely disagree. There is a lot of uncertainty about how costs will rise.",1,278,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00278
2014-05-27-T-003,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,Myself and my brothers and sisters in the healthcare profession are part of that problem because we keep researching and coming up with all kinds of ways to spend the Health Minister's money.,2,279,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00279
2014-05-27-T-003,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Lastly, the example of SARS is a great example. It is precisely because of the prudent, conservative, risk-averse approach that we take on a day-to-day basis that when something like SARS comes along, the Government is able to step in and do what needs to be done.",3,280,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00280

2014-05-27-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In the last few years, we have reshaped our health and aged care services – adding capacity, bringing services closer to citizens and we have taken steps to make healthcare services more affordable for Singaporeans.",2,283,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00283

2014-05-27-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"To make primary care at GP clinics more affordable, we introduced the Primary Care Partnership Scheme which later became the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS). CHAS was last enhanced this year with the removal of the age criterion and the inclusion of additional chronic diseases. We are going one step further to enhance CHAS by extending it to all pioneers regardless of their income and assets, and with even better benefits.",4,285,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00285

2014-05-27-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"One major initiative in this direction is the proposed MediShield Life. MediShield has played an important role in helping Singaporeans with large medical bills. Over the years, we have improved MediShield to keep up with the changing needs of Singaporeans. We extended the maximum age of coverage because Singaporeans are now living longer. We increased the claim limits to keep pace with medical inflation and improvements in healthcare technology.",6,287,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00287
2014-05-27-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Here, I must disagree with Mr Giam that healthcare inflation is easy to estimate. It is very difficult to estimate what kind of healthcare costs we will be facing because there are many, many drivers for healthcare costs. Ageing is one aspect; development of new technology is another aspect; easier access will also drive up demand and demand will drive up costs.",7,288,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00288
2014-05-27-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Last year, we expanded MediShield to also cover congenital and neonatal conditions. With each improvement, Singaporeans are better protected.",8,289,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00289
2014-05-27-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Moving from MediShield to MediShield Life next year is a much more significant shift. It will provide stronger and lifetime protection for all of us today and our children in future. It will also reflect a stronger sense of community, because it will involve Singaporeans coming together collectively to look after one another. This is what an inclusive and caring society is about.",9,290,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00290
2014-05-27-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"MediShield Life works on the concept of risk-pooling. All of us will each contribute our share into the pool and the few among us who face large hospital bills can then draw on the pool to help pay for their bills. This way, all of us can be protected and assured.",10,291,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00291
2014-05-27-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"However, for MediShield Life to work to protect all Singaporeans, all of us need to do our part. We must contribute our share of the premiums and we must do all we can to keep healthy. And I would encourage you to adopt the eight steps promulgated by Dr Janil Puthucheary. That would help us keep healthy longer. Healthcare providers need to deliver cost-effective services and avoid driving up demand or pushing up claims which will eventually result in higher premiums in future years.",11,292,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00292

2014-05-27-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"It is, indeed, encouraging to hear that MediShield Life has received broad-based support from Singaporeans.

2014-05-27-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Many Singaporeans understand that premiums will have to go up when benefits are improved.

2014-05-27-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Forty-eight-year-old Mr Yee Kwek Chin was hospitalised for 14 days for stroke. His MediShield currently covered about $5,000 of his subsidised bill and he paid the remaining $4,800 using his Medisave. With the higher daily ward limits and lower co-insurance rates, the Committee has recommended for MediShield Life, patients like Mr Yee would need to pay only $2,500 of his bill, or half of what he has to pay today.",22,303,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00303
2014-05-27-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Currently, MediShield coverage stops when one reaches 91 years old. For those Singaporeans who are older, like Mr Yasmuddin Rasul, who is 92 years old, they will not be covered under MediShield today. With MediShield Life, there will be no age limit. Older Singaporeans will be brought into the scheme and be covered for life.",23,304,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00304
2014-05-27-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The removal of the lifetime claims limit will benefit long-term dialysis patients like Mr Hashim Abdul Rahim whom I met last week at the NKF Dialysis Centre. MediShield Life will also benefit patients like Mdm Wong Kui Lan, who is 65 years old and has no insurance coverage. She has been undergoing dialysis for about a year and suffers from high blood pressure, heart conditions and cataract. In the past year, the total subsidised bill for her hospital stays came close to $8,000. MediShield Life will protect Singaporeans like Mr Hashim and Mdm Wong in the future, reducing the amount they have to pay for their healthcare bills and relieving them of a heavy burden.",24,305,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00305
2014-05-27-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Committee has shared with me that most Singaporeans hope that the MediShield Life premiums will remain affordable and can be fully paid for with Medisave so that they do not have to fork out cash for their premiums. Some shared that they are providing for a large family, for their children as well as their elderly parents, and are worried about whether they can continue to pay for their premiums in the future. They hope that the Government will provide those in financial need with more support to pay for their premiums.",25,306,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00306
2014-05-27-T-003,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Government understands their concerns and we would provide direct help to Singaporeans in three ways. First, we will provide permanent premium subsidies for the less well-off and our pioneers. These are permanent subsidies and not one-off help. To help everyone transit from MediShield to MediShield Life, the Government will also be providing transitional support for the first few years for all Singaporeans, so that the premium increases will be phased in. Secondly, we will provide Medisave top-ups for the elderly and the low-income to help them pay for the premiums. Thirdly, for those who still cannot afford the premiums, we will provide direct financial assistance, such as through Medifund, over and above the premium subsidies.",26,307,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00307

2014-05-27-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Education is a key factor for social mobility. It is often presumed that access to education will level the playing field for students of different backgrounds, thus creating an environment where individual merits can be identified and rewarded. Indeed, it has been so for a good number of Singaporeans as our country move from Third World to First in a relatively short time.",2,328,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00328
2014-05-27-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Today, I wish to warn of dangers that can compromise our ability to achieve social mobility through education. First is the danger of education perpetuating class stratifications instead of levelling the playing field. It has been acknowledged, both by politicians and scholars, that entry into branded schools in Singapore is a reflection of parents' social class than of students' merits. Entry into the more prestigious and popular Primary schools, for example, is based strongly on factors, such as the location of the family home and parents' connections to the school.",3,329,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00329
2014-05-27-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Former Minister Mentor Mr Lee Kuan Yew had observed that admission to Primary schools is based on the social class of parents. In a Parliamentary reply in 2012, it was revealed that only 40% of the students in six of the most popular Primary schools lived in HDB flats. This contrasts greatly with 80% of all Primary school students residing in HDB flats. MOE had replied that this reflected a mix of residential housing in the vicinity of these six schools. Given the current Primary 1 admission rules, it will mean that those in the higher social classes will continue to have preferences to enter popular schools.",4,330,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00330
2014-05-27-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"A second worrying data that suggests the reproduction of class is a profile of the Public Service Commission (PSC) scholarship holders. In 2008, the PSC revealed that 47% of the PSC scholarship recipients that year lived in HDB flats and 53% lived in private housing. This is an over-representation of the private housing, as up to 85% of Singaporeans live in HDB flats.",5,331,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00331
2014-05-27-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Another set of data that also showed class stratification is the profile of students entering Universities. In response to a Parliamentary Question from Member Ms Sylvia Lim in 2008, it was revealed that students from 5-room and private housing were more likely to enter University. MOE tracked the 1990 to 1992 Primary 1 cohorts until they reached ages 22 to 24 in 2007 to ascertain levels of University participation according to household types. According to MOE, ""One out of every eight undergraduates comes from poorer families who live in 1- to 3-room flats when compared to the distribution of households of Primary 1 cohorts. Students whose parents are more successful are more likely to make it to university"".",6,332,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00332
2014-05-27-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"From the data, only 13% of those living in 1- to 3-room HDB flats made it to University although they had formed 23% of their Primary 1 cohort. In contrast, 19% of those in private housing made it to University when they formed only 12% of their Primary 1 cohort. MOE's reply stated that, ""admission to a publicly-funded university is strictly on the basis of merit. All those who qualify will have a place regardless of social economic status"".",7,333,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00333
2014-05-27-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"However, the definition of meritocracy is premised mainly on good examination results which, in turn, do not reflect structural disadvantages that working class families may face, such as not being able to afford good tuition or academic enrichment classes.",8,334,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00334
2014-05-27-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Taken together, this trend should compel us to critically examine how we can strengthen education's role as a key facilitator of social mobility. I will list a few areas for review.",9,335,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00335
2014-05-27-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"First, there are subtle trends of class stratifications within the education system. The practice of dollar-for-dollar top-up of the Child Development Account (CDA) is one such example. Here, parents who allocate more funds to their child's CDA will get more public funds than parents who cannot afford to allocate as much. This is up to $6,000 each for the first two children, $12,000 each for the third and fourth child, and $18,000 each for the fifth child and beyond. Such a practice has the effect of rewarding higher income households while withholding funds from lower-income households. The CDA is often used for preschool education courses and, therefore, gives children a leg-up.",10,336,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00336
2014-05-27-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Yesterday, I was quite alarmed to hear from the Senior Parliamentary Secretary Mr Hawazi Daipi that since 2001, only 64% of the CDA's budget allocated was actually used. No breakdown was provided by the Senior Parliamentary Secretary yesterday. But it will not be surprising to anyone that the lower-income group which should be using this scheme for their children's education are not drawing on the CDA's budget.",11,337,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00337
2014-05-27-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"I wish to propose that the funds be allocated to the CDA automatically and that the quantum be standardised to $10,000 for each child. Parents can have the option of topping up the CDA up to $10,000 for each child if they wish to, to earn higher interest offered by the CDA as a way of earmarking savings for the child's education.",12,338,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00338
2014-05-27-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Second, I repeat my concern that student-care facilities in schools should expand at a faster rate. Student care is an excellent way to help weaker students through care and coaching programmes within the schools, before and after school hours. Demand is very strong across all schools that offer such services. Even with the expansion plan by MOE, more than one third of all schools will still not have school-based student care by 2016.",13,339,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00339
2014-05-27-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"The impact is felt most strongly by young families where both parents need to work and alternative care at home or from extended families is lacking. The demand for student care mirrors the strong demand for childcare facilities that have caught the Government off-guard and from which we are ramping up the supply of places and teachers now. We need to put more attention and resources into student care right now. By reassuring parents that every school will have sufficient and affordable student care places within the school, many young parents can be more assured to have children, and the need for private tuition will be reduced.",14,340,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00340
2014-05-27-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Next, I wish to reiterate a proposal I presented several times in this House. We currently have a competitive system that relies mainly on academic results to sort out students into Secondary schools and academic streams. While MOE repeatedly stated that every school is a good school, parents know which schools and which academic streams are most desired. Secondary schools are today highly differentiated and resourced differently. This created a huge billion-dollar-a-year private tuition industry for those who could afford to seek additional help for the children to give a boost to their academic results.",15,341,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00341
2014-05-27-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"A disproportionate effort is being spent on chasing academic scores over and above other forms of academic development. I hope to see pilot neighbourhood schools that offer 10-year Integrated Programme from Primary 1 to Secondary 4, or even from kindergarten to Secondary 4. These schools will allow for holistic development of students without the distraction of high-pressured sorting and streaming examinations. It will allow students of mixed abilities to develop together in the same school throughout the 10 years in an environment that is more representative of our mix and society and real life.",16,342,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00342
2014-05-27-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),We will also need to constantly guard against developing a gap in resources between schools and between programmes. The widening income gap amongst Singaporeans has manifested itself in a variety of ways – the so-called branded or elite schools which have larger alumnus or networks may be able to offer more expensive and more comprehensive learning programmes.,17,343,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00343
2014-05-27-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"I also wish to reiterate my call for smaller class sizes, especially in Primary schools. More schools in Singapore have a class size of around 40, while Primary 1 and 2 classes have 30 students. This is large, compared to the OECD's average of 21 per class.",18,344,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00344
2014-05-27-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"MOE has consistently emphasised that teaching quality is more important than going for small class sizes. I agree that teaching quality is important. However, it does not mean that we cannot move towards having general class sizes that are smaller.",19,345,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00345
2014-05-27-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"With falling birth rates, it appears from MOE's statistics that the cohort of students in primary schools is getting smaller each year. In 2012, there were nearly 49,000 students in Primary 6 versus less than 39,000 students per level in Primary 1 and Primary 2 – a difference of 10,000 students a year.",20,346,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00346
2014-05-27-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"In contrast, the number of teachers is increasing. It has grown from under 30,000 in 2009 to 31,800 in 2012, and it is projected to grow to 33,000 by 2015. I understand some of these increases have been, and will be used by schools to decide how teachers will be flexibly deployed in specific situations, such as for learning support programmes and, sometimes, there are two teachers in a class of 40.",21,347,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00347
2014-05-27-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"The best time to do planning for smaller class sizes is now. With increasingly smaller student enrolments, we may not need a lot more teachers than what MOE had already planned for. We can start moving towards smaller class sizes, say, starting at 30 students per class from Primary 3 and 4, and then gradually moving towards that ratio for Primary 5 and 6.",22,348,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00348
2014-05-27-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"That would necessitate some redesign of physical infrastructure in schools to have more classrooms. The smaller class sizes will also allow teachers to better understand individual students, which will be essential as we move towards a more holistic character and values-based education system. It will also help make classroom management easier for teachers, who may otherwise not be able to pay attention to the weaker students.",23,349,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00349

2014-05-27-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Finally, I would like to add my thoughts on the topic of constructive politics which the President had spoken about. I am all for constructive debate in the contest of ideas, conducted with decorum. I believe that debate should be measured and not personal. At the same time, I believe there should be an environment where politics is seen to be fair and important institutions are independent, so that we can encourage the development of constructive politics.",25,351,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00351

While we generally think of someone above the age of 65 years as a ""senior"", 65 is not a magical number where our seniors instantly become ridden with disability and turn into a burden to the rest of society. True, our body functions become less than optimal as we age, but through better nutrition, education, healthcare and technology, we are already bending this curve, and, in fact, many of our seniors continue to be active, enthusiastic contributors to our society.",40,433,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00433

The mindset that many people have today is to study hard for the first one-third of our life, work hard for the next one-third, and spend the last one-third in retirement.

Cost of living was on the rise. Singapore's very open economic and geographic position, and the fact that we are not naturally blessed with rich resources, meant that there was little that could be done to curb this rise. The increasing income gap was also a serious challenge, and we had to find ways to sustainably raise wages to bridge the gap and also to deliver specific targeted assistance to the vulnerable groups. In addition, healthcare costs were on the rise. These costs, fuelled by a combination of a shortage of hospital beds and a rapidly ageing population, showed no signs of abating.",3,454,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00454

Through various platforms like the Our Singapore Conversation, in public forums, in coffee shops, on cyberspace, mainstream and social media, small groups and large groups, these issues were raised and we had robust debates in this House and outside.

There will also be more hospital beds, and healthcare costs will be alleviated by MediShield Life and, of course, the Pioneer Generation Package. There will also be a review of the CPF scheme to improve life annuity schemes.

I would add, too, that these measures to improve the lives of Singaporeans did not happen by chance. They happened because we have a Government committed to the constructive politics of proactive consultation, robust debate, and then, most importantly, translating that debate into real tangible outcomes for Singaporeans.

In his Address, the President has also emphasised several times the need to strengthen our safety nets to make sure that the vulnerable and disadvantaged Singaporeans are well cared for. I agree wholeheartedly. But this means that our social programmes, which already play a key role in our fiscal policy, will have to play an even bigger part.

2014-05-27-T-003,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"There are two points. First, each of us in this House has a duty, and I quote, ""to ensure that our social spending can be sustained, and that we have enough revenue to balance our Budget"".

More than once, the President has stressed that even as we continue to do more for the vulnerable, we must also give people the means and the incentive to help themselves, to preserve and build dignity and self-worth.

2014-05-27-T-003,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"It is also just too blase to say that the Government should just subsidise healthcare insurance premiums, as has been suggested.

2014-05-27-T-003,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"It is all too easy to spend our reserves. We all want to better the lives of the less privileged, the low income, the disadvantaged – who would not? In fact, in times of need, it can be very tempting to resort to dipping into a higher proportion of the reserves to fund our social programmes, but this, as we can see, can have a very devastating and destructive effect on the long-term good of our country. We only have to look at the recent experiences of some countries in Europe, like Greece, Portugal, Spain, Ireland. These nations are now saddled with large unsustainable debts and enormous deficits following years of popular government spending on social programmes. Dependence, or I should say over-dependence, on handouts has led to a sharp drop in productivity, loss of competitiveness in these economies which are noted for its high unemployment and high taxation rates. These countries struggle to even make ends meet and need a bailout, let alone keep their social programmes sustainable.",20,471,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00471
2014-05-27-T-003,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Closer to home, we see similar examples in Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea.

All of these countries have also seen social spending increase dramatically over the last decade with no corresponding reduction in income inequality. In fact, in some countries, that gap has widened.",21,472,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00472
2014-05-27-T-003,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"It is also not as if the greater the spend, the more effective the programme. We have many examples of well-intentioned schemes, designed by governments to benefit its population, but, instead, brought about significant liabilities for generations to come. Take the USA, which has been an example some of my fellow Members have raised. In 1965, President Johnson introduced Medicare and MedicAid. When it started, Medicare, the healthcare programme for the elderly, was a US$12 billion programme. It has since ballooned to a US$550 billion programme in 2012. The Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which manages the funds and pays the expenses on Medicare, is projected to be solvent only for the next 14 years on average, so much for being able to accurately estimate healthcare inflation. It is a dire situation, caused by spiralling costs and uncontrolled spending, and could well bring a country down.",22,473,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00473

It provides free medical services to all, no means testing. So, anyone can avail themselves of these services. It sounds like a dream proposition – free healthcare for all. But anyone who has experienced the system will tell you that it is riddled with inefficiency and in need of serious reforms. Waiting times, even for a much needed serious operation, is inordinately long, and standards of medical care are anything but consistent.

We spend what we can afford, and we never, never give in to the temptation to continually expand social entitlements on a popular basis.

All of this makes for a softer, less competitive Singapore and we will gradually be marginalised, and we cannot afford this. We all joke about the kiasu Singaporean in school or at work.

The GST Voucher Fund is an example of a permanent feature of our fiscal policy and not just a temporary offset measure. Introduced two years ago, it was recently reinforced and will be made available till 2020. This signifies the Government's assessment that the income gap will not be significantly bridged anytime soon, and, by extension, we are also likely to see progressively enhanced social policies to assist lower-income Singaporeans.",30,481,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00481

It is worth contemplating. The demographics of our population today have changed. With technology, many new forms of platforms and avenues have emerged for political and Government policy discussions among Singaporeans. Social media is one, where many Singaporeans view and participate in political discussions and issues affecting our nation. This expands the traditional engagement platforms, such as here in Parliament, face-to-face seminars and forums, Meet-the-People sessions, as well as at the coffee shops, wet markets and through our regular house visits. Social media is now an integral part of our society, making the world smaller. If used responsibly, it enhances communications but, if used irresponsibly, it will serve only to confuse and mislead. With its inevitable influence, diverse views at both ends of the spectrum will be made readily available to almost all of the populace – some factual and accurate; others, not. Politics today is not and will not be the same as it was a decade ago. However, whatever we discuss and do, we should not underestimate its impact on our people and our nation.",3,486,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00486

We must not follow the footsteps of other countries, and I quote the President, ""the hurly-burly of politics has resulted in short-term populist measures, and sometimes gridlock and paralysis"" which will weaken Singapore.",4,487,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00487

This will influence the values and behaviour of our society, especially in shaping the behavioural landscape of our future generations. Many Singaporeans, particularly parents, shared their concerns about the social discourse on the Internet. While the majority of netizens are respectful and use social media to bring goodness to our lives, there are those who use and develop platforms to showcase negative social discourse and values. One mother shared with me how her son started to change in his mannerism, the words he used, and his attitude after he frequented certain online forums and engaged in the discussions there. He was also active in sharing articles which were factually inaccurate, crafted and manipulated information to mislead and incite hatred towards certain organisations. Fortunately, the mother was able to find out, counselled her son, explained and showed him what he was doing was wrong. He repented and has changed for the better.

If used irresponsibly, it is also a powerful weapon that can weaken this country we have worked so hard to preserve and develop. This country we call our Home.

For example, in promoting road safety at MOT, I am heartened to share that I have been touched by the attitude and actions of many Singaporeans who have played a constructive role in our policy-making and implementation processes.

This plan seeks to bridge connections between different stakeholders and to ensure that healthy living becomes something that is effortless and natural.

For instance, a participant shared that, with her family's support, she managed to change the way she cooks, using healthier ingredients.

They went to HDB to ask for a loan. HDB said no, Amanda works as a freelance swimming coach, no steady income, so cannot buy HDB flat. Amanda got a steady income job since February 2013 and her monthly salary is $2,800. Besides that, she continued as a freelance coach earning another $900 and, happily, they went to see HDB. This time, HDB says no again. Why? HDB says that their bank account does not show that they are building up their savings.",25,534,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00534

But when they checked, they saw that they had already paid but then it was because I had spent it. So, not many people have that kind of savings. Since she has a steady income, her mother also has income, I think we should let them buy their HDB flat. And Amanda is not the only one.

Not all cities thrive. Some decline, while others stagnate. Poor urban planning, development and management are oftentimes the downfall of cities. Proliferation of crime, degradation of the environment and formation of slums are common sights. Singapore has been fortunate to stay on the path of sustainable growth and development but we will need to explore new ways to avoid the pitfalls and challenges of urban living.",3,595,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00595
2014-05-27-T-003,Lee Yi Shyan,The Senior Minister of State for National Development and Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yi Shyan),There is a certain urgency to do so as the urban development challenges faced by developed cities like Singapore are becoming increasingly complex and global. The complexity of our urban development challenges stems from the differing and sometimes conflicting needs and interests of our citizens. This complexity is often accentuated by the growing interconnectedness of Singapore and the rest of the world.,4,596,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00596

Consider, for instance, Google processes over 20 petabytes of data every day. If Google were to translate this data into text, it would produce enough material to fill about seven billion novels, all in one day. If we look at Facebook, its users upload almost five billion content items and click 4.5 billion ""likes"" a day. One estimate says that in 2012, a total of 2,900 exabytes – and one exabyte is equivalent to one billion gigabytes – was stored in the world. Academics have estimated that the world's information storage capacity is growing about four times faster than the world's GDP and its computational power about nine times.",5,597,2014-05-27-T-003-S-00597

Someone in that group would take a picture of an item in need of repair, briefly describe it or share its location, and then the maintenance staff in the group will promptly follow up and later on showing another picture of the repair work done. All these ""closing of loops"", so to speak, took place in hours instead of days. This informal chat group, in effect, has replaced the archaic paper-based work order system that we grew up with not so long ago. It is arguably even more convenient and efficient than the EMSU (Essential Maintenance Service Unit) system because one could attach pictures and specify its geo-location.
