2014-05-30-T-001,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"Mdm Speaker, thank you for the chance to join in this debate. President Tony Tan said in his speech that ""the best years for Singapore are ahead of us"". Indeed, Singapore has a strong foundation from which to build on. But whether or not the next generation will inherit a better Singapore depends on the choices that, we, as a Government and as a people make in the next few years. Minister Mentor Lee once said ""the future is what we make of it"".",1,6,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00006
2014-05-30-T-001,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"If we take stock of the last 50 years. Singapore has done well on the security and economics spheres. Our achievements, as a country on these fronts have been nothing short of stellar. Our key challenges now remain  (a) an ageing population; and (b) a widening income/wealth gap.",2,7,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00007
2014-05-30-T-001,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"Clearly in the next few years, the Government needs to address these issues through social programmes and redistribution policies. In doing so, it could take two different paths.",3,8,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00008
2014-05-30-T-001,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"Path One  it yields to populist demands and takes a short-term view. Singapore will lose its competitive advantage over time. Path Two  even as it introduces new social programmes and enhances existing ones; it keeps an eye on emerging trends and uncertainties, and maintains Singapore's long-term competitiveness, then I believe the future of this nation will remain bright.",4,9,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00009
2014-05-30-T-001,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"The second path, Mdm Speaker, is obviously harder to execute. It requires careful calibration and making the right trade-offs between the short term and the long term. The Government would need the support of its people to first understand the trade-offs and then to make certain sacrifices now so as to secure a brighter future.",5,10,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00010
2014-05-30-T-001,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),There are various pitfalls that other countries have faced in bringing about social programmes despite their good intent.,6,11,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00011
2014-05-30-T-001,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),Singapore will do well to avoid these pitfalls and stick to certain principles and I will highlight four of them.,7,12,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00012
2014-05-30-T-001,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"First, do not erode our work ethos. Our success as a nation so far has been the work ethos of our people. The world is changing. But I do not see a scenario where good old-fashioned work ethos becomes unnecessary for success.",8,13,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00013
2014-05-30-T-001,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"Workfare, introduced in 2008, reflects the Government's philosophy that Employment is the best form of social assistance. Workfare reinforces the values of hard work and self-reliance. In contrast, many of the advanced economies with social welfare policies have, over the years, seen large numbers of citizens on unemployment benefits with greater reliance on the Government.",9,14,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00014
2014-05-30-T-001,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"Secondly, do not burden future generations. One of the defining features of the Pioneer Generation Package (PGP) is that the Government is setting aside the entire funding required for the Package, including expected cash outflows in future years, in the current year's Budget. We need to maintain prudent fiscal policies and financial discipline to avoid the pitfalls of a populist Government, seeking to win voters today by promising subsidies that future generations have to bear.",10,15,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00015
2014-05-30-T-001,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"Thirdly, do not fuel over-consumption. The principle of co-payment especially for healthcare reduces the propensity for over-consumption. If services are fully subsidised, over-consumption will inevitably set in. In such a scenario, ""tax dollars"" will go to wasteful consumption rather than effectively defraying a patient's medical costs. There would also be knock-on effects, including a strain on infrastructure as consumption increases.",11,16,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00016
2014-05-30-T-001,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"When I was engaging residents in a dialogue on the PGP, there was a suggestion that we should make healthcare totally free for the members of the PGP. It is more elegant, it is simple, it gives peace of mind. But if we do that, then, are we really helping the members of the Pioneer Generation? Because you would increase the tendency for patients to seek a second opinion, maybe a third or a second MRI and so forth. Wasteful consumption and surge in demand may not achieve the ends that we seek.",12,17,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00017
2014-05-30-T-001,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"Fourth, do not supplant family as a first line of defence. Needy Singaporeans require holistic support; money alone is not sufficient. Family members, VWOs, neighbours and volunteers have very important roles to play. Hence, the Government has various initiatives, tax reliefs for supporting parents, higher HDB Housing Grants for living within 2 km of parents' flat and so forth. The Government can and should augment the efforts of the family but should not supplant it.",13,18,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00018
2014-05-30-T-001,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"Fifth, building social capital. Mdm Speaker, sociologist Francis Fukuyama defines social capital as ""a set of informal values and norms shared among members of a group that permits cooperation among them"". I spoke of this topic back in 2001.",14,19,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00019
2014-05-30-T-001,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"We need social capital to build cohesion amongst Singaporeans. There was a time when Singapore had very high social capital. It is called the ""Kampong Spirit"", when neighbours look out for one another and when self-abnegation rather than envy ruled the day. Can we rekindle this spirit of a closely-knit society even as we grow our economy and plug into the global economy?",15,20,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00020
2014-05-30-T-001,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"Mdm Speaker, how we make this shift and the choices we make now will determine Singapore's future. Success is transient. History is replete with examples. Empires rise and fall. Companies thrive and fail. Products gain market share and become obsolete. Even species become extinct. There is no reason why Singapore's current success will be guaranteed or everlasting. No one can underwrite our success – except ourselves. We need to work at it all the time.",16,21,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00021
2014-05-30-T-001,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"So, why does an entity fail over time? It is inward-looking. It ignores the competition. It is overly protected. It fails to anticipate and plan ahead. It is slow to adapt. It becomes a victim of its past success. It is complacent. It loses its ""grit, drive and determination"".",17,22,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00022
2014-05-30-T-001,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"Madam, if these terms sound familiar, it is because when an entity is at the top of its craft, like where Singapore is now, our guards are down. We hear noises, asking for lower growth. But it is the leaders' duty to look beyond today so as to secure Singapore's future.",18,23,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00023
2014-05-30-T-001,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"Madam, Singapore also needs a new ""Vision of the Future"" which is beginning to take shape through Our Singapore Conversation (OSC) series. Such a vision is needed to rally us and to define us as a nation and as a people.",19,24,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00024
2014-05-30-T-001,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"The President was right to say that ""the best years for Singapore is ahead of us"" but this is provided that we make the right choices and take the right path forward. We need to rally the people to take a longer-term view and a more collective view. Our people will do that if they can see the Government addressing their short-term needs. This, we must do and the Government's Addenda for each Ministry spell out how this will be done.",20,25,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00025
2014-05-30-T-001,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"Mdm Speaker, on the eve of Singapore's 50th year of Independence, I join my colleagues in honouring our pioneers who have built this city, literally with their bare hands. They made the sacrifices so that we can enjoy the Singapore that we have come to know. We honour them. Yes, through the PGP, but the best gift yet is to ""pay it forward"" – to bequeath to our children a better Singapore than the one we inherited. Mdm Speaker, I support the Motion.",21,26,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00026
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Mdm Speaker, every time I return to Singapore from an overseas trip, I would look out from the plane window to try to catch a glimpse of the familiar bright lights of the HDB flats near Changi Airport. As the plane touches down on the airport runway, somehow, I feel this sense of comfort, this sense of happiness that I am returning back to Singapore – my home.",1,27,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00027
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"It sets me thinking – what does ""Home"" mean to most Singaporeans? I acknowledge that ""Home"" probably means different things to different people.",2,28,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00028
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"For me, it is a sense of familiarity. I know that when you step out from the plane, you will encounter clean toilets, the immigration queues will be short, you will be greeted by friendly immigration officers and smiling airport staff, the baggage will come out quickly and everything works efficiently.",3,29,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00029
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"But home should be more than just an efficient system. To me, home is also a place where my family members, my relatives and all my friends are. Home is a place where you can move around safely; where the majority of Singaporeans whom you encounter speak Singlish and are honest and friendly. Where many of us have shared experiences like living in an HDB flat, have gone through a common education system, have eaten together in a hawker centre, and, for the men, have served NS and shared NS stories; home is where we can interact comfortably with people of different races and different religions. Some people have argued that they feel like strangers in their own country and some have said that they want to leave Singapore and not come back. I do not agree. It is really what a person chooses to see. There are so many things which a Singaporean can easily identify with as Home.",4,30,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00030
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Next year, Singapore celebrates its 50th year of Independence. As a nation, we have done well economically and we are the envy of many countries. Each time I meet legislators from other countries, they would compliment us on how successful Singapore is and they praise our political system.",5,31,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00031
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"But I would be the first to acknowledge that we are not a perfect nation. Sometimes, things do not work the way we hoped they will. Policies which seem well thought through are sometimes poorly communicated or poorly implemented.",6,32,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00032
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"I do not believe that we will ever have a perfect nation. But I am convinced that our Government leaders all have the heart to want to make Singapore a better country for all of us. When things do not work well, this Government will set out to put them right. When policies are wrong, this Government will work to change the policies. The Government does not shy away from making corrections mid-stream if the change will help improve Singaporeans' lives.",7,33,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00033
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Prime Minister Lee yesterday elaborated on several of the policies designed to help Singaporeans lead a better quality of life and to improve the social safety net for Singaporeans. My view is that the task of improving the lives of Singaporeans will always be ""work in progress"" as we try to find the right balance and the right trade-offs to balance the interests of different groups of Singaporeans.",8,34,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00034
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"For example, we have to look after the interests of workers who want better pay; and we have employers who want lower cost workers who are willing to work harder. We have to balance the interest of the younger generation who want to buy their first home at a cheaper price versus the existing home owners who are concerned that their homes will depreciate in value. The desire of the 55-year-old worker who wants to withdraw all his CPF funds versus younger taxpayers who are concerned that, in future, they have to bear the financial costs of looking after retired Singaporeans who have withdrawn their CPF at 55 years and, unfortunately, lost their savings due to bad investment decisions. The challenge for the Government is how to strike the right balance.",9,35,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00035
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"In the President's Address, he spoke about the Government's plans to address the concerns and aspirations of the people and to build a better future for all Singaporeans. I support the various proposals laid out by the President. In particular, allow me to speak about the need to support strong families and communities, and the need to inculcate the right character values amongst Singaporeans.",10,36,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00036
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Mdm Speaker, we live in a very competitive society and work so very hard. Frequently, we forget to pause to learn how to appreciate our lives. We forget to celebrate little successes as we strive for near perfection. We forget to give that little word of encouragement to our children or to our colleagues because we needed to rush to meet a deadline for a project or maybe finish a speech.",11,37,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00037
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"In the process, the fabric of the family is weakened as family members spend less time bonding together. We are preoccupied with work even after office hours. It is a ridiculous situation. Our smart phones should be a technological tool for us and help us to become more productive and work smarter. It has, however, become a technological burden for many of us as we are on call even after office hours.",12,38,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00038
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"So, I urge the Government to do more to encourage employers not to encroach upon the personal time of their employees. Perhaps, we can take a leaf from the French where the unions and the employers have come to an agreement to prohibit workers from replying to emails after leaving their office – sounds exciting.",13,39,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00039
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"The Civil Service, as the largest employer, can take the lead in this respect and discourage staff from replying to emails after office hours, unless very urgent. Perhaps, even encourage staff to eat with their families not just once a year, but once every month. And this is a way in which we can support strong families. I hope Members of the Cabinet are looking at this enthusiastically.",14,40,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00040
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Next, Mdm Speaker, let me speak about values. The President spoke about having values like empathy, filial piety, respect and mutual help to be part of our lives. I would like to add on other important values like kindness, gratefulness, humility, respect for one another. We should encourage everyone to reflect upon their lives daily and see whether they have performed a kind deed each day. Have they been kind to their family members or to their colleagues, or to their domestic helpers, or even to the cleaners cleaning the void deck of their HDB flats? Or have they expressed gratefulness to someone who has helped them during the week? So, I am also glad that Prime Minister Lee spoke on why we should not flaunt our wealth or position. This is the need to be humble and the need to respect others, regardless of who they are.",15,41,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00041
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Unfortunately, values cannot just be taught in schools; they must be caught. As a society, if we do nothing to promote basic character values, our future generation will suffer because many of them are hooked up to the Internet and engaged in social media. I worry each time I read some of the postings on social media. There is little civility, no efforts to be kind to others, no sense of mutual respect in some of these social media posts. Frequently, the comments are full of cynicism. Some may think it is in vogue to bash the Government or its policies. But one day, these cynical behaviour will come back to haunt us as our children who read these posts lose their sense of bearing as to what is right and what is wrong behaviour.",16,42,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00042
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"If we want Singapore to be an endearing home, we need more efforts to promote a gracious and caring society. Perhaps, we can provide more funding to the Singapore Kindness Movement. Ask them to organise more programmes to constantly promote the need to inculcate right character values to encourage graciousness and care in our everyday lives, not just amongst students, but also for adults who must lead by example and who must want to impart the right values to our younger generation. This will make Singapore a more pleasant place for all of us.",17,43,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00043
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"One area which I hope to see improvement is for the Government to do more to care and help the vulnerable and to look after the weakest living in our midst. Earlier this year, during the Committee of Supply debate, I had asked HDB to consider allowing elderly seniors who are either single, divorced or living alone to rent a 1-room rental flat. I argued that these seniors are on their own and do not have support from their spouse, ex-spouse or children.",18,44,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00044
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"So, I urge HDB to allow an exception for this small group of seniors to rent a 1-room flat by themselves. These are just flats without any room, just a living hall. We should not insist that they co-share the flat with a total stranger at their age. Whilst I understand the need to manage scarce resources, I do urge MND to allot more resources to build up more rental flats just to cater to this small group of single elderly. And indeed, we can also put in more resources to provide more housing options to divorcees with children and even to unmarried single parents who had made a mistake in their younger days. Otherwise, their children would suffer.",19,45,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00045
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Mdm Speaker, we are in a position of strength. We can set aside more resources to help the vulnerable have a better quality of life. Our society will be judged by the way in which we look after the weakest in our midst.",20,46,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00046
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Finally, allow me to speak on education. The other day, my colleague, the hon Member Mr Seah Kian Peng, suggested that PSLE is past its time. I respectfully disagree. The PSLE is a helpful tool to help schools allocate their resources to assist students achieve their best. Not all students develop at the same pace or have the same kind of aptitude towards academic studies.",21,47,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00047
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Thus, for the students who are late developers, it is important for them to be given more help to overcome some of their weaker subjects. For those who do not have an interest in academic subjects, it may be better to assess them earlier and allow them to choose a different path so that they can excel in a different manner. What is important is to ensure that there are many different upward pathways to success.",22,48,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00048
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"So, if a student does not do well in PSLE, he must not think that it is the end of the world. With hard work, he can achieve better in Secondary school. And we have many stories of students from the Normal stream who have moved on to the Polytechnic and then to University and who have achieved great success in their lives. Education should really be a training of your mind never to accept that you are a failure and to learn how to persevere. And success should never be measured only by a person's wealth, educational qualifications or social status. We must broaden our perspective to respect everyone, regardless of whether they are rich or poor.",23,49,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00049
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"There is, however, one area in our education system which I hope to see some change. Just like adults who work very hard and are very stressed, our young students in schools are also very stressed. Many parents whom I speak to ask, ""Why do we give so much work to our children, especially at Primary school level?"" Sometimes, the child is given so much homework that he has to slog late into the night just to finish the work. So, parents fear that even as they find time, they set aside time for their children, it is their children who do not have time for them anymore. Many parents feel that at a young age, it is more important for the students to pick up character values than to stress them with constant assignments, assessments and tests.",24,50,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00050
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"I am concerned that in our desire to develop our children holistically, we may inadvertently take away their childhood. Children should be allowed to explore on their own, to develop creativity in a less structured manner. In today's world, it is really more important to know how to learn rather than just accumulating knowledge. Whatever I do not know today, I would be able to find most of the answers through the Internet.",25,51,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00051
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"So, I urge MOE to relook the curriculum of the Primary and Secondary schools. Let us consider a reduction of the curriculum by 20% to 30%. Make it a policy that every school should have at least two days in a week whereby the students will have no homework to do. Whatever work the students need to do, they must finish the work within the official school hours. This will benefit not only the students who have more time at home, but it will also ease the workload of the teachers who can also spend more time with their families.",26,52,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00052
2014-05-30-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Mdm Speaker, when Singaporeans from all walks of life come together to discuss and explore different ways to build a better, brighter Singapore, we can make the Singapore Dream happen. I support the Motion.",27,53,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00053

2014-05-30-T-001,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"Madam, earlier in this debate, Minister Gan Kim Yong announced that a national conversation will be entered into over the next few months to draw up a national action plan for successful ageing. Issues in lifelong learning, employment, volunteerism, urban infrastructure, healthcare, retirement adequacy and research into ageing will all be discussed. I wish the Minister every success in this important undertaking.",1,55,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00055
2014-05-30-T-001,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"In this connection, the Minister also called for a change of mindset, and I quote, ""from worrying about the challenges that come from ageing to celebrating longevity"". This is welcomed. For my part, I would like to say again a couple of things that I had said before in this House which I believe would be useful for us to keep in mind as we embark on drawing up our national action plan for successful ageing.",2,56,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00056
2014-05-30-T-001,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"First, in addition to the challenges it presents, the ageing of our population also gives us opportunities as a nation to invest in the human capital of our senior citizens for great social returns. Investing in elderly Singaporeans will reward our society with the economic, social and cultural contributions they are able to make with our assistance. It would also enable us to be inclusive, which is the basis of community and social cohesion.",3,57,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00057
2014-05-30-T-001,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"Economic benefits can be realised from investments made to redesign jobs, workplaces, work processes or even our work culture to allow us to more fully draw on the experiences and the know-how that older workers have to offer in spite of physical bodies starting to slow down, and to allow older workers to remain as productive as or even more productive than their younger counterparts.",4,58,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00058
2014-05-30-T-001,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"The elderly are also a repository of social and cultural capital. With some investment that help keep them close to their homes, we can leverage on our elders' long-standing ties in the community to teach our children traditional wisdoms and values and share stories and lessons. Our elderly can also be employed in schools to teach subjects in Social Studies and National Education, or be encouraged to volunteer to do so.",5,59,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00059
2014-05-30-T-001,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"So, let us continue to invest in Singaporeans even as they age and become elderly. But what forms will such investments take? It is a good thing that seniors themselves will participate in the national conversation about a nation for all ages. It is a good thing that they will express preferences for different active ageing activities and lifelong learning programmes. But whatever these preferences, perhaps, we could look into providing a pillar that will help support investments by our elderly in their human capital. Just like children who need to develop and working adults who need to upgrade their skills, our elderly, too, do need support and resources to continue growing, learning and developing.",6,60,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00060
2014-05-30-T-001,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"The second pillar. Informal caregivers also make it possible for our elderly to age in place, in their homes, in the community. These are friends and family. In 2010, it was estimated that approximately 8% of Singaporean adults provide regular care to family members or friends, providing on average 6.8 hours of care in a typical way. It appears to me that an important pillar to enable success to ageing would be support we provide to our informal caregivers. It is well-documented that caregivers often suffer declines in their own financial circumstances and their mental and physical health as a result of their caregiving role.",7,61,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00061
2014-05-30-T-001,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"So, as other Members have suggested, support may take the form of leave for informal caregivers or the right to ask for flexible work arrangements or CPF top-ups. Not because we want to monetise the act of caring for their loved ones, but we need to help ease some of the financial strains that may arise from their taking on such informal caregiving arrangements. Many Members believe that providing more support to our informal caregivers is the right thing to do.",8,62,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00062

That includes the elderly workers whom we can help to participate more in our economy. When targets we set for the growth in our resident working population are not met, then I think at that time, the number of foreign workers may be increased so that we are on our path to growth as we have planned. The Workers' Party's position on this is clear.

Because by 2030, as this House has heard, there will be 900,000 Singaporeans above the age of 65. And because families are getting smaller, Mdm Speaker, we do need immigrants. And I would like Mr Chen's comment on whether he welcomes immigrants and whether he would rally the support of Singaporeans to bring about these immigrants so that they are on our side, they help us compete, they help us stabilise our society.",1,68,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00068

Of course, we have nothing against immigrants coming to Singapore. But we are talking about an orderly growth within limits. And, hopefully, we would have debated and agreed on it. And that is not inconsistent with what we have said on immigration and on foreign workers in Singapore. I would like to ask Mr Foo if that is what he had in mind by asking the question.",1,69,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00069

I have been trying to explain also to my residents why we need to do this. On the economic front, if we allow the society to age, our tax base will narrow and there is no guarantee high taxpayers, talented people, will remain in Singapore. We hope they do and we will work hard to make sure that they do but there is no guarantee of that.",1,70,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00070

But so far, we have not heard the Workers' Party, hand-in-hand, if they believe in this policy; to reach out to the people, to support immigration. And listening to Mr Chen, I am still not very clear whether the Party and himself support bringing in immigrants.",3,72,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00072

Many a time, I believe the Party's Members have repeated the position of the Workers' Party. The Workers' Party is not an anti-immigration party. We make it clear here. We are not anti-immigration. We welcome immigration which can contribute to the well-being of Singapore and to the economy of Singapore. We welcome foreign talent but ""talent"", ""real talent"", not immigrants who are taking away the jobs of Singaporeans or taking away opportunities Singaporeans could have been served. So, I think let us make it clear here. We are not anti-immigration. What we are saying is that we got to have quality immigrants.",1,75,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00075

I think it is too simple, too simplified to assume that when the immigrants come to Singapore, they would integrate with Singapore and Singaporeans, and be part of Singapore. It is not that simple. In the Population White Paper, we had debated a lot on this. We have set out the Workers' Party's position clearly.

So, I meet young working adults agonising over whether they have made the right life choices. Perhaps, some angst is not uncommon at this stage of life, more so when there are so many choices available. In a way, it is also an opportunity for reflection and self-discovery, leading to stronger resilience and life skills. But what inspires me more is that I see a strong sense of idealism and enthusiasm amongst our youths to imagine the kind of Singapore they want for their future and to go about making things better for themselves and their fellow citizens.

Many Members would know that we are starting the pilot-run of the Youth Corps this year in June. We spoke to one of the applicants, Nur Huzaima Binti Mahrom. She is 28 this year, so, perhaps, she has made it through her quarter-life crisis. She works at a copywriting firm and I quote what she told us, ""Are young people happy? Well, they are happier than the older generation of today but they are at a stage when they are still figuring out what they want to do in life and feel the pressure to do so early. They are confused but they hope for a brighter future. So, I would say it is happiness mixed up with anxiety. ""When I was young I wanted to be many things  a flight stewardess, a doctor, a teacher and a cook. My family wanted me to do engineering but I wanted to do what I love best, which is to write. Today, my work gives me joy but, beyond my job, I want to contribute to social causes. I am lucky, by some accident or fate, to be born in Singapore – healthy, young and strong. But there are many who are struggling. I feel it is my duty to do something in the world.""",4,81,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00081

She has worked with locals to run a social enterprise on the developing outskirts of Manila and she is just one of more than 250 applicants we have received for the Youth Corps, for the first run of the Youth Corps. They come from a diverse range of backgrounds – from ITE, from the Polytechnics, from University students to young working adults like her.

Compared to previous generations, today's youths have more options before them rather than moving straight to the best-paying or most stable jobs, a good number are taking some time to figure out their way in life and to discover what gives them meaning and joy.

But the youth landscape has evolved over the years and we need to keep up with the times. So, we will be embarking on a review of *SCAPE to look at the use of space, the tenant mix and to see how we can have new programmes that will be more appealing and more relevant to youths, for example, in areas like music and media.

In fact, many will have to be done through partnerships, and this will require us to forge closer ties with key youth stakeholders, including MOE and schools, as well as the many voluntary groups in the community. One important partner is Outward Bound Singapore (OBS). Currently, OBS provides customised outdoor experiential learning programmes for many school students.

Before we hasten to judge them, can we invite them to come forward, talk to us, meet with us, follow us, see what we do, work with us to strengthen the system?",11,165,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00165
2014-05-30-T-001,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Minister of State for Defence and National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),We talk a lot about mutual trust between the Government and the people.

We can do so by giving people the benefit of the doubt and engage them before we judge them.,12,166,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00166

He started out expressing his displeasure with the Government, high property prices, lack of willingness to listen, even to local issues in his estate. I shared with him my challenges, too, as his local Member of Parliament. I invited him to a tea session with residents that I have regularly, shared the various social challenges facing us and the programmes we run in the community. I invited him to be part of a local committee to engage other residents to address the issues he highlighted. I gave him the space to solutions to these issues as we engage Government agencies. The close and sincere engagement allowed us to build greater trust with each other. He is now an active volunteer in my community, encouraging more of his neighbours to join him.",13,167,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00167

In the course of engagement, even as we seek to explain and convince, we, too, must be prepared to have our own views scrutinised, challenged and, where appropriate, we are prepared to change them. This is the spirit of two-way engagement. It is how we close differences, rather than entrench them.",14,168,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00168

The best care is to ensure our young grow up in stable homes and supportive communities. From the very beginning, the PAP Government made the commitment to give every Singaporean family a home they own, one that roots them to Singapore. Our public housing programme has been touted as a world wonder, attracting many government representatives from all over to come here and to study it.",15,169,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00169

Apart from my late father's CPF savings, this property is, indeed, a store of value for my mother now. My parents are not unique. Because the PAP Government cared for Singaporeans, we worked hard to develop the economy, improve living conditions, increased the value of the public housing property owned by its citizens. I am not sure of any other governments in the world which can do this for its citizens.",16,170,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00170

I share and appreciate their concerns and some of these concerns are also expressed by their parents. With worries of longer home loan tenure and increasing home prices, they wonder if they will see huge growth in asset values and prices. Yet, we know that if it continues to grow unbounded, what will happen to housing prices in 20 years' time? These are valid concerns, even though there are no easy answers. Nevertheless, they are important ones and we will look into this as we meet the aspirations of the younger generation.",17,171,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00171

Beyond facilitating home ownership through grants and subsidies, we help them secure employment if they face challenges doing so. Once employed, we encourage them to upgrade their skills through Government-funded programmes, for them to progress to better jobs, improve their incomes and grow their savings. Home ownership is, thus, a critical enabler to build resilient families who have the security of a home and an asset to provide for a better future for their children.",18,172,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00172

I know this as, for the past eight years at MND, I have been looking at appeals for housing from various groups of Singaporeans. One group, in particular, is divorcees, who may face a pressing need to secure their next home for their children, if they cannot retain their matrimonial home and have to sell it post-divorce. Divorce is a painful process. What more when there are children involved. Women with their children are most affected as they struggle to seek employment, to rebuild their lives. Some may be able to return to their families of origin while others rely on the goodwill of friends which often do not last. To those without immediate housing options, we help them with interim housing and build an effective social support infrastructure aimed at building up their capacity to work, save and own a home again.",19,173,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00173

Sympathetic to her plight, HDB officers offered her and her two teenage children a room in Interim Rental Housing (IRH) at Bedok South. She found a job as a childcare assistant and, through sheer hard work and determination, upgraded herself and, after one year, obtained a qualification as a qualified infant care teacher.

Over the last three years, we have improved divorced parents' access to their next home and provided for their interim housing needs  those with care and control of all children below the age of 18 can apply for a subsidised flat immediately if their ex-spouse does not own one; second-timers with children below the age of 16 enjoy priority for 2- and 3-room BTO flats in non-mature estates under the programme ASSIST; and while waiting for their new flat to be completed, they can rent a Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme flat.",21,175,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00175

For example, young professionals like Mr Lim Yuan Qing, a 26-year-old researcher. He comes forward to lend a hand, every night. He comes and helps the children with their homework.

Let us go to the ground and do the job that needs to be done. Let us go to the houses of our low-income families and read to their children and support them in their education. Let us encourage the adults to upgrade themselves and gain new skills. Let us stir the passion of our young people with role models who will give them direction and clear objectives. Let us prepare our seniors so that they remain active and age gracefully.,26,180,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00180

This House is not just a repository for feedback. Its role is more important and meaningful. It is a place where action is initiated with substantial suggestions on how we can improve the lives of those in our community. This is constructive politics and this is the way we, the Malay Members of Parliament from PAP, carry out our tasks. We do not merely listen to feedback but we try to do something about that feedback because we believe firmly in one principle – the principle of upholding the integrity of our system, justice and the principle of fairness. Hence, each time we hear complaints about discrimination, we do not merely bring it up to the relevant agencies, but we take the effort try to find out the cause, if any. We have a system and agencies like TAFEP (Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices), which investigates every complaint about discrimination at work.",27,181,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00181

We do not shy away from stating this and we do not believe in affirmative action, where the minority or vulnerable groups are given special privileges based on race. Our community has dignity. We want to uphold this dignity. We do not want our community to be in a position of success just because of race or ethnicity. That is just tokenism. Definitely not.

But then, the response that I get from them generally shows that they are modest and they feel rather awkward doing so because, to them, this is just nothing special. Their principle of success is to work hard and success will come. Simply put, the key to success is to raise the status and passion of our people so that we can compete, no matter how strong the competition is.

He said, ""Oh, he is at the gym."" I said, ""Huh. That is good."" We have a gym in Clementi CC. I said, ""Your daughter?"" He said, ""My daughter is in Polytechnic."" I said, ""Wonderful."" So, his father is a construction supervisor. Education is a great social leveller. He is levelled up.",20,271,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00271

I don't think he can handle a jackhammer."" A pneumatic jack. It is very heavy. We grow up not doing this. He said, ""No way."" And I asked one of my members who was with me, who went through ITE, who had gone to ITE, who had finished National Service and now in Polytechnic. He said, ""Mr Fong, it is very different today. They have levelled up our ITE students. We go into creative, innovative jobs, leveraging technology. In fact, second nature should be developed in leveraging on technology. That is our ITE students.""",21,272,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00272

Yes, it is an honourable job, but it is a hard job and, in reality, I do not think our ITE students would volunteer and say, ""Look, I want to do that for a living"". It is a fact. So, I find that the disconnect. And if we do not have those people handling the jackhammers, where do we get them? It has to be foreign workers.",22,273,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00273

In fact, it is from Admiral William McRaven who spoke at the University of Texas, his alma mater, on SEAL training when he went back to his school. He said, ""During SEAL training, the students are broken down into boat crews. Each crew is seven students, three on each side in a small rubber boat, and one coxswain to help guide the dinghy. Every day, your boat crew forms up on the beach and is instructed to get through the surf zone and paddle several miles down the coast. In the winter, the surfs in San Diego, get to be eight to 10 feet high and it is exceedingly difficult to paddle through the plunging surf, unless everyone digs in. Every paddle must be synchronised to the stroke count of the coxswain. Everyone must exert equal effort or the boat will turn against the wave and be unceremoniously tossed back on the beach.""",24,275,2014-05-30-T-001-S-00275

You have heard how we tried to explain that we are not an anti-immigrant party. Nor, I think, can our position on immigration and foreign workers be characterised as anti-immigrant, if we are being ""constructive"" about it. The speech that I gave dealt with how we can help older workers remain employed, help them keep working if they want to and help redesign workplaces or work processes so that more of them feel more productive at work and stay more productive at work.
