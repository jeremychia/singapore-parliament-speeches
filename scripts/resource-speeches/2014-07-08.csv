2014-07-08-T-001,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong,asked	 the Minister for Manpower whether it can be made automatic for lower income CPF members with less than the Minimum Sum Cash Component at the age of 55 to continue using their CPF to service their existing housing loans without interruption after they turn 55.,1,3,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00003
2014-07-08-T-001,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,asked	 the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry can remind CPF members at age 54 years old about the impending transfer of members' monies from their Ordinary Account to the Retirement Account when they turn 55 years old; and (b) whether there are plans to increase the CPF drawdown age when the re-employment age is extended beyond 65 years old.,1,4,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00004
2014-07-08-T-001,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,"asked	 the Minister for Manpower based on current data, how many Singaporeans are expected to have insufficient money in their CPF accounts when they reach retirement and to what extent will this be affected if the CPF Minimum Sum does not increase over the next decade.",1,5,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00005
2014-07-08-T-001,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,asked	 the Minister for Manpower if his Ministry will evaluate the feasibility of guaranteeing a higher rate of return on CPF monies and of allowing more flexible use of CPF funds to finance housing and education.,1,6,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00006

2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Mdm Speaker, as there are a number of questions relating to the CPF, it would be more complete if I take Question Nos 1 to 10 together, and with your permission, if Deputy Prime Minister could continue with the rest of the Parliamentary Questions (PQs) relating to CPF. So, we will take it as an entirety before we open up for questions.",1,11,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00011
2014-07-08-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Minister, your suggestion is that you will take Question Nos 1 to 10 and then Deputy Prime Minister takes Question Nos 11 to 14, and then, followed by supplementary questions?",1,12,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00012
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,That is right.,1,13,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00013
2014-07-08-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Okay, I agree.",1,14,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00014
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, much has been discussed about the CPF in recent months and I thank Members for the opportunity to clarify. Every country is concerned about how to help its people manage when they retire. Some argue that, as individuals, we should be left to sort our own lives out but, in reality, it often does not work out that way. Almost all developed countries have some form of pension or retirement system because most people generally do not save regularly nor do they effectively plan for their own retirement.",1,15,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00015
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Most systems operate as such  you pay regularly, sort of like a tax, and you receive a stream of income when you retire that will cease when you pass away. Payouts are often regular, such as every month, to ensure that there is a regular flow of income to help sustain living needs. There is a good reason why it is not provided as a lump sum.",2,16,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00016
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"For us in Singapore, assurance in old age revolves around a few key considerations  healthcare, housing and retirement needs. The CPF is our key pillar in the social security system. It is a mandatory savings account that helps us put aside money today to cover our needs in old age. As the CPF is a defined contribution system, the full amount in your CPF account would go to your family if you pass on prematurely. Both individuals and their employers contribute their share to the scheme. It is important to remember that as part of the CPF system, employers contribute to that scheme as well. And it is also a vehicle through which we help cater to healthcare and housing needs.",3,17,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00017
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"When CPF was first introduced almost 60 years ago, members could withdraw their money at age 55 in a lump sum. That was because at that time, someone could expect to live only another six to seven years after that. That was the life expectancy then. It made sense and it was logical to be able to withdraw your CPF in a lump sum at age 55. But the world has changed. The situation is very different today where one could expect to live a further 30 years or more. Allowing a full withdrawal from CPF at age 55 today will put us at real risk of outliving our savings in old age. To blindly keep to the earlier model of full withdrawal at age 55, which made sense then, would be wrong and irresponsible.",4,18,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00018
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,This is why we introduced the Minimum Sum scheme. The policy is not a new one and has been in place for about 30 years. The idea is this  how to stream out our CPF savings every month to meet living expenses instead of having them all withdrawn in a lump sum. Neither do we require Singaporeans to set aside all our CPF savings to be streamed out in this way. Only a basic amount necessary for retirement expenses is required and you can withdraw your CPF savings above that in a lump sum. This basic or minimum amount is known as the Minimum Sum.,5,19,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00019
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,Let me clarify several issues relating to this whole concept of the Minimum Sum.,6,20,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00020
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"As we know, some are unhappy when the Minimum Sum increases for every cohort that turns 55. Some see it as a ""shifting goalpost"" that locks up more and more of their CPF savings. Others do not understand how much savings they must set aside at 55.",7,21,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00021
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,Let me explain the Minimum Sum in some detail to dispel misconceptions and myths that have surfaced in the recent public discussion.,8,22,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00022
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"First, the Minimum Sum quantum is cohort specific. Once it is set for a particular cohort, it does not change. For example, someone who turns 55 between July 2014 and June 2015 will need to set aside $155,000 as a minimum, above which he can withdraw. This is slightly higher than what a person who turned 55 last year needed to set aside, which was $148,000 and which would remain unchanged for that person who turned 55 last year. To further illustrate, for someone who turned 55 five years ago, the Minimum Sum was $117,000 and that has remained unchanged for him.",9,23,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00023
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Second, the increases to the Minimum Sum for each successive cohort over the last decade are part of a major, planned, gradual adjustment starting in 2004, to catch up with what a lower middle income household would need in retirement. This was announced a number of years back; it is part of a plan.",10,24,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00024
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"How did we arrive at $155,000 for this year's cohort? That is the amount you need to get a monthly payout of about $1,200 in 10 years' time when you reach age 65, when you begin the drawdown of your CPF savings. We estimate that is how much a lower-middle income household would spend on daily living when they enter retirement 10 years from now. One thousand two hundred dollars per month in 10 years' time is not an excessive amount – it is equivalent to only about what $1,000 would be able to fetch today.",11,25,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00025
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Some might argue that both they and their spouses work, and so if both are required to set aside the full Minimum Sum individually, then they will have the combined payout of $2,400 which is more than what they need. Well, the answer is that if they have a property – and many do have a property – then they can pledge that property to set aside only half the full Minimum Sum in cash, so that each one only needs to set aside $77,500 for retirement – half of $155,000. The combined payout of their Minimum Sums will then be a total of $1,200 per month – or just adequate for basic living expenses. And what happens if they do not have a property to pledge? In the scenario where they do not have a property, they will need to pay for rent, and so a combined payout of $2,400 may not be too generous, after all.",12,26,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00026
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Third, if you do not meet your Minimum Sum at 55, you do not need to top up the shortfall in cash nor do you need to sell your property to make up the shortfall. Let me repeat this, you do not need to top up the shortfall in cash, nor do you need to sell your property to make up the shortfall. What it means is that with a smaller amount, your monthly payout would be correspondingly less. That is all.",13,27,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00027
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Fourth, only half of the Minimum Sum needs to be set aside in cash. The savings above that amount can be used to finance housing purchases, or be withdrawn through a property pledge. This means a member turning 55 this year, for example, only needs to set aside $77,500 in cash and the rest can be withdrawn through a property pledge. Seventy seven five hundred thousand dollars will translate to a CPF LIFE payout of about $600 or so per month in retirement, which is not excessive. It is important for us to remember that. As you begin to draw down or reduce the cash component, what it means is that your monthly payout will be correspondingly less.",14,28,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00028
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"On that last point, to answer Mr Gan Thiam Poh's question, 50% of active CPF members met the Minimum Sum in 2013, including 15% who used their properties to support up to half of the CPF Minimum Sum. Members who had used their properties to support their Minimum Sum included (a) members who had less savings in their CPF and had their housing withdrawals pledged to meet the Minimum Sum, as well as (b) members who had met the Minimum Sum but pledged their property to withdraw their CPF savings above half the Minimum Sum. In general, we look at the percentage of active CPF members who meet their Minimum Sum in cash plus property because home ownership, and monetisation if that is required, contribute towards how adequately we are prepared for retirement.",15,29,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00029
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"While some members are unhappy that their CPF savings are being locked up under the Minimum Sum rules, other members have voluntarily left their CPF savings in their accounts even though they have CPF funds in excess of the Minimum Sum and can withdraw these amounts. One reason why they do so is to continue to earn the risk-free returns on their CPF savings. Mr Gan Thiam Poh would be glad to know that as at December 2013, about 20% of the entire cohort who turned 55 in 2013 had balances above the Minimum Sum that were not withdrawn.",16,30,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00030
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,I am aware that some members may find the CPF system difficult to understand because policy changes over the years mean that different rules may apply for different cohorts. This practice of grandfathering old rules for older members is precisely to minimise adjustments to those members who already passed age 55. This was necessary so as not to disrupt the plans of older members mid-way through their retirement.,17,31,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00031
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I would like to add this – it would not be responsible of this Government to leave unchanged the CPF rules for those who are younger when the situation around us has changed and quite dramatically so. Singaporeans are living longer – that is a reality. The things that retired households spend on have also risen in quality. If you look at our consumption pattern over the years, it has improved in quality. That is also a testimony to the standard of living that has risen significantly for many Singaporeans. And that is a fact. The more we postpone the needed changes, the more disruptive the changes will be when they are forced upon us in future. Many governments do not embark on these changes and reforms because they may be unpopular, but it is not the right thing to do. We believe it is our responsibility to make these changes when we can, so that when the changes are upon us in full, we are well prepared.",18,32,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00032
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"What I can assure everyone is that whenever there is a policy change, the CPF Board makes an effort to try to reach out to every affected member. At the same time, we encourage members who are unsure of the rules to also step forward to request for assistance to navigate these rules. One request I would make following many dialogues with members of the public is, to read the materials that are put forward. I realised through many dialogues and conversations, many people get agitated and very emotional, and argue on points which are actually already clarified in the materials that are put out. But many have not read them.",19,33,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00033
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"CPF is an important part of our lives. It behooves us to at least read those materials, to understand what it is and what it is not. Many are concerned about whether they will meet their Minimum Sum.",20,34,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00034
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Png Eng Huat asked about the balances that CPF members have for retirement. As I had mentioned earlier, about 50% of active members who turned 55 in 2013 achieved their Minimum Sum in cash plus property. For those who do not meet their Minimum Sum, the majority have a property that they have used their CPF savings to pay for. The reason why some of them do not meet the Minimum Sum is because we cap the amount that can be used for property at half the Minimum Sum. This means that while they may not have, in terms of cash, more than half the Minimum Sum, their property may be worth far more than half. And clearly in most cases, property would be worth more than half. But we cap it, which is why even though they may have a property worth $500,000 or $1 million, and if they have less than half the Minimum Sum in cash, they are actually considered as not meeting the Minimum Sum in technical terms.",21,35,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00035
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In addition to that, it is important to understand that even though some may not meet the Minimum Sum, they also would have spouses with higher CPF balances who can provide for them.",22,36,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00036
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Over the years, more members in each cohort reaching the age of 55 have been able to meet their cohort Minimum Sum. This is despite the Minimum Sum having increased over the years for each cohort. For younger workers, we are even more optimistic about their ability to attain the Minimum Sum. In a 2012 study, two local academics, Assoc Profs Chia Ngee Choon and Albert Tsui, estimated that about 70% to 80% of new entrants to the workforce would be able to meet the Minimum Sum for their cohort fully in cash. There are several reasons why this is so  wages have been growing and labour force participation rates have been increasing.",23,37,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00037
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Significantly, it is also because we have been making enhancements to the CPF system to help members grow their savings to meet the Minimum Sum. Mr Christopher de Souza asked what those are.",24,38,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00038
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"First, since 2008, the CPF pays an additional 1% interest on the first $60,000 of the combined balances. As a result, about two-thirds of members earn 5% interest; I repeat, 5% interest on all their balances in their Special, Medisave and Retirement Accounts. Over half of all members earn 3.5% on all their Ordinary Account savings. This – for those of you who are familiar with what you may be getting in your respective deposits – is far superior to what is earned on our bank deposits today and very comparable and far higher than many comparable financial instruments.",25,39,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00039
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Second, Singaporeans earning lower incomes also enjoy boosts to their CPF savings through Workfare.",26,40,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00040
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Third, we have also been raising CPF contribution rates for older workers to help them save more and have been working with our tripartite partners to improve employment opportunities for older workers.",27,41,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00041
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The key group that we should really be concerned about and who may have insufficient CPF balances, are our seniors; many of whom are currently in retirement. Many have low CPF balances because they grew up working in an era where lower wages in the past was a norm; before we began to be more developed and wages became rising. And also because we have more liberal withdrawal rules for CPF earlier which were calibrated then for shorter life spans. In a sense, it depleted their CPF savings.",28,42,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00042
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"However, we also know that the majority of current seniors do own their own homes and have fully paid up their housing loans. Mr Png Eng Huat asked about the average proportion of the Ordinary Account Savings used for public housing by older members. Among members who turned 55 years old over the past five years and had used CPF monies to purchase HDB flats, an average of 55% of their OA savings had been withdrawn to finance their flats at the age of 55.",29,43,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00043
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"These housing assets by and large have appreciated and in many cases, quite significant and, if needed, can be tapped on to supplement their retirement incomes. Various schemes have been introduced and we will strengthen these. For example, we have the Lease Buyback Scheme and we also have the Silver Housing Bonus. Those who take advantage of these schemes typically get enough in proceeds from the sale to top up their CPF accounts up to the Minimum Sum, with cash to spare. Our current seniors also receive additional support from the Government through measures such as the Pioneer Generation Package (PGP).",30,44,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00044
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The CPF is founded on the principle of self-reliance and work. Those who do not work and do not contribute regularly to the CPF, are naturally less likely to attain the Minimum Sum. To give you a sense of the numbers, which Mrs Lina Chiam has asked for, we know that 23% of Singaporeans who turned 55 in 2013 were inactive CPF members, while the remaining 77% were active members or self-employed. For the group of inactive members, many of whom have not worked regularly, family support will have to come in and other social safety nets are in place to provide assistance – for example, through the various ComCare schemes. We have been strengthening the social safety nets over this in recent years.",31,45,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00045
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,Ms Tin Pei Ling asked whether a more flexible use of CPF savings for housing can be allowed. Mr Seng Han Thong specifically asked whether more flexibility could be exercised for members with less than half the Minimum Sum. Ms Irene Ng asked whether it can be made automatic for these members to continue using their CPF for their housing loans without interruption.,32,46,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00046
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I understand that there are concerns about CPF members' ability to continue servicing their housing loans with CPF savings after age 55. Let me first state that in the 10 cohorts aged 55 and above, only one in 10 are still using their CPF for monthly instalments, and only one in 20 may have to meet their monthly instalments with some cash.",33,47,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00047
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"For CPF members who do face difficulties with their housing loan repayments, we have exercised flexibility where a case merits it and allowed them to use part of their Retirement Account savings for housing, even if they do not have half the Minimum Sum.",34,48,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00048
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I have shared with Members of the House that we receive an average of about 500 appeals annually from members 55 years and older who request to use more Retirement Account savings for housing. We have approved about two-thirds of these appeals. The number of such appeals – 500 a year – is not large, considering that there are more than 60,000 CPF members turning 55 every year. For cases that are not approved, we also work closely with HDB to explore alternative financing or housing options for the CPF members. And there are various steps that can be executed to assist them.",35,49,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00049
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I would like to assure Mr Seng that we are ready to exercise flexibility in the use of CPF for housing after 55 years old because we recognise that helping a member maintain a roof over his head is an important part of our overall retirement adequacy goals. To address Ms Irene Ng's point, I do not think we want to make it automatic for members. Some of these members would be able to service their housing loans using cash, instead of drawing upon their Retirement Account savings and hence compromising the monthly payout in retirement. We also do not want – and I think is important to note this – we do not want to encourage rash and imprudent housing purchases by members who think that they can automatically draw down fully on their Retirement Account funds to service their loans. You could end up with over consumption on housing as a result of that. Any member can get over-stretched.",36,50,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00050
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mr Ang Wei Neng raised a separate point on whether we can remind CPF members at age 54 about the impending transfer of members' monies from their Ordinary Account to their Retirement Account when they turn 55. Currently, CPF Board informs members two months before they turn 55 years old. Since January this year, HDB has been sending letters to households with outstanding HDB loans and with at least one HDB lessee age 50 to 54, to remind them to plan ahead for their housing payment before 55 years old. Nonetheless, I think more can be done in this area and Mr Ang's suggestion is a good one. We will look into how CPF members can be reminded to make sufficient arrangements for their housing payment in advance.",37,51,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00051
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mr Ang also asked whether the CPF Drawdown Age will be increased when the re-employment age is increased. This is an issue that we are studying carefully. The drawdown age today is 63 and will be raised to 65 years old by 2018. Whether it needs to be raised further, will depend on life expectancy and the need to maintain retirement payouts at a reasonable level. We have not reached any conclusions yet.",38,52,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00052
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"One way that we protect Singaporeans from the risk of outliving their payouts due to increasing life expectancies is through our CPF LIFE annuity scheme. Mr Png Eng Huat asked about members who opt for the CPF LIFE Standard Plan. Among the members who joined CPF LIFE upon turning 55 years old in 2013, about 70% are on the Standard Plan.",39,53,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00053
2014-07-08-T-001,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"To sum up, the CPF remains a key pillar to help Singaporeans cater for their needs in old age. There are areas that certainly can be improved, and I welcome different views and perspectives on this.

We will also put in more resources to help Singaporeans better understand the CPF system.",41,55,2014-07-08-T-001-S-00055

2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Minister Tan Chuan-Jin has explained the basic features of the CPF system, the reasons for the Minimum Sum scheme and the areas which can be improved. Dr Lee Bee Wah, Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Gerald Giam have asked further questions on whether higher returns can be paid without changing the risk-free nature of CPF accounts and how CPF funds are invested and safeguarded. They have also asked about the GIC's investment returns.",1,63,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00063
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Before I get into the details on these questions, it will be useful to provide some perspective on the challenges faced by retirement savings schemes around the world. There is a looming pensions crisis in most of the advanced countries and the challenges remain largely unresolved.",2,64,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00064
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The first challenge is financial sustainability. In many advanced countries, the ""pay-as-you-go"" social security system has become unsustainable. As more of their citizens are retiring, the pensions they have been promised are becoming unaffordable to those who have to pay for the system, in other words, the younger citizens who are working and contributing through social security taxes.",3,65,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00065
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Some of these countries have responded with politically difficult but necessary reforms, such as postponing the retirement age or cutting retirement benefits for younger workers. Most recently, the Australian government has proposed major reforms to its Age Pension scheme, which is the primary source of income for the majority of Australian pensioners today. These reforms include raising the age at which pensions can be withdrawn from 65 to 70 years old.",4,66,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00066
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"But in many cases, the severity of the problem has not been acknowledged and reforms have been postponed. In the US, for example, most public pension funds still over-estimate their future investment returns and understate their liabilities. With more realistic assumptions, it is estimated that about 85% of US public pensions will go bankrupt within the next 30 years. So, this is the first challenge – financial sustainability.",5,67,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00067
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The second challenge is to give individuals a fair return on their retirement savings but avoid exposing them to more risk than they can bear.,6,68,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00068
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"As both governments and employers face increasing difficulty in funding ""pay-as-you-go"" pension schemes, more risk is being shifted to the individual in many countries. The shift is to pension plans where the worker's savings go into his own account and he eventually draws on his own account in retirement. The 401(K) schemes in the US are an example. These schemes which are called ""defined contribution schemes"", are like the CPF, in that the eventual payouts are funded by the contributions by the worker and employer into his account, not payouts funded by future workers. But in many such schemes, unlike the CPF, the worker has to choose his own investment plan and bears the risk on his investments.",7,69,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00069
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"In theory, individuals can expect to earn higher returns over the long term by taking more risk on investments, such as investing more in equities or equity-heavy funds. In practice, there are three problems. First, the evidence from the advanced economies shows that most individuals underperform the market, even when they invest in funds rather than do their own stock-picking. Some individuals do well, but most face daunting and unfamiliar investment choices, and are swayed by sentiment. They tend to buy into the funds after gains have been made, and sell after losses. As a result, in the US, for example, individual investors in equity funds earned only one-third of what the market index earned over the last 30 years; one-third of what the S&P Index earned over the last 30 years. Fees charged by private pension funds eat into the returns earned by individuals. In Europe, this is another reason why returns on private pension funds have been low in the last decade.",8,70,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00070
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"A second risk is that you may retire when the financial markets are down. A recent article in The Economist magazine described the typical retirement scheme as a lottery, because the individuals' pot of money at the time they retire will depend on the state of the markets at the time. For example, an individual who retired just before the Global Financial Crisis will have much more income in retirement compared to an individual who retired during the crisis. One year can make a big difference.",9,71,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00071
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"A third risk is that you retire when interest rates are low. The current prolonged low-interest rate environment is in fact a major challenge in many countries, because the pot of money that you have upon retiring now gives you a smaller stream of annuity income for the rest of your years. This is the consequence of low interest rates, either the annuity becomes more expensive to buy or for the same pot of money, you get a smaller stream of income for the rest of your years.",10,72,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00072
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Many retirement schemes require or encourage members to convert their capital into an annuity or monthly payout. However, interest rates matter greatly when buying an annuity, and unlike CPF LIFE, these schemes do not provide a floor on interest rates. So, when market interest rates go down, the member has to buy an annuity that is either more expensive or he gets a smaller stream of income in retirement for the same pot of money that he has.",11,73,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00073
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Even if individuals are relieved of the requirement to buy an annuity that pays out for life, which some governments have been tempted to do, it does not solve the problem. Low market interest rates mean that retirees will receive less income even if they invest on their own in suitable retirement portfolios.",12,74,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00074
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"I have provided this background, Mdm Speaker, to explain why our CPF system has worked well and provides a strong foundation for the future. It has protected members from risk. The scheme is aimed at meeting basic retirement needs. As many members have had relatively small balances, it has been right to shield them from risk. The CPF has also avoided imposing risk on taxpayers, unlike many countries where ordinary citizens face a much larger tax burden in future, on account of under-funded social security schemes.",13,75,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00075
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The CPF is not a perfect retirement savings scheme, but it is amongst the better regarded internationally. As the Prime Minister has stated, we want to improve the CPF to provide greater security in retirement, especially for those with lower wages and to help retirees cope with inflation. We also want to give those who are ""asset-rich and cash-poor"" more convenient options to get cash from their homes.",14,76,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00076
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"But as we seek to improve the CPF or to add any flexibility, we must retain its basic strengths and avoid the huge problems seen elsewhere.",15,77,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00077
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"First, our CPF system is sustainable. There are no unfunded or sudden liabilities that will burden our children's generation.",16,78,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00078
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Second, the CPF offers some flexibility for members to withdraw savings, indeed more so than many other social security systems. In particular, by tapping on their Ordinary Account (OA) savings, the vast majority of Singaporeans have been able to own their homes and service their mortgages with little or no out-of-pocket cash, which Minister Tan has just emphasised.",17,79,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00079
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Third, while the CPF scheme does not provide the highest returns, it gives fair returns and certainly one of the safest in the world. Whilst the CPF does not provide the highest returns, it provides one of the safest in the world. These are fair returns. Few systems offer the guaranteed floors on interest rates – 3.5% of the OA and currently 5% on the SMRA (Special, Medisave and Retirement Accounts) for those with smaller balances, who comprise the majority of members. And for those with larger balances, it is 1% less. The interest rates are guaranteed by one of the few remaining triple-A rated governments in the world.",18,80,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00080
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The CPF also offers the option to members who wish to place more money in their Special Account (SA) account, so that they can earn a higher interest rate than on their OA Account and it allows them the option of taking higher risks through the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) in the hope of higher returns. So, that is the third strength – fair returns and safe returns.",19,81,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00081
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Fourth, on top of the guaranteed interest rates, the Government subsidises CPF members through the Budget in a targeted and sustainable manner. We provide significant help to lower income members to build up retirement assets, by giving them housing grants in their OA and CPF contributions through the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS). Members of the Pioneer Generation also now get top-ups for life in their Medisave accounts.",20,82,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00082
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Taken as a whole, our CPF system prepares Singaporeans well for the future. Based on current policies, a new entrant into the workforce today can expect to draw a retirement income of about two thirds of his last-drawn pay if he is a median income earner. This is around the OECD average. He gets a much higher ratio of his previous pay if he is a lower income earner, chiefly because of Government subsidies. As Minister Tan has said, our key concern is to help the current generation of older Singaporeans who have lower balances, often very low balances, due to their much lower wages in the past and the more liberal withdrawal rules then.",21,83,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00083
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Let me now address the specific questions on how CPF interest rates are determined. The current CPF interest rate structure was implemented in 2008. It was an enhancement, especially for members with smaller balances. We debated the changes in Parliament in 2007, as part of the broader package of reforms to strengthen retirement security.",22,84,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00084
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The fundamental principle is to peg CPF interest rates to returns on investments of comparable risk and duration in the market. We also structured the interest rates to provide greater benefit to members with small and medium-sized balances, by paying Extra Interest (EI) on the first $60,000 of balances.",23,85,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00085
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Let me start with the OA rate. In determining the interest rates, we have to recognise the fundamental difference in the purpose of the OA compared to the longer term SA, MA and RA, or SMRA. OA savings can be withdrawn at any time for home purchases, servicing mortgage loans, or education. It is a liquid account. The interest rate on OA has therefore been pegged to the 12-month fixed deposit and month-end savings rates of the major local banks. However, unlike market interest rates, it pays a guaranteed floor rate of 2.5%, or 3.5% for OA balances of up to $20,000. More than half of all members enjoy the full 3.5% on their OA.",24,86,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00086
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Members also have options to earn more than these OA interest rates. They can transfer OA savings to the SA so that these become long-term savings, earning higher returns. That is an option that members have. It is a useful option for those who have paid up their housing loans. Those who want to take on market risks in the hope of earning better returns can also invest part of their OA balances through the CPFIS.",25,87,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00087
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Furthermore, the CPF interest rates are not the only help that members get to build up their savings. As I had just mentioned, the Government also provides subsidies through the Budget to CPF members, targeted especially at lower and middle income members. These subsidies, in effect, amount to a significant boost to what a typical lower income member earns on his balances.",26,88,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00088
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"If we look at his OA, in particular, on top of the 3.5% interest rate on his OA, he gets Workfare payments and housing grants. When he sells his home to upgrade or downgrade later, the housing grant is returned to his OA as part of his savings for retirement. Based on current policies, these grants, amortised over his working life, will, in effect, grow his savings by at least 2.5% per year over a 30-40 years of working life. So, in effect, his savings ""earn"" 6% per annum through the combination of CPF interest rates and Government subsidies.",27,89,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00089
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"This does not include the OA savings used to purchase the housing asset, which benefits separately from appreciation in housing value. As Minister Tan explained, his home is an important retirement asset and, based on its value, he can withdraw monies from his CPF balances at age 55.",28,90,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00090
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The OECD highlighted this critical role of homeownership in its recent analysis of pension systems in the advanced countries. Homeownership ""can make a big difference for many pensioners, both reducing the need for cash and providing a way to generate income later in life.""",29,91,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00091
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked if CPF interest rates could be pegged to those on 10-year Singapore Government Securities (10Y SGS). The OA interest rate, pegged to market deposits that can be withdrawn at any time, is fair. However, for several years now, the OA has earned the floor rate of 2.5% to 3.5%, well above the market rates. It also means that the OA has in fact been earning more than what 10Y SGS earns. The average yield on 10Y SGS over the past 10 years has been 2.4% and it is currently about 2.3%. So, the floor rate of the OA at 2.5% to 3.5%, depending on the size of your balances, has in fact been higher than even the 10Y SGS.",30,92,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00092
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The SMRA, on the other hand, is pegged at 1% above the 10Y SGS, which I will now explain. The Special Account and Retirement Account are as we all know held for retirement. It is long-term savings. As Medisave (MA) balances are also mainly used as Singaporeans get older, we have treated them like the SA for purpose of determining interest rates.",31,93,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00093
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The returns on the SMRA have been enhanced over the years. When we set the new basis for SMRA rates in 2007, our aim was to peg it to the rates for similar long-term, risk-free investment. This was what the Economic Review Committee (ERC) had recommended in 2002.",32,94,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00094
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The best peg would have been a 30-year Government bond, because 30 years is the typical duration for which SMRA monies are held. However, as we had not started issuing 30-year SGS in 2007, SMRA rates were pegged to the yield on 10Y SGS plus 1%, to approximate the 30-year rate. 10Y SGS plus 1% was an approximation of what a 30-year Government bond would have paid.",33,95,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00095
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"As I told the House then, when we debated the changes to the CPF, the 1% spread on top of the 10-year Government bonds was, in fact, a little generous, as it was higher than what had been observed for 30-year bonds in international markets. However, it was fair and reasonable, giving allowance for future economic and market uncertainties, such as if inflation picks up sharply over the long term.",34,96,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00096
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Going by the formula for SMRA rates, we would be paying about 3.4% today on SMRA. This is higher than the actual yield of 3% on the 30Y SGS, which we now have but is not widely traded. So, 3.4% is what the formula would dictate for SMRA. However, we have maintained a floor of 4% on SMRA, or 5% on balances of up to $60,000. We have renewed this floor each year since 2008. Two-thirds of CPF members in fact earn the full 5% on SMRA.",35,97,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00097
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"This is a fair system of returns for the SMRA. The CPF in essence pegs SMRA returns to long-term SGS, but it has also been paying a floor of 4% to 5% that is well above market rates in the current environment. As I explained earlier, we have shielded members from the risk of low market interest rates.",36,98,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00098
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"I will next explain how CPF monies are invested, as asked by Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Gan Thiam Poh. The CPF Board invests CPF members' monies in Special Singapore Government Securities (SSGS). These are issued specially by the Government to CPF Board. They are not traded instruments.

2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The Government guarantees these SSGS bonds, so that CPF Board faces no risk of being unable to meet its obligations to its members. This is a solid guarantee, from a triple-A credit-rated Government. The triple-A credit rating reflects Singapore's very strong financial position, with the Government's assets comfortably exceeding its liabilities. Both Standard and Poor's and Moody's recently reaffirmed our triple-A credit rating, noting that our strong net asset position provides ample cushion against shocks.",38,100,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00100
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"What does the Government do with the proceeds from SSGS issuance? It pools them with the rest of the Government's funds, such as the proceeds from the tradable Singapore Government Securities (SGS), any Government surpluses as well as the proceeds from land sales which under our constitutional rules have to be accounted for as past reserves. So, the Government pools the SSGS proceeds with the rest of the Government's funds.",39,101,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00101

The GIC does not, in fact, manage SSGS monies on their own, separate from the Government's other assets. This is an important distinction, which I will come to later. GIC is the fund manager for the Government, not owner of the assets and liabilities. It seeks to achieve the Government's mandate of achieving good long-term returns, without regard to the sources of the funds that the Government places with it – for example, whether they are proceeds from SGS, SSGS or Government surpluses.",43,105,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00105

2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"But that is not the whole story. The average long-term return masks wide fluctuations in returns from year to year. You can have good average, long-term returns but what it disguises is variations which can be very significant from year to year. To answer Mr Gerald Giam's question, over the last 20 years, there were eight years where GIC's investment returns were below what the Government pays on SSGS.",45,107,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00107
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"A good example was the Global Financial Crisis. As I stated in Parliament at the time, GIC's portfolio value in US dollar terms declined by about 25% during the 14 months from October 2007. October 2007 was a peak and from then to December 2008, GIC's portfolio value declined by 25%. GIC's performance was similar to that of other funds with a similar mix of asset classes, but it illustrated the market volatilities faced by every long-term investor.",46,108,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00108
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Even over the five years following the crisis, ending 31 March 2013, GIC earned an annualised return of just 2.6% in US dollar terms, which translates into a mere 0.5% in Singapore dollar terms. GIC's Annual Report explains the reasons for this weak recovery from the crisis, especially in illiquid asset classes that it was holding, like real estate. Its five-year annualised returns are expected to improve significantly going forward.",47,109,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00109
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Hence, while the Government expects to earn returns through the GIC over the long term that exceed what it pays on SSGS and has done so in the past, there is no assurance of GIC's returns exceeding SSGS interest rates over shorter periods, much less every year. This is also because of the guaranteed floor on CPF interest rates, which do not follow declines in market interest rates.",48,110,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00110
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"How then is the Government able to meet its SSGS obligations in the years when the markets are weak and GIC's returns fall below what the Government has to pay SSGS? The reason is that the Government has a substantial buffer of net assets – net assets meaning assets in excess of liabilities – which ensures that it can meet its obligations. In years when investment returns are poor, the net assets have helped to absorb any losses and ensure that the Government can meet its obligations on the SSGS as well as its market-traded SGS. Correspondingly, when investment returns are strong, the net assets grow.",49,111,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00111
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"To address Mr Gerald Giam's further question, therefore, no extraordinary measures have been necessary to enable the Government to meet its SSGS obligations in the years when GIC's returns fall short.",50,112,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00112
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"It is this role of the Government, with its significant net assets, that ultimately allows the CPF Board and CPF members to be shielded from risk. The Government, through GIC, expects to earn good returns over the long term, but the volatility can be substantial from year to year. The Government has been absorbing that volatility and protecting CPF members.",51,113,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00113
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"This is also the reason why no market player, other than the Government, is able to take on the CPF obligations. The guarantor is not merely playing the role of a long-term investor. It also must have significant capital that provides a buffer when the markets are down.",52,114,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00114
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Our CPF system is, hence, sustainable, so long as the Government continues to run prudent budgets and invest the reserves wisely. Then the Government's balance sheet will remain strong and investment returns over the long term can continue to meet our debt costs.",53,115,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00115
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"However, the GIC's good long-term returns also reflect the fact that it is managing the Government's assets as a pool, which includes the Government's unencumbered assets – in other words, assets that are not matched by liabilities. This is a critical feature of our system. The GIC is managing Government assets as a pool, and the pool comprises not just assets that are backing the SGS and SSGS but also the Government's unencumbered assets – past Government surpluses, proceeds from land sales, which under our constitutional rules have to be accounted for in, past reserves, these are unencumbered assets – and the GIC manages the whole pool of assets as one pool. This allows the GIC to invest for the long term, including investing in riskier assets such as equities, real estate and private equity.",54,116,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00116
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"It would be quite different if the GIC, instead of managing the Government's pooled assets, were to manage a separate, standalone fund to provide backing for CPF liabilities. A standalone fund would have to be managed much more conservatively, to avoid the risk of failing to meet CPF obligations. It would not be aimed at accepting risks that enable good long-term returns, but at avoiding any short-term shortfalls. Consequently, the returns it would earn over time will be lower than what the GIC can achieve in its current role.",55,117,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00117
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Finally, I should emphasise that the investment returns in excess of the SSGS rates that the GIC expects to make as a long-term investor are not simply hoarded away in the reserves. Fifty percent of the returns from our reserves flow back to our annual Budget through the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC). This currently adds about $8 billion to our Budget annually. The NIRC has provided the Government valuable resources that have allowed us to embark on new priorities for Singapore, including enhancing our social safety nets.",56,118,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00118
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked about independent audits and other measures to safeguard CPF investments and funds. As I have explained, CPF monies are invested in SSGS that are guaranteed by the Singapore Government. The Singapore Government's guarantee is a key safeguard.",57,119,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00119
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"CPF Board, besides its own internal auditors, is externally audited by professional audit firms approved by the Auditor-General.",58,120,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00120
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"As for the Government's investments, I can assure Members that GIC is audited on a regular basis. GIC's financial statements are independently audited by the Auditor-General every year. Its audited financial statements are submitted to the President and the Council of Presidential advisors annually. The President also has full information about the size of the reserves and the performance of GIC's investments. GIC's investment performance over five, 10 and 20 years is also made public through its Annual Reports.",59,121,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00121
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"To conclude briefly, let me just reiterate that our CPF system is sound and provides a solid foundation for Singapore's future. It is not a static system. Over the years, we have adjusted the system, such as to reduce the scope for housing withdrawals and focus increasingly on retirement and medical needs in old age.",60,122,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00122
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"As the Prime Minister has said, we intend to make important future improvements to the CPF to strengthen retirement security.

2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Whatever we do to improve the system, we must provide fair returns to the ordinary member who is unable to take on much risk and ensure that the CPF remains sustainable over the long term. The Government should continue to subsidise CPF members, especially those with lower income, but these subsidies should be provided through the Budget, so as to ensure the CPF is sustainable.",62,124,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00124
2014-07-08-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I understand the need for the Minimum Sum. However, I would like to ask if Minister would consider giving Singaporeans more choices pertaining to CPF withdrawal. For example, would the Minister consider allowing Singaporeans at age 55 years to withdraw $10,000, $5,000 or zero amount? For those who choose not to withdraw any CPF money at age 55 as they know that they would not meet the Minimum Sum, would the Government reward them by way of Medisave top-up, to encourage prudence?",1,125,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00125
2014-07-08-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"For those Singaporeans who can easily meet the Minimum Sum, they are already allowed to retain more money in the CPF as mentioned by the Minister. That being the case, would the Minister consider allowing them to choose a different CPF LIFE policy that provides them with a higher monthly payout of, say, $1,500 per month?",2,126,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00126
2014-07-08-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"In short, Singaporeans like to make choices. Would the Minister consider providing Singaporeans with more CPF options?",3,127,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00127
2014-07-08-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Member for his suggestions. The issue of flexibility is really a question of choice – meeting present-day wants and addressing future needs. It is a trade-off. The more flexibility we allow, the more we deplete the CPF account. What it means is that the monthly stream-out for the individuals would be reduced. As it is, as Deputy Prime Minister Tharman has mentioned, the CPF system does afford certain level of flexibility. Many Singaporeans do draw on their CPF for housing needs. In fact, many of us draw on the CPF for our housing needs. If we did not have that flexibility to use that, we would otherwise have to rely on cash. It also allows us to address some of our medical needs and, in some limited form, our own investment schemes through the CPF Investment Scheme and some limited use for our children's education as well.",1,128,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00128
2014-07-08-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The more flexibility we allow in terms of allowing individuals to withdraw more money at the age of 55, or at the drawdown age, it would mean that it would reduce correspondingly the amount that the individual would receive on a monthly basis when the stream-outs happen. But we take on board the various perspectives shared by the Member. This is not unique. Many Members have shared this request for more flexibility. We will take a look at this. Our view is that it is important to remember that the present Minimum Sum, as is computed, is meant to provide what we believe is a basic level of requirement for a couple at a slightly lower than middle income level. I think when you reduce that further, your monthly payout would correspondingly be less.",2,129,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00129
2014-07-08-T-002,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),I thank the Minister for Manpower for his assurance that flexibility will be exercised for low-income workers caught by the CPF policy to lock up their funds in their Retirement Account at the age of 55.,1,130,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00130
2014-07-08-T-002,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),I want to echo Mr Ang's appeal for greater flexibility as we continue to see residents coming to see us at the Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS) with such problems and at their wits' end because their HDB arrears are accumulating on account of this policy.,2,131,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00131
2014-07-08-T-002,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),"I know the Minister cited that the CPF receives only 500 appeals a year from those affected, but can I ask the Minister to also look into the fact that entire households of these residents are also affected at the same time? If we multiply those affected, it would be more than 500 people.",3,132,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00132
2014-07-08-T-002,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),"Would the Minister agree that, sometimes, it takes quite a lot of ""to-ing"" and ""fro-ing"" among the relevant agencies before an appeal is approved? In the meantime, it can mean that the HDB arrears are accumulating with late payment charges. This might leave the residents in a state of uncertainty and turmoil. Can I ask the Minister, if it cannot be made automatic for their appeals to be approved, can he, at least, make it less of a hassle and ensure that meritorious appeals can be approved more speedily so that such problems do not occur and cause them greater hardship?",4,133,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00133
2014-07-08-T-002,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),"My third question is that while I appreciate the Minister's point that families should not over-extend their retirement savings with large HDB loans, can I ask the Minister whether he would agree that it may not be fruitful to preach this to the current generation of older workers with existing HDB loans to service as their ship has sailed?",5,134,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00134
2014-07-08-T-002,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),"Can I urge the Minister to carefully review the data of the HDB loan obligations of this lower income group, of those aged 50 and above, and balance that with their retirement adequacy so that the CPF policy can be tweaked and fine-tuned further to take into account their concerns?",6,135,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00135
2014-07-08-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Member for the points raised. Many of us do face similar personal examples of families who come forward with various challenges. There are many reasons for some of these individuals and their families in facing difficulties. Perhaps, it would be useful for us to consider.",1,136,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00136
2014-07-08-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,One of the points I would acknowledge is that we would endeavour – certainly between CPF and HDB – to make sure that the process is as streamlined as possible so that the help can be expeditiously provided. It is important for us to understand the ways that we can help individuals.,2,137,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00137
2014-07-08-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"One, the numbers who are caught and having difficulties paying their mortgage loans as a result of turning 55 are small. On average, we have about 500 a year. Following the appeals, we approve about two-thirds of them. We do consider their cases in quite a detailed fashion. But there are other steps that we can put in place to assist members. For example, upstream, housing counsellors in HDB branches play a very important role in providing financial counselling and proactively helping owners with mortgage arrears to tailor solutions to their circumstances. They do look at the personal circumstances of each individual family and to structure programmes to help manage their transition.",3,138,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00138
2014-07-08-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"For flat owners who are in temporary financial difficulties, HDB does work out measures, such as reducing or deferring their mortgage instalments for a period of time or working out instalment plans to repay their arrears. Many of us who are Members of Parliament in this House, we have made similar appeals to HDB as well, and we have found that that has worked out quite well.",4,139,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00139
2014-07-08-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"HDB may also, in some circumstances, advise flat owners of other options. For example, if they do have a slightly bigger flat, there is the possibility of renting out spare bedrooms for additional income to supplement them in moments of need. Or, ultimately, they can refer them to the Community Development Council for employment, financial or social assistance. In those situations where the individuals find themselves in dire financial circumstances, that is where the social safety nets kick in.",5,140,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00140

For example, in some instances, they can include their children as joint owners to help service their loan. They can also consider selling their flat, downgrading and moving to a smaller one. We have various schemes to allow individuals to monetise through the Silver Housing Bonus and Lease Buyback scheme, and, if necessary, HDB can offer them a loan to help them to do so as well.",6,141,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00141

2014-07-08-T-002,Seng Han Thong,Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio),"Supplementary questions, Madam. The first question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. CPF is a very complicated scheme and CPF is also a story that can be retold again and again. In fact, different persons read it from a different perspective. May I ask the Deputy Prime Minister for his assessment of the effectiveness of CPF's communications to its members and in what ways it can be further enhanced because not all Singaporeans have the luxury of listening to your very clear explanations here?",1,143,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00143

We have come to realise that CPF has been an institution for a very long time. As with many things, there are many policies that the Government has, and one of the things that many of us realise in our dialogues is that even we ourselves, as Members of this House, do not always pay attention to these policies until perhaps when it impacts us. For many Singaporeans, it is upon turning 55 that we begin to think about what are the policies that confront us and about the decisions we have to make.",2,146,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00146

Going forward, one of the things that we are particular about is that this system must be sustainable not because we want to shift the risk to the people or not having the Government bear the risk. By not being prudent and not keeping it sustainable, we are going to shift that risk and that burden to our children's generation.

It is very difficult to generalise because every individual has very unique circumstances – why they are in a particular situation. As I mentioned, about two-thirds of the appeals are approved. We will look at them earnestly and, if we are not able to provide a solution via the CPF route, we will endeavour to work with HDB to make sure that other options are provided.",9,153,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00153

Earlier, the Minister mentioned that when CPF started 60 years ago, we were allowed to withdraw a lump sum upon turning 55 years old and it was because life expectancy then was five to seven years beyond 55. I would like to ask whether the Minister can consider giving options, that means, working backwards. Now it is 82 years' expectancy, so five to seven years from 82, can they be given the option to withdraw their money in a lump sum, because many Singaporeans would like to see lump sums and manage their own money?",1,155,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00155
2014-07-08-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"My second question is  can the Ministry do more to educate, to talk more on property pledge, including how easy or how difficult it is to pledge their property and, after pledging, does that flat still belong to them because a lot of Singaporeans would like to own their own flat.

Basically, monies above the Minimum Sum can be withdrawn. As I had mentioned earlier, with the property pledge, for those who are turning 55 this year, for example, you can withdraw half your Minimum Sum if you pledge your property. That remains available.",1,158,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00158
2014-07-08-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Independent of whatever quantum you have in the Minimum Sum, members upon turning 55 can also withdraw $5,000. Obviously, one of the suggestions is that whatever the life expectancy age may be, say, 82, 85, we should work backwards five to seven years like the example cited earlier. Back then when the retirement age was 55, you withdraw your lump sum at 55, life expectancy was about six to seven years. People live to about 60 to 62 years old.",2,159,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00159
2014-07-08-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Assuming we work backwards from whatever the life expectancy would be at that prevailing age and, therefore, allowing members to take out lump sum, again, as I mentioned earlier, the more we allow flexibility at this stage would really deplete the amount that can be withdrawn. What we have provided in terms of the possibility of withdrawing lump sum via the property pledge and the $5,000 is something that is supported and that is provided for. We do not know how long each individual is going to live, but as a whole, individuals will live longer. The more you take out, the more you reduce that monthly payout that you will have available, and are you able to stretch that for a long period?",3,160,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00160
2014-07-08-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Secondly, I do agree with the Member that we do need to perhaps publicise more and to educate the public more on how exactly the property pledge will be made. The reason for the property pledge is that we recognise that when you come to retirement adequacy, it is not just solely dependent on the monies in your CPF account. Your Minimum Sum is one component. That is a calculation upon what we think a monthly payout reasonably would afford a couple. At the same time, the property remains an asset. As I had mentioned earlier, because of the stringent way in which we define it, half of that value, even though you may have a property worth several millions of dollars, only half of the Minimum Sum amount, which in today's terms is $77,500 will be computed as part of the Minimum Sum.",4,161,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00161
2014-07-08-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"A recognition of the property pledge is an important part of that equation. It is part of your retirement adequacy. What I would assure is that when you pledge your property, that property belongs to you. If you do need to liquidate the property in order to provide for your retirement needs, that remains possible. It is an option. You are not compelled to do so. For those with HDB flats, the options we provide – and we will be strengthening these – there will be the Silver Housing Bonus as well as the Lease Buyback Scheme.",5,162,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00162
2014-07-08-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"And lastly, with regard to the Minimum Sum for 2015 and beyond and whether the announcement of the amount will be ""akan datang""  it is a plan. As we mentioned in 2003, each year, we will have to look at what the prevailing inflation rate is. Once that is clearer, we will announce it. There is one more increment left to announce, basically for next year. We have no present plans to increase from that at the moment.",6,163,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00163
2014-07-08-T-002,Laurence Lien,Mr Laurence Lien (Nominated Member),"Madam, I would like to ask the Minister for Manpower how the Government assesses the adequacy of the Minimum Sum. I know the Minister said that it produces a stream of income of about $1,200 a month but is this sufficient for those it is targeted at? How is it working on the ground? A concern is that for those where the Minimum Sum is adequate, they do not accumulate enough to have the Minimum Sum at 55 years old. While for those who can meet the Minimum Sum, it is not adequate. So, how do you assess and consider as you move ahead and plan for future increases of the Minimum Sum?",1,164,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00164
2014-07-08-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, one of the concerns raised – which I think is a fair concern – is whether the Minimum Sum accumulated is sufficient, especially when we look at the data. For example, about 50% of active members turning 55 today and in 2030 meeting that Minimum Sum. Allow me to explain the context of this statistic and in that sense also to explain what Minimum Sum means and what it does not mean.",1,165,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00165
2014-07-08-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We adopt a fairly stringent definition of Minimum Sum attainment. We kept that portion of the Minimum Sum that can be met through the property pledge at 50% of the Minimum Sum or $77,500 for members turning 55 today. In reality, the value of the property owned by CPF members would usually far exceed $77,500 and the Minimum Sum attainment rate would be higher if the full value of members' properties is taken into account.",2,166,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00166
2014-07-08-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In addition, many Singaporeans should continue to work beyond 55. Fifty five was the retirement age when CPF first started. The retirement age today is 62. The Re-employment Age has gone up from 62 to 65 years. We are in the midst of discussing how to move up to the next milestone of 67. Singaporeans continue to work beyond 55.",3,167,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00167
2014-07-08-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"With employment rate of residents aged 55 and 64 steadily increasing – in large part also due to the tight labour market and also in terms of the employers becoming more receptive to taking on older workers who do want to work – these members will continue to receive CPF contributions as they work which will further boost their retirement adequacy by the time they start receiving CPF payouts at 65. This means that even as we look at the Minimum Sum at age 55, they continue to accumulate monies in the CPF accounts after that. Some CPF members who do not meet the Minimum Sum also do have spouses who have either CPF balances or own property and can provide for them.",4,168,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00168
2014-07-08-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Taken together, the so-called 50% figure that we have today is a conservative number. It does not take into account the full value of the property which the member owns and can rely on for retirement or for future CPF contributions from employment. Certainly, it does not mean that 50% of the cohort will be inadequately prepared for their retirement. But what we have also noted is that the Minimum Sum attainment figure has been improving in the past few years and we expect this trend to continue.",5,169,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00169
2014-07-08-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In essence, what we are saying is – the Minimum Sum is something we have assessed that for the slightly below middle income family, the monthly payout basis would meet their basic needs. Now, does it mean that individuals survive solely on the Minimum Sum itself? No. For many of us, we do have other forms of savings. Many Singaporeans own their housing, which is why housing remains a very important part of retirement adequacy. In many other countries where public housing is not provided for in the way we have provided, it takes up a very large part of their retirement, in terms of the retirement funds going into funding their housing needs.",6,170,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00170
2014-07-08-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In Singapore's context, with the various housing grants, with the various subsidies and to provide public housing for the vast majority of Singaporeans, that is one way of contributing to providing their adequacy and on top of that, that is something that individuals can draw on, should the need arise. Many Singaporeans, even though they may not meet the Minimum Sum, for example, today, many of them actually own their own properties, and they also have other alternative sources as well. For those who do have challenges, meaning that they do not meet the Minimum Sum, they do not own their properties for whatever reason – perhaps because of the low wages earned or their personal circumstances and they do have challenges – that is where the other arms of the Government step into to provide for them.",7,171,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00171
2014-07-08-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The Minimum Sum is one construct. I think it is a useful construct to at least ensure that individuals do have a monthly stream out. Those who do not meet the Minimum Sum do not need to top it up. What it means is that their monthly payout will be lesser. But if they are able to manage on that payout, supplemented by other schemes that are available, then that is not a problem. But if they do have challenges, that is where the State would come in through the social safety net to augment and to provide for their other needs.",8,172,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00172
2014-07-08-T-002,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"Madam, I have two clarifications. First, will the Government consider allowing CPF members to withdraw from CPF Retirement Account to redeem housing loan with a small loan balance, say, about $20,000 at age 55, so that the member can save on paying interest?",1,173,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00173
2014-07-08-T-002,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"I have a second clarification for the Deputy Prime Minister. He said that if the CPF monies were managed and invested as an independent pool, it would not be able to enjoy the same investment returns as GIC. I would like to know why it is so. I understand we currently have about $300 billion CPF balance. Is the pool not big enough to be able to secure the same returns and maybe better returns?",2,174,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00174
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"If I can handle Mr Low's second question first. It is a very important question and, in fact, many of my grassroots leaders and others have asked that question  why not just get GIC to manage the CPF money directly?",1,175,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00175
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"If the GIC had to manage the CPF money and ensure that we are able to meet our full obligations in CPF every year – that the capital is guaranteed, the interest rates are guaranteed and when market interest rates go down, we do not bring the CPF interest rate down but we keep it at the floor, a high floor, 3.5% on the Ordinary Account and 5% on SMRA for most accounts. If those were the obligations that were required, first, there is no private sector fund manager who will take on that task because it is very difficult to meet.",2,176,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00176
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The GIC, because it has a large diversified portfolio, aims to invest for the long term and do better than the SSGS obligations imply. However, that is only possible because the GIC is not just managing SSGS obligations. It is not just managing CPF liabilities. If it is only managing CPF liabilities or SSGS obligations, where you must meet that obligation every year, it will need a very conservative portfolio. This means a portfolio that does not invest much in equities, certainly not in real estate and alternative assets. It will aim to just minimise the chance of failing to meet annual obligations, not maximise long-term returns. That is what would happen.",3,177,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00177
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"It would not be able to aim to invest over the long term and ride out the market cycles  take big losses when the markets go down, knowing that as a long-term investor, you are the one who ultimately stands to gain. It will instead have to be conservative, avoid losses and make sure that it can meet the obligations every year. That is what would happen and it does not matter whether it is GIC or anyone else. If you are managing this unique set of obligations – guaranteed capital with high minimum interest rates – you will need a very conservative portfolio. To begin with, it will be hard to achieve, and it will be a conservative portfolio.",4,178,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00178
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"That is the reason why our real strength is that the Government has net assets, including unencumbered assets – proceeds from land sales over many years, proceeds from Government surpluses, especially in the earlier years, and the investment returns on those funds. Those give us unencumbered assets. By pooling the SSGS proceeds together with those unencumbered assets, we are able to invest for the long term and aim for higher returns over the long term that will beat the SSGS.",5,179,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00179
2014-07-08-T-002,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"But if we are only managing SSGS by itself, this would not be possible. So, basically our net assets and the strong Government balance sheet are the real strengths of the system. The Government balance sheet is taking the risk, and we can absorb that risk, protect CPF members from any risks, and retain our triple-A credit rating.",6,180,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00180
2014-07-08-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, in response to the first question raised, we have, on a case-by-case basis, allowed CPF members to use savings in their Retirement Account (RA) that originated from the Ordinary Account (OA) to meet their housing needs, should there be that need. However, this option means that their retirement savings will be depleted and should be used sparingly.",1,181,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00181
2014-07-08-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In assessing whether to allow CPF members concessionary use of more RA savings for housing, we do consider whether the member will continue, even after that assistance, to have difficulties in meeting his outstanding loan even after allowing the concession. In some of the instances when we meet residents who have those challenges, even if we make those concessions, they will continue to have problems servicing the loan thereafter.",2,182,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00182

My supplementary question is  in light of some retirement surveys about potential financial adequacy or rather inadequacy in retirement in Singapore – for example, the Aviva and Manulife surveys – is it the Minister's view that CPF is all the more an important avenue for retirement savings in Singapore? And if so, how does the Minister intend to continue using the CPF tool to enhance the retirement savings of Singaporeans?",1,186,2014-07-08-T-002-S-00186

2014-07-08-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),The first pertains to removing the Dual Criminality requirement for selected types of assistance. We have calibrated the conditions which must be fulfilled before mutual legal assistance is rendered. The current MACMA provisions impose a Dual Criminality requirement for all forms of mutual legal assistance. The proposed amendments remove the Dual Criminality requirement for those forms of mutual legal assistance which do not involve coercive forms of assistance. These are the types of assistance that neither attract penal consequences for non-compliance nor adversely affect the property rights of individuals. The Dual Criminality requirement will be retained for coercive forms of assistance.,13,212,2014-07-08-T-005-S-00212
2014-07-08-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Dual Criminality refers to a situation where the foreign offence involves conduct which, if it had occurred in Singapore, would have constituted a serious offence.

2014-07-08-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The general rationale for the Dual Criminality requirement is that a State should not use its powers to promote aims that are at odds with that State's standards of acceptable behaviour and its view of what constitutes criminal conduct. It also protects individuals against the excessive exercise of power by one State in another sovereign State and this is one of the legal safeguards built into the MACMA. Under the existing MACMA, all foreign mutual legal assistance requests that do not satisfy the Dual Criminality requirement must automatically be rejected.",15,214,2014-07-08-T-005-S-00214
2014-07-08-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The international practice of the Dual Criminality requirement varies across States. Some States adopt an approach similar to Singapore's current regime while a few have dispensed with the requirement entirely. However, most leading jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada, have moved towards a more calibrated application of the Dual Criminality requirement. In these States, the Dual Criminality requirement still applies but it is confined only to requests involving coercive forms of assistance, for example, search and seizure requests, or requests to confiscate assets. The requirement is removed for forms of assistance which do not involve the use of their enforcement powers.",16,215,2014-07-08-T-005-S-00215
2014-07-08-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The Ministry has studied the international trends and practices and we think that there is merit to this calibrated approach. For instance, if a person voluntarily consents to give evidence or provide assistance in a foreign court concerning a foreign offence even though it would not have constituted a serious offence in Singapore, that request can be considered and should not be automatically refused simply because it does not fulfil the Dual Criminality requirement. Singapore may not have any connection or interest in the case and there may be little reason for us to stand in the way of assisting in such requests. The Ministry has assessed that these forms of assistance no longer require Dual Criminality as a legal safeguard.",17,216,2014-07-08-T-005-S-00216
2014-07-08-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),The Ministry will therefore not impose the Dual Criminality requirement for types of assistance that neither attract penal consequences for non-compliance nor adversely affect the property rights of individuals.

2014-07-08-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"When Singapore designated tax evasion offences as money laundering predicate offences last year, the aim was to allow mutual legal assistance to be rendered in cases of wilful or fraudulent tax evasion. However, owing to the different types and names of taxes imposed in Singapore and overseas, there is some legal uncertainty about whether the dual criminality requirement would prevent Singapore from rendering assistance where there is clearly wilful or fraudulent tax evasion but the foreign tax evaded, for example, capital gains tax, is not a tax that is imposed in Singapore.",26,225,2014-07-08-T-005-S-00225
2014-07-08-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"This amendment seeks to remove this uncertainty by expressly lifting the Dual Criminality requirement and making clear that Singapore can render assistance for foreign requests involving tax evasion offences, regardless of the type of tax evaded.

2014-07-08-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),These changes demonstrate Singapore's commitment towards combating cross-border financial crimes and address any misperception that Singapore is a shelter for tax-illicit monies.,29,228,2014-07-08-T-005-S-00228

A standalone list of offences will be introduced into the MACMA, and this list of offences will determine whether mutual legal assistance requests may be made by Singapore, or made to Singapore by a foreign country for a coercive form of assistance where the Dual Criminality requirement is applied. This will be done by amending the definitions of ""drug trafficking offence"" and ""serious offence"".",30,229,2014-07-08-T-005-S-00229

These are drug trafficking offences or serious offences as defined in the CDSA, which are generally money laundering offences. These CDSA Schedules also determine whether the Dual Criminality requirement is satisfied since the equivalent Singapore offence must be one that is listed under those two Schedules.",31,230,2014-07-08-T-005-S-00230
2014-07-08-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The present link between MACMA and the offences in the CDSA has existed since the MACMA was enacted in 2000. The CDSA lists serious offences, but generally excludes offences that are unlikely to be linked to money laundering. An example of a serious offence not covered by the CDSA would, for example, be the offence of causing death by a rash or negligent act.",32,231,2014-07-08-T-005-S-00231
2014-07-08-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The Bill will thus de-link from the CDSA the type of offences for which mutual legal assistance requests can be made or provided. It will create a standalone list of such offences within MACMA itself. This will allow offences which are not linked to money laundering, such as selected Road Traffic Act offences, to be added to the mutual legal assistance framework. All offences listed under the First and Second Schedules of the CDSA have been imported into the MACMA while some additional offences have been added to the MACMA Schedule of ""serious offences"".",33,232,2014-07-08-T-005-S-00232

2014-07-08-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Currently, Singapore can assist in the enforcement and satisfaction of a foreign confiscation order by confiscating instrumentalities relating to drug offences only.

2014-07-08-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill. Transnational crimes pose a unique problem. Since more than one country is involved in the planning, execution or impact of the crimes and house those who mastermind or execute them, individual countries often do not have the jurisdictional reach to effectively investigate and arrest criminals. Partnerships between countries are necessary. In this regard, a key tenet of Singapore's legal infrastructure in our fight against transnational crime is the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act (MACMA).",1,240,2014-07-08-T-005-S-00240
2014-07-08-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),I support this Bill as it represents a step forward in international crime enforcement by significantly widening the scope for cooperation between Singapore and other countries.,2,241,2014-07-08-T-005-S-00241
2014-07-08-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"One clear instance of this is the Bill's removal of the general requirement of dual criminality. Back in 2006, the MACMA provisions had been amended to remove the need for a Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) treaty between Singapore and the foreign country as a pre-condition for legal assistance, so long there is an undertaking of reciprocity. Now, this Bill goes one step further. While section 20(1)(f) of the current MACMA imposes the requirement of dual criminality on every request by a foreign country for assistance in a criminal matter for coercive measures, clause 4 of this Bill deletes section 20(1)(f), and introduces the new section 20(3), which imposes the requirement for dual criminality only if the request relates to assistance in obtaining evidence, enforcement of confiscation orders, and assistance in search and seizures. Furthermore, the new sections 20(4) and (5) relax the requirement for dual criminality in the case of a request relating to foreign tax evasion, so that we can now give assistance in cases where the tax being evaded is not of a type imposed in Singapore.",3,242,2014-07-08-T-005-S-00242
2014-07-08-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"However, de facto reciprocity must continue to be a key tenet of this law. I would, therefore, like to ask the Senior Minister of State whether it is or will remain the Government's policy to exercise its discretion to offer assistance only to those countries which are likewise cooperative or receptive to our requests?",4,243,2014-07-08-T-005-S-00243
2014-07-08-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"A second instance of this Bill's facilitation of international crime enforcement is evident in its removal of the requirement of a certificate when proving a foreign drug offence. This Bill removes the certificate requirement, allows for other forms of evidence to be adduced to prove the foreign drug offence. And of course, this is sensible.",5,244,2014-07-08-T-005-S-00244
2014-07-08-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Ultimately, this Bill heavily complements the amendments proposed in the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) (Amendment) Bill, now act and goes towards further enhancing Singapore's global anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing initiatives.",6,245,2014-07-08-T-005-S-00245
2014-07-08-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I would, therefore, like to ask what steps the Ministry is taking to increase the network of countries we can cooperate with, so that those who commit crimes in our country will not be able to seek refuge elsewhere and, likewise, those who seek refuge here can be brought to justice.",7,246,2014-07-08-T-005-S-00246

2014-07-08-T-005,Fatimah Lateef,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Fourthly, Madam, in general, how does Singapore make a decision pertaining to a request? Do we consider if we have had similar assistance from that particular country before, that is, reciprocity, or have we ever encountered, or are likely to encounter, a case whereby a particular Country X has been unhelpful previously on a case and now we have to handle a case from that same country. Are we likely to decline a request if it is not in our interest to provide that assistance?",4,250,2014-07-08-T-005-S-00250

2014-07-08-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"As for how Singapore decides whether to accede to a request for mutual legal assistance, our approach has always been to be as facilitative as possible within the framework of our laws.

For example, we would decline to assist if a request is contrary to our public interest or if it could prejudice a criminal matter in Singapore. We may also decline a request if the assistance sought may prejudice the safety of any person or if it would impose an excessive burden on Singapore's resources.

2014-07-08-T-006,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"First, Government will do more. The Government has already increased healthcare spending significantly and will continue to do so. We have enhanced subsidies for outpatient and long-term care, and expanded coverage of the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) for primary care. We have expanded Medifund assistance for more long-term care services, and for primary care. Over the last 10 years, we have increased the amount of Medifund assistance three-fold – from $34 million in 2003 to $102 million in 2012. These changes have made financial assistance more readily available for Singaporeans and also strengthened the assurance that all Singaporeans, regardless of income, would receive the care that they need.",10,283,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00283

What matters, however, is not how much we spend, but how we spend it, and the outcomes we get. The key is getting the best outcome at the lowest cost possible. At 4% of GDP, we currently spend less than most other developed countries, but with good outcomes. Life expectancies are high and rising, and our infant mortality rates are among the lowest in the world. However, we are still young compared with many developed countries and we will spend more as our population ages. Medical and technological advancements coupled with expectations for the latest treatment will also increase costs.

2014-07-08-T-006,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"First, on cost-effectiveness. Co-payment imposes discipline on both providers and patients to focus on the most clinically-appropriate and cost-effective option. National insurance schemes with minimal co-payment at the point of treatment may sound alluring, but may not give the best outcomes. With minimal or no co-payment, patients are likely to consume more, or providers supply more – and more does not mean better. The costs are ultimately borne by the rest of us, in the form of higher premiums or taxes. In Germany, for example, co-payments are low but premiums are high, and employers and employees contribute up to 15.5% of their income towards the insurance fund. As Germany's population ages, not unlike Singapore today, their financing model is coming under increasing pressure. This is why co-payments remain a cornerstone of our healthcare financing framework to guard against over-consumption and over-provision.",18,291,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00291

Today, hospital bill sizes are published on MOH's website to encourage awareness and allow for comparisons. The Government will do more and work with insurers to develop a framework for sharing of information on unusually large bill sizes and study the reasons for exceptionally high claims if they observe a certain pattern of claims or behaviours by healthcare providers.",21,294,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00294
2014-07-08-T-006,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"The second hallmark of a good system is one that ensures that healthcare is accessible to all. To achieve this, we must calibrate what the patient needs to pay carefully. The very sick and the needy naturally need more help. This is why we vary subsidies depending on income, as well as the Annual Value of one's residence, as a proxy for one's means and wealth. This enables us to target subsidies at those who really need it. For those who still cannot afford their share of their bills, including those living in properties with higher Annual Value but are facing genuine financial difficulties for valid reasons, there will be additional help, such as from Medifund.",22,295,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00295

Otherwise, our children's generation will be paying for the bulk of our healthcare costs when we are old. With a growing number of elderly, our children will face an immense burden if we do not manage overall costs. We must learn from the experience of other countries. Many are coming under increasing strain as their shrinking workforce struggles to pay for the healthcare costs of an ageing population. An example is Hong Kong, where healthcare is made affordable through subsidies financed by taxes.",23,296,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00296

He incurred a bill of $8,000 after Government subsidy. By the way, this is a fairly large bill, as only an estimated four in 100 subsidised Class B2 and C bills are of this amount or higher. Under the current MediShield, this bill will exceed the claim limits, and after adding the deductible and co-insurance, Mr Tan would have to pay close to $4,700. MediShield Life's higher claim limits will fully cover the bill amount. Together with the lower co-insurance rate, Mr Tan's out-of-pocket payment will be nearly halved – he now only has to pay $2,400 of the $8,000 bill, which can be covered by Medisave.",29,302,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00302

The idea of MediShield Life goes beyond healthcare and insurance. It is, in fact, a reflection of the kind of society we want to build  a more inclusive society – where we pool our resources together to help the sick among us – and a more caring and progressive society, where those who are needy receive more help.",60,333,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00333
2014-07-08-T-006,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Indeed, MediShield Life is a bold move to strengthen collective responsibility, where everyone is chipping in to cover those with pre-existing conditions, helping the less well-off through premium subsidies and financial assistance, and risk-pooling through insurance and family support. This shift is a major and timely undertaking for Singapore.",61,334,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00334
2014-07-08-T-006,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"MediShield Life is one major plank of our strategy to improve the social safety net for Singaporeans and build a more caring and inclusive society. At the same time, we will strengthen our efforts to manage healthcare costs, so as to ensure healthcare remains affordable and sustainable in the long term. Every citizen plays an important role in this, by leading a healthy lifestyle and making healthcare decisions wisely.",62,335,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00335
2014-07-08-T-006,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"I urge the House to support the Motion. Together, we can then fulfil our desire to live long and live well, and with peace of mind. Madam, I beg to move. [Applause]",63,336,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00336

2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Mdm Speaker, we have one of the best healthcare systems in the world and we are one of the healthiest countries in the world, if not the healthiest according to recent surveys. But despite this, Singaporeans are concerned about medical costs, particularly when treatment in the hospital is required.",1,344,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00344
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Singaporeans are not alone in this regard because even in countries where medical and hospital care is by and large free, their citizens are also worried about healthcare costs. I will touch on this seemingly paradoxic observation later.",2,345,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00345
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"All of us here, I am sure, hope to be remain healthy and never see a doctor, let alone the inside of a hospital ward. Most of us strive to remain healthy, but illness is unpredictable, and the cost of treating illness is difficult to plan for. So, this is why we have hospitalisation and major illness insurance, such as MediShield, to give us peace of mind.",3,346,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00346
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"In August last year, the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health made recommendations regarding how MediShield could be improved to give better peace of mind to Singaporeans for their hospitalisation expenses.",4,347,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00347
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"We noted that after Government grants, over 90% of patients seeking subsidised care in Government hospitals had bills that could be comfortably addressed by both Medisave and MediShield, with many not requiring any upfront cash payment at all. There still remains, however, a small but significant number of patients who have difficulties with their hospital bills.",5,348,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00348
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Why is this so? When we look more closely at this group of patients, it appears that, well, they either did not have MediShield or had conditions that were not covered under their existing policies, or their bills were very large due to the complexity of their conditions and the length of their hospitalisation, such that the coverage they already had under MediShield was insufficient, and there was also not enough in their Medisave accounts to cover the deficit. We also noted that there was a very small but, still, a number of elderly patients who had dropped out of MediShield as the premiums had gone up too much for them in their older years.",6,349,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00349
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"The announcement of MediShield Life which promises more comprehensive and much improved coverage for everyone and for as long as he or she shall live, should address most of these concerns, and I warmly support it.",7,350,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00350
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"I wish at this junction to record my thanks to the MediShield Life Review Committee for their efforts towards making MediShield Life a reality. It is evident from their comprehensive report that they have taken a lot of care and time listening to ordinary Singaporeans from all walks of life, as well as to healthcare insurance professionals, and have managed to somehow synthesise these myriad suggestions and concerns into a practical package that should serve our future healthcare needs for years to come.",8,351,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00351
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Under MediShield Life, the inclusion of all Singaporeans, regardless of pre-existing medical conditions, is an exceedingly bold rule that promises to build a more equal and inclusive society.",9,352,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00352
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),It is right and proper that the Government steps in to bear the majority of the huge costs required to make this happen. And it is also right and proper that the Government provides the assurance to all Singaporeans such that the revised premiums are affordable and promises that special provisions be made to help citizens and their families who may still find difficulties with some of the payments.,10,353,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00353
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"The Pioneer Generation Package that was recently announced, provides a massive boost in this respect as our seniors face the highest potential premiums yet possess little in their Medisave accounts. Many have spent their most productive working years before the introduction of either Medisave or MediShield.",11,354,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00354
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Concerns do remain. Will the improved benefits meet the present and future needs of Singaporeans in an evolving healthcare landscape? Will this grand insurance scheme be both sufficient and sustainable, given that both advances in healthcare and demand for healthcare can be unpredictable? Will we be able to keep premiums in check and keep premiums affordable by all over the next decade or so? Will we be providing too much, too quickly and running the risk of over-consumption? And will such a generous scheme encourage greater abdication of personal responsibility for one's health?",12,355,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00355
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"I have reason to be optimistic. The 3M financing framework that has been built up over the past few decades, and as mentioned, a world-class healthcare system and a resident population whose health is world leading, provides a firm foundation for MediShield Life to remain relevant and robust for the next decade and beyond.",13,356,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00356
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"But it is prudent to be cautious and we should cast a wary eye towards the experiences of other countries that have similar national health insurance programmes, all of which had glittering starts but are increasingly mired with the same healthcare problems they were originally designed to circumvent.",14,357,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00357
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Taking one step back, some have asked  why bother with a national medical insurance at all? Why not have a social public health system where the majority of medical services are provided at minimal cost, or perhaps even free, such as in Hong Kong or in the UK?",15,358,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00358
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"There are several problems to this approach, however. First, and I think we all acknowledge it, such systems are very expensive to maintain; and second, such systems can be relatively inefficient in that emergency services are relatively well addressed, but non-emergency medical services and highly specialised care, which comprise a large proportion of hospitalisations in developed nations like ours, tend to be quite severely rationed and can be of uneven quality.",16,359,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00359
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Some of us might have read or heard of starry-eyed accounts about how someone residing in or visiting such a country had some sort of a medical emergency and was whisked in and out of a hospital having to pay just a token amount of $30, $40, or $50.",17,360,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00360
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"The flip side – and there is always a flip side – would be the many unhappy accounts by irate patients waiting lengthy periods for elective procedures by anonymous medical teams. Put it another way, if you break your leg, you are probably quite well off in such a system, but if you need your gall bladder taken out, a stone removed or hip replaced, you would probably be less enthusiastic about the options. The Canadian public care system, for example, has budget limits on elective procedures and this affects waiting times for such procedures, whereas the wait for some types of surgical treatments in Australia under the public system can be over a year in some regions.",18,361,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00361
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"What this does is that it spawns dual track systems where private medical services become increasingly in demand and can command increasingly exorbitant fees due to a lack of alternatives. This paradoxically leads to over-coverage  citizens in these countries already pay a premium in taxation to help fund these social healthcare systems, yet they feel increasingly compelled to purchase private insurance plans to obtain more choice with respect to medical treatment. You end up paying much more if you feel that having more choice and more control over your medical destiny is important to you, and many people do, in fact, feel that way.",19,362,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00362
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Following the announcement of MediShield Life with its improved coverage, many were understandably concerned about how the new premiums would turn out. Reassuringly, the Review Committee has recommended fairly moderate premium increases, and I say this because it has to be taken in the context of the slew of upgraded benefits  lifelong coverage, removal of lifetime claim limits and markedly improved co-insurance terms.",20,363,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00363
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"The announcement of both fixed and transitional subsidises by MOH has further moderated premiums quite significantly and, together with the increase in employer Medisave contributions, ensured that almost everyone will be able to service premium payments through Medisave alone.",21,364,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00364
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Despite this, it is certain that there will be some individuals and families who might still have difficulties with premiums, and I am heartened by the Minister's reassurance in this regard, that help will be available.",22,365,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00365
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"However, keeping MediShield Life sustainable and keeping premiums affordable should not depend on enduring Government subsidies. Rather, the focus should remain on keeping medical costs low and keeping everyone healthy.",23,366,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00366
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Universal and more comprehensive medical coverage, particularly in the fee-for- service system such as that found in many countries around the world, runs a very real risk of fuelling over-consumption and inappropriate use of medical services.",24,367,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00367
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"In Taiwan, they launched their National Health Insurance (NHI) programme in 1995. NHI bears many similarities to MediShield Life, such as mandatory enrolment and comprehensive lifelong cover, but it also covers outpatient care, for instance.",25,368,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00368
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"NHI began with much fanfare but four years after its inception, it started to sink into deficit, and it has been sinking rapidly ever since. In fact, two years ago, it narrowly avoided bankruptcy and with debts of very close to US$5 billion, it may not be so lucky to escape insolvency the next time round.",26,369,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00369
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"One might ask how did this happen? Well, there are many reasons for this, such as a stagnant economy and more familiar themes to us such as a rapidly ageing population with declining birth rates, but inappropriate utilisation of healthcare services figures fairly prominently as well. The Taiwanese record one of the highest per capita clinic visits in the world, but they are not significantly healthier than citizens of other nationalities. Since clinic visits and, in particular, medication costs are covered under this NHI insurance scheme, many Taiwanese would go to their nearby medical clinic just to obtain medications that one would normally purchase either from a pharmacy or a nearby supermarket. Moreover, they would also tend to see their family physicians for minor ailments, such as small aches or minor coughs and colds, whereas patients in other countries would normally choose to observe and self-medicate. Patients with such typically self-resolving problems often expect to be prescribed antibiotics even when there is no medical requirement for them to do so, or doctors feel pressured by their patients for these antibiotics to be prescribed, since failure to prescribe is viewed by patients as belittling their medical problem and as inadequate care. And if they do not do so, then the doctor gets the reputation of being a poor doctor and the patient moves to another clinic or doctor. Aside from driving up healthcare spending to unmanageable levels, this has also led to a public health crisis because Taiwan now probably has one of the highest antibiotic resistance rates in the world due to the overuse of these powerful antibiotics and new prescription guidelines do not seem to be of much help.",27,370,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00370
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Furthermore, hospitals in Taiwan have become increasingly procedure intensive. Government hospitals in Taiwan have limited federal funding, since an increasing amount of the national healthcare expenditure is being channelled to fund claims under NHI. As such, hospitals and clinics seek to generate more revenue by just increasing the number or volumes that they provide. The renal dialysis and mechanical ventilation rates, that means where doctors put a tube down into your lungs to help you breathe, are among the highest in the world although this does not seem to correlate with the calculated disease burden in that country. The point is this – and as what our Health Minister has also just pointed out – more is not always better and healthcare use should be based on rational decisions and on outcomes.",28,371,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00371
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"This leads to my next point – which is another factor that could unexpectedly and significantly increase healthcare costs – the introduction of costly new treatments and procedures. It is important that such novel treatments be rigorously validated before being approved for widespread use and reimbursement. Many countries establish expert panels that help make such decisions about the value of such treatments, such as the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) which helps decide which treatments would be allowed under the Britain's National Health Service.",29,372,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00372
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Currently, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) in Singapore grants approval for the use of drugs and medical devices. But HSA looks mainly at safety and basic efficacy. We do not yet have a central body that evaluates the true efficacy and value of medical interventions, from a best practice and cost-effectiveness perspective. I would ask MOH to consider the establishment of an independent body for this express purpose, to make recommendations concerning the sustainability of various treatments. Such an independent panel would also serve the wider objective of informing Singaporeans and deciding on the treatments that truly make a difference.",30,373,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00373
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"However, when all has been said and done, at the root of everything and the best way of restraining healthcare spending and keeping premiums low is simply for all of us to remain healthy. We have to focus on health promotion and maintenance and stay focused. MediShield provides protection mainly for catastrophic illness that requires hospitalisation and some have asked for MediShield Life to also cover more health protection services such as health screening. Though I do support the general principle, I am not sure that MediShield Life should be the key funding avenue for such services and I feel that the Government should continue to support health promotion actions through other schemes and incentives, which I know it is already pursuing today.",31,374,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00374
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"One quick word on private and integrated insurance plans. Although it was not the remit of the Review Committee to look at these plans, I do applaud their initiative in making some recommendations in this regard. This is because over 60% of Singaporeans hold such plans and they provide additional medical insurance cover for those who value greater choice and flexibility in their healthcare options.",32,375,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00375
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"There are many countries which actually encourage their citizens to take up insurance cover from private medical services by offering rebates and other incentives. This is because their philosophy is that public hospitals should just focus on emergency work, low-income patients, very complex cases, and education and training. While I do not quite support the provision of such incentives at this time given our current healthcare environment, I think it is still important that premiums for Integrated Plans, or IPs, to remain affordable, so that more Singaporeans can enjoy greater flexibility in making healthcare choices beyond the basic level of care offered by MediShield Life. I fully agree with the Committee's recommendations that such plans should be more greatly simplified and standardised and that the Government or the Ministry should take a more active role in scrutinising and regulating these plans.",33,376,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00376
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Finally, I remain concerned that the continued lack of portability of employer-provided medical benefits leads to relative over-insurance. I am sure that many in this House may have duplicate medical coverage and these are health plans provided by our employers. This coverage that is provided by our employers ceases once we change employment, and this is a source of distress and anxiety for many Singaporeans. However, according to estimates, currently, only about one in 20 employers provide portable health insurance for their employees, despite there being tax incentives to do so.",34,377,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00377
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"When MediShield Life is launched, all of us will be covered under MediShield Life but many of us will still choose to take up an Integrated Plan as mentioned before. I hope that employers, insurers and the relevant agencies can move quickly to make corporate health plans more portable, or companies can move towards strategies where employees are reimbursed for participating in their own medical insurance plans or, perhaps, even through additional Medisave contributions which can be used for the payment of MediShield Life premiums, a scheme which I note the Civil Service has already implemented for some of its employees. The Labour Movement and NTUC should also be applauded in this regard because they have long called for employers to adopt portable medical benefit schemes for their employees. Given the changes introduced by MediShield Life, I would like to join the unions to urge our employers to review and revise their current employees' medical benefits to one that is much more portable and much more flexible. Such moves would reduce the burden of premium payments for many of us due to the duplication of medical insurance policies.",35,378,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00378
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"In closing, let me just share a recent experience that I had with some of my residents. An en-bloc redevelopment programme was recently announced in Tanglin Halt, which sits in my constituency of Queenstown. It is something that many of the residents there have been asking for for many years and, although they were happy staying there, the buildings were old and needed frequent maintenance, and further major upgrading was not practical. Walking around Tanglin Halt last week, I stopped to chat with a group of seniors to see if they had any concerns. Thankfully, they said, ""Well, not much, Dr Chia, we have been waiting for this for some time and we are glad that it is finally happening."" So I asked, ""Anything else you would like? Anything I could help you with?"" To which they said, in Cantonese, ""Yut Fai, Yut Ho"", that means ""Make it faster"". And they all said, ""You know, as we are already old and we have been waiting for this for some time, we want to move into our new houses as quickly as possible!""",36,379,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00379
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Moving on, I then took the opportunity to ask them if they had heard of the Pioneer Generation Package and MediShield Life. Well, again, quite reassuringly, all of them had heard about it. And one lady in her 70s, well and truly one of our Pioneer Generation Singaporeans, immediately pepped up, tightened and said, ""We want the same for MediShield Life, Dr Chia. Make it as fast as possible. Yut Fai, Yut Ho"", and the reason was so that all of them could feel calmer ""Onn Sum"", which, in Cantonese, is to be calm in their hearts about this.",37,380,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00380
2014-07-08-T-006,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"So, on behalf of these residents of mine and from my perspective as well, I do support this Motion very strongly, and hope that MediShield Life be implemented as soon as possible, so that from cradle to grave, Singaporeans can have the assurance that they will have little to worry about hospitalisation expenses. Health insurance for all and for life is yet another major step towards building a truly inclusive Singapore.",38,381,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00381
2014-07-08-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Mdm Speaker, I rise to support the Motion. Madam, I believe the MediShield Life Review Committee has considered and done its best in addressing a wide range of issues that concern Singaporeans and has produced a comprehensive report with many good recommendations for MediShield Life. In my speech, I will share why I support MediShield Life, why I believe the report forms a good basis for the design and implementation of MediShield Life, and also raise a few questions that I hope MOH can address.",1,382,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00382
2014-07-08-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"In principle, our health is ours and each of us has the responsibility of taking care of ourselves. However, we know in reality that relying on ourselves alone may not be sufficient, as healthcare expenses can be costly and not everyone has high earning power. Moreover, some Singaporeans may be more unfortunate to be hit by serious illnesses or chronic conditions, requiring long-term and expensive treatments. Hence, there is a need for additional support from other sources.",2,383,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00383
2014-07-08-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Different countries adopt different ways of tackling this issue. Some completely socialise this cost and fund healthcare through taxes. But this can lead to escalating and potentially unsustainable, public healthcare expenditures. In some developed economies, public healthcare expenditure is one of the most costly fiscal items each year and, hence, a top government headache. Others do it through insurance  collecting premiums from everyone, pooling the funds collected and then allocating the money to purchase health services as required by the population. But such systems work only when everyone contributes, regardless of whether they think they will need to tap on the common pool now. This requires a strong sense of solidarity as a nation and the willingness to help our fellow countrymen.",3,384,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00384
2014-07-08-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"In Singapore, we are not immune to this challenge, as very eloquently articulated by my colleague Dr Chia Shi-Lu. In response, we have developed the 3M system – firstly, the Medisave, which is our money and we use it to co-pay for our own medical expenses; second, MediShield, which is everyone's money that we pool together to help one another to afford high medical bills when we suffer severe illnesses; and lastly, Medifund, which is Government's money, also taxpayers' money, that acts as the ultimate safety net when all else fails to help vulnerable Singaporeans.",4,385,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00385
2014-07-08-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"While the 3M framework is robust, we can do more as a society. We have been expounding the need to be caring and inclusive. We all feel a deep sense of compassion when we see someone in pain and we all feel the need to help that someone regain the health and strength to lead a normal life like we do. We talk about it, we argue for it and this is the time for us to do it. A universal public health insurance in the form of MediShield Life is how we can do so, by pooling our risks and money together to help pay for one another's bills. No one gets left out, everyone gets a chance to tap on it, if not today, then tomorrow, although, ideally, it would be the most ideal situation that we all remain healthy so that we have the capacity to really enjoy life and do what we want to do.",5,386,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00386
2014-07-08-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),The report made recommendations to tackle the wide-ranging concerns that Singaporeans have – from the adequacy of coverage to the expected premium increase and to how current IP policyholders will not be left worse off with the transition to MediShield Life. The degree of thought and sophistication in these recommendations lead me to believe that the Committee has carefully considered all the trade-offs.,6,387,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00387
2014-07-08-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"So far as I have read the report, most of the concerns that my residents have raised to me, especially from my elderly residents in terms of affordability of premiums and the adequacy of coverage as well as the co-payment, the deductibles, I think all of these have been very adequately and eloquently addressed in the report and I am heartened by this.",7,388,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00388
2014-07-08-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),Two points in the report that struck me were the assurance that the premiums will be fully payable by Medisave and that no one shall be left uninsured because of financial difficulty. Such a promise is a demonstration of our Government's fiscal strength. Few other countries can afford to do the same.,8,389,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00389
2014-07-08-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"However, I do have a few questions that I hope MOH can address.",9,390,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00390
2014-07-08-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Firstly, can MOH share how the premiums are derived? How confident is MOH that these amounts will be adequate in supporting our current and future healthcare needs, given the enhanced coverage?",10,391,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00391
2014-07-08-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Second, how confident is MOH about the long-term affordability of the increased premiums? Will MOH continue to monitor and, if need be, take steps to mitigate the impact of the increased premiums on Singaporeans after the five-year transitional subsidy period? And at the risk of sounding like I am contradicting myself, really, how long can MOH sustain the subsidies that it has been promising Singaporeans within these five years and possibly beyond the five years?",11,392,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00392
2014-07-08-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Third, the majority of Singaporeans have CPF contributions and, hence, are able to cope with the premiums through our own Medisave. But what about those who have no income and, therefore, no CPF contributions? These include housewives and Singaporeans who have suffered long- term unemployment. A number of them may not come from well-to-do families and their family members will be unable to help pay for their share and, for some others, they may not even have reliable family members around to even help them. How will MOH support this group of Singaporeans so that they, too, will be covered?",12,393,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00393
2014-07-08-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"And fourth, for Singaporeans with unstable income, such as freelancers, how can they cope with the annual premium payments?",13,394,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00394
2014-07-08-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"MediShield Life is a bold scheme that we must support. It gives hope and assurance to those who suffer serious illnesses and have to incur large bills. However, it would be a great let-down if this hope was shattered because MediShield Life cannot be.",14,395,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00395
2014-07-08-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Sustainability of MediShield Life is perhaps the largest trade-off for the enhanced benefits it brings. In reality, sustainable healthcare financing is an issue everywhere – whether it is in Canada, US, Europe, Australia, Taiwan or Japan. These countries face escalating healthcare costs and have insolvent schemes. The systems are essentially surviving on borrowed time. For instance, the National Health Insurance in Taiwan saw its government having to borrow from banks because there was insufficient money in the pool. The one in Japan is facing such a large financing gap that increasing co-payments and other measures will not be sufficient to close it. Medicare in the United States is also fast becoming unsustainable as the enrolment into the programme is growing faster than its economy. Once introduced, such systems become entrenched. Any subsequent reforms will be difficult. And these also highlight the importance of designing, at the very onset, having careful, thoughtful design of a public health insurance system and, therefore, I think this is something that is very important for us – whether for the Government, for us as a nation – and that we need to think about very carefully.",15,396,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00396
2014-07-08-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"In Singapore, we have been able to provide large subsidies in the billions of dollars only because our country has enjoyed decades of good economic growth. However, what of the future, when our own growth is predicted to slow down, when economic conditions are expected to become more volatile, when we face an ageing population, and with smaller families? In addition, healthcare costs have been projected to increase exponentially. We see it in Canada where healthcare costs are rising far beyond the increase in their real income and this is something that I believe is not just us in Singapore or even Canada but all around the world, all the developed economies are facing the same problem. One of the key cost drivers is the cost of manpower, which, for us in Singapore, is something that continues to be a challenge that we have to grapple with today. Given these forces, I would like to ask  what is MOH's assessment of the sustainability of the proposed design of MediShield Life, and could MOH share how it intends to keep the scheme sustainable?",16,397,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00397
2014-07-08-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Sustainability also depends on whether the scheme will enjoy universal support. If health insurance is left to private insurers and they can choose who they want to insure, then those with pre-existing conditions, precisely the people who are most in need of insurance, will be left out in the cold. Similarly, we need to also make this compulsory for every Singaporean to be in MediShield Life because if those who are healthy today decide that they do not need to be insured now, then we will have an impossible situation of having only the ill in the pool, which is certainly unsustainable.",17,398,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00398
2014-07-08-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Some countries also face the issue of chasing for premium payments. In Japan, for example, those who cannot or refuse to pay for the premiums may eventually have their properties seized to pay for the arrears. Arguably, we are different in that we have Medisave accounts that we can deduct from. But how will the MOH attempt to resolve the issue when people cannot pay the premiums, or can no longer pay for the premiums from their Medisave? And before I continue and conclude, please allow me to speak in Mandarin.",18,399,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00399

The potential issues that come with a large scale and costing scheme are aplenty. The abysmal implementation of Medicare in the US provides many lessons of what can go wrong.

The Committee has suggested that the process for applying for subsidies should be as simple and convenient as possible. I agree and I would like to reiterate my earlier calls for premium subsidies to be provided automatically to households that have already undergone means-testing for other Government assistance schemes.

First, we need to explain to employees that there are clear benefits to portable insurance. When they change jobs, they can retain their cover.

This is a good initiative that should be better publicised, so as to reduce confusion and encourage more consumer self-service. It could also spur more competition and lower prices, as insurance companies will compete more on features and price, and less on their marketing ability.",34,444,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00444

2014-07-08-T-006,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member),"First, will the Government tender out the Standard Plan to only one insurance company or will all insurers be expected to offer this plan? If it is tendered to one insurer, how will it ensure sufficient competition such that the premiums and benefits are to the advantage of consumers?",36,446,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00446
2014-07-08-T-006,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member),"Second, if existing Integrated Shield Plan policyholders decide to switch to the Standard Plan, will they be subject to underwriting, where their pre-existing conditions will get excluded or risk-loaded? If so, it would probably not make sense to switch, especially for older policyholders who are likely to have developed pre-existing conditions.",37,447,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00447
2014-07-08-T-006,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member),"For many Singaporeans, the main issue they have with Integrated Shield Plans is that the Medisave Withdrawal Limits are too low, forcing them to cough out cash to pay their premiums. This is especially so for older policyholders, who now have to top up anywhere between $100 and $3,500 a year in cash to pay for their B1 plan premiums. This is frustrating for many of them, especially retirees who are short on cash but have sufficient Medisave balances.",38,448,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00448
2014-07-08-T-006,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member),"I hope the development of a Standard B1 Plan will raise the Medisave Withdrawal Limit to better meet the cost of Integrated Shield Plan premiums, especially for older policyholders.",39,449,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00449
2014-07-08-T-006,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member),"Mdm Speaker, MediShield Life is a welcome shift in policy towards stronger social safety nets. In its 1993 Healthcare White Paper, the Government sounded a warning against an over-reliance on medical insurance and the risk of moral hazard. Now, 21 years later, the Government has responded to a louder voice of the people with a universal scheme that has better benefits, lower co-payments and subsidised premiums. This is a step in the right direction towards a more caring society.",40,450,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00450

2014-07-08-T-006,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"Why do I raise this issue? Because I feel that before we start the debate on the MediShield Life Review Committee Report, it is necessary to remind Singaporeans that in the eyes of many foreigners, our healthcare system is worth learning from. Our 3M healthcare system comprises three parts – Medisave, MediShield and Medifund. Although some people may not believe this, that is, the 3M system has ensured that most Singaporeans are able to afford their medical expenses.",2,452,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00452
2014-07-08-T-006,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"Medisave is mandated by law in that every employed Singaporean must set aside a certain portion of his salary in a medical savings account. Both the account holder and his direct family members can use the money in the account. This can satisfy most of a person's ordinary medical needs. The account holder can also use some of the money in the Medisave to buy insurance from officially appointed insurance companies; this is MediShield. For low-income earners who cannot join the Medisave scheme, the Government has set up Medifund to help those people in extreme poverty to receive treatment when they fall sick. The 3M system is different from a totally free national healthcare system, and it is also different from a totally market-driven one. It has successfully integrated the efforts of the Government and the individuals to ensure people's well-being.",3,453,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00453
2014-07-08-T-006,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"Why do we review the MediShield Life system? In the Prime Minister's words, it is one of the Government's focuses to alleviate people's concern with the rising healthcare cost. He announced last August that MediShield would become universal and life-long, and the Government would particularly look after the senior citizens who have contributed to nation-building.",4,454,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00454

The Government on one hand judiciously calibrates expenses based on revenues; on the other hand, it boldly takes a long-term view. Do Singaporeans understand that the $4 billion MediShield Life fund is the result of the Government's judicious financial management? Do they understand that it would not be easy to continue to improve the healthcare system and we may need more funds in the future? The next step is for us to think about how to improve productivity, use innovation to create wealth to build up our national coffers. Only by doing this can we be healthier, happier and live a stable life.",5,455,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00455

People cannot opt-out either. According to grassroots feedback, ordinary residents cannot fully understand such details. I think it is necessary to step up public education, using different means to explain to Singaporeans in the communities, as well as in companies. Some residents have hastily opted out of their private insurance plans, believing that, with MediShield Life, there would not be any issues with getting sick and hospitalised and that everything would be cheaper. It is somewhat erroneous to interpret MediShield Life this way and should be corrected as soon as possible. Besides the Government, the insurance companies should also be responsible to explain to their customers the differences between insurance options and whether there are any overlapping areas.",6,456,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00456
2014-07-08-T-006,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"With regard to rising premiums, why young people have to pay more, needs clear explanation, too. Many people do not understand the benefits of front-loading. Front-loading means to pay more when you are young and earning more and to get a discount after retirement. Young Singaporeans must understand the benefits thoroughly. If they have aged parents, the burden on them will be lessened. If their parents' premiums are reduced, they will need less help from the children. This is one of the many features recommended by the Committee, and I fully agree. The underlying concept is simple, which is to let everyone take part within their means and all will benefit.",7,457,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00457
2014-07-08-T-006,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"I would like to emphasise that mindset should be adjusted with regard to some people's belief that it is best that the Government should pay when people see a doctor. The experience from some of the welfare states shows us that it is not sustainable to have a free healthcare system, because it will lead to the ballooning of healthcare demand, creating a heavy burden on the government. Our healthcare system still emphasises individual responsibility for one's health, which is to pay attention to things, such as preventive measures, exercise, diet and sleep. In the unfortunate event of someone falling sick, the Government, the individual and the community should make combined efforts to make sure everyone can receive appropriate levels of healthcare.",8,458,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00458
2014-07-08-T-006,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"Because of my professional background, I know many people who get into severe difficulties in their financial and personal life due to marriage failure. We can even use extreme difficulties and poverty to describe their situation. They feel being isolated socially; if they fall sick and have to be hospitalised at this time, it would be like adding frost to snow and making their lives even more unbearable. The one thing people fear most after retirement is falling sick and having to be hospitalised. Some people are even more unfortunate. They have to work day and night to make ends meet after divorce, and have no additional money to buy health insurance. This is especially the case with divorced women who have the custody of their children. If their ex-husband refuses to pay alimony and their children happen to be hospitalised and need surgery, they will be burdened with high medical bills. These cases show that there are some less fortunate Singaporeans who have no financial and family support; they urgently need the protection of MediShield Life, so that when they fall sick, they can see a doctor in time to receive treatment. For this group of people, the reform of MediShield is, indeed, timely and good news!",9,459,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00459

I welcome the move to bring on board the uninsured, including those with pre-existing conditions, under the MediShield Life scheme. At the same time, the Government would do well not to ignore the concerns expressed by many Singaporeans about the likely upward impact on the cost of premium, moving forward. Nonetheless, the recommendations made by the MLRC are steps in the right direction.",1,461,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00461

As was rightly revealed in the report that was prepared by the Committee, there were many feedback and suggestions that pertained specifically to the cost of healthcare in Singapore. As Singapore grapples with a rapidly ageing population, the cost of healthcare threatens to spiral out of control, above and beyond the financial means of many Singaporeans.",2,462,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00462
2014-07-08-T-006,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Cash payments for medical expenses constitute a major worry.

This was one of the major challenges that the Committee seeks to address. At the same time, while many Singaporeans had welcomed the additional protection accorded to them by the MediShield Life scheme, they also highlight their worries over escalating premium costs and, ultimately, the affordability of these premiums. We must bear this concern in mind as inflationary health costs, if poorly managed, threaten to price many Singaporeans out from being able to afford their own premiums, undermining not only their access to quality medical treatment but also their retirement in old age. Thus, healthcare costs need to be properly managed and attuned with the needs of a rapidly changing population.",4,464,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00464

This agency has been critical in the promotion of a healthy lifestyle in prevention and early detection of chronic illnesses. One such programme is the ""I Quit"" programme.

In this year's Budget Speech, I had called upon the Government to extend the taxi subsidy scheme that was provided to the disabled to elderly Singaporeans, in particular, those who are present recipients of welfare assistance under the Medifund scheme. Today, I would like to reiterate this call and to further suggest that the taxi subsidy scheme be extended to all beneficiaries under Medifund.",7,467,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00467

By not receiving adequate medical care and treatment, it is likely that their pre-existing health conditions will deteriorate, resulting in complications which will require more extensive and complex medical attention. In the long term, this would possibly add more inflationary pressures on the cost of healthcare in Singapore.",8,468,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00468

The cost of such personal test kits should be the least of their concerns. Availability of such test kits will go a long way in assisting patients to monitor their conditions and take appropriate steps in preventing further deterioration of their pre-existing health conditions. More importantly, it would encourage more Singaporeans to take ownership and personal responsibility for their own health.",10,470,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00470

We have seen mosques working together with the Health Promotion Board (HPB) to actively organise activities that promote a healthy lifestyle and to take care of one's health. Apart from the mosques, Malay/Muslim bodies also inculcate values pertaining to healthy lifestyles and taking care of one's health in their programmes. For instance, when I was in the social work field, I had managed a MENDAKI Programme called Nur Kasih which focused on strengthening families. One of the modules presented was on health matters. The intended key message was that a family's stability in terms of family relations and finances can be affected if the health aspect is ignored.

In the 2010 National Health Survey Report, Malays are the most affected by hypertension and the second most affected by diabetes, compared to the other communities.

I would like to suggest that this matter be presented and discussed through the Community Leaders' Forum (CLF) platform.

Under a portable scheme, a company makes contributions to an employee's Medisave account. The employee then uses the funds to buy MediShield Life or an Integrated Shield Plan offered by a private insurer, if he wishes to have further enhanced coverage and even better benefits. As the insurance coverage is not company-centric, employees can continue to be insured and have the same benefits, even if they change jobs. With more companies and the workforce joining such a proposed scheme, it may bring down the premium rates over time. This remains to be seen. In addition, in view of the new MediShield Life, I understand that MOH has indicated that it will work with private insurers to review their existing plans.

Today, many people expect that, in spite of having a chronic disease, an individual should still enjoy a high quality of life, with access to a variety of medical treatment to control their illness. Today, healthcare patients are different from those of the past. Many are well-informed, through the wealth of knowledge on the Internet, and they want greater access and freedom of choice to quality healthcare services. As patients demand better services, the future pressure on our healthcare will increase rapidly.",4,496,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00496

While some of them have claimed success, there are those in some countries where the universal healthcare system is in danger of being dysfunctional and characterised by unequal access to healthcare, and uncontrollable and rising healthcare costs. As we are developing our first universal healthcare system, I am glad to know that we have learnt from the rich, practical, day-to-day experiences of other nations and taken steps to mitigate the negative experience of these nations that have embarked on universal healthcare system.",7,499,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00499
2014-07-08-T-006,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to strongly urge that the Government make clear distinctions as to what is a ""must-have"" and what is a ""good-to-have"". MediShield Life should cover the essentials that every Singaporean must have in terms of healthcare protection for life. Beyond that, Singaporeans are at liberty to decide whether to expand their healthcare coverage through the Integrated Shield Plans offered by private insurance companies. Given MediShield Life co-exist with Integrated Shield Plans, does MOH have any plans to regulate these private insurers to ensure that policyholders are not shortchanged by Integrated Shield Plans through disclaimers and terms and conditions not made known clearly to the clients? Reported cases where patients were not allowed to renew their Integrated Shield Plans by some insurance companies after they have started making claims should not be allowed to happen.",8,500,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00500
2014-07-08-T-006,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Related to this extra medical coverage is the need for companies to review their health and medical benefits that they accord to their employees. I am glad that our GPC Chairman for Health, Dr Chia Shi-Lu, and the hon Member Mr Gerald Giam support the Portable Medical Insurance scheme that NTUC had been pushing for several years. But the context under the old MediShield was not conducive for us to achieve a breakthrough due to the annual life time and claim limit. Weighing the pros and cons of PMBS relative to MediShield, the value proposition offered by PMBS at that time was not attractive. Employees want to tap on their companies' insurance for hospitalisation bills to save on their Medisave and preserve their claim limit. However, with MediShield Life, NTUC has renewed the call for employers to implement PMBS. I am pleased that a tripartite committee has been formed to look into it.",9,501,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00501

However, there were some concerns that this may create a potential loophole as people from other countries with existing chronic illness may apply for permanent residency status in Singapore just to enjoy universal healthcare coverage. Obviously, this may lead to further pressure in healthcare cost under MediShield Life. Hence, I would like to know what steps will be taken by MOH and ICA to prevent such possible abuses to our MediShield Life system.",10,502,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00502

One of my residents shared with me his painful experience of having to incur a substantial amount for his medical bill for an angiogram and angioplasty operation in 2005 that he had in a private hospital. He could only claim $4,000 from his Medisave and MediShield for the $19,000 hospital bill. The balance had to be paid in cash despite him having substantial Medisave savings. He may not be the only one having gone through such an experience.",11,503,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00503
2014-07-08-T-006,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I attribute this to a lack of public education and awareness of the treatment and claimable limits under our current MediShield scheme.

2014-07-08-T-006,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Moving forward under MediShield Life, I hope the Government makes greater efforts to ensure better education and greater awareness amongst MediShield Life patients with regard to the coverage provided. How do we plan to bring forth the necessary knowledge with regard to MediShield Life to the public? Do they have a clear understanding of what MediShield Life may be used for and what it cannot be used for? Could the hospitals' customer patient service officers, especially those in private hospitals, be better equipped with the necessary knowledge to advise on coverage by MediShield Life, together with their advice on treatment open to the patient? This way, we would mitigate the potential for Singaporeans finding themselves in a situation of huge bill shocks due to misconceptions that they would be covered under MediShield Life. With greater awareness, Singaporeans would be better able to plan their finances around co-payment for medical treatment, instead of falling into financial difficulty. Mr Deputy Speaker, please allow me to speak in Malay.",13,505,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00505

2014-07-08-T-006,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The move to make MediShield Life scheme compulsory will be advantageous to families who usually do not obtain any health insurance coverage for themselves or their family members. Within this group, there are those who have chronic health problems that require long-term treatment and expensive medical care. Through MediShield Life, the Government has made it easier for everyone, regardless of educational background or income level to receive the necessary treatment. For those among the Malay/Muslim community who usually do not have medical insurance coverage due to financial reasons or lack of awareness about medical insurance, MediShield Life will provide the basic coverage that is much needed by everyone. The subsidies provided to the needy will bring us closer to our goal of building a more inclusive and fair society in Singapore.",15,507,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00507
2014-07-08-T-006,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Even so, I would like to urge the Government to be cautious when considering the suggestions that were given, especially the ones about providing higher subsidies or about allowing new medical treatments that will be placed under MediShield Life. Our demographic profile will change whereby more people will live longer. This trend, together with rapid advances in medical technology, can increase medical costs. Therefore, the Government must be careful because we have yet to identify the costs of medical care in the future that can affect the premium amounts to be paid. To ensure that Singaporeans continue to receive sufficient medical coverage, the Government can set up a medical committee that conducts studies periodically to ensure that the MediShield Life scheme remains effective and affordable for most Singaporeans.",16,508,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00508

I am of the opinion that it would be better if MOH itself conducts the review on these efforts because they have better resources and information to do a better job. I feel that it is more important that we increase efforts to engage our community about MediShield Life and it can be done with the support of MENDAKI and MUIS.,17,509,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00509

They benefit from cutting-edge technologies and treatments, as well as medical strategies that are informed by academic research on our population. This burden of research and academic pursuit is borne largely by our public sector, and, so, it is the public healthcare system that sets the bar. In other jurisdictions, the weight of insurance-funded healthcare has reduced the emphasis on research and academic excellence, primarily as a means of controlling costs. This has not always caused a decrease in the progress of the academic pursuits if there are funds available from alternative sources. Philanthropy is one good example in the United States, for example.",5,515,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00515

Will Singaporeans continue to receive the best possible medical care in the public institutions, as they currently do and have appropriately come to expect? Will the public healthcare institutions be able to continue to pursue these missions of providing excellent care, training the future generation of healthcare providers, and developing better treatments to suit our population? Will the proposed changes affect these in any way?",6,516,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00516

He contrasted this with MediShield Life's – I think it was 163 or 167 that he quoted from his Parliamentary Question – and questioned whether this was appropriate.",8,518,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00518
2014-07-08-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The thing to appreciate is that the 120% set by MAS is not a target for the funds, the insurance schemes, to meet. It is a floor. It is a floor that they must operate above. If they breach that floor, there are very, very significant regulatory requirements. It is inappropriate to compare the floor with the target that MediShield Life might have.",9,519,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00519
2014-07-08-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"What should we compare it with? Perhaps, we should ask ourselves what do the insurance schemes and other funds target as their Capital Adequacy Ratio. It is not 120% because that is what they have to stay above, and because of variations in cash flow in markets and the assets that are marked to market, they target a level of 200% CAR or more.",10,520,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00520
2014-07-08-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"These are the private for-profit companies. And you would expect, in order to maximise profit, they have to sail as close to the wind as possible. Yet, these companies, understanding these schemes, understanding the significant amount of variation that puts their operations at risk should they breach that floor, are operating at 200% or more. This is the correct thing to compare with, not the absolute requirement from MAS of 120%. It is a misunderstanding and I hope that would be clarified.",11,521,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00521
2014-07-08-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"There is another misunderstanding, and this is something that Mr Giam has brought up today, at the recent debate on the President's Address – and he has also written about it on his blog about the Medical Loss Ratio. He described the Medical Loss Ratio as being 63% over the last 11 years, 75% in 2012. Those numbers are true if, and only if, one was considering the simple Medical Loss Ratio. That is, if you just take the premiums that are collected with the cash paid out in a given year, those figures are correct.",12,522,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00522
2014-07-08-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"His mistake, however, is to compare this with the Affordable Care Act in the United States, or ObamaCare, where he quoted 80% to 85%, and he is comparing these two numbers. He is not the only one to do so. There are a number of online commentators who have done something similar. The reality is that in ObamaCare or the Affordable Healthcare Act, the 80% to 85% mandate includes the direct claims. It includes the unpaid claim reserves, the changes in the contract reserves and reserves for contingency benefits. This is not the same as what we are talking about for the MediShield Life's simple loss ratio.",13,523,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00523
2014-07-08-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"So, let me state that again so that we are all quite clear. What he has described is a simple ratio between the premiums that are brought in and the claims that are paid out every year. He has compared this with the United States where, on the one hand, premiums are brought in, claims are paid out, money is put aside for unpaid claim reserves, money is put aside for changes in the contracted reserves, and money is put aside for contingency benefits. In actual fact, under the US system, other things are classified as claims, including quality healthcare initiatives.",14,524,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00524
2014-07-08-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"If we take the same approach for Singapore, we need to use something that we call the ""Incurred Loss Ratio"", where we compare the premiums that are paid in, the claims that are paid out every year, together with what we have to do to put aside to fund the liabilities, going forward. So, it is not a simple issue. This data is available through the CPF Board Annual Report and it is also available in the series of Parliamentary Questions that Mr Giam had asked before.",15,525,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00525
2014-07-08-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"If we do that and we calculate our situation in Singapore, what we find is the Incurred Loss Ratio is very, very different from what Mr Giam has described. It was 119% in 2011; 111% in 2012 and 91% in 2013. That averages out at 96% over the last five years. So, in our numbers and statistics, what we see is that MediShield is paying out claims and putting aside money it needs in order to pay out claims. It is not making a profit. This money is not disappearing somewhere. It is being put aside prudently.",16,526,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00526

But it is going to vary on either side and that is exactly what we see. Some years, it is slightly more than 100%; some years it is slightly less than 100%. That is exactly what we expect to see  the money is paid in, it is paid out to people who need it, and some is put aside so that it can continue to pay people who need it. The purpose of MediShield Life – and MediShield in the past – is only to help Singaporeans with large hospital bills.",17,527,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00527
2014-07-08-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The comparison is inappropriate. Is it just a small matter, a technical term – Loss Ratio versus Incurred Loss Ratio? First thing is, it involves millions of dollars, hundreds of millions of dollars, so, it is not that small a matter. If I can give Members an analogy of the extent of this inappropriate comparison – what Mr Giam has done is analogous to trying to compare two companies. One is an American for-profit company and the other is a Singaporean social enterprise. In trying to compare the financial position of these two companies, on the one hand, he has said, ""Tell me everything about this company – your income, your expenditure, your profit, your loss, your liabilities, your debts, your total financial position."" And then, looking at the Singaporean company, he said, ""I want to know the cash flow."" On the basis of that, he has compared the two.

On the first two, I will entrust our civil servants and many in the profession to optimise the workings of this scheme. What would be helpful, however, would be yearly public reports on how the administrative costs are managed and whether the funds are prudently invested, as well as transparency on fund use.

Perhaps, emotion care is not measured in the healthcare KPI, or, put simply, it does not pay to see patients for, say, an extra five to 10 minutes, then it is the case today. Yet, I think that a great deal of the psychological effect of a doctor's explaining medical conditions and setting a patient's mind at ease probably reduces anxiety that can manifest itself in many physical symptoms which necessitate more medical interventions.",24,555,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00555

There are at least two other additional reasons for this – first, the automatic inclusion feature, so no one is left behind, and second, its affordability. Patients will now pay less, and worry less, and the premiums can be covered by a mandatory 1% increase in employer contributions to the CPF scheme. Perhaps, Medisave Minimum Sum could be reviewed to keep up with the times.",30,561,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00561

This will help individuals fund MediShield Life. However, my heart is also with the smaller firms, VWOs and NPOs, who may or may not be able to afford the increase in employer contributions to Singaporeans' CPF funds. Given the tight labour market, many are already having difficulties attracting talents into their organisations. Will this move unwittingly lower their competitiveness in attracting talents?

This beats the current system where companies take up private insurance plans that are not portable, and employees are vulnerable to exclusions and uninsurability whenever they switch jobs. Both are expensive options. We should do a lot more to encourage all organisations to cover their staff through MediShield Life, which is a win-win for all.

Mr Deputy Speaker, I would go further than this and urge the Government to use its wide moral influence to ensure that more companies start to utilise MediShield Life for their workers' medical benefits rather than relying on private insurance coverage, such as the Hospitalisation and Surgical (H&S) Plan. Specifically, MOH could facilitate a framework to allow employers to directly pay or co-pay the employee's MediShield Life premiums, in addition to the usual Medisave contribution before the employers start to buy H&S Plan for the employees or their dependants.

This is unlike the Pioneer Generation Package whereby all Pioneers can enjoy the same subsidies, regardless of being rich or poor. When the report was released, it is not surprising that retirees who live in big houses and upper-middle class families who have more than two maids cry foul that it is not fair.

The family's annual MediShield Life premiums will be $1,130, without any permanent or transitional premium subsidies. If the family belongs to the low-income category, they only need to pay $806, meaning a 40% subsidy of $324. For a relatively well-off family, the subsidy of $324 a year is not a big sum. For a low-income family who cannot even afford the premiums, $324 is a substantial amount. Therefore, it makes sense to adhere to the principle that the lessser a person earns, the more subsidies he deserves.",18,587,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00587

However, there might be people who need subsidies but, for some technical reasons, cannot qualify. The Minister has promised that the Government will give special considerations to such cases. More importantly, there are Singaporeans who either have no job or their job is unstable. These people have more pressing needs.

2014-07-08-T-006,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"The Minister did not say how the Government is going to collect the premiums from Singaporeans who do not have sufficient money in their Medisave account. For this group of people, will the Government deduct the premiums from their Ordinary Account first before siphoning money from their Special and Retirement Account? Will the Government ask them to use cash to pay the premiums as the last resort? For those people who have money in their savings account but refuse to pay the premiums, will the Government put pressure on them and even impose penalties?",20,589,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00589
2014-07-08-T-006,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),The Minister has said repeatedly that MOH would use Medifund or some similar scheme to help those who cannot afford the premiums. I hope the Minister can show compassion to help them as long as they do not have sufficient savings in their Medisave account and do not have any family support. There is no point forcing the poor to pay the premiums when they cannot afford.,21,590,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00590

2014-07-08-T-006,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I welcome the move to improve protection against large hospital bills and against expensive chronic treatments, as well as to cover those with pre-existing conditions. My colleagues have touched on and will be touching on various aspects of MediShield Life. I wish to speak today about keeping healthcare costs manageable.",1,592,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00592
2014-07-08-T-006,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"The Committee reported that in the recent five years, our total healthcare spending has risen close to 10% each year on average. Medical inflation has been rising much faster than inflation in general. The healthcare industry has little incentive in itself to contain costs. If this medical inflation trend continues, it can be worrying as to how much MediShield Life's premiums will be in future, as well as the cost of smaller medical bills which are not covered by MediShield Life.",2,593,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00593
2014-07-08-T-006,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"The report touched on some areas that the Government can look into to contain costs. First, I would like to understand how we can keep claims reasonable. I would like to see a robust framework to detect inflated claims or frivolous treatments by healthcare professionals. Inflated claims can come in the form of prescribing treatments beyond what the patients need or from the over prescription of drugs. How will the Government track claims to ensure that even as we strengthen our insurance framework, we will not have inflated claims and unnecessary treatments that will push up healthcare costs, as we have seen that happening in some other countries?",3,594,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00594
2014-07-08-T-006,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Another way to keep costs manageable is for people to stay healthy. That is easier said than done. Many people in Singapore today are already not healthy, being diagnosed with various chronic illnesses. For example, 11.3% of Singaporean adults are diabetic. One in three people are diabetic by the age of 70. A recent study by NUS' Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health forecasted that by 2050, Singapore may have as many as one million diabetics, with one in two being diabetic by the age of 70. Around 24% of adults in Singapore now have high blood pressure or hypertension. What is needed will be to prevent those with chronic illnesses from developing complications. Diabetes itself may not be scary, but it can lead to kidney failure, or the patient becoming blind or needing amputation. A person with high blood pressure may feel healthy, but the ailment can develop into stroke or a heart attack if the situation is not controlled.",4,595,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00595
2014-07-08-T-006,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Our lifestyles are increasingly becoming unhealthy. We can put more effort to focus on those who are already diagnosed as unhealthy and invest in preventive care for them. We need to give the best care possible and to monitor the proper taking of medication to prevent complications from developing, which can be life-threatening and are very costly to treat.",5,596,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00596
2014-07-08-T-006,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"While we currently already have schemes like CHAS and various subsidies for medicines, it is frightening to note that we are currently having four new cases of kidney failures every day and two cases of limb amputations are performed each day due to diabetic foot complications. We should constantly monitor the schemes to see how they are working and what else we can do if the results are not as good as what we want them to be.",6,597,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00597
2014-07-08-T-006,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),Drugs are another area for cost control. I am concerned about the potential impact that the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) may have on the cost of drugs. TPP is currently being negotiated among 12 countries which include Singapore. Many negotiating countries have raised concerns about the Intellectual Property (IP) rights chapter in the TPP which reportedly seeks a much more stringent level of IP protection than the World Trade Organization (WTO) standards. Fears are that these new rules will strengthen the drug monopoly of big US pharmaceutical companies by altering existing patent laws in their favour. The Committee has recommended using generic drugs as far as possible to lower costs. We need to guard against the TPP drastically changing IP rules that may delay drugs becoming generic.,7,598,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00598
2014-07-08-T-006,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Next, on electronic health records. I believe information transparency will allow the Government to monitor the performance of healthcare providers and to track if appropriate and cost effective treatments are provided. Readily available comprehensive medical data will allow the Government to better manage cost across the entire healthcare sector. This is especially so for the private sector. The Committee had highlighted concerns about ""high professional fees"" in the private sector.",8,599,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00599
2014-07-08-T-006,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Some 10 years ago, MOH made it as one of its priorities for the healthcare sector to adopt ICT for health and to set up a common Electronic Medical Record system. Much has been invested in the National Electronic Health Record system (NEHR), and international experts have been brought in to help implement the system. I understand that, today, a version of the system is used in the public healthcare sector. However, the vast majority of those in the private healthcare sector and those run by VWOs are not yet adopting the system.",9,600,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00600
2014-07-08-T-006,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"For NEHR to help better manage the industry efficiently and effectively, I think it will be necessary to have the private sector and VWO providers adopt the NEHR system as well. We should have all healthcare providers on board the same system. This will let patients have the choice to move on to other healthcare providers with full portability of records. The information will also allow the Government to measure the performances of healthcare providers and, if necessary, to even effect changes to payment models, such as to pay for health outcomes rather than just to pay for treatments. I would like to know if there are timelines in place for NEHR to be used industry-wide.",10,601,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00601
2014-07-08-T-006,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Healthcare has been a laggard in the exploitation of ICT.

2014-07-08-T-006,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Also on technology, telehealth or telemedicine offers opportunities to enable the diagnosis, consultation, treatment, education, care management and self-management of patients remotely. Telehealth can include the home monitoring of chronic diseases, time-sensitive assessments in accident and emergency (A&E) departments by medical specialists in another hospital, video conferencing between patients and healthcare providers, and store-and-forward technologies, such as for X-rays and photographs to be captured and transmitted for analysis by doctors later and remotely.",12,603,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00603
2014-07-08-T-006,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Expanding the use of telehealth has the potential to reduce healthcare costs, increase the level of convenience for patients and to improve patient outcomes over traditional methods. Home monitoring of chronic diseases has been shown to lead to reduced hospitalisations. A patient in the A&E department, for example, can receive care by video conferencing with a specialist in another hospital and, thus, may save a transfer to that hospital. Telehealth can provide timely care for stroke patients who may have difficulties travelling to hospitals.",13,604,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00604
2014-07-08-T-006,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"I understand that telehealth is currently being piloted in Singapore. We will need to move to an agreed-upon reimbursement model. If doctors cannot be compensated for tele-consultations, they will likely fall back on the traditional mode of getting patients to visit them in their clinics. If patients cannot use Medisave or be covered by insurance for telehealth, they may opt not to have telehealth even if it can be more suitable for them. I would like to see greater adoption of telehealth through better infrastructure and changes to reimbursement models or regulations that inhibit telehealth.",14,605,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00605
2014-07-08-T-006,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Finally, the Committee has recommended that the Government build up capabilities to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of medical practices, technologies and drugs. I wish to understand what measures the Government has put in place to ensure that new practices, technologies and therapies that are cost-effective in achieving a good treatment outcome are covered by Medishield Life. What will be the measures used to define cost effectiveness? What will be the frequency of such evaluation so that good treatment methods can be covered as soon as practical?",15,606,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00606
2014-07-08-T-006,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Will there be a formal institution that will be set up to make these decisions in a transparent manner and to evaluate appeal on decisions? For example, in the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) is government-funded and exercises independent and binding decision-making on what the health services need to offer. Crucial to the Institution's independence is its transparency in decision-making. The academic research, industry output, patient advocates' filing, demographic and epidemiologic data that go into the decision-making process are freely available.",16,607,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00607

Firstly, while the recommendations will substantially reduce the costs of large hospital and medical bills for most Singaporeans through the reduced co-payments, the deductibles and the Medisave, it is still inevitable that new medical treatments, technology and prescriptions will contribute towards the escalation of medical bills. This means that the possibility of Singaporeans having to incur out-of-pocket expenses for medical treatments remains a reality.",5,614,2014-07-08-T-006-S-00614

2014-07-08-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),"The Singapore healthcare system and its financial framework are generally sound and cost-effective  our National Healthcare Expenditure (NHE) is at 4% of GDP. In comparison, OECD's average is 9.6%. Even then, Singapore achieves good health outcomes. With an ageing population, our national healthcare expenditure and the Government's share of our overall healthcare expenditure are expected to increase.",16,645,2014-07-08-T-008-S-00645
2014-07-08-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),"It is not just my personal belief or opinion that our healthcare system is one of the best in the world. Singapore's healthcare system has been rated by the World Health Organization as the best in Asia, and the sixth best in the world in year 2000. In 2004, Political & Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) ranked Singapore's healthcare system as the third best in the world. In 2008, the Global Competitiveness report ranked Singapore second for infant mortality rate and twelfth for life expectancy at birth.",17,646,2014-07-08-T-008-S-00646
2014-07-08-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),"The Singapore healthcare financing framework is anchored on the twin philosophies of individual responsibility and affordable healthcare for all. This system has evolved over the years, with the current multi-tiered protection to ensure that no Singaporean is denied access to basic healthcare because of affordability issues.",18,647,2014-07-08-T-008-S-00647
2014-07-08-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),"The first tier of protection is provided by heavy Government subsidies in acute public hospitals and polyclinics, which all Singaporeans can access. The quantum of subsidy will increase, especially for the Pioneer Generation and low-income Singaporeans. The second tier of protection is provided by Medisave, a compulsory individual medical savings account scheme which allows Singaporeans to pay for their share of medical treatment. The third tier of protection is provided by MediShield, a low-cost catastrophic medical insurance scheme, which will soon be replaced by MediShield Life, an enhanced universal lifetime medical insurance plan for all Singaporeans.",19,648,2014-07-08-T-008-S-00648
2014-07-08-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),"Individual responsibility for one's healthcare needs is also promoted through features of deductibles and co-payment in the new MediShield Life – our universal health insurance scheme. As for Singaporeans who really cannot afford to pay for their medical bills despite heavy subsidies by the Government, there is Medifund – a medical endowment fund set up by the Government to act as the ultimate safety net to help needy Singaporeans.",20,649,2014-07-08-T-008-S-00649
2014-07-08-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),It may sound like a broken record but I must emphasise that our 3M framework is something that has worked well for us and we should not just throw the baby out together with the bathwater. What we need to do is to groom and nurture the baby and eventually transform it to a fine gentleman.,21,650,2014-07-08-T-008-S-00650
2014-07-08-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),"While the Government has done much to address affordability through increased subsidies, MediShield Life and the Pioneer Generation Package, much work needs to be done to address the accessibility issue – such as the crowdedness in polyclinics, long waiting times at Specialist Outpatient Clinics and the emergency departments, and the near 100% occupancy of inpatient beds in many restructured hospitals.",22,651,2014-07-08-T-008-S-00651
2014-07-08-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),The MLRC has also brought up issues relating to Employer Medical Beneﬁts. Many employees today have some form of medical insurance provided by their employers. Even Public Service employees today are also offered additional payment under the MSO scheme to purchase additional insurance on their own. It is important for MOH to rethink how this would work synergistically together with the new MediShield Life scheme.,23,652,2014-07-08-T-008-S-00652
2014-07-08-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),"I noticed, for instance, that MOM has recommendations for portable medical benefits which allow employers implementing any of the recommended portable medical benefit options higher tax deductions.",24,653,2014-07-08-T-008-S-00653
2014-07-08-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),"How can we streamline Government policies such that they would complement the new MediShield Life scheme? One way, perhaps, is to enable employees in the Civil Service or private sector to make the right choices of insurance plans that complement MediShield Life. Singaporeans need to be educated about what MediShield Life covers or not cover so that all employees can make informed decisions on what additional plans to purchase to complement their existing MediShield Life plan.",25,654,2014-07-08-T-008-S-00654
2014-07-08-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),"I also fully agree with the MLRC's recommendation that the Government should consider strengthening financial support to companies willing to provide portable medical benefits that ride on the MediShield Life scheme. Should we also consider going one step further to legislate health insurance portability, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in the United States?",26,655,2014-07-08-T-008-S-00655
2014-07-08-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),"In many ways, this draws us in to the standardised B1 Integrated Shield Plan that the Committee has recommended. A standardised Shield plan for B1 class wards would provide those Singaporeans who are keen for an upgraded plan better clarity and less confusion. There are, currently, many different Integrated Shield Plans out there in the market and, more often than not, patients may not fully understand the financial implications for each and every one of the Integrated Shield Plans available. Many Singaporeans do want to have better coverage and the option to choose the doctors of their choice, without having to pay an arm or leg or being excessively insured. The standardised B1 Integrated Shield Plan can provide such a choice with standardised coverage across-the-board. It should ideally also complement MediShield Life, and also Employee Medical Benefits at the same time. The last thing we want to do is to encourage the market to come up with products that duplicate and waste resources.",27,656,2014-07-08-T-008-S-00656
2014-07-08-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),"It is, therefore, important to note that the insurance market is essentially a private-sector venture. Companies that underwrite insurance are for-profit organisations, and it is essential that medical insurance, a vital component of the financing framework for healthcare in Singapore, be regulated properly. This would mean that we should be looking at ways to ensure that different products can be compared across-the-board, and information is readily available for Singaporeans to make the right choices.",28,657,2014-07-08-T-008-S-00657
2014-07-08-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),"On this note, perhaps we should also consider how different Singaporeans have different types of needs. Pensioners, for instance, are a group of people who have different needs – they have medical coverage under existing public service medical benefits for pensioners. Many pensioners are concerned about the MediShield Life plan and how they will be affected with its implementation. Many have questioned what will happen to their existing medical benefits. Will they be better or worse off? Besides pensioners, are there other groups of Singaporeans who will be affected? While we have the guiding principles right, it is also necessary to go down to the nitty-gritty and look at MediShield Life in terms of the impact it will have on the lives of ordinary people.",29,658,2014-07-08-T-008-S-00658
2014-07-08-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),"Now, while we have moved forward on our plans for universal lifetime medical coverage, let us remember that the artificial boundaries that we draw between health and social care are gradually blurring. We need to see social care as an important part of health care and a part of the continuum of care. I have spoken about how Singaporeans choose to remain in the acute hospital settings because they are unable to utilise Medisave/MediShield funds for community hospitals and other social care settings.",30,659,2014-07-08-T-008-S-00659
2014-07-08-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),"It is important for MOH to look at these social care aspects and see how they can influence health outcomes. After the rollout of MediShield Life, we need to ensure that social care is sufficiently funded for Singaporeans. Perhaps, we can take a leaf from the UK, where the government is undertaking the Care Act 2014, which promises to integrate health and social care services.",31,660,2014-07-08-T-008-S-00660
2014-07-08-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Members in the House had spoken about Obamacare previously and how Singapore can learn from this initiative. MediShield Life offers Singaporeans many similar promises that Obamacare does. But at the same time, Obamacare has been criticised for the ""broken promises"" by its critics, and the Republicans are talking about repealing and changing Obamacare.",32,661,2014-07-08-T-008-S-00661
2014-07-08-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),One of the main things that I will be particularly concerned about is the implementation of MediShield Life. Like what many married couples and new parents will tell you – having a child is a lifelong journey. The story does not just end with the delivery of the child. We need to ensure that the benefits and the promises of the new plan filter down to all Singaporeans.,33,662,2014-07-08-T-008-S-00662

2014-07-08-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),"In conclusion, the 3M framework has served Singapore well and, moving forward, we need to continuously review and tweak the system to make it more relevant to commensurate with the needs and expectations of Singaporeans. The universal coverage provided by Medishield Life is an important move to provide peace of mind and ensure that all Singaporeans are protected. I am sure the Government will continue to provide strong support to achieve universal coverage and enhance benefits, while ensuring affordable premiums for Singaporeans. With that, I pledge my support and endorse the recommendations of the MLRC.",39,668,2014-07-08-T-008-S-00668

2014-07-08-T-011,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"The fall in the current account surplus between 2010 and 2012 was mainly due to a decline in the trade surplus, as the net exports of goods fell. This was in line with the slowdown in global trade activity. As global and regional trade flows picked up in 2013, Singapore’s trade surplus similarly saw an up-turn.",2,680,2014-07-08-T-011-S-00680
2014-07-08-T-011,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"I would like to specifically address Ms Tan's underlying concern over tightening domestic liquidity conditions. First, the surplus in the trade and current account balance remains sizeable and continues to be a source of inflow of funds into the domestic economy. This has supported an appreciation of the Singapore dollar. On a trade-weighted basis, our exchange rate has appreciated by around 7% over the last three years. Second, domestic interest rates have remained low over the same period, with the three-month S$SIBOR averaging around 0.4%. This is consistent with the still-low global interest rate environment, and is indicative of continued ample liquidity conditions in Singapore. Third, notwithstanding the low domestic interest rates, we have not seen any unusual flow of capital into and out of Singapore in the recent period.",3,681,2014-07-08-T-011-S-00681
