2014-09-09-T-001,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"Mdm Speaker, our Vehicle Entry Permit (VEP) fee and the Goods Vehicle Permit (GVP) fee seek to equalise the cost of owning and using a foreign-registered vehicle in Singapore, with that for a Singapore-registered vehicle. There is a need to do so, given the significantly higher costs for Singapore-registered vehicles because of our Certificate of Entitlement (COE) policy, higher vehicle taxes and so on. By way of background, the GVP has been in existence since the 1960s and the VEP since the 1970s.",1,2,2014-09-09-T-001-S-00002
2014-09-09-T-001,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"LTA periodically reviews these fees to ensure that they continue to serve their objective. The cost difference between owning and using a foreign-registered vehicle and a Singapore-registered vehicle has widened in recent years. This is why we need to revise the fees. I should point out that this is the first increase in the VEP fee in 20 years, the last being in 1994. The VEP is not always adjusted upwards. In fact, it was reduced in 2004 for foreign-registered cars because COE prices had gone down during that period, resulting in lower overall costs for Singapore-registered cars. The GVP fee had remained unchanged since its introduction until the recent revision.",2,3,2014-09-09-T-001-S-00003
2014-09-09-T-001,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"Buses, taxis and motorcycles are not affected by the recent increase in VEP and GVP fees. In addition, all foreign-registered cars and motorcycles continue to enjoy around 125 VEP-free days per year, on top of daily VEP-free hours which are from 5.00 pm to 2.00 am, and which is extended to 12.00 pm to 2.00 am during Singapore's mid-year and year-end school holidays. Effectively, based on 2013 data, only about one in 10 foreign-registered cars that enter Singapore will be affected by the recent increase in VEP fee.",3,4,2014-09-09-T-001-S-00004
2014-09-09-T-001,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"The VEP is not intended as a revenue generator. The VEP fees collected vary, depending on the number of foreign-registered cars and motorcycles entering Singapore and their length of stay during VEP-chargeable hours.",4,5,2014-09-09-T-001-S-00005
2014-09-09-T-001,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"On Malaysia's proposed entry fee on non-Malaysia-registered vehicles entering Johor, we have not been officially informed of it by the Malaysian government. We are concerned whether it is directed towards Singapore vehicles. We have contacted the Malaysian government to seek details and are awaiting their reply before deciding on our response.",5,6,2014-09-09-T-001-S-00006
2014-09-09-T-001,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Senior Minister of State for the comprehensive reply. We understand that the purpose of the VEP is to curb vehicle congestion during the peak hours and typically during the week days. Foreign-registered vehicles entering Singapore are given 10 VEP-free days per calendar year, besides not having to pay VEP during Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. If the Malaysian authorities had decided to go ahead with their own VEP, would MOT consider negotiating with them so as to provide the same kind of number of fee-free days?",1,7,2014-09-09-T-001-S-00007
2014-09-09-T-001,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"My second supplementary question is about the higher toll charges imposed by Malaysia at the Causeway since 1 August 2014. Both MOT and LTA have indicated the intention for Singapore to match the same. However, many Singaporeans are concerned about the impact of the higher toll charges. Would the Senior Minister of State provide an update on this issue?",2,8,2014-09-09-T-001-S-00008
2014-09-09-T-001,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"As I had noted earlier in our response, we have not had official word from the Malaysian government on what they intend to do regarding the entry permit fees that reportedly they would like to levy. Until details are made known to us, it is premature to comment on it. So, I would suggest that we not say anything more at this point in time.",1,9,2014-09-09-T-001-S-00009
2014-09-09-T-001,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Regarding the Causeway tolls, there is a Parliamentary Question (PQ) following this first PQ that relates to the Causeway toll, so I suggest we take it together with Question No 2.",2,10,2014-09-09-T-001-S-00010
2014-09-09-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA plans to review its long-standing policy of matching toll charges at the Causeway and Second Link to those set by Malaysia in future; and (b) whether a Whole-of-Government study has been carried out by Singapore to assess the prospect of higher toll charges on Singapore businesses operating in the Iskandar zone in Johor.,1,11,2014-09-09-T-002-S-00011
2014-09-09-T-002,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"Mdm Speaker, toll charges at the Causeway and Second Link were introduced by Malaysia in 1998. Our matching policy reflects the shared nature of the two crossings, and ensures a fair distribution of total revenues from the crossings. Without a matching policy, lower toll charges by one side may simply be offset by higher tolls levied by the other side. There is no assurance that toll charges foregone by one side will be translated into lower total charges which benefit motorists.",1,12,2014-09-09-T-002-S-00012
2014-09-09-T-002,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"Hence, in response to Malaysia's Causeway tolls revision on 1 August 2014, we have announced Singapore's intention to match Malaysia's new and increased toll charges in due course.",2,13,2014-09-09-T-002-S-00013
2014-09-09-T-002,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"The Government has limited information on the cost structures and market conditions of Singapore businesses operating in the Iskandar zone in Johor. But clearly, there will be some impact on their costs.",3,14,2014-09-09-T-002-S-00014
2014-09-09-T-002,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"In this regard, we note reports in the Malaysian media that the Malaysian authorities will review the tolls. Should Malaysia reduce or do away with the toll charges, Singapore will follow suit. This would be welcomed, I think, by both Singapore and Malaysia businesses on both sides of the Causeway.",4,15,2014-09-09-T-002-S-00015
2014-09-09-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for that very helpful clarification. I have three supplementary questions for the Senior Minister of State. First, did the Malaysian government forewarn Singapore of their intention to raise toll charges at the Causeway on 1 August, and have there been any joint discussions about this round of toll hikes since 1 August so as to manage costs for Singaporeans and Malaysians travelling to and fro both countries?",1,16,2014-09-09-T-002-S-00016
2014-09-09-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second question is  did the Singapore Government inform its Malaysian counterparts when it planned to increase VEP charges in July this year, and if not, does it plan to do so going forward?",2,17,2014-09-09-T-002-S-00017
2014-09-09-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Finally, in view of the close relationship between Singapore and Malaysia, especially between the Prime Ministers in recent years, has the Government suggested to the Malaysian authorities to consider tagging the additional toll from 1 August along the Eastern Dispersal Link rather than at the Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ), so as not to penalise drivers who do not use the Eastern Dispersal Link and only travel into Johor Bahru city?",3,18,2014-09-09-T-002-S-00018
2014-09-09-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mdm Speaker, the answer to the Member's first question is no. We were not informed in advance of Malaysia's intention to increase the tolls at the Causeway on 1 August. The answer to his second question is yes. We informed our Malaysian counterparts in advance why there is a need to revise the VEP fees. As I have explained in my answer to the earlier Parliamentary Question on VEP fees, it is really because the cost of owning a Singapore-registered vehicle and using it on Singapore roads has risen, whereas the similar cost for a foreign-registered vehicle had largely remained unchanged. And so, yes, our Malaysian counterparts were aware of the intention to raise our VEP fees.",1,19,2014-09-09-T-002-S-00019
2014-09-09-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"We very much would like our Malaysian counterparts to come to the discussion table and look at what are the better ways of managing this issue of the Causeway tolls so as not to penalise drivers who do not use the Eastern Dispersal Link. Our long-standing policy is well known to our Malaysian counterparts, and that means if the Causeway tolls levied by the Malaysian side were to be reduced or removed, we would do likewise.",2,20,2014-09-09-T-002-S-00020
2014-09-09-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,"asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there are clinical trial runs for the Sanofi dengue vaccine being conducted in Singapore; (b) whether an approved dengue vaccine can be used to help reduce the number of people who suffer from dengue fever in Singapore; and (c) whether the Ministry has plans to eventually make a dengue vaccine available under the National Childhood Immunisation Programme (NCIP), just like the polio vaccine.",1,21,2014-09-09-T-003-S-00021
2014-09-09-T-003,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),,1,22,2014-09-09-T-003-S-00022
2014-09-09-T-003,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),"A dengue vaccine could potentially help reduce the number of cases of dengue in Singapore. However, it is too early to definitively assess the effects of the Sanofi dengue vaccine. As with all new vaccines, it must first be scientifically assessed by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) for its safety, quality and efficacy to meet internationally benchmarked standards, before the vaccine is approved for use in Singapore. In granting marketing approval, HSA will take into account whether the data provided from the clinical trial studies demonstrates that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks of potential side effects, if any.",2,23,2014-09-09-T-003-S-00023
2014-09-09-T-003,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),"Results from two large scale Phase III studies, conducted in Asia and South America, were reported recently. Both studies focused on effectiveness of the vaccine in children, whereas in Singapore, most dengue cases occur in adults. The results were similar and showed lower efficacy against dengue virus serotypes 1 and 2, which are the commonest types circulating in Singapore. There had previously been reports that while past infection with one serotype confers immunity and protection against that serotype, it could lead to more serious disease if infection with a different serotype occurs.",3,24,2014-09-09-T-003-S-00024
2014-09-09-T-003,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),"More study is needed to ascertain whether similarly, incomplete protection from vaccination could potentially result in the risk of more severe infection from serotypes which the vaccine protects poorly against. To reduce the number of dengue cases, other measures such as reducing the number of mosquito breeding sites and using mosquito repellents continue to play an important part.",4,25,2014-09-09-T-003-S-00025
2014-09-09-T-003,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),"An Expert Committee on Immunisation (ECI) advises MOH on matters related to vaccination. The ECI considers factors such as the local burden of disease, vaccine safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness when recommending whether a particular vaccine, such as the dengue vaccine when it becomes available, should be included into the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule.",5,26,2014-09-09-T-003-S-00026
2014-09-09-T-004,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"asked the Minister for Defence in view of the celebration of Singapore's 50th National Day next year, whether the Government will consider having two NDP Preview shows so that more Singaporeans can have the opportunity to attend the parade at the Padang and celebrate this very significant National Day.",1,27,2014-09-09-T-004-S-00027
2014-09-09-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Mdm Speaker, MINDEF agrees with the Member of Parliament Mr Liang that it would be good, indeed ideal, if more Singaporeans could attend the NDP 2015 next year, in celebration of our 50th National Day.",1,28,2014-09-09-T-004-S-00028
2014-09-09-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"The Organising Committee is evaluating various options to achieve this. The Member has asked about extra shows. Let me just give some details on our current format. There are now four shows open prior to the actual NDP – three National Education Shows for school students and the NDP Preview itself. The Member has suggested and asked if another NDP Preview would be one way of increasing the attendance. We can explore the idea but adding another NDP Preview may tax participants too heavily, who would require some rest before the actual NDP Show.",2,29,2014-09-09-T-004-S-00029
2014-09-09-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"However, the Organising Committee is exploring other ideas to allow more Singaporeans to see the show ""live"", such as increasing the seating capacity at the Padang or creating satellite viewing platforms throughout the Marina Bay area during the Preview and NDP 2015. We are also working with the People's Association on activities to celebrate National Day in Heartland locations.",3,30,2014-09-09-T-004-S-00030
2014-09-09-T-004,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Madam, first and foremost, I want to congratulate the Defence Minister for yet another spectacular NDP this year. Increasingly, we are seeing more Singaporeans taking part in the celebration with great pride. And NDP, being a pinnacle celebration, I think, obviously is where more Singaporeans want to be a part of.",1,31,2014-09-09-T-004-S-00031
2014-09-09-T-004,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I would like to ask the Minister what more we can do to maximise Singaporeans' participation, especially at next year's NDP, and whether we could further leverage or harness on the surrounding places around Padang or the Marina Bay, so that more Singaporeans can be part of SG50. And thirdly, the NDP Preview, whether we could consider one more of this preview because the capacity at the Padang is usually much less and perhaps, we can see if we can have one less rehearsal in the earlier stages so that we can have one more Preview for the public to view.",2,32,2014-09-09-T-004-S-00032
2014-09-09-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mdm Speaker, let me thank the Member for his kind words. Congratulations are due to the participants and the Organising Committee. I will pass on his good remarks.",1,33,2014-09-09-T-004-S-00033
2014-09-09-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"With regard to maximising capacity and that is indeed what we do around the Marina Bay area. I am glad that the Member has brought it up. It shows that the Organising Committee is on the right track. They have looked around the area. There are possible focal points. I am not giving the distinct details or confirming it, but these are possibilities, because obviously, there are logistical problems. It is right in the middle of town, and if we expand the show, we have to see whether it is feasible.",2,34,2014-09-09-T-004-S-00034
2014-09-09-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"There are potential sites. Marina Bay, of course, is a potential satellite site. The Marina Promenade is a potential site, but there are other possible sites. The advent of large LED screens with very good resolution makes it possible. I think that is the advance in technology that we have now. We are exploring this seriously to see whether there could be a better option.",3,35,2014-09-09-T-004-S-00035
2014-09-09-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"To add another NE show is based on the issue of logistics. There can only be so many shows when you are really ready to show to the public, and with the time given and required, we are now putting up all, in all five shows. Three shows are meant for school students, which many of us would agree are useful, and we do not want to rob from them to give it to others. So, we will keep it as three shows.",4,36,2014-09-09-T-004-S-00036
2014-09-09-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Adding another show means that we may have to add it on Sunday because we have it on Saturday now, and I think that may be very taxing on the participants.",5,37,2014-09-09-T-004-S-00037
2014-09-09-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"We will let the Organising Committee evaluate all these options. They will include these inputs as well as, I am sure, inputs from members of the public, but they are quite cognisant that this is NDP 2015, our Golden Jubilee, and they want to put up a good show and include as many Singaporeans as possible either at Padang or the fringe areas.",6,38,2014-09-09-T-004-S-00038
2014-09-09-T-005,David Ong,Mr David Ong,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance over the last two years, what is the number of appeals received from senior citizens with qualifying income criteria and no ownership of any residential property but who do not qualify for GST Vouchers because their residential address as an occupier has an annual valuation of above $21,000.",1,39,2014-09-09-T-005-S-00039
2014-09-09-T-005,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance),"Mdm Speaker, the GST Voucher scheme is a broad-based scheme to help lower and middle income households with their expenses, in particular, what they pay in GST. The criteria for the GST Voucher – Cash takes into account an individual's Assessable Income (AI), the Annual Value (AV) of his place of residence and how many properties he owns.",1,40,2014-09-09-T-005-S-00040
2014-09-09-T-005,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance),"We receive an average of 120 appeals a year from senior citizens – here, I am referring to those who are aged 65 and above – who are below the income threshold and do not own any properties, but are living in properties with Annual Values exceeding $21,000. To put this in context, properties with Annual Values exceeding $21,000 make up the top 15% of owner-occupied homes in Singapore.",2,41,2014-09-09-T-005-S-00041
2014-09-09-T-005,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance),"There is no perfect way of assessing a person's financial situation. However, a person living in a high-value property with his family is in general more likely to be supported by adequate family resources, even if he or she does not own the property. While there will certainly be exceptions, this approach is broadly equitable and progressive.",3,42,2014-09-09-T-005-S-00042
2014-09-09-T-005,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance),"The Member can be assured that appeals by those who are unable to qualify for the GST Voucher but are in financial difficulty will be carefully considered. We will continue to review the GST Voucher from time to time, to ensure that it continues to reach those who need it most.",4,43,2014-09-09-T-005-S-00043
2014-09-09-T-005,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Thank you, Madam. I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. From the many cases I have seen in my Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS) and house visits, many seniors aged 55 and above were pretty upset that the GST Voucher is based on the Annual Valuation of their residence because most of them do not own a property. They are cash-poor, but simply because they live with their children, they are denied the benefits. Since the appeal cases are relatively low for those aged 65 and above, would the Ministry consider extending the benefit to these senior citizens?",1,44,2014-09-09-T-005-S-00044
2014-09-09-T-005,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mdm Speaker, the number of properties that falls into this category is actually 15%. If we take 15%, that number in absolute terms will not be very small. What I can suggest that the Member does in such situations where he has encountered seniors in financial difficulty, is to write in to us and I can give him full assurance that we will look into each case carefully; and for deserving cases, certainly, we will do our best to help.",1,45,2014-09-09-T-005-S-00045

2014-09-09-T-007,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Madam, today, the required qualification for pre-school teaching is a certificate or a diploma in early childhood care and education, which equips preschool teachers with relevant knowledge and competencies to perform their role. The large majority of early childhood educators in the sector, from new teachers to senior teachers and centre leaders, hold a diploma. The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) does not impose a degree as a requirement.",1,53,2014-09-09-T-007-S-00053
2014-09-09-T-007,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"In line with the Applied Study in Polytechnic and ITE Review (ASPIRE) Committee's recommendations, ECDA is working with early childhood operators and practitioners to define the competencies required for different jobs at different levels. With this, we will be able to develop better career progression pathways and continuing professional development programmes for early childhood educators throughout their careers. It will also enable operators to better tie the remuneration of their staff to job size and performance, rather than whether they have a degree or a diploma.",2,54,2014-09-09-T-007-S-00054
2014-09-09-T-007,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"I thank the Minister for the clarification. I would like to ask the Minister, based on the conversations that I have with some of the pre-school teachers within my constituency, they shared that there has been a move to encourage them to take on graduate degree kind of programmes and this has asserted quite a bit of pressure on them. I am wondering if the Minister could clarify whether this move is actually signalling that the preschool sector should be moving into a higher skill, higher knowledge kind of basis whereby preschool teachers are expected, moving ahead, to hold a degree before they can dispense proper care for our toddlers or young children. Could the Minister help to address this question?",1,55,2014-09-09-T-007-S-00055
2014-09-09-T-007,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Madam, I do not think it is ECDA's policy to encourage people to pursue degrees and I do not think we have ever discussed this in my Ministry. As what we mentioned, what we want is to have people who are appropriately trained, adequate for their jobs and not whether they have a degree or a diploma per se. In fact, today, the vast majority of early childhood educators do not need a degree to be in the sector. And I think we all know that what we are looking for in the early childhood sector are people who can relate to children, people who can care and have the heart for them. A degree may neither be necessary or sufficient in itself. I do not think we will have a policy to say that you must have a degree in order to be an early childhood educator.",1,56,2014-09-09-T-007-S-00056

The event attracted more than 1,000 jobseekers, of which 20% were interested in educarer positions.",2,60,2014-09-09-T-008-S-00060

Every week during my Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS), I have residents who come and ask for help. They have been putting their children on the waiting list of childcare centres. It looks like there is an acute shortage. So, I would like to ask  what is the average waiting time and what more can be done, because every week I have been seeing residents asking for help. I wonder if this problem is unique to Nee Soon South or it is a nation-wide problem.",1,63,2014-09-09-T-008-S-00063
2014-09-09-T-008,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mdm Speaker, let me reply to Er Dr Lee Bee Wah's questions. Indeed, we have a challenge now. And let me explain how ECDA and the Ministry try to work with the various operators to try to meet this challenge of the supply and demand issues in the childcare sector.",1,64,2014-09-09-T-008-S-00064
2014-09-09-T-008,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the demand side, we are doing two things to make sure that we have the places at the correct location. The first thing, as Members will know, is that we recently introduced a registration management system. This gives us a better fix of who are the people who are really in the queue or demand. And what we have discovered, very quickly, is that the real or actual demand is a fraction of what the queue may have represented in the past. For those operators who have come on board with us, they are able to deconflict the people who have either got a place somewhere else but never informed them and they should be out of the queue, or there are people who are queuing at multiple centres, sometimes more than 10 centres, and that messes up the projection demand.",2,65,2014-09-09-T-008-S-00065
2014-09-09-T-008,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"So, the first thing we want to do better is for the registration management system to get a better queue system in place, to know the actual demand. That will allow the operators to better site their operations to where it is required. So, that is the first thing – right numbers. The second thing that we want to do better is to make sure that the planning of places in each level is correct. Because while the total number of places is one thing that we are concerned with, we are also concerned with the number of places in each level – whether it is N1, N2, infant care, and so forth, so that there can be better matching. The third thing is a better siting of the location. Some of the high demand areas, like Nee Soon South, Punggol and Woodlands, are where we have allowed the Anchor Operators to quickly expand capacity.",3,66,2014-09-09-T-008-S-00066
2014-09-09-T-008,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The second set of things that we want to do better on the demand side is to make sure that we get the incentives right, so that we target the subsidies to those people and families who need help the most, so as to avoid a situation where people over-consume the services that they may not necessarily require.",4,67,2014-09-09-T-008-S-00067
2014-09-09-T-008,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the supply side, we are also doing four things to make sure that we increase the supply to meet the demand. First, we want to make sure that we strengthen the process of recruitment upstream. We are giving out more scholarships and more training awards, and these will strengthen the pipeline of people coming through to the sector. Second, what we are going to do is to review the career pathways and progression for people to find it attractive and professionally challenging to stay in the sector. Third, we want to make sure that in terms of retention of manpower, we will be able to stretch the career of the early childhood professionals so that we reduce the churn in the sector and also to reduce the training resources we need to pump into this sector. And the last thing is getting the sites right. So, we have placed a lot of emphasis on areas with a larger population of younger families, for example, Woodlands, Punggol, Pasir Ris, Sengkang and some parts of Yishun Town itself. In the eastern part of Yishun Town, we have a lot of new families coming on board.",5,68,2014-09-09-T-008-S-00068
2014-09-09-T-008,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"So, these are various things that we are doing to make sure that we better match the demand and the supply of childcare.",6,69,2014-09-09-T-008-S-00069
2014-09-09-T-008,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Finally, if I may just share, the structure of the sector is a bit different from some other industries. In this sector, we will have to work very closely with the operators in managing the supply and the demand of child care because this sector is operated by a number of Anchor Operators and many more private operators. So, we have to talk to operators to make sure that they work with us to provide the career opportunities for the teachers to be recruited in the sector and to stay in the sector.",7,70,2014-09-09-T-008-S-00070
2014-09-09-T-008,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Last but not least, for many of the places like Yishun, what we are seeing is that childcare places are available but the critical shortage is in the recruitment of the teachers. And we have seen some innovative ideas from some other estates whereby they recruit part-timers and women who are hoping to return to work after bringing up their children. And these are auxiliary manpower that we can quickly get in to staff the centres. So, the availability of childcare places is not necessarily the bottleneck for Yishun. It is the recruitment of the educarers that are required and we welcome suggestions on how we can strengthen this pipeline, especially in a very labour-tight market.",8,71,2014-09-09-T-008-S-00071

2014-09-09-T-008,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Thank you, Madam. I have a couple of supplementary questions. May I know what is the percentage of those who are undergoing training as preschool teachers who will eventually end up as preschool teachers? Is there a high attrition rate for those who undergo the training programme but did not end up as preschool teachers? My second question is about the traineeship programme for the early childhood sector. I think the Minister probably touched on this a little bit earlier, but I am wondering if a part-time scheme or flexi-adjunct scheme for stay-at-home mothers can be introduced under this traineeship programme, to encourage more stay-at-home mothers to come out and join the preschool sectors as educarers or teachers.",1,73,2014-09-09-T-008-S-00073
2014-09-09-T-008,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mdm Speaker, in response to the first supplementary question from Dr Intan, yes, indeed, the attrition rate is higher than what we would like it to be. We want to bring this down, which is why we are working closely with MOE and the ASPIRE Committee. The first thing we need to do better is to make sure that we counsel the people taking up early childhood care and development courses, that they must have a passion and they must be prepared to undertake the work in the sector. Like many other sectors in the Polytechnics or even in the ITE, there would be people who took up the courses but eventually did not take on the particular job there. I do not have the exact attrition rate but I know that it is much higher than what I would like it to be. I can get the numbers for the Member subsequently. So, this is what we want to do – to reduce the attrition from the pipeline. That is something that we need to work together with the operators and also do counselling.",1,74,2014-09-09-T-008-S-00074
2014-09-09-T-008,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On her second question on the flexi scheme, as she called it, indeed, that is what we are working closely with the operators to do, not just for the women who are returning to work but also some of the people who have recently retired and are able to play a role in the sector.",2,75,2014-09-09-T-008-S-00075
2014-09-09-T-008,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In fact, we are prepared to be very flexible to get the manpower into the sector. Recently, we started a scheme, which is to have a registry of all the people who have just left the sector or who have retired from the sector, for them to come back as part-timers to join us as and when they want. They not only provide a ready source of manpower, they also provide supplementary manpower for our own teachers in the sector to go for training. Without them, it will be very difficult for our teachers to upgrade themselves. So, we are doing all this and we will continue to welcome any ideas in order to supplement the manpower in this case.",3,76,2014-09-09-T-008-S-00076

2014-09-09-T-008,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"I would like to ask the Minister whether the Ministry can take on a more structured way of recruiting on a nation-wide basis – give them more incentives and, perhaps, make the training simpler. I was told that for infant carers, they need to go through a certain duration of training. So, if you were to recruit some of those housewives who are very good in caring and have the experience in caring of babies, if you asked them to go and study, they would say, ""	Ai tak chek ah?"" or ""we have to study?"", then they would not want to come forward. Perhaps we need to put in more incentives, make the training easier, so that we can have sufficient teachers for our centres.",2,79,2014-09-09-T-008-S-00079
2014-09-09-T-008,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mdm Speaker, indeed, the issue is not the availability of childcare places but the number of people that we can recruit. For example, in Yishun, I think overall and nation-wide, in the last about five years, we have increased the number of places by three times. But the enrolment rate in Yishun is particularly high. Today, you are at about 88% to 89% enrolment, meaning the places are all filled up. The rest have to do with a bit of matching because of the differences in the level.",1,80,2014-09-09-T-008-S-00080
2014-09-09-T-008,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Indeed, we are trying to expand the number of people that we can recruit. And let me assure the Member and all Members of this House – do not think that it is our intention to make the qualifications very academic; in fact, I do not think many of the qualifications and the courses are that academic. For most trainees, we recruit them on what we call a place-and-train basis, that is, we recruit them, they show the correct aptitude, they show the skill sets and can give assurance to the parents that they are able to take care of the children, then we do the modularised training and upgrade them along the way. That helps us to bring them quickly into the workforce, into the sector, and when we need to, upgrade them on some of the handling skills.",2,81,2014-09-09-T-008-S-00081
2014-09-09-T-008,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I agree with the Member that many of our parents never went through this kind of courses but they brought us up all right, I hope so. So, what we are looking for are not academic qualifications. What we are looking for are people with the right skill sets that give assurance to the parents who leave their children with us. Some issues in terms of safety, hygiene – these are fundamental aspects of training. And at the same time, educarers must have the heart to want to care for the children. So, they are not going to go for a lot of examinations and tests on the academic side, but more on practical skills that can help them. And we are talking about educarers – we are not talking about the people who are teaching the languages, as those would need certain qualifications – with practical skill sets, and we hope that we can have these people.",3,82,2014-09-09-T-008-S-00082

I would like to ask a clarification in relation to licensed moneylenders. I have seen quite a number of residents with debts owed to licensed moneylenders, and these moneylenders, as the Senior Minister of State alluded to in his response, sometimes harassed them at the door, at the office, through many phone calls, in order to recover the debts. Can there be more done to eyeball the licensed moneylenders who may be carrying out the tactics of unlicensed moneylenders, in terms of harassment, because I do see my residents having this experience?",1,87,2014-09-09-T-009-S-00087

This could include contacting the borrowers to ask them to return the loan, or taking legal action to enforce the loan contract. However, as to the concerns raised by the Member, we know some moneylenders do resort to such tactics that the Member has alerted us to. Our point is that moneylenders cannot resort to harassment, vandalism, violence or threatening behaviour when recovering debts – the very things that we try to avoid from unlicensed moneylenders. Borrowers who encounter such behaviour should report the matter to the Police for investigation.

This is an inherently fairer system as those who contribute more to congestion will pay more. The incentive for these drivers to change their time, route or mode of travel would thus be stronger.",4,107,2014-09-09-T-011-S-00107
2014-09-09-T-011,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I do not disagree with the principle of using financial disincentives to control traffic volume and, hence, alleviate traffic congestion. However, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State, has our consistent tweaking of ERP rates been confusing motorists on keeping track of and remembering the prevailing rate of a specific gantry during different time slots of the day and how effective has this scheme in addressing psychology of motorists and changing their driving behaviour? It is interesting, given that the high percentage of 78% of gantries had not changed their rate in the last three years, would this not indicate that the ERP had not helped to bring down the traffic volume across those gantries?",1,108,2014-09-09-T-011-S-00108
2014-09-09-T-011,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mdm Speaker, the ERP rates are changed when the speeds fall outside the optimal range. So, it is not an optimal speed, but it is a range. And the range is 45 km/h to 65 km/h on expressways. The reason why this is a range is so that you do not have to make ERP rate changes so frequently. Speeds have to go below 45 km/h for us to increase the rate. Speeds have to go beyond 65 km/h for us to bring down the rate. And that is precisely to address the Member's concern. We do not want to confuse the motorists too much.",1,109,2014-09-09-T-011-S-00109
2014-09-09-T-011,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Speaking as a motorist myself, I have to confess that it is probably true of many motorists that even when rate changes are announced in advance through the media, we do not always pay attention. Very often, we only pay attention when our in-vehicle unit goes ""beep"", we look at the number and realise that it looks different from the last time we were on the road. With that, the motorists take notice and then they have to make a decision on whether they should modify their travelling behaviour.",2,110,2014-09-09-T-011-S-00110
2014-09-09-T-011,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"From that perspective, we try not to adjust the rates too frequently. When it is adjusted, we also make sure that the amount is significant enough for people to take notice in the hope that this will cause them to rethink their driving behaviour. Not all will respond because even with the rate changes, they may consider that it is still well worth the time savings for them. Alternatively, they may assess that they have no better alternative but to travel in that particular time slot. But each time there is a rate change, we do notice that there are certain drivers who have changed their travelling pattern, and that is why there has been an impact on the speeds of travel on the particular stretches of road where ERP rate changes have occurred.",3,111,2014-09-09-T-011-S-00111

2014-09-09-T-012,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Careful attention is paid to the planning and design of our gas network. SP Power Grid (SPPG), which manages Singapore's gas network, must conduct a risk assessment exercise and meet the requirements set by SCDF and other authorities, before constructing a pipeline.",2,119,2014-09-09-T-012-S-00119
2014-09-09-T-012,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,All high-pressure gas pipelines are constructed using high-strength steel with anti-corrosion coating. Pipelines on the mainland are buried at a depth of 1.5 metres on average and further protected by concrete slabs to ensure pipeline integrity. Gas that is distributed to consumers is also odorised to facilitate detection in the event of any leak.,3,120,2014-09-09-T-012-S-00120
2014-09-09-T-012,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"To ensure that the pipeline network remains in good working condition, SPPG carries out various surveillance and maintenance measures, as required by the Gas Transporter Licence and relevant codes of practice such as the Gas Safety Code and Gas Supply Code. SPPG continuously monitors pipeline pressure and flow for any anomalies. It also surveys the pipeline network regularly for leaks using gas detectors. Such surveys are conducted more frequently in crowded and residential areas. For example, SPPG inspects the pipelines in the vicinity of MRT stations on a monthly basis, while non-residential areas are surveyed on an annual basis.",4,121,2014-09-09-T-012-S-00121
2014-09-09-T-012,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"In addition, SPPG conducts annual mechanical inspections of critical pipeline components and inspects high-pressure pipelines using pipeline inspection gauges every five years to ensure that the pipelines remain in good working conditions.

2014-09-09-T-012,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"The service life of gas pipelines is about 50 years. SPPG systematically replaces pipelines before the end of their service lives, or earlier if the condition of these pipelines is found to have deteriorated. Our high-pressure pipelines are less than 20 years old, so they are well within the estimated service lifespan.",6,123,2014-09-09-T-012-S-00123
2014-09-09-T-012,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"As for water pipes, PUB's water mains are relatively new, with an average age of 24 years. Since the 1980s, older pipes have been systematically replaced with cement-lined ductile iron and steel mains, which are more durable and have an expected lifespan of 70 years. A strict maintenance regime is in place to ensure that our water pipes remain in good working condition. There is a dynamic leak detection programme in which all water pipes are checked for leaks at least once a year. Our leak rate is six leaks per 100 km of pipes each year, which is among the lowest in the world.",7,124,2014-09-09-T-012-S-00124
2014-09-09-T-012,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Nee Soon),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State what lessons can be learnt from the Taiwanese experience, as well as what is the possibility of such an incident happening in Singapore. I would also like to ask, for example, about water pipes. There are ground movements and as Members of Parliament, we do receive complaints from residents about water pipe leakages as well as bursting of pipes. Water pipes may not be as dangerous as gas pipes. So, I am just wondering what other measures are taken to make sure that such instances do not happen, and in the past, how many of such cases have happened in Singapore.",1,125,2014-09-09-T-012-S-00125
2014-09-09-T-012,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Madam, in the Taiwanese case, the recent explosion is due to a pipeline supplying petrochemicals to a chemical plant. The gas carried there is propene (C3H6), which is different from the natural gas that our SPPG is distributing. Propene is a heavier gas than air. So, when it leaks, it tends to stay underground until it gathers a bigger mass, which makes it more dangerous. Whereas natural gas, in our case, is lighter. So, if it leaks, it tends to dissipate into the air quickly, therefore, reducing a volume build-up and explosion.",1,126,2014-09-09-T-012-S-00126
2014-09-09-T-012,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Having said that, they are all inflammable. The results of the investigation in Taiwan have not been released, so, we probably can take some lessons from that incident at a later stage. In the case of Singapore, I mentioned SPPG being the one that manages our natural gas distribution pipelines on the mainland mostly, whereas our petrochemical pipelines are mostly concentrated on Jurong Island. And therefore, they are supervised by SCDF which imposes in them another and more stringent set of construction, operation and maintenance regime. We have confidence that the two sets of pipelines are separately managed, and there is sufficient rigour and robustness in the way that they are maintained and operated.",2,127,2014-09-09-T-012-S-00127
2014-09-09-T-012,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"The Member also asked about the frequency of leaks. For high-pressure gas pipelines, there was one case that took place in 2012 on Jurong Island. The leak was detected early, so there was no casualty or fatality. It was rectified in a relatively short time, as the gas supply was resumed after a short while.",3,128,2014-09-09-T-012-S-00128
2014-09-09-T-012,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Over the last five years, there were 500 minor gas leaks – 300 were detected by SPPG and 200 were reported.

Perhaps, living in mature estates presents more difficulty for children to want to move in close to their parents. May I ask the Minister's clarification on this particular issue, where in a mature estate, for example, the constituency I serve, Ulu Pandan, there is limited space to build more flats. HDB is good at finding pockets of space and building flats, and children would move into those flats to be close to their parents. But the parents usually live in older flats which are possibly coming up for en bloc development. My question is  would HDB look at it in a considered fashion to try to find space even for the older flats to undergo en bloc within that mature estate setting? I know it may be a tall order, but I would be grateful if consideration could be given for that.",1,145,2014-09-09-T-014-S-00145
2014-09-09-T-014,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Madam, indeed, it is a tall order. And for mature estates, there are particular challenges for the simple reason that land for a big number of BTO construction is less available than in non-mature estates. But because this is such an important social objective, we try very hard and we continue to strive to the best of our abilities to fulfil those needs. There are various ways we go about it. If the Member checked back on the last three years of BTO launches, he will note that I have launched quite a number in several mature estates. Within the next 12 months, there will be several BTO launches in several mature estates. Whether these would be in the Member's ward, I do not know, but wherever possible, we try to do so.",1,146,2014-09-09-T-014-S-00146
2014-09-09-T-014,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Then, there is always the possibility of en bloc or SERS development. There is yet another avenue which is resale flat. There are a large number of resale flats, more so than the number of new flats that I can build. In fact, until this current property cycle, most people buy their flats through resale transactions – the ratio was about 60-40; 60% from resale and 40% from BTO flats.",2,147,2014-09-09-T-014-S-00147
2014-09-09-T-014,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"But the last three years have been unusual. As I step up the number of BTO launches and kept the prices very competitive, now, almost 95% of young couples buy directly from HDB. This cannot be the steady state. But now that Cash-over-Valuation (COV) has turned negative, with many transactions settled below market valuation, it opens up huge opportunities for buyers. I see that possibility growing within the next many months.",3,148,2014-09-09-T-014-S-00148

In MND, we try very hard to meet the aspirations of both parents – especially parents – and their children wanting to be able to live close by and we will do our very best. Of course, there is, yet, another option which is the parents may decide to sell off their flats and move with their children to the new towns. Theoretically, it is logical and possible, but I know many parents are very reluctant. As we have heard yesterday, they are used to the hawkers, to a particular wet market stallholder and they find it very difficult to move to a new place.

The CPF Grant that the Minister had mentioned earlier, I think, typically does not apply to these parents because they would have enjoyed previous subsidies. And, therefore, I hope that the Ministry would consider giving, perhaps, cash grants to incentivise parents to move into the new location and settle down there.",1,150,2014-09-09-T-014-S-00150

2014-09-09-T-015,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Madam, let me contextualise the availability of grilles in rental flats. Although I have mentioned that we do not put it as a standard feature today, historically, rental flats which were mainly built in the 1960s and 1970s were originally designed without window grilles. Tenants who wished to install it at that time can do so at their own cost. But over the years, as part of the Government's efforts to improve the living conditions of our rental flat tenants, window grilles were included as one of the improvement items and installed during the various upgrading programmes. For example – rental flats – the Main Upgrading Programme, the Project LIFE rental flats upgrading project.",1,165,2014-09-09-T-015-S-00165
2014-09-09-T-015,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Households with young children generally welcome the provision of these window grilles for safety reasons. However, some tenants also provide feedback that the window grilles caused a ""caged in"" kind of feeling in the smaller flats and hindered or obstructed some of their activities, for example, especially for the elderly ones, who have difficulties when they want to hang out their clothes. Therefore, HDB, after having upgraded some of these rental flats with window grilles, in 2007, we had a review and we decided to exclude window grilles as essential items for fitting in rental flats for the following reasons  one, is as mentioned, not all rental tenants need window grilles and it is consistent with the non-provision of grilles in purchase and rental flats and, at the same time, based on the feedback that we have received.",2,166,2014-09-09-T-015-S-00166
2014-09-09-T-015,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"The new rental flats which were built after 2007, when we resumed our rental building programme, were not installed with grilles. With all the upgraded rental flats today, with an existing stock of 109 blocks, we do have about 74% of them that are already provided with window grilles, meaning that three-quarters of our rental flat tenants are already living in rental flats with window grilles.",3,167,2014-09-09-T-015-S-00167
2014-09-09-T-015,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Mr Baey asked about the proportion of our tenants who are living with children below the age of 12. Today, about 15% of our rental flat tenants are made up of families or households with children below the age of 12. So, the number is quite small.",4,168,2014-09-09-T-015-S-00168
2014-09-09-T-015,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"We had another review recently, in April 2014. HDB decided to install window grilles for deserving households on a case-by-case basis if the tenant meets one of the two following guidelines  one, is that the family with young children aged below 12. For those who meet this criterion, HDB will assist them in installing the window grilles. At the same time, households where family members with medical conditions, for example, hyper activity, those with intellectual disability, or hallucinations, and there are safety concerns for these families.",5,169,2014-09-09-T-015-S-00169
2014-09-09-T-015,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"To date, we have received about 60 requests for such cases. In the last two years, HDB has assisted about 27 cases and installed the grilles for them. The others who do not meet the criteria, we asked them to seek help from FSOs, VWOs, because they are not seen as families with young children at risk or maybe having safety concerns.",6,170,2014-09-09-T-015-S-00170
2014-09-09-T-015,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Henceforth, from April this year, families with children below the age of 12 will be assisted. But as I have mentioned earlier, we do have a stock of rental flats that are already installed with grilles, and if those flats are available for tenancy, we will actually offer those to meet the needs and match the profile of families or households with children below the age of 12.",7,171,2014-09-09-T-015-S-00171

2014-09-09-T-018,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Madam, education has always been seen as the universal leveller. It allows someone from a poorer socio-economic background to secure a better job because he or she has better training and better educational qualifications and, hence, has a higher probability of success in life. In Singapore, many parents encourage their children to secure a degree in the belief that they can get a better job and secure better pay.",7,191,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00191

Very frankly, I think many parents share the same view. I am sure every parent in this House would also hope that their child can get to University. In fact, many of them would also have a bank account to provide for overseas university studies, in case their child cannot make it to the local Autonomous Universities.",12,196,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00196

How can we better explain to parents and students that a degree is still useful as a training of the mind? However, not having a degree does not mean that there will be no progress. Would our young and their parents be persuaded that there are, indeed, multiple pathways to advance in their careers? How useful would postgraduate training be in helping them deepen their skills? What kind of certifications would be issued and would these certifications be recognised?

The distinction is even more stark if one compares graduate scholars in the Civil Service and graduate scholars who are from the elite Administrative Service. Their progress or promotion depends on whether they are graduates or non-graduates, whether they are scholars from the Administrative Service. But this distinction is not real because, in the private sector, the employer looks at your skills, your experience and whether you can deliver results.",21,205,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00205

I call on the Government to take the lead in changing the mindset of Singaporeans.

The Government can take the lead by showing them that skills and experience are just as important as qualifications.",23,207,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00207
2014-09-09-T-018,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Our civil servants should be given every opportunity to progress in their careers not based on whether they have a degree; but due consideration should also be given to how they perform in the delivery of their task. One good example is the appointment of Mrs Elaine Quek – this was reported in The Straits Times. She is a non-graduate and she was appointed as principal of Maha Bodhi School. I truly hope that we can have many more similar cases in the Civil Service, where employees are promoted based on their skills and experience.",24,208,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00208
2014-09-09-T-018,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Finally, mindset change. The ASPIRE report talks about the need for a mindset change. One important change which is critical is the need for all of us to respect every job and value every individual for what they do.

Parents generally want their children to work in offices and to shun work that would require them to wear a uniform or to work in non air-conditioned places.",25,209,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00209

There is no reason why we should treat such people with less respect. Perhaps, the Government can explore ways in which skilled technicians or people with strong vocational skills or strong service skills can be better remunerated for their expertise. We can also consider redesigning some of these jobs so that they carry more responsibilities. For example, bus drivers are now called ""bus captains"" with more responsibilities for the passengers in their buses. Our cooks are now called chefs.

I was fortunate enough to be assigned to an encouraging mentor who dedicated time to setting goals for me and evaluating my progress.

2014-09-09-T-018,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, Members in this House acknowledged that there is a need for a fundamental review of the prevailing assumption in education today, key of which is the definition of success in Singapore society today and the parameters that operate under this assumption.",2,281,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00281
2014-09-09-T-018,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"For years, our society has been socialised to view a University degree as the sole means to an end – career success and economic progress in life. The Committee has taken a step forward in trying to shape and reframe existing attitudes and prevailing mindsets. We should welcome that.",3,282,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00282
2014-09-09-T-018,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"The Committee has conceived a different approach to the viewing of success and progress in Singapore society, and I believe their painstaking intents, as illustrated in the report through the various recommendations, can be realised. Indeed, the shifting of mindset is no doubt an uphill and tedious task, one that requires constant calibration and adaptation. The Government, through the ASPIRE report, has taken the lead in the reframing of mindsets. The direction, as set forth, should be complemented with efforts on the part of employers and industry players to realign their work processes and resynchronise their organisations' objectives and outcomes.",4,283,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00283
2014-09-09-T-018,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"At the same time, parents and students have their respective roles to play in this brave new world. Parents should continue to remain engaged with their children's future while simultaneously providing adequate space for them to pursue their own interests and aspirations. I see the role of a parent more as a cheerleader rather than as a director. The student himself is the director of his hopes and dreams in life. As a society, we should encourage our young minds to strive for the best with the skills they have been equipped with. Thus, parents play a fine balancing act between expressing concern for their children's future, providing them with autonomy to empower themselves at critical decision-making points in their academic and career junctures.",5,284,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00284
2014-09-09-T-018,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, for the student to better empower himself and exercise the confidence invested in him by his parents, he needs to actively inform himself with the academic and career information provided to him and immerse himself in the world beyond our shores. On this note, I would like to encourage students to step out of their comfort zones, away from the paternal culture prevalent in our education system today. It is hoped that, without the shackles of a narrow societal mindset in which one's value and contribution are solely based on University paper qualifications, the student can better express himself with greater gumption, creativity and entrepreneurial tenacity and, in doing so, start towards the future that he envisions for himself and his loved ones.",6,285,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00285
2014-09-09-T-018,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"To this end, I hope that in the not-too-distant future, applied education can be as rewarding and fulfilling as a University degree. Both would be recognised, appreciated and encouraged by members in our society.",7,286,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00286

2014-09-09-T-018,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"As a Member of this House, I support the recommendation to strengthen and coordinate Education and Career Guidance (ECG) efforts as part of an integrated National ECG Framework, in particular, the brand of end-to-end ECG, as laid out in para 2.7 of the ASPIRE report.",9,288,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00288
2014-09-09-T-018,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Making a well-informed choice is paramount. A comprehensive and continuous education and career guide in schools and institutions can have a rewarding outcome, especially considering that decisions on education options and clear opportunities can be a rather complex and risky process.",10,289,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00289
2014-09-09-T-018,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"On this, I would like to suggest that the Government include the administering of psychometric tests as part of the initiative in strengthening the ECG framework. Conducting psychometric tests, such as the DISC personality assessment, will enable students to develop a better understanding of their attributes, the special qualities that they possess and an honest reflection of their own weaknesses. An in-depth awareness of oneself will enable him to better tailor his education with his career decisions. Psychometric tests, as part of the national ECG framework, would certainly be helpful for the students in the long term.",11,290,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00290
2014-09-09-T-018,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Additionally, I hope that the system can be set in place to encourage the active involvement of parents in the planning of their child's educational progression and subsequent career prospects. Invitation to parents to attend ECG sessions at the Secondary school level should be seriously considered. In the report, it was stated that 62% and 49% of the Polytechnic and ITE students surveyed cited parents as one of their top three influences in choosing their course of study. Clearly, parents have a disproportionate influence on their child's mindset and thought processes. Thus, they need to be well-equipped to provide the necessary advice and opinions to their own child. In doing so, it would also provide parents with a realistic and rational perspective to their child's academic potential and their accompanying career opportunities.",12,291,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00291
2014-09-09-T-018,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, as part of the effort to strengthen education and training in Polytechnics and ITEs, it was highlighted in para 3.2.2 that there is a need for Polytechnics and ITEs to provide more development and support programmes to help every student succeed, no matter what his or her circumstances may be.",13,292,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00292
2014-09-09-T-018,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"On this, I would like to suggest that the Government consider strengthening the links and partnership between the Family Service Centres and the Student Affairs Centres and Counselling and Wellness Centres in Polytechnics and ITEs. These would not only ensure prompt and ready assistance, financial or otherwise, whenever needed, but it would also allow cases to reflect earlier and symptoms better addressed. Such an arrangement would be beneficial to enhancing the social and emotional competencies of the students as they navigate the consequences of their decisions. Madam, in Malay, please.",14,293,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00293

There were recent discussions and efforts made to raise the awareness that success in life is not necessarily achieved through University education but, in fact, applied education or education via the Polytechnic and ITE route can also unlock opportunities for similar success. This is the objective that the Government wants to realise through the 10 recommendations or proposals contained in the ASPIRE Review Committee report.",15,294,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00294
2014-09-09-T-018,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"The change that the ASPIRE report wants to make is to give more recognition, and also to provide career progression and success to Polytechnic and ITE graduates. This is a good step and it should be supported, and it needs the involvement of everyone who has to play their role to achieve this objective.",16,295,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00295
2014-09-09-T-018,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, all along, Singaporeans have been inculcated with the paradigm or mindset that University education is the only way to achieve success and progression in their careers and lives. A mindset change must be made if we wish to achieve the objectives set out by ASPIRE. The Government has taken the first step by initiating a mindset change through ASPIRE and all of us should take the next step to give support so that we, as a society, can work together in this effort and, together, achieve the objective of giving more recognition and also providing career progression and success to Polytechnic and ITE graduates.",17,296,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00296
2014-09-09-T-018,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, in my English speech earlier, I touched on and gave my viewpoints on two recommendations from the ASPIRE Committee.

2014-09-09-T-018,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"This is a positive step, especially for the Malay community, because we have a rather large number of students who are studying in NITEC courses in the ITEs. I hope that Malay students can take advantage of the opportunity that will be made available. This pathway will not only increase skills and knowledge, but it will also present a better chance for students to continue their studies in the Polytechnics.",20,299,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00299
2014-09-09-T-018,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, another recommendation that I would like to touch on is the recommendation on having collaboration between the Polytechnics and ITEs with MINDEF and MHA. The focus of this collaboration is to enable the Polytechnic and ITE graduates to be given vocations that are related to their course of study while they are undergoing National Service. This is to ensure that these graduates not only retain their skills and knowledge that they have gained but, at the same time, they would also gain practical experience and knowledge that are relevant to their course of study. The recommendation to give accreditation is also a good initiative. This effort is akin to the Malay saying ""while diving, you drink the water"" where many benefits can be gained while undergoing National Service. My hope is that this recommendation can be implemented well and fairly so that each ITE and Polytechnic graduate will be given equal opportunity, regardless of race or religion, especially the chance to serve in the Air Force or the Navy of the Republic of Singapore.",21,300,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00300

2014-09-09-T-018,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"University education remains important and, for students who are academically able, no efforts should be spared to ensure that they receive a world-class University education. However, there is also a need for Singapore and Singaporeans to deepen our zeal to enhance technical competency and uphold alternative pathways to success. In the years ahead of us, the composition and profiles of parliamentarians in this House can, in fact, serve as a good litmus test as to how much our society has come in recognising the value of applied education vis-a-vis a University degree. I believe, to have Prime Ministers, Chiefs in the Singapore Armed Forces, Permanent Secretaries and Heads of Civil Service from the Polytechnic or ITE route is not only a worthy aspiration, but it can be a practical reality in the not-too-distant future.",23,302,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00302
2014-09-09-T-018,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"In this regard, I hope that this national effort to improve the prospects of Polytechnic and ITE graduates can, in the longer term, expand and enrich the mindsets of our political leaders and allow this to translate into greater diversity in our leaders' perspective on talent and the recognition of success in our political discourse and the employment of talents in our Civil Service.

From sports, to cooking, to marine, our training and education landscape has, in conjunction with the trainers and educators, conjured a variety of quality training courses to serve the growing needs of our young people who find themselves more at ease with technical education and vocational training, in contrast to the conventional academic lessons in class. We must continue to help these students stretch their potential to the fullest.

In a whole kampong or even block of flats, there was only one or maybe none of these graduates. And he or she will be the buzz among the neighbours. Only a very small percentage of our population had a high level education qualification. For the rest of the population, it was primarily about getting basic education, skills and work.",4,307,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00307
2014-09-09-T-018,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Technical education, vocational training and on-the-job training were the main routes for many after Secondary school and Primary school. I was told that during the days when the British Forces were still stationed here, they even recruited students who were doing their Secondary 2 to join their vocational and technical training scheme. Their education would be taken care of and they would even be paid for on-the-job training. For those who did not sign up for the British dockyard training scheme, education was focused on the needs of the industry. Students would receive hands-on training which would help them get specific jobs when they leave school.",5,308,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00308
2014-09-09-T-018,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Then, Singapore took a different route in its economic policy after gaining Independence.

2014-09-09-T-018,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"To quickly support this rapid growth strategy, we needed to supplement the long-term education objectives with the growing demands for manpower for industry growth. I think, back then, EDB realised this and EDB started several dedicated training centres and programmes. The Manpower and Training Unit was established to focus on industrial training within Singapore. The Overseas Training Programme and Joint Government Training Centres saw many young Singaporean workers being placed in apprenticeship programmes in countries like India, Holland and Germany to learn and improve on their skills. In the marine industry, many young Singaporeans had to undergo on-the-job training and other training programmes to be groomed into skilled draftsmen, technicians and welders, more for the shipyards. The money was very good, especially for welders, because the shipbuilding industry was booming fast. Some even went to work in the Middle East and were paid even better wages in US dollars.",7,310,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00310
2014-09-09-T-018,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"As we move to value-add industries, I think our economic policy also changed, and EDB started a specialised institute to accelerate manpower development for new industries. Three institutions, in partnership with three developed nations famed for their technological advancement, were established. They were the German-Singapore Institute for Precision and Manufacturing, Japan-Singapore Institute for Software Technology and the French-Singapore Institute for Electronic and Control Systems. Our technologies were groomed in these institutes for the industries and a new term called ""the teaching factory"" was coined for these specialised institutes. I was the product of one of these specialised institutes.",8,311,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00311

We must not forget it. And we must not ditch it. Paper qualifications are not the only way to move forward or upwards. Not everyone is academically inclined. Some of us are just gifted with the abilities to use our hands and brains in the application of tools and skills.,10,313,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00313
2014-09-09-T-018,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),The objective of wanting to uplift the overall image and value of technical education and vocational training as a viable and attractive path for sustainable progress and development of our students and employees is a correct and noble one.

2014-09-09-T-018,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Having said that, Madam, I am also aware that the paper chase culture that we have in Singapore is quite entrenched and it will take some time for mindsets to change and take shape. Logic and rationale tell us that non-graduates who do not have paper credentials or qualifications should not be denied recognition and opportunities to move up the career ladder when they are clearly equipped with the relevant skills and experience. But is that ideal thought translated into real life practice in the industry?",12,315,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00315
2014-09-09-T-018,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"We should ask these hard questions of all our employers. Every now and then, we hear of good stories of ITE graduates and Polytechnic graduates who rise up to hold key positions in industries. The key reason why these stories are good and interesting is because they are not the norm but the exception. I believe more needs to be done to change the mindset on how we value our workers and their contribution beyond their qualifications. Thus, the work of the ASPIRE Committee and the follow-up implementation are very important.",13,316,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00316
2014-09-09-T-018,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"On the other hand, we should not also send the wrong message that all levels of University qualification are not important. There need to be a more holistic and balanced views of path of progress and development towards success. We are not saying that our graduates, after years of slogging for a degree, now have come to nought. Academic abilities are important but they must also be pegged with relevant practical skills. You must be able to value and recognise the importance of practical and implementable skill sets. It is pointless to have a degree in business when you do not actually have practical knowledge and skills to run a business. Or, what good is an architect if there are no welders, artisans, draughtsmen, bricklayers, to put his ideas into reality? Thus, we must value workers for their contribution and service but not only their paper qualifications.",14,317,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00317
2014-09-09-T-018,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mdm Speaker, another point that I would like to highlight is the vital link between training and industry. The link between the industry and training must be of high relevancy, and it must also be seamless. Training should eventually contribute to the industry and one's job. Lifelong learning and upgrading opportunities should not be about getting a higher or better qualification for the sake of the paper chase. There should also be upgrading opportunities for specialised skills and craftsmanship. Workers should be incentivised and motivated to go for such upgrading of skills. Specialisation and craftsmanship should be properly rewarded and recognised. Over time, society and community will begin to understand the value of these highly regarded jobs and skills.",15,318,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00318

In Germany, training for vocations is usually done by a dual programme of training and theoretical education. Students work three or four days a week at a partner company as apprentices or interns. The remaining one or two days are spent doing theory lessons in school. This apprenticeship lasts about two to three or three-and-a-half years.",16,319,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00319

2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Mdm Speaker, I support this Motion that can set the tone for our society. I thank Senior Minister of State Indranee Rajah for her leadership and the ASPIRE Committee for their tremendous efforts.",1,333,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00333
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Hon Members in this House have given thoughtful and constructive ideas. I commend, in particular, our Nominated Members who made their maiden speeches – Mr K Karthikeyan, who spoke of his experience in the industry, and Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein who spoke from his experience as an employer.",2,334,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00334
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"When the ASPIRE report was presented, I was happy to accept, on behalf of the Government, the recommendations in full. I appreciate the report for the highly consultative approach in the vein of Our Singapore Conversation, engaging many stakeholders on a significant scale – Polytechnic and ITE students, parents, alumni, staff, employers, workers.",3,335,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00335
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"I appreciate how faithful ASPIRE's strategies are to Singaporean's aspirations to build a society of opportunities, regardless of our starting points. The report addresses the needs of Polytechnic and ITE students. Senior Minister of State Indranee and I have interacted with many of them. We applaud their spirit. We are determined to help them succeed, and that is why we are strongly supporting the many interesting ideas that came out – structured internships, Place-and-Train programmes, Higher NITEC places, online learning, better development programmes in the campuses and so on.",4,336,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00336
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"I also appreciate its deep insights. Although the report focuses on Polytechnic and ITE education, its findings can transform our beliefs about education and learning in all areas – in our schools, in our Institutes of Higher Learning, in the Universities, at the workplace.",5,337,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00337
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"I would also like to thank Mr Zainudin for giving us a history of the Polytechnic and ITE education in Singapore. I am happy to say that we are not fixing a broken system. In fact, the Polytechnic and ITE education in Singapore is first-rate. It has allowed many Singaporeans to make good progress and it is widely admired around the world. ASPIRE represents the forward thinking and planning in our policymaking. It represents a way that we respond to the aspirations of Singaporeans.",6,338,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00338
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Members would agree that our beliefs can shape our choices. Our beliefs can either limit or expand opportunities. My remarks will address three beliefs about qualifications that limit our potential, how ASPIRE breaks through these limiting beliefs and the actions that we must take to break through these limits.",7,339,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00339
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"The first limiting belief is that qualifications are all that matter to get a good job, to get a good life. This is limiting because the highest qualifications will do a person no good if there are no good jobs available in the first place. And, indeed, in many parts of Europe, even nearer home – Taiwan and other examples – we see highly educated people without a job because the economy does not create jobs for them – for structural or cyclical reasons. It is very painful.",8,340,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00340
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"The belief that qualifications are all that matter is also limiting because there is a variety of jobs out there requiring us to learn in different ways in all our life. Some jobs require degrees, some jobs do not. Some, like heart surgeons, for instance, require deep skills that take years of postgraduate specialised training. And there are some jobs, like those of a master craftsman or master chef, that also require deep skills but which can be better acquired on the job.",9,341,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00341
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"This belief that qualifications are all that matter is also limiting because, as several hon Members have pointed out, we need a whole package of attributes to succeed. Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein mentioned about IQ, EQ and AQ. And Ms Jessica Tan yesterday mentioned about soft skills. And, indeed, qualifications are a proxy measure for some competencies and some attributes, but cannot represent the full package of attributes each of us brings to the table.",10,342,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00342
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"The second limiting belief is the opposite extreme – that qualifications do not matter at all. As several hon Members have noted, some members of the public are asking, ""Is the Government now saying that qualifications do not matter? Then why are we urging people to learn and upgrade?""",11,343,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00343
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"So, let me be clear. ASPIRE is not about dissuading Singaporeans from upgrading ourselves, or pursuing degrees, or pursuing any form of qualifications. ASPIRE is about creating opportunities for all, not creating more competition for some. ASPIRE is about keeping pathways open for all, not blocking pathways for some. Qualifications matter but they must be the right qualifications and of the right standard for what we want to do. For example, we want our doctors, nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists to each have the right qualification for the job they do. We want the engineers who certify that our buildings are safe, to be well-trained and well-qualified to do the job. We want our architects similarly to be well-qualified for the job.",12,344,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00344
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"The right qualification signifies that you have the right skills, the right combination of knowledge, application and experience. But not all qualifications matter, not if they do not help us build the right skills for what we want to do. This can happen when we seek qualifications as a paper chase rather than as a quest for skills.",13,345,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00345
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Recently, a young resident came to see me for advice. She shared that after she got her diploma, she went directly to do a private degree programme because she thought that she could get a better job and earn a better pay. But after spending tens of thousands of dollars on the programme, she now got a job that paid her at a fresh diploma holder level, about $2,000, because her company did not find her degree skills relevant. She lost three years of salary had she gone on to work, so an opportunity cost of over $70,000, plus the cost of doing this programme. What is worse is that she realised, after all this, that this line of work does not suit her strengths and interests. She was so caught up in chasing a piece of paper that she lost the chance to discover what she really cared about. Each person has a different learning and working journey. This story moved me because her family is not well off, but it is such a huge cost to them. It is only now, three years and a lot of costs later, that she is getting a good sense of what she really wants to do. Would it not have been so much better for her and her family if she could have realised this earlier?",14,346,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00346
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"By sheer coincidence, last evening, at my Meet-the-People Session (MPS), I had a chance to play an untrained educational and career guidance officer. The father of this young lady had come to see me a few weeks back asking me for help to get his daughter to a University, any University. I asked him to ask his daughter to come and see me instead because I wanted to understand what I could do for her.",15,347,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00347
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Last evening, she came and I found out that she had a diploma from one of our Polytechnics. She was very interested in communications and design. I asked her why she wanted to do a degree, and she said because it would allow her to do better. I was really impressed by this young lady. She was full of zest for learning and wanting to do well. I explored a number of options with her as to what her career interests were, what her passion was and what she enjoyed learning and doing most. And she told me that she is very keen to learn how to marry communications with design and with planning. And I said that is very good and, in fact, there a number of useful courses in our Polytechnics for doing that. Since I am an untrained career counsellor, I told her to send me a longer note on what she is really interested in doing and what her career plans are and I will get someone trained and well-versed in this industry to advise her.",16,348,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00348
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),I feel strongly that we must provide better career and education guidance to our young people. And our captains of industries must come out and explain what they are looking for.,17,349,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00349
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"The third limiting belief is, that if others are better qualified, I would lose out. Is it true that if Polytechnic and ITE students learn better, the value of degrees will go down? Again, this is very limiting. The opposite is true – when our friends and colleagues can do a better job, we all benefit.",18,350,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00350
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Just think about this  what does it take to make a visitor to Singapore to have a great experience? From the airline pilot, to the cabin crew, to the moment he lands at the airport, the way that our counter staff deals with him, to our taxi driver, to the baggage handler, to the frontline staff at the hotels, in the restaurants, in the places of interest – everyone will have some role to play in making it a great experience. Not to mention the architects and the engineers who designed all these attractions. Not to mention the technicians and the cleaners who maintain these facilities. In fact, the more that each of us can do our part, the more that each of us is highly skilled and can do a great job, the more we create the right conditions for everyone to thrive.",19,351,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00351
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"In fact, this is the Singapore story. We enjoy a better standard of living because we work as a team and we earn others' respect and we earn a premium for being team players, for cheering one another on, for helping one another to do better. Think about it, if we do not have enough skilled people, investors will not even come in the first place.",20,352,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00352
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Those are the three limiting ideas. The ASPIRE report encourages us to break through these limiting beliefs, to think anew about qualifications, jobs and opportunities. Breakthrough number one is to go beyond qualifications to the pursuit of excellence by recognising that attitude, deep skills, knowledge and experience matter if we want to perform and excel.",21,353,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00353
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"The second breakthrough is to go beyond the classroom to recognise the value of applied learning and lifelong learning, and make the workplace a great learning place.",22,354,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00354
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"The third breakthrough is to go beyond narrow definitions of success to recognise that everyone excels at different things, in different ways and that we can all excel if we apply our minds, hands and hearts to what we do.",23,355,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00355
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Mr Zaqy Mohamad and Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked what ASPIRE's breakthrough means for the value of a degree. Does this mean that degrees no longer matter? None of these breakthroughs devalue some qualifications over others. None of these breakthroughs limits opportunities for one group of people over another. It is not about one kind of qualification versus another, one group versus another. ASPIRE seeks to support each of us on the path that best suits our personal needs and aspirations so that we can each excel and lead fulfilling, happy lives. It is about breakthroughs, not limits; widening opportunities, not narrowing them; addition, not subtraction; more, not less.",24,356,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00356
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"As hon Members have pointed out, these, indeed, add up to a major transformation, so, can we put these breakthroughs and ideas into practice? The answer is yes. The Public Service Division is doing so. In MOE, we recognise that qualifications matter for teachers and we also recognise that some teachers who did not take the degree route can develop the depth of knowledge, which, along with other qualities like care and skill at their craft, allows them to excel as teachers. All teachers should have opportunities to deepen and upgrade their skills. That is why we will be emplacing outstanding non-graduate teachers on graduate pay scale. These are teachers who have proven themselves to be excellent teachers.",25,357,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00357
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and others asked if this means that there has been a change in MOE's position. Let me assure Members that we will not just maintain but seek to raise the level of teaching. We have an important responsibility to all our children. MOE will continue to recruit graduates as we need teachers with a strong grasp of the academic subjects to help our children build their foundation, but we will also hire some non-graduates who have the passion and predisposition for teaching and help them deepen their skills.",26,358,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00358
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Let me recap that we must not be a society where paper credentials mean everything. We must also not be a society where paper credentials mean nothing. We limit ourselves if we believe that qualifications are all that matter to get a job, or the opposite – that qualifications do not matter at all. We limit ourselves if we think that some people improving their qualifications increases competition for others. If we limit ourselves this way, we block our individual ability to reach our aspirations and our collective potential to build an inclusive, fair society of opportunities for all.",27,359,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00359
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"As individuals, we can shed these limitations and see things in these terms  what are our real interests? What is the right qualification and the right form of learning that will help us to be the best at that? What are all the changing conditions around us that can affect our ability to succeed at our jobs? How can we keep learning to be ahead of these changes? And, finally, how can we support one another through our unique learning journeys to each reach our best?",28,360,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00360
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Let me now talk about the three action areas. We create opportunities for all Singaporeans to learn and succeed through multiple pathways, through multiple modes of learning in a continual progression, developing a culture of passion, recognition and respect with every part of society playing a part. It is about learning the right thing, at the right time, at the right place, in the right way, and learning all our life. This leads to three action areas – learning at every stage, learning in every way and respecting everyone.",29,361,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00361
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"First, learning at every stage. We need to have seamless integration from schools to IHLs to the workplace. Our education system must provide the broad and deep foundation for life and lifelong learning. I have spoken on this before in the MOE's Workplan Seminar last year. Mr Christopher de Souza pointed out yesterday that ASPIRE's recommendations, built on ""Every School A Good School"", applied learning programmes, and he reminded us of the Committee on University Education Pathways last year. And, indeed, this is so.",30,362,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00362

We recently added Applied Learning Programmes and Learning for Life in our Secondary schools to help students develop their life skills and to learn how to apply knowledge and to develop a lively interest of the world around them.",31,363,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00363

By deepening the structured internships and applied learning opportunities, especially for our ITE and Polytechnic students, it will help our students explore this even more deeply.",32,364,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00364
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"We will, over time, develop a seamless integration across our schools and IHLs to help students learn the right thing at the right time, while encouraging them to explore their strengths and discover the opportunities out there for them to deploy their strengths fully.",33,365,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00365
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"I appreciate Ms Denise Phua's point yesterday that we must have porosity between the pathways.

2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Let me say a few words about applied learning. Earlier on, Mr Muhd Faisal Manap spoke about applied learning as the alternative to University education. As Senior Minister of State Indranee mentioned in her opening speech, it is not. It is not one or the other. In fact, applied learning will be a key feature of our fifth University – the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and the degree programmes at UniSIM.",35,367,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00367
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"In fact, our existing Universities are all developing applied learning in some ways. The learning is two-way. It is not just the Polytechnics and ITEs learning from what the Universities are doing but, in fact, the Universities are also learning what the Polytechnics and ITEs are doing. I think this is a very healthy interchange.",36,368,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00368
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"I see the integration of theoretical and applied running throughout our education system, not just in the Polytechnics or ITEs, because this sets the foundation for future learning.

2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"The second area is to learn in every way, to embrace and encourage lifelong learning. Learning must not stop when we leave school. In fact, the more reflective we are, the more we turn each day into a learning day, and the more we can learn from everyone we meet or work with. When we share our learning experience, the wiser we get.",38,370,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00370
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"I have been very amazed at how many teachers and professors in the universities tell me how much they are learning every day from their students. These are reflective teachers, that when they reflect on how they do the lessons, whether they do it well, when they encourage students to express their views, they, too, learn from the students. We must have this habit of learning in every way. We must sow the seeds of lifelong learning in our students when they are in school.",39,371,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00371
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Beyond school, we must make learning real, relevant and meaningful. Many lecturers create simulated situations to help students learn in a real-life manner. These are useful but nothing is more real than the workplace. Great employers understand this and have plans to help staff learn the real stuff, the relevant stuff. We will work with employers to turn workplaces into great learning places, to help every Singaporean build deep skills that matter.",40,372,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00372

Indeed, we will work with SMEs, whether as individual organisations or as an association. Let me share a very inspiring story. I recently met a Polytechnic student at the National Day Rally who designed our ASPIRE logo. He had just graduated from the Polytechnic and I asked him what he was doing. He had started work with a company, very similar work to what he was taught in the Polytechnic and he is a very talented designer. It was a small company. So, I asked him, ""What was the biggest difference between studying in the Polytechnic and now doing the work?"" He said, ""Well, the difference is that in the Polytechnic, I do one project for the term. Here, I have 10 projects anytime"". So, it is extremely challenging, but he said it is also an extremely rich learning experience and that because of this variety of work, he learns such a variety of skills because every client has a different need. He gets to understand the needs of the whole spectrum of clients and his learning curve is steep, but so is his learning.",41,373,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00373

Earlier this year, I was at Silicon Valley to look at what the Americans are doing on online learning. I see that there are some very important areas that we have to pick up and that we have to learn. We will have to make a concerted effort in this area. At the same time, as Mr Heng Chee How pointed out earlier on, the unions have also been playing a very important role in working with companies, and in creating their own learning institutions, e2i and so on.

Therefore, the objective of ASPIRE is for us to break away from our customary thinking about qualifications, career and opportunities.

2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"None of these breakthroughs devalues some qualifications over others.

2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Every Stage, Every Way and Everyone. Through multiple pathways, we ensure that everyone does his best in school and in the workplace, has a passion for learning, and continuously upgrades his skills.

At the same time, they should love what they do and strive for excellence in the workplace.",56,388,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00388
2014-09-09-T-018,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"(In English)  Madam, to conclude, I addressed three limiting beliefs that hold us back from realising our full potential. I talked about three important breakthroughs that ASPIRE makes. And I shared the three areas of action for us to break through our limiting beliefs. We must learn at every stage, learn in every way, respect everyone. These are not ideals, Madam. These are imperatives. We must not limit ourselves to some places, sometimes, some people over others. We must break through into every stage, every way, everyone.",57,389,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00389

To me, the most important part of all is ""Respect Everyone"". Because at the heart of the matter, it is not just about qualifications, not just about jobs, not just about economic growth. All of this is to create conditions for Singaporeans to pursue lives of meaning, achievement and joy – every one of us, regardless of our starting point.",58,390,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00390

First of all, I would like to thank the Prime Minister for his commitment that ""Singapore must always give our people full opportunities to achieve their potential and to give every Singaporean the confidence to shoot for the stars"". I also wish to congratulate the ASPIRE Committee for the hard work done. I believe the ASPIRE recommendations have come in a timely manner, as our country's industry employers are experiencing a shortage of talent, especially at the technical mid-management level, and, as the recent #AskPMLee sessions noted, a degree of dissatisfaction amongst our nation's students. In this context, I am thus in full support of educational reform in the name of applicability and accessibility.",2,393,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00393

2014-09-09-T-018,Rita Soh Siow Lan,Ms Rita Soh Siow Lan (Nominated Member),"As a qualified professional architect with over 25 years of experience in the building and construction industry, I can affirm that the skills-based approach of the ASPIRE recommendations has great industrial relevance, particularly in the field of architecture, which combines the need for scientific knowledge and artistic skills. Employers and industry professionals alike have noticed with frustration a steep decline in the value of craftsmanship amongst incoming batches of graduates.",5,396,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00396
2014-09-09-T-018,Rita Soh Siow Lan,Ms Rita Soh Siow Lan (Nominated Member),"The element of cultivated artisanship, of refining one's skills and priding oneself on it, has, indeed, taken a backseat in the relentless paper chase as professional success becomes increasingly defined by the number of degrees one holds.",6,397,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00397
2014-09-09-T-018,Rita Soh Siow Lan,Ms Rita Soh Siow Lan (Nominated Member),"Of course, employers, too, have a part to play in affecting this work climate, and we should, henceforth, be careful not to let such arbitrary degree bias affect our hiring decisions. The ASPIRE Committee's movement to instate benchmarks for hiring and progression with sector-specific standards should go some way towards alleviating this, though with any attempt at establishing universal criteria there must be room for nuance and flexibility.",7,398,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00398
2014-09-09-T-018,Rita Soh Siow Lan,Ms Rita Soh Siow Lan (Nominated Member),"ASPIRE can thus prove to be a turn in the tide  the mentorship and apprenticeship structure of the Place-and-Train programme will make strides in the development of our students' experiential wisdom, as they spend the sector-specific amount of time working with and building the necessary interpersonal relationships with industry professionals, which will effectively become important stepping stones in their careers ahead. Students receive the learning opportunities and valuable face time with future employers that can only come through on-the-ground experience, and their skills are put to good practical training with the promise of equitable remunerations.",8,399,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00399
2014-09-09-T-018,Rita Soh Siow Lan,Ms Rita Soh Siow Lan (Nominated Member),"The resulting collaboration and dialogue between school and industry foster a synergy that not only provides our country's employers with a competent and well-suited workforce, but also ensures our students undergo a first-hand understanding of their prospective professions that they might not have sought for otherwise, and I believe such training is a necessary part of the preparatory curriculum.",9,400,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00400
2014-09-09-T-018,Rita Soh Siow Lan,Ms Rita Soh Siow Lan (Nominated Member),"It is with this spirit that I look forward to the implementation of the aforementioned recommendation. At the same time, I believe that this bid to strengthen our country's skills-based education will not grow in opposition to but, in fact, will inspire similar initiatives in the Humanities and the Arts. For while we equip our students with the skills needed for industry, our education system is also responsible for their growth and development as self-fulfilled adult individuals, which I believe cannot happen without a firm grounding in or at least personal acquaintance with the Humanities and the Arts.",10,401,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00401
2014-09-09-T-018,Rita Soh Siow Lan,Ms Rita Soh Siow Lan (Nominated Member),"Arts and culture in Singapore are often framed outside of civic engagement or even more meaningful productive activity and any attention paid to them is usually, as in the case with most urban politics, expressed within the conversation of attracting tourism and economic development, rather than creative self-expression or self-fulfilment. This tendency for Singaporeans to distill everything into its pragmatic value has suffocated the intellectual and artistic capacities of our youth  the fact that the motivation for tertiary education can be so easily abbreviated into a degree chase for higher professional salaries instead of a personal thirst for knowledge is one such indicator of this trend. The loss of craftsmanship I mentioned earlier is, in fact, reflective of a deeper societal attitude that needs to be worked on.",11,402,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00402
2014-09-09-T-018,Rita Soh Siow Lan,Ms Rita Soh Siow Lan (Nominated Member),"Our students are people before they are commodities in the labour market. Madam, we need to see every child as an individual with their own talents and gifts and the entitlement to an individualised education that goes beyond simple behavioural modification to comply to a particular set of industry norms. This will be the first step towards inculcating a broader curiosity in the world, so that our students realise their own gifts and develop a sense of purpose and willingness to work towards the mastery of these gifts.",12,403,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00403
2014-09-09-T-018,Rita Soh Siow Lan,Ms Rita Soh Siow Lan (Nominated Member),"The ASPIRE report briefly touches upon the emotional development of the students but only nominally and the recommendations seem to go the way of token gestures by HR departments to create ""better working environments"" without doing anything substantial. Personal growth goes beyond financial support and a hotline.",13,404,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00404
2014-09-09-T-018,Rita Soh Siow Lan,Ms Rita Soh Siow Lan (Nominated Member),"The so-called ""soft skills"" should also be the primary focus of ASPIRE, as well as the education initiatives to come. As such, we first have to eradicate the notion of arts and culture as deeply elitist, and place it at the centre of a holistic education. We need to create and foster cultural equity by providing equal opportunities for arts education and, hence, remove it from the ivory tower of cultural institutions, for it is through the Arts and Humanities that we can cultivate in our country's students an integration of the head, heart and hands, which is the essence of fruitful creativity.",14,405,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00405
2014-09-09-T-018,Rita Soh Siow Lan,Ms Rita Soh Siow Lan (Nominated Member),"Our ITE and Polytechnic students must not be made to feel that they do not deserve to develop creatively and artistically, or that their education simply stops at the quick acquisition of skills for future employment. There needs to be instilled in our students a sense of personal artistic actualisation, which cannot be achieved by ownership of a degree or diploma alone. A holistic education should activate the heart; it should build confidence and self-assurance in one's own unique creativity without using a school degree as a security blanket. This self-motivated passion for utilising their artistic capacities will prove to be a key component to the success of ASPIRE, as the degree chase will fade away in the face of a personal drive towards mastery and a cultural conviction of an individual's skills as valuable in their own right.",15,406,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00406
2014-09-09-T-018,Rita Soh Siow Lan,Ms Rita Soh Siow Lan (Nominated Member),"There are already existing methodologies for holistic education we can learn from. Examples, such as Dr Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences, which was elaborated earlier by my fellow colleague, Ms Denise Phua, or Daniel H Pinks' theory on what motivates us, where factors such as autonomy, mastery and purpose are proposed channels for better performance and personal satisfaction.",16,407,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00407
2014-09-09-T-018,Rita Soh Siow Lan,Ms Rita Soh Siow Lan (Nominated Member),"In order to achieve this shift in cultural attitudes, we need to re-examine our entire preschool, Primary school and Secondary school education. Teachers will need more training in developmental science, brain-based learning and the enhancement of their students' multiple intelligences. Apart from simply updating their skill sets, we need to prepare our kids for autonomous self-directed learning, a drive towards mastery and self-discipline for deep concentration.",17,408,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00408
2014-09-09-T-018,Rita Soh Siow Lan,Ms Rita Soh Siow Lan (Nominated Member),"Moving on from ASPIRE we will thus need to further investigate our country's stance on culture and creative production. We need to build broader definitions of who and what an artist can be in our society. The pursuit of artistry should not be viewed as a leisurely indulgence, or as counter-productive to professional and industrial excellence. For the cultural health of our society, Singaporeans will have to create an environment where art is valued for its own merit, so that our children no longer see artistry, craftsmanship, skilful mastery and self-expression as merely bad financial decisions.",18,409,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00409
2014-09-09-T-018,Rita Soh Siow Lan,Ms Rita Soh Siow Lan (Nominated Member),"The Government often sees our local arts scene as self-focused, constantly asking for support, while members of the artistic community often choose not to work through the redundancy of the Government bureaucracy and start their own community-based initiatives. There has to be more mutual support between these two entities  on the part of those in Government, we need to celebrate, not dismiss or criminalise, our grassroots artistry; we need to reconfigure how we handle the processing of permits and artistic access to the community's public spaces; and, most of all, we have to start promoting art as an asset for the city, so that we may become a flourishing democracy with a strong cultural centre.",19,410,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00410
2014-09-09-T-018,Rita Soh Siow Lan,Ms Rita Soh Siow Lan (Nominated Member),"At this point, Madam, it is important to recognise the nature of our demographic make-up as a population that is witnessing a rapid rise in our median age. In Singapore's fondness for everything new and everything fresh, we should not be neglecting a significant part of our population who continue to actively seek professional dynamism in their middle age and beyond. So, while I commend the ASPIRE Committee's due diligence to ensure the sustainability of these skills-training programmes post-graduation, we need to make sure that the same opportunities and support are accessible and affordable to all ages.",20,411,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00411

I am, indeed, heartened to note that a continuing education and training masterplan is in progress, as mentioned by Senior Minister of State Ms Indranee. I believe that there must not be an age limit to the acquisition of knowledge and skills. What is especially important is the need to encourage and facilitate those in their mid-careers to have access to such facilities without having to sacrifice their careers just to acquire additional expertise.",21,412,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00412

On the part of the urban planning sector and the construction industry, we are determined to reconfigure our physical landscape in a way that is all-inclusive. Universal accessibility is a key spatial indicator of a progressive city. This concept should apply to all layers of our societal reform  we will need greater improvements in our country's physical, cultural and educational infrastructure in the name of accessibility, and we will need to move even faster to catch up with our citizens' demands and seize these new dimensions of economic opportunity.",23,414,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00414
2014-09-09-T-018,Rita Soh Siow Lan,Ms Rita Soh Siow Lan (Nominated Member),"Madam, I believe these internal shifts in culture will prove to be vital to the strengthening of our global representation, as Singapore and Singaporeans become increasingly dominant players internationally. The implementation of the ASPIRE recommendations itself will be a big step forward  instead of seeking foreign validation and certification of our abilities, our students will find enough assurance in the competitiveness of their own local training to confidently step forward as highly skilled professionals in the international arena. This will be especially relevant as local companies seek to assert a greater and bigger presence in the region and beyond.",24,415,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00415

More importantly, what they do is to reiterate this guiding philosophy.

2014-09-09-T-018,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"I would argue that the ASPIRE Committee has not gone out of its way to dispel well-established notions about the importance of University degrees. Its recommendations also do not constitute a challenge about the importance of University education. The fact is that degree holders and degree aspirants should not need anyone to argue on their behalf. Instead, what I see is a warning against leaving our students unprepared for the rigours of the workplace that is set to become more and more competitive over time.",7,423,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00423
2014-09-09-T-018,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"The ASPIRE report recognises that the ultimate aim, regardless of whether an academic pathway or an applied pathway is taken, is to equip students to make an impactful and fulfilling contribution before they enter the workforce. Being fully prepared for the workplace is the key, and the reality is that, given the right vocational training, some of our students will likely enjoy an equally, if not more, rewarding career over their University-trained counterparts.",8,424,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00424
2014-09-09-T-018,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"On the other hand, students who rush headlong and unprepared into a University degree without taking time to decide on what is most suited to their aptitude and inclination may not achieve their full potential, and may actually fall behind their vocationally-trained counterparts. There is growing concern about this, not just here in Singapore, but many advanced industrialised countries as well.",9,425,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00425
2014-09-09-T-018,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"In Singapore, the statistics on the labour market performance of degree holders already contain some warning signs. For example, resident degree holders are the only group with a re-employment rate that falls below 50%. What this means is a majority of residents succeed in gaining re-employment after losing a job, except for degree holders. This is why it is important to work with students on applied pathways to help them to understand that merely getting a degree does not place them at the leading edge in the competition for good jobs.",10,426,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00426
2014-09-09-T-018,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"Secondly, ASPIRE also addresses key economic vulnerabilities which could be attributed to our size limitations. Our size limitations prevent us from relying heavily on foreign manpower. However, in the transition to more self-reliance, we have to be careful not to end up in a precarious position which compromises our economic competitiveness, especially when it comes to employment creation.",11,427,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00427
2014-09-09-T-018,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"The Singapore economy has developed to a stage where further progress depends on access to manpower with deeper sets of skills and a broader range of capabilities than the resident workforce alone at the present stage can supply. Without freer access to foreign manpower, the economy's manpower needs cannot be satisfied by depending on education and training through the academic pathway alone.",12,428,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00428
2014-09-09-T-018,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"Driven by their bottom line, employers have to be very discerning when it comes to skills. The voracious hiring appetite over the last decade or so had been caused by employers relying on manpower to increase their productive capacity. Choosing manpower instead of investment in new capital or technology when expanding the scale of production could be a sign that employers are uncertain about the appropriate entry point they should make into new technology. Some of this could be signs of a persistent shortage of skilled manpower, which could explain why some employers are blaming the tight labour market for forcing them to curtail expansion plans.",13,429,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00429
2014-09-09-T-018,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"Regardless of the opinion one holds about our reliance on foreign manpower to make up these gaps, the fact remains that there has been a significant numerical shortfall in the availability of local manpower to meet the needs of our economy. For example, unemployed degree holders number only about one-tenth the number of Employment Pass holders. You would need to integrate all economically inactive residents with at least diploma qualifications before you match the Employment Pass numbers we now have, something that is clearly impossible. This is what I interpret the emphasis of ASPIRE on broader and deeper skills to mean  our resident workforce must broaden and deepen its skillsets and have the range to cover more positions as we continue towards further labour market tightening.",14,430,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00430

If it did, you would not see the massive rates of unemployment many OECD economies have been struck by since the great recession. For some time now, we have been constantly reminded of the lengths to which these economies have had to resort to address their unemployment woes, as observers guess at the chaos that could accompany the withdrawal of Quantitative Easing. As we move to moderate the pace at which jobs are being generated by the Singapore economy, we have to be careful to avoid severely impairing the job creation process. Once it is impaired, even literally throwing money at it may not even work.",20,436,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00436

Hence, being responsive to the needs of businesses when it comes to the shortfalls they experience in manpower supply is important. When employers can rely on well-trained, highly skilled, reliable workers, they have the confidence to invest in better equipment and technology. This produces a virtuous cycle which leads to better productivity performance and, in turn, encourages further job creation. The economy as a whole benefits from the improved competitiveness. This is the celebrated achievement of Germany's model which has attracted worldwide admiration.",21,437,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00437

This trade-off would affect whether employers decide to take trainees under their wing.

2014-09-09-T-018,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"In addition to getting employers to support and participate in the scheme, we will need qualified trainers within the participating companies. Other countries who have considered adopting Germany's model, have discovered that this key ingredient – the close relationship between its employers and training providers – was not something that they could easily replicate. Despite its highly celebrated status now, Germany's apprenticeship scheme has also seen its share of ups and downs. In the early 2000s, for example, Germany was stung by criticism over the poor performance of its students in international PISA assessments. Throughout, it was this solid arrangement of having a tradition of qualified trainers that saw it through.",25,441,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00441

Where has that sacrifice of time and resources gone when a graduate can no longer be matched to the positions available in the job market? This is not an easy question for policymakers anywhere to answer, and other economies are also grappling with the same issue.",28,444,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00444

In addition, if a person is not suitable for existing graduate-level positions, having a post-graduate degree could actually exacerbate his or her problems. Such a challenge must, therefore, be tackled at its root, with the focus set on ensuring that further education continues to enhance the human capital of Singapore's next generation of workers instead of confounding their chances. The ASPIRE recommendations demonstrate a conservative and responsible concern for this challenge.",29,445,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00445

He was reflecting on how Singapore society over-valued paper qualifications. He noted that society respected him because he was a University professor, but whenever his car broke down on the highway, he could do nothing but stand by his car while waiting for a mechanic to arrive. He said, ""I just stand there while he rescues me. Yet, nobody takes notice of him.""",1,448,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00448

This is understandable as the disparity between University graduate pay and non-graduate pay is great.",2,449,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00449

Singapore will be in trouble if it cannot offer jobs to Singaporeans because their qualifications are not in demand. We want Singaporeans to be able to find fulfilling work in Singapore and we want job vacancies to be filled by Singaporeans. At a more fundamental level, we should aim to reduce the current inequality between University graduates and non-graduates in terms of income as well as status. An egalitarian society is more stable and cohesive than one with high inequality. However, for ASPIRE to succeed, non-graduate pay must rise.",5,452,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00452
2014-09-09-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"For the remainder of my speech, Madam, I would like to share some observations about the Committee's recommendations. I will focus on Recommendation 2 on internships, Recommendation 4 on the lead institutions for key industries, Recommendation 6 on supporting students, and Recommendation 10 on skills frameworks. I will also touch on Part 2 of the Motion.",6,453,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00453
2014-09-09-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, enhancing internships. The Committee rightly noted that students' internships can be a bit of a hit-and-miss affair with a wide range of students' experiences. The move to get educational institutions and industry partners to work more closely to ensure clear and relevant learning outcomes is good. However, it is also important that students do not misunderstand this to mean that the employers owe them a living and they should be doing interesting work all the time. Learning workplace and life skills, such as getting along with colleagues, working under pressure or doing mundane tasks for the business should also be part of the learning outcomes.",7,454,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00454
2014-09-09-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Currently, I believe that there is already some form of pre-deployment consultation between the employers and lecturers supervising the student to ascertain the potential for learning during internship. The practical difficulty is usually that during the internship itself, the exigencies at the workplace will trump any training plan, leaving interns to fend for themselves or help in repetitive tasks, such as storing documents for office renovations. It would not be fair as well to hold an employer accountable if some learning outcomes are not met.",8,455,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00455
2014-09-09-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Already, it is not easy to find employers to take interns in some industries. With the additional responsibilities expected of the host employer under ASPIRE, for example, providing suitable mentors, greater employer commitment and buy-in will be needed. Perhaps, one way of getting more buy-in from employers is to alleviate the current manpower demands by providing student manpower during the peak periods for the industry, or to de-conflict the internship periods among institutions to ensure employers have a steady stream of interns throughout the year. Perhaps, the lead institution appointed for each industry sector could look into this.",9,456,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00456
2014-09-09-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Students currently do internships from between two months and six months, but this may not be enough in certain industries. It would be good if companies could get involved earlier in the education process to ensure students are market-ready. One good example today is Temasek Polytechnic's Lufthansa Technical Training Centre, which provides training for the Polytechnic's aviation students, which helps prepare them for an industry accreditation recognised by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. We should encourage more of such collaborations.",10,457,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00457
2014-09-09-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, Recommendation 4  role of lead institutions. The Committee has recommended designating a key Polytechnic or ITE college as a lead institution, to co-ordinate efforts in working with different stakeholders. It was stated that the lead institution should work with the relevant economic agencies, employers and other stakeholders to ensure course offerings are relevant and to partner them in internships and industry projects. It was further stated that all institutions and students would be able to benefit.",11,458,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00458
2014-09-09-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I would like to ask whether the lead institution would have any advantage for itself by doing the co-ordination role. For instance, if a lead institution is appointed for the hospitality industry, does this mean that it will have priority for research projects in hospitality, or is the lead institution just a co-ordinator who will have to open up projects to all institutions for discussion? As for the academic programmes themselves, will non-lead institutions continue to run them, or does the Ministry expect some sort of rationalisation, that is, individual institutions concentrating on certain industries?",12,459,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00459
2014-09-09-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, Recommendation 6  more development and support for students. The Committee highlighted the challenges that some students face in their studies, due to their different abilities and family difficulties. It was stated that there were adequate financial schemes to cater to the financial needs of students. However, it should not be assumed that all is well on the financial front. My own observation is that not all students who need the schemes eventually get helped by them. Families in financial difficulties are often unstable, with some even selling their homes and moving to stay in Johor Bahru. Some parents perceive the application process for financial aid as cumbersome; some even pressure their children to work or even to stop studies to work full-time. These cases need strong guidance and support.",13,460,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00460
2014-09-09-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The Committee suggested that Polytechnics and ITE offer more development programmes to strengthen students' resilience. However, I would like to suggest that it is important to beef up the capabilities of staff as well, to help students undergoing emotional or financial stress. Besides having counsellors or specialists in sufficient numbers in educational institutions, academic staff should also receive sufficient baseline training to better support their students, since they are the ones who see the students regularly and know them well.",14,461,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00461
2014-09-09-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, Recommendation 10  sector-specific skills frameworks and career progression pathways. ASPIRE recommends developing sector-specific skills frameworks linked to progression pathways for each sector to serve as national benchmarks. The intention is for all employers and employees in a particular sector to have a common reference point, to facilitate promotion based on skills. The intention is a good one. However, it is not an easy task to devise skills frameworks and progression pathways which are credible and usable across an entire sector.",15,462,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00462
2014-09-09-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"While getting the frameworks and pathways in place is one thing, making them effective to improve salaries is another. A case in point is the private security industry. For about a decade, a CET framework under the WSQ (Workforce Skills Qualification) scheme was devised. It aimed at imparting specific skillsets to security officers and supervisors, to enable them to be more professional and improve career paths. Yet, despite evidence that standards have risen and job scopes have increased, and despite a market shortage which can only be filled by locals and Malaysians, it remains a low-wage industry. Employers were also reluctant to send their staff for non-compulsory courses for two main reasons  first, more costs may have to be incurred to hire cover staff, and secondly, staff would expect to have pay increases after completing the courses. While each industry is different, I believe this experience with the private security industry may hold lessons for other sectors on the possible challenges and buy-in needed to make the frameworks and pathways produce results, to create the ""virtuous cycle"" we aim for.",16,463,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00463
2014-09-09-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, I next move on to Part 2 of the Motion. The second part of the Motion calls upon this House to support a tripartite approach to instil a culture of lifelong learning and a reward system based on skills and performance. Instilling a culture of lifelong learning and having a reward system based on skills and performance, rather than qualifications, is easier said than done.",17,464,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00464
2014-09-09-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"For instance, an employer committed to lifelong learning will have to accommodate release of staff for courses and even hire cover staff, which can be disruptive. Educational institutions and course participants will also need to be flexible to accommodate work exigencies. I have personally had the experience of co-ordinating CET courses at my former workplace, where we had large cohorts of students who were law enforcement personnel working on different shifts. Major planning on the part of the employer and the educational institution was required to enable staff to attend courses, with disruptions to course schedules due to major deployments for events, such as World Bank meetings and General Elections.",18,465,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00465
2014-09-09-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"As for rewarding staff based on skills and performance, this, too, can have its challenges. In theory, staff who are better trained and have larger job scopes are more productive and, naturally, will justify higher salaries. Ideally, with better training, the organisation's productivity and earnings would rise, and employers would share those rewards down the hierarchy. However, there is no guarantee. On the other hand, some employers may be reluctant to send their staff for training, as staff would return from training expecting a pay increase, which, in turn, would increase employers' costs.",19,466,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00466
2014-09-09-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Given the challenges of implementing ASPIRE's recommendations, an approach involving Government, employers and employees makes sense. However, as the Senior Minister of State mentioned yesterday, it cannot be limited to these stakeholders; we need the concerted effort of everyone, ""Government, industry, educational institutions, workers, unions, students, parents and educators"" to move to a new paradigm where alternatives to a degree are equally respected and a viable economic option.",20,467,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00467
2014-09-09-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, next, caution against discouraging academic progression. In our zeal to deepen technical competence and uphold pathways to success, we should be mindful that we do not inadvertently discourage individuals from pursuing higher academic qualifications just because of their starting point. We should ensure that ASPIRE's recommendations do not get translated into advising our ITE and Polytechnic graduates not to aspire. Where an individual has good academic potential, he should be encouraged to pursue those goals. Academic progression must always remain open. To this end, ITE graduates must be able to progress to Polytechnics, and Polytechnic graduates must be able to progress to public Universities. The recent set-up of the Singapore Institute of Technology is very welcome, as it gives Polytechnic graduates the opportunity to earn applied degrees in Singapore. Over time, our economy should be able to cater for a workforce which is not only better-trained, but better-educated.",21,468,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00468
2014-09-09-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, Madam, at the cultural and mindset level, is it possible for us to change the prevailing mindset that a degree is the baseline for a good life? In order for ASPIRE to work, each of us must believe that our own children too should be content to go through the technical pathways drawn up by ASPIRE. As many have noted, this is a tough sell for Singapore parents.",22,469,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00469
2014-09-09-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"As for employers, they should be as open as possible to looking at qualities other than paper qualifications to hire and promote people. In this regard, the private sector fares better, as it tends to be more performance-oriented in its reward system. Instead, the biggest culprit at over-emphasising qualifications might actually have been the Government itself, as has been pointed out, which has even distinguished among the graduates  scholars and non-scholars have different career progression and pay, and employees with ""good"" Honours degrees may get higher starting ranks and pay than those with ""less good"" Honours degrees; the differences between graduates and non-graduates in the Civil Service are even more stark. It is noteworthy that the Public Service Division has announced some changes and said that a review is in progress. It may be necessary to review the entire Civil Service and uniformed services' hiring and promotion system; otherwise, we would only be paying lip service to the principles espoused by ASPIRE.",23,470,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00470
2014-09-09-T-018,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, in conclusion, our society can never be totally equal, and some differentiation gives incentive and motivation to work for a better life. Nevertheless, the ASPIRE's recommendations highlight the need to remedy the great divide in Singapore in the pay and standing of those with University degrees and those without.

2014-09-09-T-018,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"Yesterday, some Members raised concerns that ASPIRE's ability to succeed depended greatly on today's culture of employers, teachers, parents – and youths themselves – being ready and open to a major paradigm shift. This is not a minor concern. The fear to lose – the ""kiasu"" syndrome that we laugh about – runs long and deep in our city's children and adults. It is this fear that gives birth to our neurotic obsession with status. It is this fear that displaces our faith in our children's unique strengths and interests and compels us to put our trust instead in excessive private tuition, examination results and paper qualifications as the best indicator and guarantee of future career success. So, it will be this fear that will hold many of us back from choosing ASPIRE's new way forward despite all indications that clinging onto the cultural excuse of kiasuism has been and always will be toxic for all of us. Something is wrong when some of our University graduates still feel compelled to put their PSLE results on their work resumes as if it mattered that much to an employer.",4,486,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00486

My focus group may be small and not representative of the whole but I am concerned that, over 12 years, I have never had a batch of students where there was a majority who readily said yes to all of the above. I discovered that most of their lack of enthusiasm about the working world was rooted in cynicism about what control they had over their choices, as well as a careless ignorance about the dramatic changes happening in the real world. Anything outside of the narrow constraints of examinable school curriculum was dismissed as irrelevant to their future.",6,488,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00488

Many of these students continue to memorise the Rwanda of their seniors' outdated examination notes still stuck in the 1994 genocide and failed to perceive how dramatically a country could change in 20 years. The same youths who could not see the Rwanda of 2014 that positions itself as ""The Singapore of Africa"", with some of the fastest economic growth rates in the developing world, do eventually grow up into the adults who will miss out on the best business opportunities that Africa has to offer.",7,489,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00489

2014-09-09-T-018,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"Firstly, we should protect our youths' freedom to pursue whatever path of Knowledge that is meaningful to them. When we rob our youths of their ability to choose what they want to study based on our own adult assumptions that it is ""too hard for them to score"" or ""will bring down our school ranking"" or ""will not earn you enough money in life"", we teach them very early on that no matter what people say, our society will only accept a certain pathway to success and you have no choice but to take it to its bitter end. Trying to convince them otherwise later down the road at an ITE, Polytechnic or University stage becomes extremely difficult. In 2001, 16,970 students took pure Literature at ""O"" Levels. In 2013, only 3,000 did. Anecdotal evidence suggests that it was the desire to maintain school rankings based on ""O"" Level results which led to some schools dropping Literature or actively discouraging students from taking the subject because they could not score high in it.",10,492,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00492
2014-09-09-T-018,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"Those in the arts scene will share the same observation as those in the corporate world of the results of raising less literary-minded youths – many young Singaporeans today are not strong in the soft work skills of communicating ideas deeply, analysing character behaviour objectively and understanding deep complex narratives about themselves and society.",11,493,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00493
2014-09-09-T-018,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"The late Steve Jobs created the world's most valuable brand, Apple, because he was equally developed in the seemingly unlinked skills of electrical engineering, calligraphic design and narrative construction. What exciting intellectual property we might have seen created in Singapore if more young people were given the full freedom to play with the subject combinations they want, regardless of their ability to score well in them?",12,494,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00494
2014-09-09-T-018,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"The second thing I would recommend is to give our youths early and extended exposure to all forms of work. I believe we should bring work-and-study, Place-and-Train programmes in some form even to younger students as part of examinable curriculum. In 2012, Raffles Institution introduced an innovative Gap Semester where 16-year-olds were given nine full weeks after their Year 4 final examinations to pursue non-academic interests and to make presentations on what they had learnt to their cohort. I do not see why this innovation cannot be introduced in other schools in some form. Imagine if every Singaporean teenager, from every kind of school, were given the blessing by their school system to take nine weeks off every year to intern in various industries, to consciously experience all sorts of work – blue-collar and white-collar, corporate and creative – and to earn a small allowance while they are at it. I believe parents would love it and I believe early exposure to the complex reality of the workplace is one of the best ways of helping young people discover for themselves the value of soft skills, nurturing a deep respect for all forms of work – and gaining more insight into what type of work actually suits them later on in life.",13,495,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00495
2014-09-09-T-018,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"My third recommendation is  do not just educate the youths in ""career and industry awareness"" – educate the parents and teachers as well. Parents and teachers are key influencers in any youth's career decisions. They form the ecosystem of advice and support surrounding young people, and they need just as much continual exposure to changing industrial trends and learning about where the world is going. If these adults themselves are still stuck in old narratives about what makes for valuable work and do not keep up with global market trends themselves, they may still pressure our youths to make archaic career choices that even the youths themselves do not believe in.",14,496,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00496

If we take her answer of 10-20 years, then I suggest that there is no better time than right now to take the bold and visionary steps needed to free our children and our children's children to discover a stronger and more compelling narrative about work – that all Singaporeans can do work that is meaningful for ourselves, matters to our community and makes life worth the living and learning from.

Let me inform this House that a study commissioned by WDA in 2012 found that individuals who went through the WSQ training received higher wages, compared to workers of a similar profile but without WSQ training. In fact, the returns from training were even more significant for low-wage workers. Since 2009, WDA has also carried out an Outcomes Evaluation Survey to evaluate the effectiveness of our WSQ training.

For young students, ECG aims to help them explore different areas to figure out their interests and strengths early on, and provide them with a clearer idea on the wide range of education options available. For tertiary students, it is about preparing them to enter the workforce, and helping them explore the types of careers that they wish to go into.

2014-09-09-T-018,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] I support the recommendations of the Applied Study in Polytechnics and Institute of Technical Education Review (ASPIRE) Committee because these recommendations can potentially help Polytechnic and ITE graduates to upgrade their skills and productivity, which can provide better opportunities for them in terms of their career and income.",2,534,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00534

In order to ensure that good guidance is provided, it is essential that the staff that are selected to run this programme are very knowledgeable and able to give sound advice. On this matter, I would like to suggest that MOE provide job opportunities to mature or aged workers who have long careers in certain fields and have a rich working experience and knowledge. These experienced workers can be trained to become counsellors who can give guidance to help students make good academic and career choices.",3,535,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00535
2014-09-09-T-018,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I would also like to urge MOE to encourage schools, Polytechnics and ITEs to work with the Labour Movement through nEbO, an NTUC branch that comprises union members who are youths. nEbO is spelt with a small ""n"" and ""b"" and capital ""E"" and ""O"". Unofficially, it means ""nobody enjoys being ordinary"". Presently, NTUC's nEbO is collaborating with 11 Secondary schools, ITEs and Polytechnics to organise study visits for students so that they can see and understand the careers that they are interested in. I hope that every Secondary and tertiary student will become a nEbO member in the future, so that the Labour Movement, through the unions, can help them explore their interest in their career of choice.",4,536,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00536
2014-09-09-T-018,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"ASPIRE also recommended the enhancement of the internship programme for Polytechnic and ITE students. Here, I hope that these students will be equipped with knowledge on the Employment Act. This is important to ensure that they know their rights as workers even during their internship. On this matter, too, NTUC is willing to play a part to enhance the students' awareness and knowledge about the Employment Act and the role that the unions can play to help them in terms of their employment and standard of living.",5,537,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00537
2014-09-09-T-018,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"ASPIRE also proposed to assist the deepening of skills after completing ITE and Polytechnic education. I think that this effort will achieve good results if MOE collaborates with organisations that possess the capabilities and have been providing career counselling services. The Employment and Employability Institute, or e2i, the Lifelong Learning Institute and WDA have a group of career consultants that are willing to help Polytechnic and ITE students choose the right career and can continue to help them enhance their work skills in the future. The expert resources available in these organisations must be utilised to achieve ASPIRE's goals.",6,538,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00538
2014-09-09-T-018,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"On the recommendation to develop sector-specific skills and progression frameworks with the cooperation of the industries, the Labour Movement would like to urge MOE and MOM to involve NTUC in this effort because NTUC is actively encouraging every sector to adopt a progressive wage model that provides wage increment ladders that are based on productivity, skills and career. Any framework that is developed must be transparent and fair so that it will motivate workers to upgrade their skills and productivity. For this framework to achieve the intended objectives, it is important that emphasis is given to the role and responsibility of the employer to ensure that the worker's career is based on his/her skills, productivity and responsibilities, and not solely on educational qualifications.",7,539,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00539
2014-09-09-T-018,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"ASPIRE can transform the labour force in Singapore because it presents a good future for workers who are ITE and Polytechnic graduates by enhancing the opportunity to upgrade skills that are relevant to their careers. Even so, it is important also to make efforts to change mindsets and convince the community that success in the workplace does not necessarily depend on an undergraduate degree. Success can also be achieved by deepening skills in the jobs that we are interested in.",8,540,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00540
2014-09-09-T-018,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"In this aspect, I would like to urge Mendaki and other Malay/Muslim organisations to work with MOE to lead the effort in engaging Malay/Muslim parents and students on ASPIRE. Allow me to quote a phrase from the Suara Musyawarah report, ""The committee is concerned that although many education pathways are provided to the community, the parents and the students themselves may not even be aware of the career objectives and potential that may be present with each choice."" Therefore, it is imperative that our community becomes aware of the efforts that will be taken to implement ASPIRE's recommendations, and we must make use of the available opportunities to help Malay students in the ITEs and Polytechnics to understand and achieve success in their careers.",9,541,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00541
2014-09-09-T-018,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"This effort to engage the Malay/Muslim community will also be in line with the Suara Musyawarah committee's recommendations to have a more specific public awareness programme on educational and career pathways. This may bring about a mindset shift among parents and students about ITE and Polytechnic graduates, since this group of students will possess niche skills and expertise that can be upgraded so that they can enjoy good careers.",10,542,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00542
2014-09-09-T-018,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"However, the Suara Musyawarah committee admits that the Malay/Muslim community is facing the challenge to stay competitive within Singapore's labour force. According to the Suara Musyawarah report, ""The inability or the refusal to upskill is usually linked to issues of finance and the readiness to do so, family commitments and possible disruptions to the present careers."" These are issues that may hinder the Malay/Muslim community from getting the benefits, in terms of career, that can be gained from the implementation of ASPIRE's recommendations. Hence, emphasis should continue to be given to mindset change, skills upgrading and learning within the Malay/Muslim community through the efforts of MENDAKI and other Malay/Muslim organisations.",11,543,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00543

2014-09-09-T-018,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Mdm Speaker, I speak in support of the Motion. When Prime Minister spoke about the recommendations of ASPIRE and played down the importance of getting a degree during this year's National Day Rally, it was met with strong support as well as scepticism.",1,555,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00555
2014-09-09-T-018,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Strong support because many of us know that getting a degree is not an end all and be all approach to improving one's career prospects. During one of my weekly house visits, I met a couple in their 50s. There was a huge family portrait on the wall showing three of their children wearing mortarboards. I commented that it was great for their children to be graduates. The mother of three replied, ""文凭不值钱"" or ""the degrees are no more valuable"". I asked them why and they explained that their children's salary did not improve significantly after obtaining their degrees from the private Universities. This is similar to the story narrated by Mr Heng earlier on.",2,556,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00556
2014-09-09-T-018,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Singaporeans, as with their counterparts in other Asian societies, would not hesitate to invest heavily in education. In the struggle to be educated, the pinnacle is the attainment of a University degree. That is why in Taiwan, with a population of slightly more than 23 million people, there are 163 universities. That is seven universities for every one million people. In South Korea, with a population of about 50 million, there are 411 universities or eight universities per million people. How about Singapore?",3,557,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00557
2014-09-09-T-018,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"When I check a website for the list of Universities in Singapore, I am surprised to learn that there are 30 Universities. Besides the six public Universities, the rest are mainly private Universities, and many of which I come across for the first time. Thirty Universities for a population of five million people in Singapore, it works out to be about six Universities for every one million people, not too far away from Korea and Taiwan. Certainly, we have to count the enrolment figures for each of the Universities so as to make a fair comparison across the different countries, but the number of Universities could still serve as a good proxy.",4,558,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00558
2014-09-09-T-018,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Is having too many private Universities a problem? At least Taiwan admitted so. The unemployment rate among the Taiwan graduates is high. One in five recent young graduates in Taiwan could not find a job within one year of graduation. Thus, Taiwan is taking steps to reduce the number of universities from 160 to about 110.",5,559,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00559
2014-09-09-T-018,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Similarly, in Singapore, we need to guard against the mushrooming of private Universities resulting in the mass proliferation of University graduates, compromising the quality of the graduates' training and lowering the value of the degree. This is especially so as we extend the university space in the public Universities. While we wait for the recommendations of ASPIRE to take effect, I urge MOE to take stock of our private Universities, tighten the academic standard, enhance the system to differentiate the better ones so that Singaporeans could obtain better value from these private Universities. We need to persuade Singaporeans not to spend excessive money to obtain a degree that does not add much value, and this is why the ASPIRE's report is timely.",6,560,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00560
2014-09-09-T-018,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"However, what is even more important is how the ASPIRE's recommendations are implemented. As indicated by many speakers before me, the Civil Service needs to take a lead in making the changes.",7,561,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00561
2014-09-09-T-018,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"When I started my career in the Police Force more than 20 years ago, I realised that there was a clear demarcation of career paths for diploma holders, normal graduates and overseas scholars. Their career paths hardly crossed. For example, non-graduates started off as Junior Police Officers and it would take years or even decades for them to be promoted to the rank of Inspector, the lowest of the rank of senior officers. Returned overseas scholars receive higher pay even if they are of the same rank as the local graduates, regardless of their performance. I must say that most overseas scholars generally perform much better than the other graduates. However, there are some who do not perform as well and that sours the feelings of the majority of the Police officers. I understand that similar situations occur in the Army and many other Government departments. It is probably a lot better off today as compared to two decades ago but there is still room for improvement, particularly to allow civil servants with different qualifications to compete on a more even ground.",8,562,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00562
2014-09-09-T-018,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"It does not take too long for a non-graduate officer to see where the goal post lies after the annual promotion exercise. On the ground, people use the term ""farmer"" to indicate civil servants who do not have a degree or scholarship. For ASPIRE's recommendations to be effectively implemented, the perception that ""once a farmer always a farmer"" in the Civil Service has to be demolished; otherwise, many will remain skeptical about ASPIRE's good intention.",9,563,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00563
2014-09-09-T-018,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"I am, therefore, heartened to hear Prime Minister Lee announcing a review on the human resource policy within the Civil Service.

2014-09-09-T-018,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"In summary, I applaud the effort to change the mindset that ""obtaining a degree is the only ticket to a better career"". However, we need to be mindful that the change process takes time and MOE needs to do more to improve the quality of the courses offered by the private universities in Singapore. Last but not least, the Civil Service needs to take the lead to even the playing field for officers with different qualifications.",11,565,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00565

2014-09-09-T-018,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"A fundamental tenet underlying the Committee's approach was that all Singaporeans should have opportunities to realise their full potential and progress in life, regardless of their starting point. Many Members of this House have spoken about this and I, too, strongly support this key tenet.

2014-09-09-T-018,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"In a young and developing country like Singapore, it is important that every citizen is developed to the best of his or her ability and, as far as possible, every citizen should be helped to achieve a position where he can best contribute to society and also find the most fulfilment. As such, this message, that opportunities will be given to all, regardless of academic qualifications, needs to be disseminated to all strata of our society, all stakeholders, employers, employees, students as well as parents.",3,568,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00568
2014-09-09-T-018,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"I think the central factor to this exercise is how our country and we, as a people, define and celebrate success, and also how we treat and value people and respect every job. It seems naturally ingrained in us that we want to do well and to hope that our children can be successful. Like all parents, we are hopeful that the next generation will do better than the one before. But how do we define what is ""better"" or ""successful""?",4,569,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00569
2014-09-09-T-018,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Meritocracy is an essential and integral part of Singapore's political and social culture for years and academic qualification is often viewed as a stepping stone to getting a secured future, grounded in a good job with better pay.

2014-09-09-T-018,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"In the minds of some, this has mutated into a sense of entitlement, where there is a belief that once a person has a degree, regardless of what one wants to do, that person should be given a job with pay commensurate to the degree. I must reiterate that I am not at all saying that degrees are no longer valuable or worth pursuing. Rather, it is the pursuit for degrees sake, regardless of its relevance to the worker or his job that needs validating. Big changes in mindsets will be called for if this mental shift is to be practicable.",6,571,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00571
2014-09-09-T-018,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Whilst meritocracy has transformed our country from Third to First world in a short span of 49 years and benefited Singapore and its citizens, it can be argued that the time has come for us to relook this primary ""key"" which unlocks the doors to opportunities. Can there not be other alternative keys which may also unlock those same doors? Or perhaps the issue can be seen in another way, where the idea of ""meritocracy"" is not equated or so closely intertwined with ""academic achievements"", such that other forms of achievement can also be recognised on equal footing as ""meritocracy""? I submit that such non-academic achievement must include work skills, experience, or even recognised knowledge acquired possibly in ways not linked to examinations or written tests. In essence, we must strive for a fair meritocracy to ensure that equal opportunities will benefit all segments of our society.",7,572,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00572

Under the Pell Grant Program, it costs the American taxpayers more than US$30 billion each year and yet American students periodically do not do as well comparatively. On the other hand, Germany's vocation trainings are based on the enlightened view that not everyone will benefit from a university education. The expensive resources can be better allocated elsewhere. A notable success story of Germany's new belief system is the famous chef, Claus-Peter Lumpp.",16,581,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00581

His mother gave him permission to leave school, but only if he found an apprenticeship. Lumpp landed one in the kitchen of the Hotel Bareiss in 1982. Today, Lumpp's Restaurant Bareiss has a three-star rating from the prestigious Michelin guide and most of the chefs in his kitchen were mentored under the same system that brought his talents to the fore. As a result of this system, few Germans find themselves unemployable. The youth unemployment rate, for example, was just 7.7% in February, well below that of the US and the euro zone as a whole at 23.9%.",17,582,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00582

At 50 years, she found it daunting to go back to school but her determination and resilience saw her achieving an almost perfect GPA of 3.94 which earned her the Tay Eng Soon Gold Medal. She currently works at Dover Park Hospice and will be pursuing a Diploma in Nursing course starting this October. Lay Kian demonstrates an inspiring sense of determination and resilience. This quality is more important than any paper qualifications. At her age, she continued to pursue lifelong learning even when it was difficult. Learning new skills when one has gone past the conventional school-going age is never easy, but Lay Kian has shown us that personal determination and resilience can make it possible.",22,587,2014-09-09-T-018-S-00587
2014-09-09-T-018,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"In closing, let us not allow any lack of paper qualifications, even age, be barriers to have a fulfilling and rewarding career. Older workers can aspire too and should be given equal opportunities. I urge employers, parents and education institutions to come together and value our precious human talents regardless of their starting points. Let us re-define ""success"" and embrace a fair meritocracy that will uplift all segments of our society, providing each with equal opportunities and many pathways to achieve their own aspirations. Indeed, we are not scaling to reach a single summit but enabling all of us to reach the many different peaks of a wide mountain range.

The ALP focuses on the application of skills in the real world and is taught through problem solving, supporting tie-ups with industry partners. And for the LLP, it focuses on real-world experiential learning to develop character and values, through community outreach programmes or service learning projects.

The CUEP report recommended an applied degree pathway which emphasises a practice-orientation, learning through work, industry focus, to be offered by the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and SIM University (UniSIM).

That is why the ASPIRE Committee came in at this stage. What you can see, therefore, is that we have introduced the idea of applied learning at the Primary and Secondary schools, then we have put it in place for University.

Some will choose a more academic path; some will choose a more applied path. Even then, they are not mutually exclusive. That is the important thing to remember. Even if you are going on the academic route, there will be applied elements. In fact, NUS and NTU have partnerships with industry and they are now also looking into strengthening internships.

Many Members have called for the public sector to take the lead. We should look at this in perspective. The Government and public sector agencies employ 4% of the total workforce. The small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) employ 70%. Multinational corporations (MNCs), both home-grown and foreign, and the social services employ the rest. In terms of the overall numbers of people employed, or the total workforce, the percentage employed by the Government is very small.

For the Civil Service, it adheres to the policy of hiring on merit, so the most suitable candidate is selected for the job. For new jobseekers at entry level jobs, the educational qualifications would have to serve as a proxy because you do not know the person, you do not know their capabilities yet. So, that is entry level. And some jobs require a degree; some do not. So, when recruiting, the Civil Service will indicate what kind of qualification is required according to job type. And there will be certain professional fields where professional accreditation is required, for example, medical or engineering. In such cases, the applicants will have to meet the requirements.",16,606,2014-09-09-T-020-S-00606

2014-09-09-T-020,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"We have drawn from what we have seen, for example apprenticeships and career guidance, but we have woven it into our own context, our economic structure and our system. We are building on the strength of our Polytechnic and ITE system which we have strengthened over the years and which now have a brand of their own. We are proud of our Polytechnics and ITE, and of their students and graduates. International visitors from other education ministries and agencies are always very impressed by them.",55,645,2014-09-09-T-020-S-00645

2014-09-09-T-020,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng,"Thank you, Madam. I want to thank the Senior Minister of State and the Minister for a really good job. This, to me, is very significant for Singapore. I just want to belabour one more time the need for the public sector to take the lead. Not because it is not trying and is not doing what it is already doing. The public sector needs to put in even more effort mainly because although it hires 4% of the total workforce, it is, however, the largest employer in Singapore. And because it is so respected, people look towards it for the definition of job success.",1,651,2014-09-09-T-020-S-00651

2014-09-09-T-020,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng,"So, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State if the Committee would recommend a taskforce that goes beyond the 10 recommendations. Because the 10 recommendations, to me, are still ""outside-in approaches"". Unless that mindset, that cultural change happen, it is not going to help us get results from the 10 recommendations.",1,653,2014-09-09-T-020-S-00653
2014-09-09-T-020,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng,"So, I would like to ask if the taskforce would put in place a HR taskforce that comprises HR professionals and other leaders from the public sector, people sector and the private sector with the specific task to identify and to study rigorously which jobs need degrees and which do not, and then study the competencies that are required. Then, basically, even at the point of hire, employ people that way and pay them that way. If we can do that, then I think it is a very good start to let Singaporeans know that there are jobs that just look at competencies and not just at paper qualifications.",2,654,2014-09-09-T-020-S-00654

2014-09-09-T-020,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank Ms Phua for her unflagging support which we have seen again. On the question of drawing up competencies, that is, in fact, what the sector-specific frameworks intend to do. That was one of our recommendations and that will be a work-in-progress.",1,657,2014-09-09-T-020-S-00657
2014-09-09-T-020,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"On the public sector, as I had indicated in my answer earlier, that is something that the Public Service Division is looking at. Ms Phua and Members can rest assured that the Government is looking at this seriously.",2,658,2014-09-09-T-020-S-00658
2014-09-09-T-020,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"With regard to her other question about the taskforce and whether the Committee can make recommendations on that, first, the Committee has, in fact, done its work, which has culminated in the report which has been submitted to the Government. The ASPIRE Committee would not actually be doing further work as the Committee has ended its remit. However, I am pleased to say that Ms Phua can be assured that it is being looked at because the Prime Minister did announce that there will be an Inter-Ministerial Committee to look at it. I am happy to say that that, of course, will be under the purview of Deputy Prime Minister Tharman and that, at the appropriate time, Ms Phua may like to direct the questions to the Deputy Prime Minister after the Inter-Ministerial Committee and the expanded WDA have had the time to study these issues and to look at how it would be best to implement and take forward the ASPIRE recommendations.",3,659,2014-09-09-T-020-S-00659

2014-09-09-T-022,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, employers of Work Permit holders are required to ensure that their foreign workers have accommodation that meets the regulatory requirements of various agencies. These requirements include living space standards, structural and fire safety, as well as proper sanitation to safeguard the well-being of the occupants.",1,666,2014-09-09-T-022-S-00666
2014-09-09-T-022,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Employers can currently house foreign workers in a variety of approved accommodation, including various types of dormitories and workers' quarters. Employers may choose appropriate accommodation depending on their business requirements and the needs of the workers, provided the accommodation meets the standards set by the relevant authorities that safeguard the safety and well-being of foreign workers. A good number of workers in the construction industry is already housed in purpose-built dormitories. In a few months, we will be proposing new legislation pertaining to the regulation and licensing of purpose-built dormitories.",2,667,2014-09-09-T-022-S-00667
2014-09-09-T-022,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"At the same time, we also recognise that there are benefits to housing workers at or close to their workplaces as this reduces the need for workers to be ferried to and from their workplaces. This could provide workers with more time to rest outside of working hours, reduce traffic congestion and crowding, and hopefully also enhance workers’ productivity.",3,668,2014-09-09-T-022-S-00668
2014-09-09-T-022,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Specific to workers' quarters on construction sites, contractors must meet BCA's structural safety requirements and SCDF's fire safety standards. All workers' quarters must comply with specifications relating to ceiling height, ventilation, staircase width and lightning protection requirements. Contractors must also meet NEA's requirements for adequate and proper sanitary and bathing facilities, as well as SCDF's requirements pertaining to sufficient living space per worker. Our data shows that there are over 70,000 foreign workers living in construction quarters.",4,669,2014-09-09-T-022-S-00669
2014-09-09-T-022,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Employers must ensure that foreign worker accommodation continues to be well-maintained throughout their workers' stay in the premises, such that their well-being is not compromised. MOM actively conducts enforcement inspections, often in collaboration with relevant agencies such as NEA, SCDF and URA to ascertain that the workers' accommodation meets regulatory requirements. Over the last three years, on average, over 900 premises are checked each year.",5,670,2014-09-09-T-022-S-00670
2014-09-09-T-022,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"For each worker found housed in non-approved accommodation, employers are currently liable to a fine of up to $10,000, or imprisonment for up to 12 months, or both. These penalties were doubled only two years ago, when the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act was amended in November 2012. Errant employers will also be barred from applying for new work passes or renewing existing work passes. In addition, owners and occupiers of premises used as illegal foreign worker housing will be taken to task by the relevant authorities.",6,671,2014-09-09-T-022-S-00671

2014-09-09-T-023,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the progress of sleeper replacements for MRT tracks; (b) whether there have been any delays to the progress; and (c) when can speeds of trains return to the normal 60-80 km/h from the current safety speed of 40kmh for the Kranji-Yew Tee-Keat Hong track segment.,1,673,2014-09-09-T-023-S-00673
2014-09-09-T-023,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Sleeper replacement for MRT tracks remains on schedule. For the North-South Line, 43% of the sleepers have been replaced and the rest should be completed by the second quarter of 2015. Train speeds will be restored to the normal levels of 60-80 km/h by end-September 2014 for the Kranji-Yew Tee segment, and by the first quarter of 2015 for the segment near Keat Hong. For the East-West Line, the tender is in progress and the sleeper replacement works is scheduled for completion by the end of 2016.",1,674,2014-09-09-T-023-S-00674
