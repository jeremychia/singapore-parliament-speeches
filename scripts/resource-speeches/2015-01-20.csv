2015-01-20-T-001,K Karthikeyan,Mr K Karthikeyan,"asked  the Minister for Health whether hospitals administer different drugs and treatment for the same medical conditions based on private or subsidised wards and, if so, whether the Ministry conducts checks on hospitals for such practices.",1,1,2015-01-20-T-001-S-00001

2015-01-20-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"Some of the drugs or treatments thus prescribed could be non-subsidised as there are more cost-effective alternatives available. Nonetheless, where non-subsidised drugs or treatments are assessed to be clinically required and cannot be replaced by subsidised alternatives, patients from lower-income households are provided assistance to help them access these drugs or treatments.",3,4,2015-01-20-T-001-S-00004

2015-01-20-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"Public hospitals have various governance frameworks in place to ensure that patients receive care appropriate to their clinical needs. This includes accreditation committees to ensure appropriate use of new technologies and procedures and that procedures are performed by properly trained doctors. The Pharmacy and Therapeutic (P&T) and Medical Device (MDC) committees ensure clinically appropriate use of drugs and medical devices/implants respectively. There are also pre-operations conferences for peer review of elective surgeries to ensure that they are appropriate, safe and not unnecessary.",5,6,2015-01-20-T-001-S-00006
2015-01-20-T-001,K Karthikeyan,Mr K Karthikeyan (Nominated Member),"I had a recent case with my union member who went to a hospital to do a stomach operation. There is a range of painkillers. The nurse gave him Panadol. He said, ""I just did a stomach operation. Is there any way I can get an injection?"" The doctor and the nurse were talking and he overheard the conversation  ""C Class ward; Panadol is enough."" This gave him a feeling that you would get subsidised treatment when you are in a C Class ward. Is there any way we can talk to the hospitals and see how they communicate and how they make things straight? That is my only concern.",1,7,2015-01-20-T-001-S-00007
2015-01-20-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"First, let me thank the Member for raising this Parliamentary Question (PQ), as well as for sharing this example. It is important for us to explain and clarify. Let me reassure the Member that hospitals do not differentiate the treatment routes based on the subsidy status of the patients, as long as the treatment route is required and necessary.",1,8,2015-01-20-T-001-S-00008
2015-01-20-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"In this stance, it is, indeed, unfortunate that there is this perception. We need to get more details to better understand the case. Let me briefly elaborate.",2,9,2015-01-20-T-001-S-00009

2015-01-20-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Typically, for pain management, as the Member has highlighted, clinical guidelines may give guidance to provide baseline pain management; further pain drugs may be added, if required; as well as to start with the least invasive drugs. This approach is quite typical across the different clinical conditions. The patient may, first, be prescribed oral Panadol. This could progress to stronger, more potent drugs, through injections, for instance. These are not without side effects.",4,11,2015-01-20-T-001-S-00011
2015-01-20-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Basically, throughout the spectrum of drugs required for pain management, you can find subsidised drugs. So, the patient does not really have to pay more for these subsidised drugs. There is no Panadol injection, but as the Member has mentioned, there are morphine, pethidine, nico injections which are in the Standard Drugs List. As I have said, these are stronger painkillers and may not be without their side effects. So, we need to ascertain if the patient's conditions will warrant these and if these are suitable for the patient. We would need further details to better understand the case.",5,12,2015-01-20-T-001-S-00012
2015-01-20-T-001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"What I would like to reiterate is that the drug and treatment prescribed are what the doctor and the healthcare team deem as clinically appropriate, based on the patient's conditions and not based on the subsidy status of the patient.",6,13,2015-01-20-T-001-S-00013

First, in profiling the Malay community as being more prone to certain sorts of diseases, have these co-rrelations been identified through studies of profiles of the population or is it more genetics? I am just wondering if more in-depth research has been done.",1,28,2015-01-20-T-002-S-00028
2015-01-20-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Two, in terms of outreach, it is great to see outreach, such as quit smoking campaigns, being done at the mosques. The number of people being reached out to is about 5,000, and the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that one fifth had quit smoking, for example. This is good outreach, but I think the numbers are still a bit small. There are also many other diseases that need to be managed as well. Is the Ministry considering more of such outreach or more of such collaborations in the community to address the other health issues?",2,29,2015-01-20-T-002-S-00029
2015-01-20-T-002,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"I want to thank the Member for the supplementary questions. As I had mentioned earlier, all the non-communicable diseases have common lifestyle risk factors, which are linked very directly to obesity, the food that we eat, as well as the lack of sufficient physical activity. These affect diseases like high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Essentially, what we have been trying to do is to encourage people to eat moderately, a balanced diet, to have physical activities and go for health screening.",1,30,2015-01-20-T-002-S-00030
2015-01-20-T-002,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"It is important that we embark on this.

2015-01-20-T-002,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"We have moved into a targeted approach, which I had shared earlier. The calendar is very popular this year. We not only give aspects of the calendar, but we also relate to their lifestyle, in terms of the food that they cook and their common habits, so that we can reach out to the different sectors of the community. We realised that, over time, they become excited about how to live healthily. With that aspect, we want to focus on these lifestyle factors.",3,32,2015-01-20-T-002-S-00032
2015-01-20-T-002,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Beyond that, in terms of genetics, we do not have significant evidence to show such a phenomenon. Based on what we have and what research we have done locally, we realise that such lifestyle practices play an important role. And we can reduce the risk to such non-communicable diseases among the community if we focus on the aspects of healthy eating, physical activity as well as going for proper and appropriate health screening.",4,33,2015-01-20-T-002-S-00033
2015-01-20-T-002,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"With regards to outreach, Members will see that, over time, we have been able to reach out to more and more Singaporeans in terms of the programmes that we have. For example, the calendar, we have increased it tremendously in terms of numbers. When we did it last year, we received many requests from the community, asking for more. We gave out more publicity materials than what we gave out last year. Demand has gone up so much that we had to ask for more materials.",5,34,2015-01-20-T-002-S-00034
2015-01-20-T-002,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Secondly, if you look at the anti-smoking campaign, the ""I Quit"" programme, you would realise that the numbers have not only  gone up, the number of families coming on board to be part of this process of their family members has also gone up. I was there in the last few years to share the load and to reach out to the community. I was so touched by the community support not only among the children and spouses, but also among grandparents coming to support to get their children to quit smoking.",6,35,2015-01-20-T-002-S-00035
2015-01-20-T-002,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Beyond these figures, anecdotally, I feel that there has also been an increase in terms of awareness about healthy living. For example, locally in my area, over two years, the number of Malays coming on board to be a part of an exercise group, which I join often, has gone up by three times. I met them recently and I am so happy because I usually ask how many would need a calendar. In the past, it was about 10 to 15. This year, close to 40 to 50 asked for it. When I went down and met them, there was a sense of passion, commitment towards healthy living.",7,36,2015-01-20-T-002-S-00036

2015-01-20-T-002,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,I would like to assure the Member that we would continue this effort.

2015-01-20-T-003,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari,asked  the Minister for National Development (a) how many HDB flats have been compulsorily acquired in the past three years; (b) what are the main reasons behind the compulsory acquisition of these HDB flats; (c) what are the alternative accommodation provided to families affected by the compulsory acquisition; and (d) what measures are in place to enable these families to own HDB flats again.,1,40,2015-01-20-T-003-S-00040

2015-01-20-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"HDB will assist households affected by CA due to mortgage arrears to find alternative accommodation.

Those who are unable to afford another flat and have no family support or other housing option, are allocated rental flats.",3,43,2015-01-20-T-003-S-00043
2015-01-20-T-003,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I thank the Minister of State. I have three supplementary questions. First, after how many months of mortgage arrears have to be accumulated for HDB to start the process of CA? Second, how does HDB help home owners manage their arrears? And third, could HDB consider assisting home owners with alternative accommodation even if they decide to sell their flats on their own instead of through CA?",1,44,2015-01-20-T-003-S-00044
2015-01-20-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mdm Speaker, it is not in the interest of HDB flat owners to accumulate mortgage arrears. It is not just a heavy financial burden on them but also tremendous emotional strain. HDB, therefore, intervenes early, proactively and sympathetically to help flat owners resolve their arrears issues.",1,45,2015-01-20-T-003-S-00045
2015-01-20-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"There are many measures that can be taken to help these HDB home owners. Some are short term, to deal with their short-term financial difficulties. Some are longer term for those facing prolonged difficulties. For instance, loan instalments are usually paid on the first of each month, but HDB gives lessees up to the end of the month if they face temporary cash flow difficulties. If they still face problems doing so, HDB will make a call, arrange a meet-up or even do a home visit, to better understand the situation and to offer help. The Member may note that every HDB branch has housing counsellors who offer financial counselling and explore sustainable housing options for home owners in mortgage arrears.",2,46,2015-01-20-T-003-S-00046
2015-01-20-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"What are some of these options? First, HDB can help the flat owner reschedule his mortgage loan, including extending the repayment up to the maximum loan period, if that would help.",3,47,2015-01-20-T-003-S-00047
2015-01-20-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Second, under the reduced repayment scheme, owners in difficulty can pay lower monthly instalments of between, say, 50% and 75% of their normal instalments for, say, up to two years.",4,48,2015-01-20-T-003-S-00048

2015-01-20-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Seventh, apart from financial measures, we also recognise that mortgage arrears are normally a symptom of other difficulties that the owners face.

2015-01-20-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"HDB's counsellors, therefore, look beyond housing loan measures that I have just detailed above, and work with other agencies to help these families more holistically.

2015-01-20-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The Member has asked for the timeframe.

2015-01-20-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mdm Speaker, yes, HDB issues a Notice of Intention to compulsorily acquire a flat and, down the line, after all measures have failed, in addition to what I have just detailed above, a revesting notice is issued. Between the Notice of Intention and the actual acquisition, if HDB does need to resort to that, it can be many months, even up to a year or beyond. That is a reflection of the effort that HDB officers put in to try to resolve the issues with the families directly.",1,60,2015-01-20-T-003-S-00060
2015-01-20-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I thank the Minister of State for the clarification earlier. I just want to move slightly to a different note. I know, most times, we have been sympathetic and I credit HDB for being sympathetic in a lot of compassionate cases out there. But in my estate, for example, we have a lot of middle-income families and, most times, we look at right sizing and when they go into arrears, it is really about credit card and other sorts of debts.",1,61,2015-01-20-T-003-S-00061
2015-01-20-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"HDB has not mentioned one of those as a criterion that you consider but, most of the time, when they right size, the cash that they get is also used to pay for a lot of these debts. What is HDB's view on this because, many a time, when they want to right size, you take into account all these cash surpluses that you get as part of the settlement. I think for many of them, they also get stuck in trying to get a new flat or to right size. So, what is HDB's view on credit card and other forms of debts?",2,62,2015-01-20-T-003-S-00062
2015-01-20-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"An HDB flat is a home and HDB does not encourage people to monetise the flat, then use it to settle debts, leaving themselves without a shelter. Having said that, we recognise the realities and difficulties of life. Families may choose to settle all these debts to the detriment of their housing needs.

2015-01-20-T-004,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),HDB's deficit is largely due to the subsidy extended to buyers of new flats and the disbursement of Central Provident Fund (CPF) housing grants to eligible buyers of resale flats.,3,68,2015-01-20-T-004-S-00068

Yes, it was expected because as we ramp up the numbers – 25,000 homes – you should expect that the deficit will grow accordingly. But going forward, I do not see us building 25,000 units per year for a long time. In fact, this is already Year Four, and we have started the process of tapering it down for the simple reason that the number of family formation is not of that order.

If you go back to the 1970s, Singapore had about 3,200 hectares of low-lying flood-prone areas. Today, the flood-prone area has been reduced to about 34 hectares; 3,200 hectares to 34 hectares. But to reduce 34 hectares to an even smaller number, it is like ascending the last bit of the mountain. It will get progressively more difficult.

The approach that we would like to take is to reach out to all the Pioneers, as many as we can, and help them to benefit from the package.",1,130,2015-01-20-T-008-S-00130
2015-01-20-T-008,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"It bears repeating that in setting the criteria, in terms of age, as I explained earlier, we had already been more inclusive. In terms of the citizenship criterion, the cut-off was set at 1986 and, in fact, it is 21 years after Independence.So, even in that criterion, I think that we have tried to be as generous as possible. So, for the members of our community who are not in any way able to benefit from the Pioneer Generation Package, if they are Singapore Citizens, there are other benefits that apply to them, including the MediSave top-ups that we have made available for five years to all those aged 55 and above. For the subsidies, for the forthcoming implementation of MediShield Life, they would likely also be able to benefit from it. And with these other forms of support, there is still a need, I think we would very much like to know who these individuals are and find other ways to help them.",2,131,2015-01-20-T-008-S-00131

However, there are cases of appeals linked to the ignorance of their parents or a twist of events that rendered them stateless when Singapore suddenly became independent in 1965 and many of them acquired their citizenship after 1986. And they feel to be part of the Pioneer Generation, not because of medical benefits. Will a case of this nature be given special consideration?",1,132,2015-01-20-T-008-S-00132

These career pathways will be closely integrated with education, training and development so that there is greater fluidity between learning and working as the individual progresses in his career. In doing so, SMS achieves two objectives – it builds a future supply of talent to meet the sectors' needs and provides for more meaningful pathways for workers who choose to work in those sectors.",5,141,2015-01-20-T-009-S-00141

2015-01-20-T-009,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"On a broader level, SMS encourages a shift among employers – from a ""plug and play"" mindset where employers seek to hire workers who already have all the necessary skills, without further thought of development and training. This has changed. So we need to move on to an approach where employers will proactively develop every worker, providing career pathways and valuing their contributions as they advance. And some companies are already doing that.

These lead sectors cover essential services, such as healthcare and social services; new growth sectors that provide exciting job opportunities for Singaporeans but do not necessarily have a ready pipeline of workers, such as biopharmaceuticals; and sectors facing significant manpower challenges, such as construction, retail and F&B.

A large proportion of the companies in the lead sectors are SMEs. We recognise the manpower challenges that SMEs face and how they often have limited resources and bandwidth to plan for the future. So, one clear benefit of the SMS will be to provide SMEs with a clearer sense of the sector's direction and needs and draw together the necessary resources, from which SMEs can tap to support the attraction, retention, training and development of workers in their sectors.",13,149,2015-01-20-T-009-S-00149

Otherwise, for them, they will have to be the business managers, implementors, finance managers and manpower persons themselves.

When there is a new childcare centre being set up, there will be a lot of resignations from a nearby childcare centre because the new one cannot get the staff and just offer higher salaries.

The reasons are as follows  by and large, the economy is doing relatively well. We do have many sectors that are growing and that represents a demand on manpower. Eventually, I think the market will have to find its own stabilisation point and this applies to the childcare sector as well.",1,156,2015-01-20-T-009-S-00156

The network that the Minister mentioned has the advantages of bandwidth because it is relying on institutional resources. The disadvantage of that is that it lacks in-house capabilities and we need the in-house capabilities for research that is specific to the national athletes.

I would like to ask  is there any other way to help the SMEs which need the vans for their businesses? Secondly, how many COEs will be available over the next three years, as the Senior Minister of State mentioned earlier that 31,000 COEs will be expiring?",1,188,2015-01-20-T-012-S-00188
2015-01-20-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mdm Speaker, as Er Dr Lee was asking the question and expressing the concern that bigger companies were outbidding smaller companies which need smaller vehicles in Cat C, it reminded me of an argument that was made very strongly just one or two years back that if we removed taxis from Cat A, we would see a very different premium. In any case, we did remove taxi companies from bidding in Cat A, but I think the results suggest that that argument was probably unfounded.",1,189,2015-01-20-T-012-S-00189
2015-01-20-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"So, to the Member's suspicion, it is not something that we can prove or disprove. But I would say, the point that the Member raised that we want to attend to is that some smaller businesses do face pressures in terms of needing a vehicle for their business. Where we have put our efforts is in trying to be helpful to businesses in general, and small businesses in particular, where they need vehicles for the smooth operation of their businesses. There are several measures to help them manage the cost of vehicles.",2,190,2015-01-20-T-012-S-00190
2015-01-20-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Firstly, for example, commercial vehicles are subject to lower vehicle taxes. And when businesses purchase a vehicle, the Additional Registration Fee for commercial vehicles is set at 5% of the vehicle's Open Market Value (OMV), compared to an effective rate of between 100% and 180% of the OMV for cars. Commercial vehicles also enjoy lower effective road tax and are exempted from diesel fuel taxes.",3,191,2015-01-20-T-012-S-00191
2015-01-20-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Secondly, businesses are allowed repeated five-year renewals of their COE. Earlier on, I mentioned that 31,000 small delivery vans will have their COEs expiring between now and 2017. A large majority – more than 80% of them – have more than five years of statutory life remaining. They can thus choose to go for two consecutive five-year renewals, instead of renewing directly on a 10-year COE. So, that facilitates their cashflow management.",4,192,2015-01-20-T-012-S-00192
2015-01-20-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Thirdly, we introduced the early turnover scheme where businesses can transfer any unused COE life to a new vehicle and enjoy discounts if they replace their more pollutive pre-Euro and Euro-1 diesel commercial vehicles. In addition, they do not need to bid for a new Cat C COE. They only need to pay a discounted prevailing quota premium for such vehicles when they turn it over. And since the scheme was enhanced in March last year, in fact, the discount on the prevailing quota premium is, on average, $23,000, a very considerable amount. That is why we have seen a steady increase in the take-up on the early turn-over scheme.",5,193,2015-01-20-T-012-S-00193
2015-01-20-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"These are some of the measures that we take to help businesses where vehicles are concerned. These measures are also complemented by other Government schemes to assist all SMEs directly with tax deductions, grants or micro loans.",6,194,2015-01-20-T-012-S-00194
2015-01-20-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"As to the Member's second question on how many COEs will become available, your guess is as good as mine. It really depends on several factors. It depends on how many vehicles are deregistered and it also depends on what is the permitted vehicle growth rate, which we have already given indication of. But deregistration really depends on the vehicle owners themselves. Analysts have given their own projections and forecasts. I think it is something that we will only really know when the deregistrations take place.",7,195,2015-01-20-T-012-S-00195
2015-01-20-T-012,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the answer. But we cannot, because of the example of the taxi COEs not achieving the effect that we would like to see, that we should not try to come up with a category for the small vans. The feedback is that many of them, they have already renewed the COEs, but how many times can they keep on extending it? They need the vans for their business. So, I would like to ask whether there is any difficulty in allocating a certain number of COEs for the small vans.",1,196,2015-01-20-T-012-S-00196
2015-01-20-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Madam, as I have explained earlier in my reply, it is something that we have to be quite careful in thinking through. The more categories we split them into, it means that, within each category, the numbers that can be made available for bidding each cycle would likely be much more volatile. And we have to ask ourselves whether that is, in fact, helpful to small businesses.",1,197,2015-01-20-T-012-S-00197
2015-01-20-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"So, we understand completely where Er Dr Lee Bee Wah is coming from. But we also have to ask whether the alternative that the Member has suggested is, in fact, going to be helpful to SMEs.",2,198,2015-01-20-T-012-S-00198
2015-01-20-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"And, please, let me assure Members that if it is something that is, indeed, likely to be beneficial, there is no reason why we cannot consider it.",3,199,2015-01-20-T-012-S-00199

From January 2014 to November 2014, over 35,000 rodent burrows were detected and treated by NEA. This reflects how important it is for the owners of premises, especially operators of food establishments, to practise good housekeeping habits, such as adopting good refuse management regimes.

As of November 2014, more than 16,000 mosquito breeding sites were found, a drop of 19% from the same period the year before. Amongst the new measures introduced in 2014, NEA piloted the Gravitrap surveillance programme in clusters and high-risk areas as a control tool and a guide for pre-emptive control operations. Now, there are some statistics we can gather from this Gravitrap programme. But let me explain that this is by no means a comprehensive surveillance of the entire country. But where we have placed Gravitraps, we estimated from the start of the programme that some 32,000 mosquitoes have been caught in these Gravitraps. I am not sure what to make of it, but this is the first year when we have such a statistic. So, we will probably use this as a basis for study going forward. I assure Members that we do not spend time doing a count; I am sure it is by some estimation.",3,212,2015-01-20-T-014-S-00212

As I have mentioned earlier, it is important to remember that these ""smaller"" dormitories will continue to be subject to our existing comprehensive regulations to protect the safety and well-being of residents. Residential premises not covered under the Bill will also continue to be subject to existing regulations pertaining to fire and structural safety, hygiene, subletting and change of use.",12,250,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00250

The holder of the licence, who will be the operator, is responsible for the day-to-day running of the dormitory. Actions by the operator can have a large impact on residents' well-being. Hence, in assessing the suitability of an operator for a licence, we will look at the prospective operator's financial capacity and track record and whether the operator can comply with the licensing conditions.",13,251,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00251

For a repeat offence, the penalty will be doubled. We are also proposing a substantial penalty for the breach of each licensing condition.

The Commissioner may also disqualify persons from managing or holding licences to operate dormitories for specified periods. The offences under the new legislation must be effectively enforced on the ground. To this end, officers who are appointed as dormitory inspectors will be provided with the necessary powers to enter, search and collect evidence from premises. These powers take reference from those currently accorded to inspectors under similar legislation, such as the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act and the Employment Agencies Act. Our inspectors will also be empowered to arrest suspected unlicensed operators or proprietors.

We will, therefore, exercise some flexibility in implementation. We will allow a six-month transition period from the date the proposed Bill comes into effect in the second half of 2015 to enable them to level up their standards and obtain the necessary licence.

For example, agencies are keeping a close watch on areas where there are already clusters of foreign worker housing, especially where infrastructure, like roads and sewers, are unable to support further intensification. Since November last year, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has identified 12 industrial estates where it will no longer approve applications to convert factory space into new foreign worker' dormitories, as well as applications to increase the number of workers in existing factory-converted dormitories.",28,266,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00266

In addition, we will step up measures to educate foreign workers about Singapore laws and social norms. For known foreign worker gathering areas, we can deploy additional uniformed Auxiliary Police Officers and devote extra resources to step up cleaning efforts to meet the needs of residents living nearby.

2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"This Bill gives us greater regulatory powers as larger PBDs are built to better address the housing and living needs of foreign workers. Due to the different dynamics that come with larger sites, it is necessary for the Government to start upstream and put in place these additional regulations. I will repeat, there are existing regulations that continue to be enforced and we continue to monitor them and to improve on them, to strengthen them as it goes on. Going forward, we will be seeing many more PBDs built of this scale, which is why it is important to add on some of these additional requirements, because the nature and dynamics of the far larger dorms are quite different from some of the smaller ones. For the smaller ones, some of the existing concerns can be addressed in different ways.",33,271,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00271

2015-01-20-T-016,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"However, in recent months, there have been several unsettling reports that have called our attention to the poor living standards and conditions that some foreign workers are subjected to. For example, in November last year, a spot check conducted by the Migrant Workers' Centre found about 50 construction workers from Bangladesh and India being housed in two-bedroom condominium apartments along Selegie Road. Possibly the most troubling was a photograph that was published in August, which exposed the deplorable living conditions and bathing facilities that some foreign workers were subjected to when they were housed on-site at a construction site in Punggol.",3,276,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00276
2015-01-20-T-016,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I support this Bill, Mdm Speaker, but I would like to ask three pertinent questions. The first is  would the Minister clarify why the proposed licensing regime only seeks to target larger dormitories with 1,000 beds and over, when a large proportion of foreign workers in Singapore reside in dormitories which have less than 1,000 beds? While these smaller dormitories will continue to be caught under existing regulations, what was the reason for not including them under the new framework as well?",4,277,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00277
2015-01-20-T-016,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Also, could the Minister outline how the Ministry will keep a close eye on dormitory operators to prevent them from deliberately keeping numbers below the 1,000-bed threshold to escape the licensing requirements proposed under this Bill?",5,278,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00278
2015-01-20-T-016,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Therefore, in setting out a new regulatory and licensing regime, we must be careful not to inadvertently incentivise dormitory operators to circumvent these important requirements by deliberately operating dormitories with less than 1,000 beds.",6,279,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00279

Therefore, we should respect the dignity of these foreign workers by providing them with safe and humane living conditions. I would like to ask the Minister whether there will be a move to extend the regulations contained in this Bill to dormitories which have less than 1,000 beds.

It is also a step in the right direction forward towards the proper management of our foreign workers and it is also linked to their welfare.

Anecdotally, MWC's close working relationship with the operators of our commercial dormitories, as well as our housing activities for the homeless and destitute workers, has allowed our team to actually witness the dormitory rentals increase from about $170 per bed space in 2009 to about $350 today – a 100% increase within a period of just less than five years. Thus, in the last two years, Madam, calls from the migrant workers advocacy groups, including the MWC, have led to the Government's concerted efforts moving forward to open up more new supplies of purpose-built housing. This is encouraging and I must commend MOM, the Ministry of National Development and their agencies for this positive response.",2,290,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00290
2015-01-20-T-016,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"Yet, Madam, our authorities have themselves continued to be mindful that such a ramp-up will not be able to render the operation of smaller dormitory types, like the factory converted or temporary dormitories, obsolete. Statistics from our authorities, as reported in the media, show that roughly half of the 400,000-plus workers requiring customised migrant workers' housing are currently accommodated in the 50 purpose-built dormitories here, while the other half continue to be housed in smaller, often less well-run housing facilities.",3,291,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00291

The MWC has operated the only 24-hour distress hotline here for non-domestic workers from 1 July 2014 and has, through this facility, received quite a number of housing-related complaints from our migrant workers. Our case data shows that the complaints from migrant workers were almost all concerns about smaller factory-converted, temporary or even makeshift accommodation arrangements accommodating less than 1,000 workers. Just a few months ago, in November 2014, MWC itself responded quite aggressively to one such case in Selegie, where information uncovered by my team suggested that more than 100 migrant workers were being housed in just two small residential condominium units.",4,292,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00292

We continue to be in contact with the employers of the four deceased workers from the incident to ensure that they do right and stand by their workers and also help their next-of-kin.

Together with health and safety considerations as well as security concerns, whether within individual dormitories or in clusters, this effort had resulted in MWC being the first to moot the idea of forming an industry association, which could, aside from their other responsibilities, present an industry representative to work with our authorities in developing and implementing the industry-wide standards. Having advised on the formation of the Dormitory Association of Singapore Limited (DASL) in January 2013, and we have been working very closely with them, I was quite glad to know that actually they are in support of the Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill (FEDB).

Even more worrying are the negative externalities that might arise if this ""double standard"" is allowed to become structured.",13,301,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00301

Today, employers constantly grapple with their business costs and, depending on the considerations that drive them and the degree of importance they place on keeping costs as low as possible, many of the more errant bosses prefer to house their workers in a cheaper, less favourable and often smaller accommodation. The cases are well-publicised and we know that the phenomenon is common. What is worrying for the operators of properly licensed dormitories is how the requirements and conditions in the FEDB will inevitably lead to further increases in their own running costs that will be passed on to consumers.",14,302,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00302
2015-01-20-T-016,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"The fear of this happening is that while the increase in cost of compliance applies to the larger dormitories that already practise higher standards today, the FEDB seems to leave the smaller operations to their own devices. The latter group will continue to serve a relevant purpose, as I have mentioned earlier, and it is difficult to argue with a simple economic proposition that higher costs for larger, purpose-built dormitories will make smaller, cheaper dormitories to be held to a lesser standard even more attractive to the employers. In the long term, if this preference begins to take root and the concern is not addressed, the large operators are concerned that the uneven treatment towards these two groups might pull down overall migrant housing standards in general.",15,303,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00303
2015-01-20-T-016,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"I would, therefore, suggest that our authorities guard against over-regulation of one segment of the industry and, as far as possible or appropriate, apply the standards and conditions as general as possible to all. The Minister has mentioned that, actually, there are already some existing regulations for the smaller operators. I would like to ask the Ministry  why does it not just group all these regulations together under this Bill and apply it to all?",16,304,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00304

Two firemen and eight other individuals suffered injuries from this blaze. The unit in question – reported to be an area only slightly bigger than 1,300 square feet – had nine rooms, each equipped with bunk beds, a tiny kitchen and a toilet. The Malaysian Star newspaper, Stomp and a TODAY article reported that the premises was occupied by some 100 foreigners from China, India, Bangladesh and Malaysia, partitioned into 11 units of rooms, each occupied by about 10 people. The local Chinese newspaper Shin Min Daily News, on the other hand, reported that the affected unit of the three-storey walk-up apartment had 11 rooms, each occupied by up to eight workers, which makes for a total of about 88 people in a single apartment.",2,307,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00307

It is also reported that the men ""slept shoulder to shoulder, amid rotting food and soiled clothes"". The same article reminded readers that the paper had raised several reports earlier on unhygienic and overcrowded foreign worker housing, recounting an incident at a Punggol HDB construction site where hundreds of workers had to use choked and broken urinals, and another story covering the plight of about 5,000 workers living at Tuas View Square in factory-converted dormitories infested with rats and mosquitoes.",4,309,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00309

A recent Business Times' article reported that the first half of 2014 saw 360 inspections. However, the large number of these continuing violations and inspections suggest that Singapore, a First World economy by any stretch, does not host a robust enough framework governing the housing of foreign workers, even as this Bill is a step in the correct direction.",6,311,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00311

By this threshold, the Bill does not address the sort of accommodation at the centre of the 6 December Geylang fire and the ""secret dormitories"", such as those in Tampines. I would like to ask the Minister what plans are envisaged to reduce this threshold number within the context of the Bill since it is explicitly suggested in the Explanatory Note and, separately, how this figure of 1,000 was arrived at, in the first instance, in view of the need for greater oversight, regulation and enforcement across this industry, than is currently the case.",7,312,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00312

The reason for this sudden turn of events was put down to more construction firms being permitted by the authorities to set up foreign worker quarters on the sites of major building projects, such as the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and HDB sites. I recognise that manpower proximity to the workplace helps reduce costs for businesses, particularly construction contractors. To this extent, Government policies should support such considerations wherever possible. However, rendering such operational flexibility for businesses would have been an opportune time to introduce clear licensing requirements, regulatory standards and a penalty framework for such temporary foreign worker quarters. This would have greatly supported the contractors on the one hand and improved the living conditions of foreign workers on the other.",8,313,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00313
2015-01-20-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In drafting this Bill, I would like to enquire if the Ministry has considered, for example, introducing a separate category or categories of licensing for premises that operate as smaller foreign employee accommodation below the threshold number, so as to bring many more dormitories and places of accommodation for foreign workers under a licensing framework. Such a broad strategy would have been aligned with the purpose of this Bill, as spelt out in clause 4, which seeks to establish certain accommodation standards for foreign employee dormitories; for the appropriate mechanisms to ensure adherence to those very standards; and to promote the sustainability of, and continuous improvements in, the provision of services at foreign employee dormitories.",9,314,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00314
2015-01-20-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"One possible way to support SMEs and small businesses and contractors on the one hand, and the foreign worker community on the other, is for the Government to consider building and managing some dormitories for our foreign workers. For example, employers that employ 100 or less foreign workers, being more sensitive to cost pressures, can be eligible to house their workers in Government-built and operated dormitories which set the standard for the entire industry. The entry of the Government into the sector can be modelled along the entry of the Ministry of Education into the kindergarten business, which is to provide good preschool education and, more importantly, to catalyse improvements in this sector. If deemed appropriate, a fraction of the foreign worker levy can be used to establish such dormitories, with a subsidy for small companies that show real and sustained productivity improvements in their operations.",10,315,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00315
2015-01-20-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, Part 5 of the Explanatory Statement of the Bill states that the Minister, by way of subsidiary legislation, can determine that several buildings on different parcels of land can be regarded as a single boarding premises and whether all the beds therein are to be counted to determine if the total threshold number is attained. This is a positive move as it would prevent savvy operators who would nonetheless operate assiduously to work around the 1,000-bed threshold by all means, effectively negating Parliament's intent, for example, by creating sister companies through friends and families. I would like to ask the Minister whether the Ministry has determined how many additional dormitory operators are likely to come under this scenario, as spelt out in the Explanatory Note, and how many beds, so to speak, would come under the licensing framework as a result of this envisaged subsidiary legislation.",11,316,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00316

As recently as 2008, Avery Strategic Investments, an entity that was then 97% controlled by Morgan Stanley Real Estate, bought three foreign worker dormitories for $153 million when Jurong Town Corporation offered to sell these dormitories comprising a total of 13,544 beds. An officer of the minority shareholder, Averic Capital Management, was then quoted as saying, ""As the Singapore economy grows, likely so will the dormitory business. We're hopeful the economy remains robust; then there will be more opportunities to invest in this asset class."" About two-and-a-half years later, Morgan Stanley sought to exit the dormitory business, citing a dearth of sites made available for dormitory development by the Government, preventing them from enlarging their portfolio to spin off the business into a dormitory real estate investment trust. It was reported that the entity received expressions of interests ranging from $375 million to $450 million, a whopping $100 million more than the total cost of assets it purchased a mere three years earlier.",12,317,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00317

However, for industries and sectors that have significant socio-cultural implications for an urban and high-density society like Singapore, the market approach should go hand-in-hand with responsibility towards our foreign workers. Apart from the dizzying dollars churned by the financial industry and the heady world of mergers and acquisitions, the concern of many Singaporeans and Members of this House, by virtue of this Bill, is primarily over the health, safety, security and safe lodging of our foreign workers.",13,318,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00318

Nonetheless, the premises may be owned by a separate proprietor who either sublets the premises to the operator for use as a dormitory; or appoints the operator to manage the daily operations on his behalf. In such instances, we [the Ministry] will hold proprietors accountable where they, rather than the operators, have more control, for example, in making repairs or alterations to the premises.""",15,320,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00320

For example, how far would an owner or a corporate entity be held liable if it can prove it had no control in making repairs and alterations to a boarding premises? Does that mean it is not responsible should foreign workers be found living in unsatisfactory conditions?",16,321,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00321

Specifically, I would like to ask the Minister, how far does ownership extend, as defined by this definition? Would it cover financial institutions and funds that are the ultimate owners and who seek to unlock value in such investments? In keeping with the purpose of the Bill as made out in clause 4, would it not be less ambiguous and in keeping with the parliamentary intention of the Bill to make the licence holder and the owner or owners, regardless of their shareholding, jointly and severally liable for any infractions committed by the licence holder? A clarification of this point, in view of the Ministry's potentially ambiguous press release of 4 November, would be appreciated.",17,322,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00322
2015-01-20-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, if this Bill is about providing for certain standards of accommodation and to promote the continuous improvement in the provision of services at dormitories, then I would argue that a firm enforcement regime that emphasises responsibility for foreign workers up and down the value chain be enshrined by this Bill and enunciated by the Minister. This is especially so since big corporates can potentially come on board and purchase strategic stakes in foreign employee dormitories as investors. The benefits of such a prospect should not be only to unlock shareholder value. I would argue that the benefits should flow back to the industry and to society and align itself to the purpose of this Bill. In some cases, the financial heft of big corporates and holding companies and their ability to undertake independent risk assessments put them in a good position to be the quasi-regulators of this industry, by virtue of ownership, alongside the Dormitory Association of Singapore Limited.",18,323,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00323
2015-01-20-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In conclusion, Mdm Speaker, while I support the Bill, which seeks to regulate some aspects of foreign worker accommodation in Singapore, I fear it may be a half measure and rendered otiose if there is no parallel strategy to better regulate foreign employee accommodation per se – targeting not just big dormitory operators but the small-time businesses as well. Such an approach would be fairer and serve regulators and businesses better, too, as it would not unwittingly penalise honest businesses which operate large dormitories that this Bill will regulate who play the game by the rules and will do many Singaporeans a great service by improving the lot of our foreign workers. If Singapore manages to scale up its standards of foreign employee accommodation, our businesses are likely to attract higher quality workers and significantly lower the risk of another tragic and senseless fire in Geylang or, potentially, wanton violations of statutory regulations, as evidenced by the secret dormitories in Tampines.",19,324,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00324

The Bill mentions that if the dormitory officer or inspector believes that any offence under this new Bill has been committed, he or she may break open any door or window of the premises for inspection. He or she also has the power to arrest and detain someone for up to 48 hours. Why does the Bill give such broad powers to inspectors when we already have existing legislation, such as the Criminal Procedures Code (CPC) and the Police Force Act? According to sections 7 and 25 of the Bill, not having a licence to run a dormitory is an arrestable and detainable offence.

2015-01-20-T-016,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"First, given the significant impact that large foreign employee dormitories could have on the welfare of their occupants, the condition of the immediate vicinity, as well as the general state of the neighbourhood in which it is located, I am concerned that none of these factors appear to have been explicitly included in the licensing conditions.",2,381,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00381

2015-01-20-T-016,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, I am suggesting that accounting for such potential impact on the community should be built into the licensing requirement so that the operator is required to proactively seek community feedback as part of the conditions for renewal of licence. I am suggesting that such conditions be explicitly imposed. I am aware that it could impose additional costs on operators, which would, ultimately, have to be borne by employers. However, I believe that what we want is a system that will stand us in good stead for the longer term. Hence, I believe that this would be in line with the purpose stated in clause 4(c) of the Bill.",5,384,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00384
2015-01-20-T-016,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"If the regulatory burden on operators is too heavy, it will encourage flouting of the law.

2015-01-20-T-016,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"My second concern is about the threshold number, which several hon Members have already spoken about before me. I appreciate that the Minister had already emphasised that smaller dormitories are not exempt from regulations. I hope you will allow me to press this point on the grounds that there are concerns that I feel exactly about the uneven treatment. Since a significant proportion of workers are housed in smaller dormitories which would be exempt from this Bill, I would like to ask if the Minister has any concerns about possible unintended outcomes. Is it the intention to impose a heavier regulatory burden on operators of larger dormitories?",8,387,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00387
2015-01-20-T-016,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"This raises other issues. First, operators will be subject to different standards, depending on their size, and the enforcement could become, therefore, correspondingly more onerous.

What we are stipulating are standards that we should not compromise on once they have been met.",11,390,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00390
2015-01-20-T-016,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"In conclusion, I want to urge the Ministry to ensure that enough resources are allocated to enforcement. Accommodating large numbers of foreign workers carries a cost to society as a whole. It is the responsibility of employers to fully price such costs into their operations. Workers need to be taken care of according to standards that the social conscience of Singapore today requires. Very often, the social cost of accommodating low-wage workers are hidden from view and not properly accounted for. In that sense, poor quality conditions in accommodating foreign workers often push the cost to society.",12,391,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00391

2015-01-20-T-016,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),"One obvious reason for this is cost. Employers are, above all, driven by cost considerations, especially given the significant increase in foreign worker levies over recent years. They keep costs as low as possible to maximise profits.

Already, there seems to be an increasing divide between Singaporeans and foreign workers in our midst. Nasty comments both ways are not uncommon in the social media. These should be discouraged and the deeper issues addressed.

In particular, the Explanatory Notes state that compliance directives may be issued to a licensed operator without the need for the licensed operator to be heard and that non-compliance is an arrestable offence. We need to ensure that any such directives issued are with transparency and fairness and do not serve to discourage genuinely interested and qualified operators from entering this industry.",15,465,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00465
2015-01-20-T-016,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Likewise, clause 25 states that ""A Police officer or dormitory operator may arrest without warrant any individual whom the Police officer or dormitory inspector, as the case may be, reasonably suspects is committing or has committed an offence under section 7"". Here, again, we need to ensure that enforcement of this clause is fair and proportionate. I would also ask that dormitory operators and Police officers be properly trained to conduct inspections with due respect and sensitivity towards dormitory residents.",16,466,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00466
2015-01-20-T-016,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"In addition, as a multi-agency approach will be adopted to ensure that the licensing conditions will be enforced, the different Government agencies should work seamlessly, expediently and coherently together.",17,467,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00467
2015-01-20-T-016,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Mdm Speaker, in conclusion, it is heartening to learn from a recent survey that an overwhelming 90% of foreign workers in Singapore are satisfied to work here, 92% plan to continue working in Singapore, and 81% would recommend Singapore to friends and relatives as a place to work. Singapore continues to depend on these workers to build our infrastructure and support our economy. The Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill is a step in the right direction towards building living spaces where all residents, whether local citizens or foreign workers, can live and work together in comfort, safety and harmony. Madam, I support the Bill.",18,468,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00468

2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We all acknowledge the importance of the Bill as a progressive and much needed measure to provide the Government with additional levers to manage larger dormitories over and above current regulations. With that in place, we will be able to better design dormitories and to deal with these issues upstream when we are designing the dormitories, so that we can ensure that we provide better living, social, recreational alternatives for workers. This will also help to facilitate the harmonious co-existence with our residents from the surrounding communities.",2,471,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00471
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"A number of Members raised comments on a broad range of issues, including employment standards and protection for workers. They are all important. I would like to again emphasise that the management of a foreign workforce is a very wide-ranging topic. A number of these measures are already in place. A number of major steps have been put in place in the preceding years. For example, the changes that we have made to the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act represent a step in that direction.",3,472,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00472
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I would address most of the concerns specific to the issues of the Bill which is about regulating larger dormitories, but I would also like to take the opportunity here to make some broader points about the state of foreign worker welfare in Singapore; they are from some of the descriptions and points raised.",4,473,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00473

I do agree, for example, in various instances highlighted by a number of Members – Mr Christopher de Souza, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Mr Pritam Singh, Mrs Lina Chiam, Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Ms Irene Ng – of workers being housed in poor, unhygienic conditions. I do know because I accompany my officers when they go for inspections and I have seen many of such similar cases.",5,474,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00474

But I would like to emphasise that these instances that we see, they are unacceptable; and in many instances, they already violate existing laws. Regulatory agencies will take to task any person found to have violated the prevailing standards and ensure that the affected workers are relocated to approved accommodations.",6,475,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00475
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"My officers are out every week inspecting, following up on leads and tip-offs. Many of these do not make it to the headlines. What you see represents some of the cases that have been highlighted, some have been tipped off to the media, some have been tipped off by the public, some by the NGOs, and they are valid because there are these cases and many more that our people see. We do need to deal with them. But does it mean that, across the board, the situation is dire, as highlighted by Ms Foo Mee Har?",7,476,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00476
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We have taken this issue on board. We have tried to make sure that we survey the foreign workers in a large enough sample to understand what are the conditions. Our survey showed that nine in 10 foreign workers are satisfied with working in Singapore and an equally high proportion would recommend that their friends come here to work. Again, that does not mean that there are no egregious cases.",8,477,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00477
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"For example, in terms of existing regulations – in terms of enforcement – last year, MOM alone took more than 1,400 employers to task for providing unacceptable accommodation to their workers. We relocated close to 3,000 as a result of poor living conditions. We have prosecuted offenders in egregious cases. Other agencies, such as URA, NEA and SCDF have also taken errant premises owners to task for flouting existing regulations which cover areas, such as illegal subletting, inadequate bathing and toilet facilities and overcrowding. As the Government, we are not only stepping up enforcement of existing requirements, but we are also continuing to review and raise these standards over time, and this is what we are going to do.",9,478,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00478
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"This Bill addresses one part of the issue, which is dealing with the dormitories that are far larger. The rest of the other regulations continue to be in place, tracked and strengthened over time. In particular, housing types raised by Members, for example, onsite workers' quarters – that is one area that we are looking at as well. I would also add that the authorities are also watching the density and use of these sites. Apart from managing the standards that are expected and required, we are also looking at what sites ought to be approved, where are the areas that ought to be approved and, as we build up more PBDs, we are also looking at being a lot stricter in giving approvals for the use of various premises for housing foreign workers.",10,479,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00479
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Let me also state this again about foreign workers being housed in dormitories. The dormitories are more relevant for non-Malaysian workers in the construction, marine and process sectors. This group forms only about half, not the whole of the 770,000 or so Work Permit holders in Singapore. Half of them are Malaysians. Many of them commute daily and do not need dormitories, or are workers in the manufacturing and services sectors who may live in rented residential premises near their workplaces.",11,480,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00480
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"With regard to Ms Foo Mee Har's query on how the locations of dormitories are determined, the relevant Government agencies do take into account many factors, including technical and infrastructural constraints like suitability of roads, adequacy of sewers in the area as well as recreational and social amenities that the dormitory can support. I would also like to assure Mr Gan Thiam Poh that similar care is taken in determining the capacity for each dormitory as well as the number of dormitories allowed within an area.",12,481,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00481
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,This level of coordination is going on across Government agencies and we do continue to want to strengthen that. This may not always be apparent because this often takes place in the background. But this work will continue and we will continue to emphasise and strengthen the collaboration and cooperation across various stakeholders.,13,482,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00482
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh also raised the issue of whether employers from specific sectors should be allowed to house their workers in better-equipped PBDs. While the Government's view is that PBDs can better cater to Work Permit holders' housing needs, there are also merits to housing workers on or near their worksites. For example, this would alleviate the need to transport them back and forth. There will be an impact on productivity. There will also be less loading on the public transport system during peak hours. Therefore, such non-PBDs still remain a space which we need to look at in terms of providing housing options, provided they continue to meet the existing regulatory requirements on appropriate housing standards. Where these requirements and standards are not met, we urge the public and those who are aware of such violations to raise them. Our authorities will inspect and take action. That is what a lot of officers do on a week-to-week basis.",14,483,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00483
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mr Christopher de Souza, Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Mr Patrick Tay, Mr Pritam Singh and Mr Gan Thiam Poh had also noted that there is still a significant number of workers who are being housed in the dormitories that will not come under the ambit of this new Bill. This is one of the common concerns that have been raised by many about why only those dormitories with above 1,000 beds; how about those with less? They suggested lowering the 1,000-bed threshold to cover dormitories housing fewer workers. Assoc Prof Randolph Tan has also asked if concerns about unintended outcomes arising from the threshold had been considered.",15,484,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00484
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"To put things in perspective, the threshold of 1,000 beds will cover all existing PBDs, and all the new PBDs coming onstream will offer 1,000 beds and above. That is where we are going with PBDs. It is important for us to factor in these requirements upstream, so that they are designed and worked into the building of the PBDs; not just the physical infrastructure, but the way in which it has to be run. It does not mean that the rest of the space is not being regulated; they are. It also does not mean that we will not look at whether and how to strengthen the regulations for the smaller dormitories or accommodations which house fewer than 1,000 beds.",16,485,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00485
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"It is a considered decision. We had also debated why 1,000 beds, should it be fewer, should it be more. We looked at the spread of the different housing types and the numbers that they house. We felt that, going forward, that is what we are going to do with PBDs – we are going to have a lot more of these and that is why it is important for this Bill to move now rather than wait for a complete solution. The rest of the other measures will unfold with time as we look into it and see how best to strengthen them.",17,486,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00486
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Over time, as more PBD sites are launched, we will expect the proportion of foreign workers staying in larger dormitories within the threshold to increase. As I have mentioned earlier, we will also manage in terms of the permission given for contractors and developers, in terms of requesting various sites to house their workers. As more of these PBDs come onsite, we will also begin to take a stricter view about how workers are housed elsewhere. Therefore, you will begin to see a lot more of them shifting towards PBDs.",18,487,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00487
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"There is, therefore, this need to manage upstream the different dynamics that come with a larger site. As I have highlighted earlier, the 1,000-bed threshold was selected because of the different challenges posed by such larger dormitories, as well as the fact that the requirements that we will impose, such as outdoor recreation spaces and minimarts, are only possible actually in larger dormitories.",19,488,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00488
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"For smaller dormitories – for smaller factory-converted dormitories, for example, they may not have the scale to be able to put in place some of these measures. There are other solutions. For instance, we also encourage the building of recreational centres which cater to clusters. For example, there are areas where there, perhaps, may not be so many of such PBDs but there are facilities housing smaller numbers of workers, but there is a whole cluster of them which have needs to be met, and that is where recreational centres are being built to address those.",20,489,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00489
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"There are practical reasons why this is so. For example, we are aware of security concerns. We are also aware of healthcare concerns. For smaller dormitories or smaller accommodation spaces, when outbreaks happen, you can manage it, you have quarantine. But when you have a much larger dormitory, the requirements are quite different, the scale is very different. We need to weave this into the design of the dormitories themselves.",21,490,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00490
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Instead of just lowering the threshold, the more practical approach, we believe, is to add on additional requirements for dormitories above 1,000 beds. I emphasise again  existing regulations continue to be there. They continue to be important. They continue to cover a wide range of the concerns that we have today, and they will be looked at and will continue to be strengthened over time. But for the many PBDs that are going to come on line – the existing ones and the new ones – we do need these additional requirements because the scale of those dormitories is quite different. These requirements will be on top of the existing levers which will continue to apply.",22,491,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00491
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Having said this, we will also bear in mind the suggestion, the possibility, of having different classes of licences in the future, should experience show that this is needed. Which is why the way the Bill is structured allows us to have the space to have different classes of licences and to be able to adjust the numbers accordingly, should the need arise.",23,492,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00492
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Pritam Singh were also concerned that operators could potentially escape licensing by subdividing their premises to fall slightly below the threshold of 1,000 beds; or as Er Dr Lee Bee Wah mentioned, ""What about the 999-bed dormitories?""

2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"For the vast majority of dormitories which will be Government-tendered, the proprietors are obliged to provide enough bed spaces for a predetermined number of workers. Any request for subdivision will be evaluated and will be subjected to approval by the relevant authorities. Moreover, we have made provisions in the Bill precisely to prevent this kind of gaming by empowering the Commissioner to deem a group of buildings, structures or facilities as one dormitory for the purpose of dormitory licensing. We are fully aware that there is a likelihood, in fact, in our discussions with the various stakeholders with the dormitory operators themselves, they have also raised various questions, ""What happens if we have this, that and the other?"" This is where we share the same concern as Members do, and we have worked it into the Bill so that we make sure we are able to prevent such gaming of the system.",25,494,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00494

The Government has also been injecting more land for development of PBDs over the last few years. As PBDs are completed over the coming years, more bed spaces are coming online in the next few years, we have reasons to believe that the dormitory operators will need to keep prices competitive to attract tenants. At the same time, as I have mentioned earlier, we are also watching the space in terms of permission granted for other types of dormitories being set up, housing smaller numbers of workers in other types of accommodations.",26,495,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00495
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Let me point out that the additional requirements to be imposed through this regime have been included in the tender conditions for new dormitories since last year. What it means is that the bidders of these sites must calculate the necessary compliance costs, including the additional regulatory requirements of larger dormitories as part of their overall business plans and, therefore, adjust the costs in their bids accordingly. This mechanism will also allow them to ensure that they do not just pass on the cost. Often times, if you overbid for a particular project, you will have to find ways to recover that. But when all these requirements are upfront, they will have to factor that in so that they bid accordingly. This will help to manage the cost and to ensure that they do not transfer it on to others, especially to the workers.",27,496,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00496
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"For existing dormitories which were not built to the new standards, as many Members have acknowledged, it is important for us to allow some flexibility on a case-by-case basis when it is extremely difficult for the dormitory to comply. We will give time and we support their effort. For instance, there may be space constraints and it might just not be possible to provide sufficient outdoor recreation space. We will provide some form of financial assistance to retrofit existing dormitories to ease operators into the new framework and reduce the need to pass on the cost through higher bed prices. More details will be provided to the industries when these are finalised.",28,497,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00497

2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Ms Foo Mee Har also asked about the other measures in place to mitigate contingencies involving security and public order. We have kept such contingencies in view and consulted quite extensively with the relevant agencies, including SPF, MOH and NEA, when formulating the licensing conditions. Many of the requirements imposed on the dormitory operators are devised precisely to facilitate the intervention of the relevant agencies in an emergency. We would also like to assure Ms Irene Ng that it is not the intention of the Government to make dormitories restrictive places to live in. There are also extensive requirements pertaining to areas, such as social and recreational amenities, which ensure that dormitories better meet the needs of the residents.",30,499,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00499

Assoc Prof Tan can be assured that sufficient resources have been allocated to the task. On the other hand, I would also like to assure Ms Foo Mee Har and Mrs Lina Chiam that we will not go overboard either and that the powers of the Commissioner and inspectors will be exercised judiciously. They will have a wide range of tools and levers that can be calibrated according to the situation. For example, the offence of running a large dormitory without a licence is a particularly egregious one. We have, therefore, made this an arrestable offence.",33,502,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00502
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"It is also imperative that the Commissioner has the powers to use compliance directives to respond effectively to disorder and risks to the dormitory residents' health and safety. In such exceptional circumstances, when time is of the essence, the Commissioner needs to have the power to direct dormitories to comply immediately with the necessary requirements, even if these have not been communicated beforehand. As many Members have shared, for instances of violations, we do take these quite seriously. The changes we have made in EFMA in the preceding years and some of these measures we are putting in place are to give the authorities more clout to be able to step in, in a much more decisive fashion. We are going to do the same for dormitories and housing arrangements for fewer than 1,000 workers.",34,503,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00503

For instance, for the modification of licensing conditions, the Commissioner must give a notice period of at least 14 days, during which the operator may make written representations. Clause 13(2) also states clearly the circumstances under which the Commissioner may issue a compliance directive, for instance, when the dormitory has contravened a licensing condition.",35,504,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00504

2015-01-20-T-016,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang,"Mdm Speaker, I would like to seek a few clarifications from the Minister. The Minister mentioned that the Bill targets those dormitories that are housing 1,000 workers and above. But this Bill's name is ""Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill"". Why do we not call the Bill the ""Purpose-Built Dormitory Bill""? That is, we call a spade a spade. It is still important for us to ensure that all the other dormitories are properly regulated. Because of the fact that many Members have raised the concern, may I now ask the Minister if he would recognise that there is a big gap? In his reply, he mentioned that, currently, there are already a lot of existing regulations to regulate the other dormitories. But how are we going to enhance them?",1,515,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00515
2015-01-20-T-016,Yeo Guat Kwang,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang,"I would also like to ask the Minister  why do we not consider, like the Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill yesterday, grouping all the other relevant regulations into the Bill to make the whole regulatory regime more comprehensive?",2,516,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00516
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, it is important for us to understand that this Bill addresses a specific issue, which is how best to regulate the larger dormitories, basically 1,000-bedders and above, because we are building PBDs of that size. It does not mean there are no regulations in place; it does not mean that the present regulations governing the welfare of the foreign workforce are inadequate. There are, for example, in the many instances highlighted in the media, the egregious cases we have seen over the past couple of months – in fact, over a long period, there have been various issues that have been cropping up – all those cases violate existing regulations.",1,517,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00517
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"What we intend to do is to make sure those regulations remain in place. They continue to remain in place, even for the larger dormitories. But the larger dormitories bring with them a different scale, which is why it is important for us to provide some of these added requirements, because the scale adds a very different dimension to it.",2,518,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00518
2015-01-20-T-016,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Now, does it preclude that we, going forward, do not bring in some of these measures for some of the smaller dorms? It does not preclude that. Does it mean that we will not eventually have an over-arching Bill that brings in together everything? No, it does not preclude that either. What we are saying is that there are already a lot of measures in place and continue to be in existence. We do not want to wait for this mother-of-all-Bills to cover everything, because it is pressing for us to address the 1,000-bedders and above, because these PBDs are coming online. We want the contractors and developers to build this into the requirements and to the design of not only the physical infrastructure, but in the way in which they are run, so that the playing field is clear, all these things are fused in and we do not need to do this retrospectively.

But the idea is that, going forward, we will be building more PBDs of that size. We would like to shift more of the housing accommodation needs of our foreign workforce into that sector. It does not mean that the need for some of these factory-converted dormitories (FCDs) does not exist. We do know there are also many FCDs, for example, that do need regulations and which are of a suitable standard to provide housing and accommodation for the foreign workforce. There is a reason for that, because housing them, for example, onsite, would actually be a lot more productive, would save a lot of time, I think for the foreign workers themselves as well. But the standards must be met.",1,527,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00527

For example, URA has also issued some guidelines on some of the areas. If we have a number of FCDs and we feel that the density has exceeded what we feel is comfortable, we will place a cap and basically not allow further FCDs on those premises.",2,528,2015-01-20-T-016-S-00528

These sectors accounted for 56% of value-added in Singapore’s economy.

2015-01-20-T-022,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The Ministry of Manpower understands that foreign manpower needs differ across sectors. We have catered for sector-specific needs by applying different dependency ratio ceilings to the five broad sectors – construction, manufacturing, services, marine and process. In general, higher dependency ratio ceilings are granted to industries where the nature of work tends to be relatively unattractive, as locals are less inclined to perform these jobs. For instance, both the construction and process sectors enjoy a very high dependency ratio ceiling of seven foreign workers for every local worker hired. We have also provided flexibility in industries where there is an essential economic or social need on an exceptional basis. This explains why we have specific provisions for industries like conservancy and healthcare.",1,568,2015-01-20-T-022-S-00568

For the industries that many of us perceive to be ""manpower-intensive"" and ""heavily dependent on foreign workers"", we should ask ourselves whether such industries are similarly labour-intensive in other developed countries. Often, they are not, with reliance on technology or self-service instead. The higher productivity level of such industries then allows higher wages to be paid.",2,569,2015-01-20-T-022-S-00569
2015-01-20-T-022,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"So, we must change the nature of work of many labour-intensive industries to be manpower-lean. Even if it is difficult to attract locals to do such roles, it should still be done with fewer foreign workers, who have good skill levels. Manpower-intensive industries, such as construction can rely on less manpower once a better quality workforce is built up. Our recent announcements, such as mandating a minimum R1 proportion in the construction sector from 2017 onwards, support this shift.",3,570,2015-01-20-T-022-S-00570
2015-01-20-T-022,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,A productive economy has to be well-supported by an experienced and highly skilled workforce.

2015-01-20-T-023,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"The frontline agencies with significant public interactions include the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority, Central Provident Fund Board, Housing and Development Board, Inland Revenue Authority, Ministry of Manpower, Ministry of Social and Family Development and National Environment Agency. Among these seven agencies, there were 45 cases of harassment or abuse reported to the Police in 20141. This was an increase from the 25 cases reported in 2013. Among the restructured hospitals, there were 31 reported cases in 2013 and 34 cases in 2014. The Public Service receives more than five million service requests through physical channels each year. The incidence of abuse should thus be seen in this overall context.",2,574,2015-01-20-T-023-S-00574
2015-01-20-T-023,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"The majority of these cases are incidents of verbal or physical abuse which amounted to intimidation and obstruction of public officers in performing their duties. In some instances, members of the public turned abusive when their requests or appeals were turned down.",3,575,2015-01-20-T-023-S-00575
2015-01-20-T-023,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"We take a serious view of abuse of public officers, and the more severe cases of abuse will face criminal prosecution under the Protection from Harassment Act which was passed by this House on 13 March 2014. The Act extended protection from harassment for public officers to include Public Service workers who deliver public services that are essential to Singaporeans’ daily lives, such as nurses working in our restructured hospitals. It also provides for increased penalties to reflect the seriousness of harassment against public officers and Public Service workers when they are performing their duties. Our Public Service officers and workers endeavour to serve Singapore and Singaporeans well. We will continue to protect them from abusive behaviour that prevents them from performing their duties.",4,576,2015-01-20-T-023-S-00576

The detailed engineering study is ongoing and requires more time than initially envisioned due to the complexity of the project. Thereafter, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) will conduct the tender for construction, which will take about six months. Thus, construction will likely only commence in 2016.",1,578,2015-01-20-T-024-S-00578
2015-01-20-T-024,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The locations of all the entries and exits for NSE are available on LTA’s website. The construction area of NSE will not overlap with that of the two MRT stations. Nevertheless, before construction works begin, LTA will carry out traffic impact assessments and engage affected stakeholders on mitigation measures. For roads that are affected by construction works, lane for lane replacements will be provided wherever possible. Even with these mitigation measures, some inconveniences are inevitable and we seek the public’s understanding.",2,579,2015-01-20-T-024-S-00579

We maintain a firm and principled stance against corruption and other financial crimes. Singapore is a responsible and effective member of the wider international cooperation network in combatting transnational crime. For example, amendments to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act (MACMA) were passed by Parliament in July 2014 to enhance mutual legal assistance and facilitate greater international cooperation against transnational crime. Singapore also proactively shares our experiences with other countries at various fora, such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)'s Anti-Corruption and Transparency Experts’ Working Group.",3,583,2015-01-20-T-025-S-00583

2015-01-20-T-027,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,It is the duty of the contractor overseeing the construction site to ensure the construction has minimal impact on the residents. There are regulations in place to minimise the health and environmental impact of construction.,1,589,2015-01-20-T-027-S-00589
2015-01-20-T-027,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Under the Building Control Regulations, prior to project commencement, the contractor has to carry out a pre-construction survey to assess the existing conditions of the buildings and structures which are in close proximity to the building works. This survey would be used to determine whether the construction works have affected the surrounding properties.",2,590,2015-01-20-T-027-S-00590
2015-01-20-T-027,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"During project implementation, the Building Control Act requires contractors to erect protective hoarding around the site boundary to prevent construction debris from posing a hazard to the public and the environment. Measures must also be in place to minimise any soil movement which could affect the environment. For construction works that cause vibrations, the contractors have to ensure the vibration level is within the recommended limits based on international standards and practices. These are specified in the Code of Practice.",3,591,2015-01-20-T-027-S-00591
2015-01-20-T-027,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Contractors must comply with the maximum permissible noise levels regulated by the National Environment Agency (NEA). To meet these noise standards, contractors could put in place measures, such as setting up noise barriers. In addition, NEA imposes the no-work rule on Sundays and public holidays on construction sites that are located near residential and noise-sensitive premises, such as hospitals.",4,592,2015-01-20-T-027-S-00592
2015-01-20-T-027,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"In addition, the Environmental Public Health Act requires construction sites of contract sums exceeding $10 million to employ an Environmental Control Officer to anticipate and eliminate situations which could result in environmental health problems, for example, mosquito breeding.",5,593,2015-01-20-T-027-S-00593
2015-01-20-T-027,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and NEA regularly share good practices with the industry through seminars.

2015-01-20-T-028,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) takes a firm stance against discriminatory employment practices. All employers are expected to consider Singaporeans fairly by complying with the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) and the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices.,1,597,2015-01-20-T-028-S-00597
2015-01-20-T-028,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"MOM does not hesitate to take action against employers who are found to have discriminatory employment practices. Last year, MOM investigated and took action against 150 firms for having discriminatory employment practices. Some were given stern warnings while others had their work pass privileges curtailed for up to two years. We might also name and shame these employers. One example is Prime Gold International Ltd after investigations revealed that the firm discriminated against Singaporean employees by unfairly replacing them with foreigners. There has been a couple of high-profile cases highlighted in the media recently. I would like to assure the House that my Ministry has looked into the cases and will take the necessary action when investigations are completed.",2,598,2015-01-20-T-028-S-00598
2015-01-20-T-028,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Besides acting on complaints, we also proactively identify and engage firms with a disproportionately low share of Singaporeans compared to other firms in their industry. We have identified some firms with shortcomings in their HR practices and required them to implement an action plan to address these shortcomings. We also scrutinise their work pass applications closely.",3,599,2015-01-20-T-028-S-00599
2015-01-20-T-028,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"However, enforcement alone cannot be the only way to address the issue of unfair and discriminatory employment practices. We have complemented our enforcement action with the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP)’s promotion and education efforts. Our current approach has worked well. Companies that were approached by MOM and TAFEP have generally responded positively and are supportive of upholding fair employment practices. For unresponsive and recalcitrant employers, we are prepared to take further action where necessary.",4,600,2015-01-20-T-028-S-00600
2015-01-20-T-028,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"To conclude, let me emphasise that there is no place for employment discrimination in Singapore and the current penalties in place are sufficient to deter such practices. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and will review our approach if necessary.",5,601,2015-01-20-T-028-S-00601
2015-01-20-T-029,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the rationale for imposing a higher interest rate for home owners who take a third housing loan from HDB; (b) what is the income profile and circumstances in which a person will be granted a third HDB housing loan; and (c) whether the interest rate can be equalised regardless of the number of housing loans taken.,1,602,2015-01-20-T-029-S-00602
2015-01-20-T-029,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The Housing and Development Board (HDB) provides up to two concessionary rate loans to eligible flat buyers, with interest rate at below market rates over the long term. Under exceptional circumstances, HDB may grant a third housing loan, but it will then be at the market rate. Typically, this is for those who are in urgent need of housing but, due to poor credit records, are unable to secure a bank loan even though they have a steady income.",1,603,2015-01-20-T-029-S-00603
2015-01-20-T-029,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Providing a third housing loan at a higher rate is to discourage churning of resale flats. However, for genuine hardship cases, HDB may help with a concessionary rate loan, if the case merits such consideration.",2,604,2015-01-20-T-029-S-00604
2015-01-20-T-030,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,asked the Minister for National Development whether lifts in newer HDB flats are designed to accommodate an ageing population that may require wheelchair access and ambulance stretchers to quickly evacuate emergency cases using the lifts; (b) what proportion of existing HDB flats are not able to accommodate ambulance stretchers or to move deceased persons easily; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider enhancing lift regulations to accommodate the above in future lift upgrades.,1,605,2015-01-20-T-030-S-00605

The current focus is on expanding CAB and building a new runway at Changi, a complex undertaking that requires highly-skilled engineering as well as close coordination with the ongoing runway and terminal expansion works at Singapore Changi Airport. Construction of facilities at Changi will commence after detailed site surveys and land preparation works are completed. For TAB, the current effort is on the detailed airbase facility design.",2,629,2015-01-20-T-035-S-00629
2015-01-20-T-035,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"To ensure the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF)’s operational readiness is maintained, RSAF has put in place plans to build up various capabilities which include a state-of-the-art Island Air Defence System, fighters and other key mission capabilities. The ASTER-30 Surface-to-Air Missile System and the recently announced aerostat system are part of this effort. RSAF will also be upgrading and renewing some of our older systems to meet our long-term security needs.",3,630,2015-01-20-T-035-S-00630
2015-01-20-T-035,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"MINDEF will continue to work closely with MND and the relevant agencies on the detailed planning and implementation of the relocation.

2015-01-20-T-037,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Singapore’s relations with Indonesia have always been broad-based and multifaceted. This is underpinned by mutual respect and ""win-win"" cooperation in various fields, such as the economy, education, environment, health and defence. Our ties at the leadership level are excellent and are buttressed by strong people-to-people links.",1,635,2015-01-20-T-037-S-00635
2015-01-20-T-037,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We have also stood together in solidarity during times of crises. For instance, we just commemorated the 10th anniversary of the tsunami that devastated Aceh on 26 December 2004. The Singapore Armed Forces worked closely with the Indonesian military to help the victims and their families in the aftermath of the disaster. During the recent crash of AirAsia flight QZ 8501, Singapore supported the search and locate and subsequent recovery efforts led by Indonesia. Our agencies operated closely with their Indonesian counterparts, leveraging on the close ties forged over many years.",2,636,2015-01-20-T-037-S-00636
2015-01-20-T-037,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Similarly, we have cooperated closely in international and regional forums. Singapore and Indonesia share similar views on the need for a stable region with an open and inclusive regional architecture. We have worked well together to promote Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) centrality, stability and prosperity. When there are outstanding or difficult issues, we have been able to discuss them in a frank and constructive manner in order to find a way forward. Ultimately, we understand that, as neighbours and regional partners, there is much to be gained in strengthening the relationship between our two countries. I am confident that this will continue to be the case going forward.",3,637,2015-01-20-T-037-S-00637

2015-01-20-T-037,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I also met my foreign affairs counterpart Ms Retno Marsudi on a number of occasions recently. She visited Singapore for her introductory visit on 26 November 2014 and I visited Jakarta in December 2014 to have discussions with her and other Indonesian leaders.

2015-01-20-T-038,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Today, we have Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) for mid-career professionals who are keen to join healthcare as nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists or diagnostic radiographers. Under the Healthcare PCPs, trainees receive funding that covers the full fees of a local training programme, a monthly training allowance and a Career Transition Bonus upon graduation.",1,642,2015-01-20-T-038-S-00642
2015-01-20-T-038,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Our Healthcare PCPs focus on disciplines where we have the most significant manpower needs and where there is adequate faculty to support a local training programme. There are currently no plans to extend the PCPs to podiatrists, respiratory therapists, perfusionists or physician assistants.",2,643,2015-01-20-T-038-S-00643
2015-01-20-T-038,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Instead, the Ministry of Health offers scholarships for Singaporeans to be trained as podiatrists and respirational therapists overseas. Over the past five years, we have awarded 20 scholarships for podiatry and 12 scholarships for respiratory therapy. Our public healthcare institutions also provide in-house training for biological sciences graduates to become perfusionists. We presently do not have physician assistants in the healthcare sector but are reviewing the various healthcare provider roles as we plan for the future.",3,644,2015-01-20-T-038-S-00644

2015-01-20-T-039,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the cost of providing free MRT and bus rides to all Singaporeans above 60 years old, 65 years old and 67 years old respectively; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider providing free transport to all Singaporeans above 67 years old.",1,646,2015-01-20-T-039-S-00646
2015-01-20-T-039,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,It is difficult to estimate the costs as the travel patterns of the senior citizen group can vary considerably with different policies in place and because we only have the data of those who hold the senior citizen concession card and not that of the entire senior citizen population.,1,647,2015-01-20-T-039-S-00647
2015-01-20-T-039,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"That said, to give an idea of the costs for which the Member has requested, the annual cost of travel incurred by the 580,000 senior citizen card holders, all of whom are Singaporeans 60 years old and above, is about $200 million annually. If we look only at the card holders who are 65 years old and above, and 67 years old and above, the cost is about $125 million and $95 million respectively. With free travel, the travel patterns may change and the estimates may rise due to induced travel demand. Furthermore, the population of all Singaporeans 60 years old and above is about 660,000 today and rising, more than the 580,000 senior citizen card holders and, therefore, the estimates are on the low side.",2,648,2015-01-20-T-039-S-00648
2015-01-20-T-039,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Another consideration would be that all senior citizens who are 60 years old and above already enjoy today, generous discounts of 25% to 59% off adult fares, depending on the distance they travel. Senior citizens who travel frequently can also cap their public transport expenditure by using the monthly concession pass priced at $60.",3,649,2015-01-20-T-039-S-00649
2015-01-20-T-039,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Given these generous discounts and the significant additional cost taxpayers and other commuters will have to foot, I am not sure we need or should move to completely free travel for our senior citizens at this time. We will, however, revisit this issue from time to time and continue to pay very close attention to fare affordability for vulnerable groups of Singaporeans, including senior citizens.",4,650,2015-01-20-T-039-S-00650

2015-01-20-T-040,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Currently, all bus captains are required to demonstrate basic competency in conversational English before being deployed.

2015-01-20-T-041,K Karthikeyan,Mr K Karthikeyan,asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider increasing the current minimum annual leave entitlement of seven days under the Employment Act.,1,654,2015-01-20-T-041-S-00654
2015-01-20-T-041,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The Employment Act (EA) stipulates minimum labour standards to be complied with by all employers and so ought to be kept basic. Under the EA, an employee who has served an employer for at least three months is entitled to seven days of paid annual leave in the first year of service. Subsequently, for every year of service with the same employer, he is entitled to an additional one day’s paid annual leave, up to 14 days. However, employers are encouraged to consider more generous leave benefits as a strategy to attract good workers in this tight labour market.",1,655,2015-01-20-T-041-S-00655
2015-01-20-T-041,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"A 2014 survey by the Ministry of Manpower showed that many companies already provide more days of annual leave than what is legislated. About half of the establishments2 provided more than the minimum seven days of annual leave for their rank-and-file employees, and 35% already provide 14 days or more.",2,656,2015-01-20-T-041-S-00656
2015-01-20-T-041,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Employees, who see that their organisations are more generous than just following the minimal provisions of the law to protect the most vulnerable, are likely to be more committed. A more motivated workforce can, in turn, benefit employers in terms of lower absenteeism, higher staff retention as well as better productivity.",3,657,2015-01-20-T-041-S-00657
2015-01-20-T-042,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether the former Surrender Chamber in the old City Hall building will be restored to its former state when the renovations are completed and the National Gallery Singapore opens next year.",1,658,2015-01-20-T-042-S-00658
