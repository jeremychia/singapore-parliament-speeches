2015-01-20-T-001-S-00001,2015-01-20-T-001,1,K Karthikeyan,"asked  the Minister for Health whether hospitals administer different drugs and treatment for the same medical conditions based on private or subsidised wards and, if so, whether the Ministry conducts checks on hospitals for such practices."
2015-01-20-T-001-S-00002,2015-01-20-T-001,2,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"<span style=""color  rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color  transparent;""> </span>"
2015-01-20-T-001-S-00003,2015-01-20-T-001,3,Amy Khor Lean Suan,
2015-01-20-T-001-S-00004,2015-01-20-T-001,4,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Some of the drugs or treatments thus prescribed could be non-subsidised as there are more cost-effective alternatives available. Nonetheless, where non-subsidised drugs or treatments are assessed to be clinically required and cannot be replaced by subsidised alternatives, patients from lower-income households are provided assistance to help them access these drugs or treatments."
2015-01-20-T-001-S-00005,2015-01-20-T-001,5,Amy Khor Lean Suan,
2015-01-20-T-001-S-00006,2015-01-20-T-001,6,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Public hospitals have various governance frameworks in place to ensure that patients receive care appropriate to their clinical needs. This includes accreditation committees to ensure appropriate use of new technologies and procedures and that procedures are performed by properly trained doctors. The Pharmacy and Therapeutic (P&T) and Medical Device (MDC) committees ensure clinically appropriate use of drugs and medical devices/implants respectively. There are also pre-operations conferences for peer review of elective surgeries to ensure that they are appropriate, safe and not unnecessary."
2015-01-20-T-001-S-00007,2015-01-20-T-001,7,K Karthikeyan,"I had a recent case with my union member who went to a hospital to do a stomach operation. There is a range of painkillers. The nurse gave him Panadol. He said, ""I just did a stomach operation. Is there any way I can get an injection?"" The doctor and the nurse were talking and he overheard the conversation  ""C Class ward; Panadol is enough."" This gave him a feeling that you would get subsidised treatment when you are in a C Class ward. Is there any way we can talk to the hospitals and see how they communicate and how they make things straight? That is my only concern."
2015-01-20-T-001-S-00008,2015-01-20-T-001,8,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"First, let me thank the Member for raising this Parliamentary Question (PQ), as well as for sharing this example. It is important for us to explain and clarify. Let me reassure the Member that hospitals do not differentiate the treatment routes based on the subsidy status of the patients, as long as the treatment route is required and necessary."
2015-01-20-T-001-S-00009,2015-01-20-T-001,9,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"In this stance, it is, indeed, unfortunate that there is this perception. We need to get more details to better understand the case. Let me briefly elaborate."
2015-01-20-T-001-S-00010,2015-01-20-T-001,10,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"There are clinical guidelines for pain management in different clinical conditions, which provide clinical guidance on the choice of pain relief drugs, and these are in line with international practices."
2015-01-20-T-001-S-00011,2015-01-20-T-001,11,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Typically, for pain management, as the Member has highlighted, clinical guidelines may give guidance to provide baseline pain management; further pain drugs may be added, if required; as well as to start with the least invasive drugs. This approach is quite typical across the different clinical conditions. The patient may, first, be prescribed oral Panadol. This could progress to stronger, more potent drugs, through injections, for instance. These are not without side effects."
2015-01-20-T-001-S-00012,2015-01-20-T-001,12,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Basically, throughout the spectrum of drugs required for pain management, you can find subsidised drugs. So, the patient does not really have to pay more for these subsidised drugs. There is no Panadol injection, but as the Member has mentioned, there are morphine, pethidine, nico injections which are in the Standard Drugs List. As I have said, these are stronger painkillers and may not be without their side effects. So, we need to ascertain if the patient's conditions will warrant these and if these are suitable for the patient. We would need further details to better understand the case."
2015-01-20-T-001-S-00013,2015-01-20-T-001,13,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"What I would like to reiterate is that the drug and treatment prescribed are what the doctor and the healthcare team deem as clinically appropriate, based on the patient's conditions and not based on the subsidy status of the patient."
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00014,2015-01-20-T-002,14,Zaqy Mohamad,"asked  the Minister for Health in respect of the latest statistics by the National Registry of Diseases that a disproportionate number of diabetics and patients with kidney failure, heart attacks and strokes come from the Malay population (a) whether the Ministry has plans to address the issue with the Malay community; and (b) whether the Ministry has conducted specific research on the causes and devised strategies to address them accordingly."
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00015,2015-01-20-T-002,15,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"<strong style=""color  rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color  transparent;"">(for the Minister for Health)</strong>"
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00016,2015-01-20-T-002,16,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00017,2015-01-20-T-002,17,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"The Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Health Promotion Board (HPB) have a variety of preventive health programmes and activities targeted at the general population, including children, adolescents, adults and the elderly, to keep Singaporeans healthy and free of illness and disability for as long as possible through the adoption and maintenance of healthy lifestyle habits. To further encourage positive behavioural change, we launched the Healthy Living Masterplan in 2014, which aims to make healthy living accessible, natural and effortless for all Singaporeans."
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00018,2015-01-20-T-002,18,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00019,2015-01-20-T-002,19,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"While rolling out population-based programmes to all Singaporeans, HPB has, over the years, tailored programmes specific to the cultural context of the various ethnic groups. Take, for example, the Holistic Women's Health Workshop Series, which aims to empower women to take charge of their own and families' health over a range of health topics. This series of workshops is not only conducted in English, but also contextualised for the Chinese- and Malay-speaking audiences."
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00020,2015-01-20-T-002,20,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00021,2015-01-20-T-002,21,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Since 2012, HPB has been partnering Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) and mosques in the Ramadan I Quit smoking cessation programmes. In 2014, of the 1,507 participants, one in five quit smoking and another one in four reduced the number of cigarettes they smoked."
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00022,2015-01-20-T-002,22,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00023,2015-01-20-T-002,23,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"In 2013, HPB partnered the Singapore Muslim Women's Association (Persatuan Pemudi Islam Singapura or PPIS) and mosques to launch the 2014 Health calendar for Malay women. Serving as a healthy living educational tool, the calendar incorporates healthy recipes, health tips and screening messages to help users make healthier choices for themselves and their families. The response was positive and we have increased the distribution of the 2015 calendar tenfold to 30,000 households. In fact, this initiative has proven so popular that we have just launched a Chinese version of this calendar for the Chinese community, too."
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00024,2015-01-20-T-002,24,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00025,2015-01-20-T-002,25,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Such initiatives and programmes are guided by the data and research that MOH and HPB conduct on the population, such as the National Health Survey, National Health Surveillance Survey and National Nutrition Survey. These surveys gather quantitative data on the health behaviour of the community and are complemented by ongoing qualitative feedback processes for further fine tuning of programmes."
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00026,2015-01-20-T-002,26,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00027,2015-01-20-T-002,27,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"My Ministry continuously reviews our research methodology to ensure that we have the latest data on the health status of the population. We will also continue to incorporate best practices and research findings from other countries, where relevant, and update our health prevention programmes and strategies tailored to the local context, including the Malay community."
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00028,2015-01-20-T-002,28,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his reply. Two clarifications. First, in profiling the Malay community as being more prone to certain sorts of diseases, have these co-rrelations been identified through studies of profiles of the population or is it more genetics? I am just wondering if more in-depth research has been done."
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00029,2015-01-20-T-002,29,Zaqy Mohamad,"Two, in terms of outreach, it is great to see outreach, such as quit smoking campaigns, being done at the mosques. The number of people being reached out to is about 5,000, and the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that one fifth had quit smoking, for example. This is good outreach, but I think the numbers are still a bit small. There are also many other diseases that need to be managed as well. Is the Ministry considering more of such outreach or more of such collaborations in the community to address the other health issues?"
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00030,2015-01-20-T-002,30,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"I want to thank the Member for the supplementary questions. As I had mentioned earlier, all the non-communicable diseases have common lifestyle risk factors, which are linked very directly to obesity, the food that we eat, as well as the lack of sufficient physical activity. These affect diseases like high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Essentially, what we have been trying to do is to encourage people to eat moderately, a balanced diet, to have physical activities and go for health screening."
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00031,2015-01-20-T-002,31,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"It is important that we embark on this. At the same time, we have noticed that different ethnic groups have different lifestyles. Even though all of us eat, but Malays have their common way of eating and the dishes that they like. Similarly for the Chinese and the others."
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00032,2015-01-20-T-002,32,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"We have moved into a targeted approach, which I had shared earlier. The calendar is very popular this year. We not only give aspects of the calendar, but we also relate to their lifestyle, in terms of the food that they cook and their common habits, so that we can reach out to the different sectors of the community. We realised that, over time, they become excited about how to live healthily. With that aspect, we want to focus on these lifestyle factors."
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00033,2015-01-20-T-002,33,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Beyond that, in terms of genetics, we do not have significant evidence to show such a phenomenon. Based on what we have and what research we have done locally, we realise that such lifestyle practices play an important role. And we can reduce the risk to such non-communicable diseases among the community if we focus on the aspects of healthy eating, physical activity as well as going for proper and appropriate health screening."
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00034,2015-01-20-T-002,34,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"With regards to outreach, Members will see that, over time, we have been able to reach out to more and more Singaporeans in terms of the programmes that we have. For example, the calendar, we have increased it tremendously in terms of numbers. When we did it last year, we received many requests from the community, asking for more. We gave out more publicity materials than what we gave out last year. Demand has gone up so much that we had to ask for more materials."
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00035,2015-01-20-T-002,35,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Secondly, if you look at the anti-smoking campaign, the ""I Quit"" programme, you would realise that the numbers have not only  gone up, the number of families coming on board to be part of this process of their family members has also gone up. I was there in the last few years to share the load and to reach out to the community. I was so touched by the community support not only among the children and spouses, but also among grandparents coming to support to get their children to quit smoking."
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00036,2015-01-20-T-002,36,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Beyond these figures, anecdotally, I feel that there has also been an increase in terms of awareness about healthy living. For example, locally in my area, over two years, the number of Malays coming on board to be a part of an exercise group, which I join often, has gone up by three times. I met them recently and I am so happy because I usually ask how many would need a calendar. In the past, it was about 10 to 15. This year, close to 40 to 50 asked for it. When I went down and met them, there was a sense of passion, commitment towards healthy living."
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00037,2015-01-20-T-002,37,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Also, you see more stakeholders coming together to be part of it. For example, we have the Geng Sihat over the last weekend – Mdm Speaker was also part of this process to reach out to the community."
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00038,2015-01-20-T-002,38,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"We are beginning to see more and more small pockets of those in the Malay/Muslim community coming together to reach out, to live healthily and, at the same time, create an atmosphere that healthy living is the right thing to do."
2015-01-20-T-002-S-00039,2015-01-20-T-002,39,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,I would like to assure the Member that we would continue this effort. We feel that it is important for the community to be healthy and this will help the community to achieve a better life in Singapore.
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00040,2015-01-20-T-003,40,Zainal Sapari,asked  the Minister for National Development (a) how many HDB flats have been compulsorily acquired in the past three years; (b) what are the main reasons behind the compulsory acquisition of these HDB flats; (c) what are the alternative accommodation provided to families affected by the compulsory acquisition; and (d) what measures are in place to enable these families to own HDB flats again.
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00041,2015-01-20-T-003,41,Desmond Lee,"<strong style=""background-color  transparent; color  rgb(0, 0, 0);"">(for the Minister for National Development)</strong>"
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00042,2015-01-20-T-003,42,Desmond Lee,
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00043,2015-01-20-T-003,43,Desmond Lee,"HDB will assist households affected by CA due to mortgage arrears to find alternative accommodation. For those who can afford smaller flats, HDB will help them buy one and may offer them another loan for the purchase, if necessary. Those who are unable to afford another flat and have no family support or other housing option, are allocated rental flats."
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00044,2015-01-20-T-003,44,Zainal Sapari,"I thank the Minister of State. I have three supplementary questions. First, after how many months of mortgage arrears have to be accumulated for HDB to start the process of CA? Second, how does HDB help home owners manage their arrears? And third, could HDB consider assisting home owners with alternative accommodation even if they decide to sell their flats on their own instead of through CA?"
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00045,2015-01-20-T-003,45,Desmond Lee,"Mdm Speaker, it is not in the interest of HDB flat owners to accumulate mortgage arrears. It is not just a heavy financial burden on them but also tremendous emotional strain. HDB, therefore, intervenes early, proactively and sympathetically to help flat owners resolve their arrears issues."
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00046,2015-01-20-T-003,46,Desmond Lee,"There are many measures that can be taken to help these HDB home owners. Some are short term, to deal with their short-term financial difficulties. Some are longer term for those facing prolonged difficulties. For instance, loan instalments are usually paid on the first of each month, but HDB gives lessees up to the end of the month if they face temporary cash flow difficulties. If they still face problems doing so, HDB will make a call, arrange a meet-up or even do a home visit, to better understand the situation and to offer help. The Member may note that every HDB branch has housing counsellors who offer financial counselling and explore sustainable housing options for home owners in mortgage arrears."
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00047,2015-01-20-T-003,47,Desmond Lee,"What are some of these options? First, HDB can help the flat owner reschedule his mortgage loan, including extending the repayment up to the maximum loan period, if that would help."
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00048,2015-01-20-T-003,48,Desmond Lee,"Second, under the reduced repayment scheme, owners in difficulty can pay lower monthly instalments of between, say, 50% and 75% of their normal instalments for, say, up to two years."
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00049,2015-01-20-T-003,49,Desmond Lee,"Third, they can defer their mortgage payments if they face serious financial difficulties. This will be for an initial six-month period. It can be extended based on review."
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00050,2015-01-20-T-003,50,Desmond Lee,"Fourth, home owners can pay their arrears by instalments."
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00051,2015-01-20-T-003,51,Desmond Lee,"Fifth, they could sublet a spare room if there is one to generate additional income for themselves."
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00052,2015-01-20-T-003,52,Desmond Lee,"Sixth, they can also include their working adult children to help pay the loan without affecting their children's eligibility to apply for HDB loans in future."
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00053,2015-01-20-T-003,53,Desmond Lee,"Seventh, apart from financial measures, we also recognise that mortgage arrears are normally a symptom of other difficulties that the owners face. For instance, medical problems, medical or family issues, loss of job, loss of a loved one and the breadwinner, and so on."
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00054,2015-01-20-T-003,54,Desmond Lee,"HDB's counsellors, therefore, look beyond housing loan measures that I have just detailed above, and work with other agencies to help these families more holistically. These include Family Service Centres for family counselling; e2i, WDA or the CDC for job placement or job upgrading; the SSO for financial assistance; VWOs and so on."
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00055,2015-01-20-T-003,55,Desmond Lee,"Eighth, for those who are still unable to manage, as I said earlier, HDB will help them right size to the flat that they can afford and offer another housing loan to assist them, if necessary."
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00056,2015-01-20-T-003,56,Desmond Lee,"Ninth, if they cannot afford another flat, then HDB will allocate them a rental flat."
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00057,2015-01-20-T-003,57,Desmond Lee,"From January 2012 to December 2014, HDB assisted 9,752 families with one or more of the measures that I have just described above. It is only when all these attempts to solve their arrears problem fail, such as when the home owners persistently refuse to solve their arrears or work towards a sustainable solution, that HDB has no choice but to exercise CA."
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00058,2015-01-20-T-003,58,Desmond Lee,"The Member has asked for the timeframe. Under the legislation, CA can be taken if arrears pile up for up to three months, but in practice, HDB works with lessees, as I have just mentioned above, and this can take quite some time. It is an ongoing process."
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00059,2015-01-20-T-003,59,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"I wish to ask the Minister of State once the date of CA has been firmed up, is there a formal written notice sent to the lessee? Second, how long is this notice period?"
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00060,2015-01-20-T-003,60,Desmond Lee,"Mdm Speaker, yes, HDB issues a Notice of Intention to compulsorily acquire a flat and, down the line, after all measures have failed, in addition to what I have just detailed above, a revesting notice is issued. Between the Notice of Intention and the actual acquisition, if HDB does need to resort to that, it can be many months, even up to a year or beyond. That is a reflection of the effort that HDB officers put in to try to resolve the issues with the families directly."
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00061,2015-01-20-T-003,61,Zaqy Mohamad,"I thank the Minister of State for the clarification earlier. I just want to move slightly to a different note. I know, most times, we have been sympathetic and I credit HDB for being sympathetic in a lot of compassionate cases out there. But in my estate, for example, we have a lot of middle-income families and, most times, we look at right sizing and when they go into arrears, it is really about credit card and other sorts of debts."
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00062,2015-01-20-T-003,62,Zaqy Mohamad,"HDB has not mentioned one of those as a criterion that you consider but, most of the time, when they right size, the cash that they get is also used to pay for a lot of these debts. What is HDB's view on this because, many a time, when they want to right size, you take into account all these cash surpluses that you get as part of the settlement. I think for many of them, they also get stuck in trying to get a new flat or to right size. So, what is HDB's view on credit card and other forms of debts?"
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00063,2015-01-20-T-003,63,Desmond Lee,"An HDB flat is a home and HDB does not encourage people to monetise the flat, then use it to settle debts, leaving themselves without a shelter. Having said that, we recognise the realities and difficulties of life. Families may choose to settle all these debts to the detriment of their housing needs. It is, therefore, as I said in my answer earlier, that, in the last resort, HDB offers public rental housing or interim rental housing as these families take time to sort out the various issues."
2015-01-20-T-003-S-00064,2015-01-20-T-003,64,Desmond Lee,"I also said earlier, in my response to the Member Zainal Sapari's supplementary question, that HDB counsellors look beyond just arrears management and work holistically across the board with various agencies to tackle these issues, such as credit cards, money lenders, social assistance, healthcare and do their best to sort out these issues holistically."
2015-01-20-T-004-S-00065,2015-01-20-T-004,65,Foo Mee Har,asked  the Minister for National Development (a) what implication does HDB's net deficit of $1.97 billion in Financial Year (FY)2013/2014 have for Singapore; and (b) whether this deficit trend will escalate in the future years.
2015-01-20-T-004-S-00066,2015-01-20-T-004,66,Khaw Boon Wan,"Madam, the Housing and Development Board (HDB)'s deficit is the outcome of Government policies to provide Singaporeans with good, affordable public housing and quality living environments in HDB towns."
2015-01-20-T-004-S-00067,2015-01-20-T-004,67,Khaw Boon Wan,
2015-01-20-T-004-S-00068,2015-01-20-T-004,68,Khaw Boon Wan,HDB's deficit is largely due to the subsidy extended to buyers of new flats and the disbursement of Central Provident Fund (CPF) housing grants to eligible buyers of resale flats.
2015-01-20-T-004-S-00069,2015-01-20-T-004,69,Khaw Boon Wan,
2015-01-20-T-004-S-00070,2015-01-20-T-004,70,Khaw Boon Wan,"The spike in HDB's deficit in Financial Year (FY) 2013 was due to HDB's ramp-up in its flat-building and upgrading programmes. The deficit will remain high in the next few years, as flats launched in the ramp-up phase are progressively completed and handed over."
2015-01-20-T-004-S-00071,2015-01-20-T-004,71,Khaw Boon Wan,
2015-01-20-T-004-S-00072,2015-01-20-T-004,72,Khaw Boon Wan,"For future years, the deficit level will depend on several factors, such as housing demand, policy changes, HDB's building and upgrading programmes, as well as development costs. HDB will continue to use its allocated resources judiciously to provide affordable and quality homes for Singaporeans."
2015-01-20-T-004-S-00073,2015-01-20-T-004,73,Foo Mee Har,"Madam, I thank the Minister for his response. I have two short supplementary questions for the Minister. I would like to ask the Minister how HDB financials would be impacted by other HDB initiatives, such as the Home Improvement Programme where the Government subsidises up to 95% of the upgrading cost. And I understand there are plans to ramp up this initiative covering about 100,000 flats in the next two years."
2015-01-20-T-004-S-00074,2015-01-20-T-004,74,Foo Mee Har,"Second, I would like to ask the Minister whether he expects the deficit of $1.97 billion as part of the budget process from committed projects. How much of the deficit was anticipated and how much was due to cost overruns? And how does the Government cover the deficits that HDB incurs?"
2015-01-20-T-004-S-00075,2015-01-20-T-004,75,Khaw Boon Wan,"Madam, indeed, other HDB initiatives, like HIP, will contribute to the deficit of HDB. But the single biggest ticket item in our deficit is the subsidy and housing grants under the Home Ownership Programme. For upgrading, as we ramp up some programmes, there are other upgrading programmes which we are ramping down, for example, LUP, which is a big $5-billion project."
2015-01-20-T-004-S-00076,2015-01-20-T-004,76,Khaw Boon Wan,"How do we finance it? HDB operates under what we call the deficit financing model. So, whatever the deficit is for the year, we receive a grant from the Ministry of Finance (MOF), so that, in the end, we will balance our account. That grant is reflected in the overall Government Budget for the year, which we debate during COS."
2015-01-20-T-004-S-00077,2015-01-20-T-004,77,Khaw Boon Wan,"Was the almost $2-billion deficit expected? Yes, it was expected because as we ramp up the numbers – 25,000 homes – you should expect that the deficit will grow accordingly. But going forward, I do not see us building 25,000 units per year for a long time. In fact, this is already Year Four, and we have started the process of tapering it down for the simple reason that the number of family formation is not of that order. While I hope even more Singaporeans will get married and have larger numbers of babies, I do not see that happening in the near future or the medium term."
2015-01-20-T-005-S-00078,2015-01-20-T-005,78,Seah Kian Peng,asked  the Minister for National Development (a) what has been the number of events held at the Speakers' Corner for the past one year; (b) how does this compare with the year before and the year that it was started; and (c) whether there is a need to review regulations over the use of Hong Lim Park.
2015-01-20-T-005-S-00079,2015-01-20-T-005,79,Khaw Boon Wan,"Last year, there were 136 registrations of events in the Speakers' Corner. The corresponding figure for 2013 was 169."

2015-01-20-T-005-S-00083,2015-01-20-T-005,83,Khaw Boon Wan,"The regulations governing the use of Hong Lim Park have worked well over the years, with no untoward cases until the incident of 27 September last year. As legal proceedings against certain persons related to the incident are still ongoing, it is not appropriate to comment on whether there is a need to review the regulations over the use of Hong Lim Park."
2015-01-20-T-006-S-00084,2015-01-20-T-006,84,Seng Han Thong,asked  the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) if he will give an update on PUB's action plan to strengthen Singapore's flood resilience; (b) whether the action plan that covers the entire spectrum of drainage and flood management has worked or not; and (c) whether it needs further enhancement in the larger context of long-term plans in view of global climate change.
2015-01-20-T-006-S-00085,2015-01-20-T-006,85,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Mdm Speaker, the increasing frequency of high-intensity storms as well as the progressive urbanisation of our landscape has posed challenges for the management of flooding in Singapore."

2015-01-20-T-006-S-00087,2015-01-20-T-006,87,Vivian Balakrishnan,"My colleagues in the Public Utilities Board (PUB) have been very busy over the last few years. PUB adopts a comprehensive ""source-pathway-receptor"" approach to preventing and mitigating floods. This involves measures, first, to reduce the storm water run-off, that is, at the source itself, where the rain falls; second, to enhance drainage capacity, that is, to increase the flow within the drains; and, third, to reduce the flood risks at vulnerable low-lying areas."
2015-01-20-T-006-S-00088,2015-01-20-T-006,88,Vivian Balakrishnan,
2015-01-20-T-006-S-00089,2015-01-20-T-006,89,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Since 2011, our drainage design standards have been changed and they have been raised by between 15% and 50%, depending on the size of the catchment. PUB has, therefore, been carrying out an island wide drainage improvement programme to enhance the capacity of all our canals and drains to meet these new standards. That is why many of you would have noticed that there is a lot more work going on in drains, I am sure, even in your own local neighbourhoods over the last three years."

2015-01-20-T-006-S-00091,2015-01-20-T-006,91,Vivian Balakrishnan,"In fact, since 2012, drainage improvement works at 187 locations have been completed. Ongoing, currently, is work at another 115 locations, including the Stamford Detention Tank, the Stamford Diversion Canal and the Bukit Timah First Diversion Canal. This year, drainage improvement works in an additional 19 areas will also commence and these include improvement works to Tampines Canal to alleviate flood risks along Tampines Road itself as well as new drainage infrastructure in Marina South to serve upcoming developments in that area."

2015-01-20-T-006-S-00093,2015-01-20-T-006,93,Vivian Balakrishnan,"To reduce run-off ""at-source"", all new developments or redevelopments of 0.2 hectares or more since January 2014 have had to control the peak run-off entering the public drainage system. Developments can achieve this by implementing on-site detention or retention measures in order to reduce the peak run-off, which means, when the rain falls, it does not immediately enter the public drainage system. To date, about 75 developments have submitted plans that have incorporated such on-site features."
2015-01-20-T-006-S-00094,2015-01-20-T-006,94,Vivian Balakrishnan,
2015-01-20-T-006-S-00095,2015-01-20-T-006,95,Vivian Balakrishnan,"At the ""receptor"" level, PUB has raised the requirement levels for platform and crest levels for all new developments and redevelopments since 2011. This is to provide an additional safeguard against future sea level rises. PUB has also been working with specific building owners to provide technical advice on relevant receptor solutions such as flood barriers and road crests, where necessary."

2015-01-20-T-006-S-00097,2015-01-20-T-006,97,Vivian Balakrishnan,"In addition to all these structural enhancements, PUB has also instituted measures to help the public better prepare for floods. PUB has a network of 171 water sensors installed in all the major drains and 161 closed circuit televisions (CCTVs) installed at flood-prone areas in order to provide remote monitoring of drain and flood conditions at critical junctions. All this data is available publicly in real time. If you use any of the apps from my Ministry, you will be able to see the video feeds in real time. The drain sensors are tweeted in real time also, if the water levels reach significant points."

It is too early to declare victory but we have made progress and I would say my colleagues are cautiously optimistic. We will continue to work hard and, over time, the results will speak for themselves."
2015-01-20-T-006-S-00102,2015-01-20-T-006,102,Seng Han Thong,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Minister for his cautiously optimistic answer and for the hard work by the PUB. And, really, this time round, we did not suffer any flooding in the Orchard Road area, not even ponding. May I ask whether there are other initiatives besides the recommendations of the expert panel in 2012?"
2015-01-20-T-006-S-00103,2015-01-20-T-006,103,Vivian Balakrishnan,"We have substantially implemented all the recommendations that were put up by the expert panel. We are actually projecting a future with even greater challenges. As global climate change occurs, we anticipate further rises in sea levels. We also anticipate more intense storms. So, even the levels of drainage standards we have imposed now may not be adequate for the future. So, this is an ongoing programme. Members will also appreciate that these are major and expensive works and they are disruptive. So, we have got to phase them out and ensure that we do not unnecessarily disrupt lives or spend too much money in advance of those needs. So, there is an element of judgement needed."
2015-01-20-T-006-S-00104,2015-01-20-T-006,104,Vivian Balakrishnan,"I will just give Members a figure, so that you can get an idea of it. If you go back to the 1970s, Singapore had about 3,200 hectares of low-lying flood-prone areas. Today, the flood-prone area has been reduced to about 34 hectares; 3,200 hectares to 34 hectares. But to reduce 34 hectares to an even smaller number, it is like ascending the last bit of the mountain. It will get progressively more difficult. But we make this commitment that we will be open and we will acknowledge problems. That is part of the reason for our tweets on drains, that is, to send a message to the people that we will not ignore problems, we will be completely open and forthright about them."
2015-01-20-T-006-S-00105,2015-01-20-T-006,105,Vivian Balakrishnan,"The other point is that we have a simple heuristic within PUB. If an area has had a flood, we will conduct a full investigation, identify the source, if need be, upgrade the drain. You will see continuous improvement. If any of you have got any specific concerns in your respective areas, please let us know."

In addition, foreigners who wish to save on their own may tap on the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS). They will enjoy tax benefits on the SRS contributions they make. We will continue to review the SRS scheme from time to time."

2015-01-20-T-007-S-00115,2015-01-20-T-007,115,Josephine Teo,"For the majority of Singaporeans, the CPF remains at the core of our social security system. Beyond mandatory contributions, both individuals and employers can make voluntary contributions to the CPF accounts and enjoy tax benefits. For the less well-off, the Government provides support through top-ups to their CPF accounts, such as through Workfare and housing grants and the enhanced interest scheme."

Yes, I am aware that Singapore did overall score quite well in the Mercer Index, but the point was that on the adequacy requirement side, we actually scored 56.4, which is below the global average of 63, and adequacy requirement is something that is very important to Singaporeans, given rising costs."
2015-01-20-T-007-S-00117,2015-01-20-T-007,117,Yee Jenn Jong,"I would like to ask specifically about section 5 of the Income Tax Act which provides for this sort of corporate retirement plans. There are reports saying that there are only about 20 companies in Singapore that currently implement such plans. I would like to know, given that this scheme was there since 1994, why is the take-up rate so low, and is there a way to use corporate retirement plans to supplement our CPF and SRS schemes? And is there a study to see whether our companies are not taking up these section 5 plans? Is it because maybe the tax benefits are not good enough or it is not widely known and publicised to the companies?"
2015-01-20-T-007-S-00118,2015-01-20-T-007,118,Josephine Teo,"Mdm Speaker, since the Member Mr Yee had talked about Singapore's specific score on retirement adequacy, with your permission, I would like to take a step back and I do not mean to be technical or to suggest that the index is unhelpful in any way. But I think each time we look at such indices, there is some value to investing the time to understand how they are constructed and what they actually measure."
2015-01-20-T-007-S-00119,2015-01-20-T-007,119,Josephine Teo,"As far as we know, where corporate retirement plans are concerned, the index assigns a higher score to countries which provide tax advantages for such private plans. In other words, there is a particular item in this index and if a country provides tax advantages for providing private plans, then you would score higher on it. It does not matter whether there are, within that country, schemes like the CPF or even the fact that there are tax benefits for voluntary contributions to the CPF, for example, through the Minimum Sum Top-Up Scheme; none of those things matter."
2015-01-20-T-007-S-00120,2015-01-20-T-007,120,Josephine Teo,"In fact, if we think about it, even in the absence of private plans on a large-scale basis, employers in Singapore are already required to contribute 17% to an employee's retirement savings through CPF. That is our CPF contribution rate. And you compare that to Australia where the mandatory contribution is 9.5%, and Denmark which came up tops in this study, the mandatory contribution is between 6% and 11%. If you look narrowly at this score, then you could be led to draw a certain conclusion and forget the fact that even in the absence of large-scale retirement plans – private plans, corporate retirement plans – actually, employers in Singapore are already contributing quite a lot to employees' retirement savings through CPF."
2015-01-20-T-007-S-00121,2015-01-20-T-007,121,Josephine Teo,"Putting this aside, the key question is whether the so-called shortcoming is something that should be a major concern to us. I would like to reiterate the point, Madam, that it is relevant mainly for foreigners working here for whom the CPF is not applicable. Members would agree with me that our primary concern should be for Singaporeans, unless Mr Yee thinks otherwise."

2015-01-20-T-008-S-00127,2015-01-20-T-008,127,Josephine Teo,"Hence, as provided under the Pioneer Generation Fund Act, the Panel decided that it would only consider appeals relating to the citizenship criterion."
2015-01-20-T-008-S-00128,2015-01-20-T-008,128,Josephine Teo,"As part of the evaluation process, the Panel considers whether the person had obtained Singapore citizenship shortly after 1986 – the year set as the citizenship cut-off date for eligibility of the Pioneer Generation Package. In addition, it looks at factors, such as whether he or she had been in Singapore since the early years of independence, contributed to our society and demonstrated clear efforts to sink roots in Singapore. To date, the Panel has approved 642 of such appeals."
2015-01-20-T-008-S-00129,2015-01-20-T-008,129,Lily Neo,"Madam, may I ask the Senior Minister of State whether she will take into consideration the lack of means or poverty as one of the mitigating criteria in appeals for the Pioneer Generation Package, so that we can be more flexible to applicants in such circumstances?"
2015-01-20-T-008-S-00130,2015-01-20-T-008,130,Josephine Teo,"Madam, in response to Dr Neo, we are very mindful that there will always be members of the Pioneer Generation who saw Singapore through the most difficult periods of our development and they themselves may still have difficulties today. The approach that we would like to take is to reach out to all the Pioneers, as many as we can, and help them to benefit from the package."
2015-01-20-T-008-S-00131,2015-01-20-T-008,131,Josephine Teo,"It bears repeating that in setting the criteria, in terms of age, as I explained earlier, we had already been more inclusive. In terms of the citizenship criterion, the cut-off was set at 1986 and, in fact, it is 21 years after Independence.So, even in that criterion, I think that we have tried to be as generous as possible. So, for the members of our community who are not in any way able to benefit from the Pioneer Generation Package, if they are Singapore Citizens, there are other benefits that apply to them, including the MediSave top-ups that we have made available for five years to all those aged 55 and above. For the subsidies, for the forthcoming implementation of MediShield Life, they would likely also be able to benefit from it. And with these other forms of support, there is still a need, I think we would very much like to know who these individuals are and find other ways to help them."
2015-01-20-T-008-S-00132,2015-01-20-T-008,132,Seng Han Thong,"I noted that the large majority of the unsuccessful appeals is age-related. However, there are cases of appeals linked to the ignorance of their parents or a twist of events that rendered them stateless when Singapore suddenly became independent in 1965 and many of them acquired their citizenship after 1986. And they feel to be part of the Pioneer Generation, not because of medical benefits. Will a case of this nature be given special consideration?"
2015-01-20-T-008-S-00133,2015-01-20-T-008,133,Josephine Teo,"Madam, I would like to invite Mr Seng to let me know who these individuals are and then we can reach out to them and see whether there is some way that we can help them."

2015-01-20-T-009-S-00145,2015-01-20-T-009,145,Tan Chuan-Jin,"On a broader level, SMS encourages a shift among employers – from a ""plug and play"" mindset where employers seek to hire workers who already have all the necessary skills, without further thought of development and training. This has changed. So we need to move on to an approach where employers will proactively develop every worker, providing career pathways and valuing their contributions as they advance. And some companies are already doing that. The Government will be a key enabler in these efforts, by providing resource support and helping to coordinate and enhance the linkages between all players."
2015-01-20-T-009-S-00146,2015-01-20-T-009,146,Tan Chuan-Jin,
2015-01-20-T-009-S-00147,2015-01-20-T-009,147,Tan Chuan-Jin,"But the key really lies with industries, sectors and, especially the companies, in taking that step to develop their workers. As a start, we will focus our efforts on a set of lead sectors that have more pressing manpower needs. These lead sectors cover essential services, such as healthcare and social services; new growth sectors that provide exciting job opportunities for Singaporeans but do not necessarily have a ready pipeline of workers, such as biopharmaceuticals; and sectors facing significant manpower challenges, such as construction, retail and F&B. We will progressively expand our efforts to other sectors."
2015-01-20-T-009-S-00148,2015-01-20-T-009,148,Tan Chuan-Jin,
2015-01-20-T-009-S-00149,2015-01-20-T-009,149,Tan Chuan-Jin,"In direct response to the Member's question, we will pay particular attention to our small and medium enterprises (SMEs). A large proportion of the companies in the lead sectors are SMEs. We recognise the manpower challenges that SMEs face and how they often have limited resources and bandwidth to plan for the future. So, one clear benefit of the SMS will be to provide SMEs with a clearer sense of the sector's direction and needs and draw together the necessary resources, from which SMEs can tap to support the attraction, retention, training and development of workers in their sectors."
2015-01-20-T-009-S-00150,2015-01-20-T-009,150,Tan Chuan-Jin,
2015-01-20-T-009-S-00151,2015-01-20-T-009,151,Tan Chuan-Jin,"In addition, the Government also helps our SMEs through a range of schemes. These include the Enterprise Training Support Grant, Innovation and Capability Voucher (ICV) and the SME Talent Programme. SMEs that need customised advisory services can also approach one of the 12 SME Centres located islandwide. So, through these various measures, we believe that this is the way that we can work together to develop the space as we go forward."
2015-01-20-T-009-S-00152,2015-01-20-T-009,152,Ang Hin Kee,"The Minister mentioned that for SMEs, they face certain constraints, but another category of workers who may benefit from the SMS will be your freelancers, sport coaches, cabbies, adult educators, who basically also require skills upgrading in order to prepare themselves for the future. Otherwise, for them, they will have to be the business managers, implementors, finance managers and manpower persons themselves. So, I would like to enquire if the Ministry will consider setting aside some resources or efforts to study the needs of freelancers to see whether or not they can be incorporated into its overall plan when it comes to implementing these future strategies."
2015-01-20-T-009-S-00153,2015-01-20-T-009,153,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, we will be happy to do so, but I would like to emphasise that, apart from specific lead sectors, even as it is today, we are looking at providing a wide range of further development and skills upgrading for a full range of workers. What we want to stress is that there are particular sectors that we are emphasising, because they are large sectors that provide opportunities to many. But we recognise that not just for those who are operating individually. There are many different needs in society."
2015-01-20-T-009-S-00154,2015-01-20-T-009,154,Tan Chuan-Jin,"So, we do intend to develop that space so that lifelong learning is not just confined to these sectors alone. Every Singaporean would have opportunities to develop themselves in their respective areas. We will be quite happy to take on feedback if there are particular areas and initiatives we think that we can introduce and see how they can be incorporated. But the main idea is that every Singaporean should have before him or her the availability of different schemes and opportunities to upgrade themselves, so that they can either deepen their skills in their particular profession or to switch sectors to do something different."
2015-01-20-T-009-S-00155,2015-01-20-T-009,155,Lee Bee Wah,"Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister whether there is anything that can be done to address the acute shortage of manpower in the childcare sector – kindergarten and childcare – because, today, I see the situation of ""musical chairs"". When there is a new childcare centre being set up, there will be a lot of resignations from a nearby childcare centre because the new one cannot get the staff and just offer higher salaries. I do not think that this will solve the problem. I think we need to do more to train and attract more people into this sector. So, is there anything that can be done to address this shortage?"
2015-01-20-T-009-S-00156,2015-01-20-T-009,156,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, if the Member would like to file a specific Parliamentary Question (PQ) on this, but, broadly, I would say that there are many different sectors today, and not just the childcare sector, that face a challenge in terms of finding manpower. The reasons are as follows  by and large, the economy is doing relatively well. We do have many sectors that are growing and that represents a demand on manpower. Eventually, I think the market will have to find its own stabilisation point and this applies to the childcare sector as well."
2015-01-20-T-009-S-00157,2015-01-20-T-009,157,Tan Chuan-Jin,What we do want to make sure is that we provide the training and schemes and support the growth of the sector. But there are many different sectors growing as well and it is difficult to target it specifically. MSF is looking at various initiatives to expand this because we do recognise that there is a real need. We intend to make sure that schemes are available to train manpower.
2015-01-20-T-009-S-00158,2015-01-20-T-009,158,Tan Chuan-Jin,"As to whether we can meet the demands, I think that is a broader issue that can be dealt with separately."
2015-01-20-T-010-S-00159,2015-01-20-T-010,159,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"asked  the Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (a) for each year from 2012 to 2014, what is the total number of applications that MUIS has received for their Financial Assistance Scheme; (b) what is the percentage of applications approved each year and what are the main reasons for unsuccessful applications; and (c) how does MUIS arrive at the eligibility criterion of a $350 monthly per capita income cap as the basis of its assessment."
2015-01-20-T-010-S-00160,2015-01-20-T-010,160,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"asked  the Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (a) for each year from 2011 to 2013, what is the average monthly number of feedback received by MUIS on their financial assistance scheme(s); (b) what are the most common areas of concern; and (c) what procedures and processes has MUIS put in place to enhance the services rendered to needy families."
2015-01-20-T-010-S-00161,2015-01-20-T-010,161,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Madam, can I take Question Nos 10 and 11 together?"
2015-01-20-T-010-S-00162,2015-01-20-T-010,162,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2015-01-20-T-010-S-00163,2015-01-20-T-010,163,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Madam, the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) provides a range of assistance to needy Muslims, including monthly cash assistance and food vouchers as well as one-off assistance, to help pay off outstanding debts for basic necessities, such as utility bills and conservancy charges, academic support and burial expenses. MUIS also helps Muslim families through other support schemes, such as the Empowerment Partnership Scheme (EPS), to help our zakat families attain self-reliance; PROMAS, which is the Progress fund Madrasah Assistance Scheme, provides financial assistance for full-time madrasah students; and the Islamic Education Fund that provides an education fee subsidy for part-time madrasah studies at the mosques. These assistance schemes and programmes are available at the mosques and madrasahs, as well as partner-organisations, to allow greater accessibility for those in need."
2015-01-20-T-010-S-00164,2015-01-20-T-010,164,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"MUIS will, typically, advise prospective applicants on their eligibility for zakat financial assistance. The number of applicants has risen slightly over recent years  in 2012, MUIS received 5,210 applications; in 2013, 5,306 applications; and in 2014, 5,454 applications. Within this period, MUIS approved an average of 99% of these applications each year. Unsuccessful applicants might have sought help on matters for which MUIS does not have an assistance scheme. In such instances, MUIS would refer the applicants to the appropriate public agency."
2015-01-20-T-010-S-00165,2015-01-20-T-010,165,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Madam, in deciding on the per capita income cap, firstly, MUIS takes into consideration the sustainability of the assistance scheme in the longer term. Secondly, MUIS' zakat financial assistance is meant to supplement the existing national assistance schemes, such as ComCare, and to help those who need it most. MUIS took into account these considerations last year, when it raised the monthly PCI cap from $300 to $350 to extend the support to more families and increased the amount of assistance to each eligible family."
2015-01-20-T-010-S-00166,2015-01-20-T-010,166,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Between 2011 and 2013, MUIS received, on average, about 125 enquiries or items of feedback about its financial assistance schemes every month. These were either received directly by MUIS or via the enhanced mosque clusters. Issues ranged from general queries about MUIS' financial assistance schemes, to specific queries by zakat recipients on the status of their assistance."
2015-01-20-T-010-S-00167,2015-01-20-T-010,167,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"MUIS studies feedback received from the public as well as from Social Development Officers at our mosques. It regularly reviews the adequacy of its current financial assistance schemes and studies social trends and challenges faced by needy households so as to enhance its schemes and services. As part of this process, MUIS has trained over 520 Mosque Befrienders to conduct regular home visits to long-term zakat recipients so as to better understand and respond to their needs."
2015-01-20-T-010-S-00168,2015-01-20-T-010,168,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Thank you, Madam. I would like to thank the Minister for his response. I have three supplementary questions. I would like to know how often MUIS conducts reviews on its financial assistance scheme criteria. The Minister mentioned just now that the last review was conducted in July last year. I would also like to know when was the last review prior to the one in July 2014. My third question is  who are the personnel involved in the review process?"
2015-01-20-T-010-S-00169,2015-01-20-T-010,169,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Madam, as mentioned by the Member, the last time we reviewed this was last year, in July 2014. I cannot remember specifically when we did the one before that, but we do this on an annual basis, looking at the trends at the national level. The personnel involved are the MUIS officers, together in consultation with our Board members who are in the zakat"
2015-01-20-T-010-S-00170,2015-01-20-T-010,170,Zainal Sapari,"Mdm Speaker, I have three supplementary questions for the Minister."
2015-01-20-T-010-S-00171,2015-01-20-T-010,171,Zainal Sapari,"One, where does MUIS get the majority of its funding for its financial assistance programme? Two, would a person be denied financial assistance from MUIS if he or she has been receiving financial assistance from other organisations? Three, recently, there were allegations that some families were denied financial assistance from MUIS but received financial assistance from other religious organisations. What was the outcome of MUIS' investigations into this issue?"
2015-01-20-T-010-S-00172,2015-01-20-T-010,172,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Madam, all of our financial assistance schemes are being funded by the zakat fund. Everything else that we collect goes into the general fund which is meant for the purpose of running MUIS. No one will be denied financial assistance if they meet our criteria. They may have received assistance from ComCare or any other national agency, but if they come to MUIS, and if they meet our criteria, we will give them the assistance. As I had mentioned in my reply, the approach is really for us to take advantage of what is available at the national level before coming to MUIS; we will complement that."
2015-01-20-T-010-S-00173,2015-01-20-T-010,173,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"On the allegations that the Member mentioned, I am not sure exactly which one the Member is referring to. We receive many of those. But the one that I think that the Member was referring to that was circulating online recently. We have investigated and found that there is no truth at all to those allegations. In fact, the family has been assisted by MUIS."
2015-01-20-T-011-S-00174,2015-01-20-T-011,174,Benedict Tan,"asked  the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth what is being done to ensure that our national athletes receive adequate medical support, given that the Singapore Sports Institute has been without any full time Sports Physician for the past two years."
2015-01-20-T-011-S-00175,2015-01-20-T-011,175,Lawrence Wong,"Madam, the Singapore Sports Institute (SSI) runs a sports medical centre that is supported by visiting sports physicians and consultants, as well as a team of in-house physiotherapists and trainers. In addition, it has tie-ups with three public hospitals – Changi General Hospital, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Under these tie-ups, experienced visiting sports physicians provide quality medical support and specialist care to our national athletes."
2015-01-20-T-011-S-00176,2015-01-20-T-011,176,Lawrence Wong,
2015-01-20-T-011-S-00177,2015-01-20-T-011,177,Lawrence Wong,I agree with the Member that it is important for SSI to have a resident Medical Director to ensure a robust system is in place to oversee the medical needs of our national athletes. Sport Singapore has intensified the search for such a full-time Sports Physician and we hope to find a suitable candidate soon.
2015-01-20-T-011-S-00178,2015-01-20-T-011,178,Benedict Tan,"Mdm Speaker, I would like to declare my interest. I run two sports medicine centres and I thank the Minister for his reassuring reply. I have just one supplementary question. The network that the Minister mentioned has the advantages of bandwidth because it is relying on institutional resources. The disadvantage of that is that it lacks in-house capabilities and we need the in-house capabilities for research that is specific to the national athletes. So, a better solution would be to have both in-house as well as the network capabilities. In relation to that, I would like to ask the Minister if the sports medicine network is the permanent solution or an interim solution and whether the Minister is exploring other options or models."
2015-01-20-T-011-S-00179,2015-01-20-T-011,179,Lawrence Wong,"Madam, I would perhaps first want to emphasise that our assurance to the Member and all our athletes is that we want to do everything we can to provide the best possible and timely medical support to all our national athletes. Any athlete who needs medical care should and will get timely and effective medical care. So, we will find the best possible solution to provide such medical support."
2015-01-20-T-011-S-00180,2015-01-20-T-011,180,Lawrence Wong,"What is the model? I do not think there is a silver bullet. We will have to work through various solutions and it probably will entail a mix of both a good network of partners as well as capabilities in-house. And as I had mentioned, we are continuing to build up and strengthen our capabilities within the Singapore Sports Institute (SSI). We are doing that not just in our search for a resident doctor but also building up our team of physiotherapists and trainers."
2015-01-20-T-011-S-00181,2015-01-20-T-011,181,Lawrence Wong,"Beyond providing medical care, in-house and through the network, the Singapore Sports Institute (SSI) Medical Centre is also doing more going upstream, for example, doing more in terms of injury prevention, advising athletes on the steps that they should take to minimise injuries, conducting injury-prevention workshops or, for example, working more closely with the National Sports Associations and the coaches to look at the kinds of training regimes that athletes go through to ensure that they do not over-strain and they take the necessary safety precautions."
2015-01-20-T-012-S-00182,2015-01-20-T-012,182,Lee Bee Wah,"asked  the Minister for Transport (a) how many small delivery vans will be due for COE renewal in the next three years; (b) whether big lorries and goods vans fall into different COE categories; and (c) with a satellite-based ERP system, whether the Ministry will do an overall review of all their policies relating to motor vehicles, including COE."
2015-01-20-T-012-S-00183,2015-01-20-T-012,183,Josephine Teo,"<strong style=""color  rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color  transparent;"">(for the Minister for Transport)</strong>"

2015-01-20-T-012-S-00185,2015-01-20-T-012,185,Josephine Teo,"All goods vehicles and commercial buses, whether large or small, fall within Category (Cat) C of the COE bidding system. It is not desirable to have too many categories catering to different vehicle sizes as it can lead to excessive volatility in quota numbers and prices in each category."
2015-01-20-T-012-S-00186,2015-01-20-T-012,186,Josephine Teo,
2015-01-20-T-012-S-00187,2015-01-20-T-012,187,Josephine Teo,"Objectively speaking, the COE system has served us well in controlling the overall vehicle population. Road pricing, on the other hand, helps us manage regular road congestion by influencing road usage decisions. The two systems complement each other. A satellite-based Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system will certainly allow us to have more precise usage pricing, such as through distance-based charging on congested roads, and we will be reviewing in the next few years before ERP2 is implemented at the end of this decade, whether any of our policies could be improved. However, fundamentally, in land-scarce Singapore, controls on both vehicle ownership and usage will still be needed."
2015-01-20-T-012-S-00188,2015-01-20-T-012,188,Lee Bee Wah,"Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask two supplementary questions. COE, to a large extent, has controlled the population of cars. However, because the big trucks, big lorries and small vans are all placed under the same categories, a lot of feedback says that because of the fierce tendering system, the smaller companies, the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) which need the small vans, cannot compete with the big companies who have the capabilities and the muscle to tender for the COEs. I would like to ask  is there any other way to help the SMEs which need the vans for their businesses? Secondly, how many COEs will be available over the next three years, as the Senior Minister of State mentioned earlier that 31,000 COEs will be expiring?"
2015-01-20-T-012-S-00189,2015-01-20-T-012,189,Josephine Teo,"Mdm Speaker, as Er Dr Lee was asking the question and expressing the concern that bigger companies were outbidding smaller companies which need smaller vehicles in Cat C, it reminded me of an argument that was made very strongly just one or two years back that if we removed taxis from Cat A, we would see a very different premium. In any case, we did remove taxi companies from bidding in Cat A, but I think the results suggest that that argument was probably unfounded."
2015-01-20-T-012-S-00190,2015-01-20-T-012,190,Josephine Teo,"So, to the Member's suspicion, it is not something that we can prove or disprove. But I would say, the point that the Member raised that we want to attend to is that some smaller businesses do face pressures in terms of needing a vehicle for their business. Where we have put our efforts is in trying to be helpful to businesses in general, and small businesses in particular, where they need vehicles for the smooth operation of their businesses. There are several measures to help them manage the cost of vehicles."
2015-01-20-T-012-S-00191,2015-01-20-T-012,191,Josephine Teo,"Firstly, for example, commercial vehicles are subject to lower vehicle taxes. And when businesses purchase a vehicle, the Additional Registration Fee for commercial vehicles is set at 5% of the vehicle's Open Market Value (OMV), compared to an effective rate of between 100% and 180% of the OMV for cars. Commercial vehicles also enjoy lower effective road tax and are exempted from diesel fuel taxes."
2015-01-20-T-012-S-00192,2015-01-20-T-012,192,Josephine Teo,"Secondly, businesses are allowed repeated five-year renewals of their COE. Earlier on, I mentioned that 31,000 small delivery vans will have their COEs expiring between now and 2017. A large majority – more than 80% of them – have more than five years of statutory life remaining. They can thus choose to go for two consecutive five-year renewals, instead of renewing directly on a 10-year COE. So, that facilitates their cashflow management."
2015-01-20-T-012-S-00193,2015-01-20-T-012,193,Josephine Teo,"Thirdly, we introduced the early turnover scheme where businesses can transfer any unused COE life to a new vehicle and enjoy discounts if they replace their more pollutive pre-Euro and Euro-1 diesel commercial vehicles. In addition, they do not need to bid for a new Cat C COE. They only need to pay a discounted prevailing quota premium for such vehicles when they turn it over. And since the scheme was enhanced in March last year, in fact, the discount on the prevailing quota premium is, on average, $23,000, a very considerable amount. That is why we have seen a steady increase in the take-up on the early turn-over scheme."
2015-01-20-T-012-S-00194,2015-01-20-T-012,194,Josephine Teo,"These are some of the measures that we take to help businesses where vehicles are concerned. These measures are also complemented by other Government schemes to assist all SMEs directly with tax deductions, grants or micro loans."
2015-01-20-T-012-S-00195,2015-01-20-T-012,195,Josephine Teo,"As to the Member's second question on how many COEs will become available, your guess is as good as mine. It really depends on several factors. It depends on how many vehicles are deregistered and it also depends on what is the permitted vehicle growth rate, which we have already given indication of. But deregistration really depends on the vehicle owners themselves. Analysts have given their own projections and forecasts. I think it is something that we will only really know when the deregistrations take place."
2015-01-20-T-012-S-00196,2015-01-20-T-012,196,Lee Bee Wah,"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the answer. But we cannot, because of the example of the taxi COEs not achieving the effect that we would like to see, that we should not try to come up with a category for the small vans. The feedback is that many of them, they have already renewed the COEs, but how many times can they keep on extending it? They need the vans for their business. So, I would like to ask whether there is any difficulty in allocating a certain number of COEs for the small vans."
2015-01-20-T-012-S-00197,2015-01-20-T-012,197,Josephine Teo,"Madam, as I have explained earlier in my reply, it is something that we have to be quite careful in thinking through. The more categories we split them into, it means that, within each category, the numbers that can be made available for bidding each cycle would likely be much more volatile. And we have to ask ourselves whether that is, in fact, helpful to small businesses."
2015-01-20-T-012-S-00198,2015-01-20-T-012,198,Josephine Teo,"So, we understand completely where Er Dr Lee Bee Wah is coming from. But we also have to ask whether the alternative that the Member has suggested is, in fact, going to be helpful to SMEs."
2015-01-20-T-012-S-00199,2015-01-20-T-012,199,Josephine Teo,"And, please, let me assure Members that if it is something that is, indeed, likely to be beneficial, there is no reason why we cannot consider it."

Singapore has in place a framework for international cooperation with overseas legal, law enforcement and regulatory agencies. The Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act (MACMA) enables Singapore to provide mutual legal assistance to other jurisdictions, in relation to criminal investigations or criminal proceedings for offences covered by the Act. While we have legal instruments and other enforcement cooperation mechanisms in place to buttress Singapore's commitment towards fulfilling our international obligations, we must also ensure that such undertakings do not undermine the integrity and sovereignty of our legal framework."

2015-01-20-T-013-S-00205,2015-01-20-T-013,205,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"A significant initiative noted in the Declaration was the establishment of the APEC Network of Anti-Corruption Authorities and Law Enforcement Agencies (ACT-NET) which is an informal network for anti-corruption and law enforcement practitioners from member economies to share information and exchange best practices. Singapore welcomed the formation of the ACT-NET and is committed to engage meaningfully to collaborate with, and learn from law enforcement authorities within the APEC community. CPIB represented Singapore at the first ACT-NET meeting in Beijing, August 2014, where members shared best practices on informal and formal requests from foreign counterparts for assistance relating to corruption cases. CPIB also participated in the first capacity building workshop on fugitive repatriation and asset recovery held in Beijing in December 2014."

2015-01-20-T-013-S-00207,2015-01-20-T-013,207,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The Beijing Declaration on Fighting Corruption also attaches great importance to capacity-building of anti-corruption and law enforcement authorities in the Asia Pacific region. CPIB will continue to render cooperation and assistance to counterparts in areas, such as personnel training, study visits, specific training in areas such as financial investigation and computer forensic."
2015-01-20-T-014-S-00208,2015-01-20-T-014,208,,"To ask  the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether statistics on the population of vectors (mosquitoes, flies, cockroaches, rodents and rat fleas) are available and, if so, whether there has been an increase; and (b) whether there are new measures to bring these vectors under control."

2015-01-20-T-014-S-00211,2015-01-20-T-014,211,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"NEA implements an integrated rodent surveillance and vector control programme comprising surveillance, control, public engagement, law enforcement and research. From January 2014 to November 2014, over 35,000 rodent burrows were detected and treated by NEA. This reflects how important it is for the owners of premises, especially operators of food establishments, to practise good housekeeping habits, such as adopting good refuse management regimes. The key to rodent control is to eliminate food sources."
2015-01-20-T-014-S-00212,2015-01-20-T-014,212,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Dengue continues to be a problem. As of November 2014, more than 16,000 mosquito breeding sites were found, a drop of 19% from the same period the year before. Amongst the new measures introduced in 2014, NEA piloted the Gravitrap surveillance programme in clusters and high-risk areas as a control tool and a guide for pre-emptive control operations. Now, there are some statistics we can gather from this Gravitrap programme. But let me explain that this is by no means a comprehensive surveillance of the entire country. But where we have placed Gravitraps, we estimated from the start of the programme that some 32,000 mosquitoes have been caught in these Gravitraps. I am not sure what to make of it, but this is the first year when we have such a statistic. So, we will probably use this as a basis for study going forward. I assure Members that we do not spend time doing a count; I am sure it is by some estimation."
2015-01-20-T-014-S-00213,2015-01-20-T-014,213,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"NEA has also tightened surveillance and enforcement efforts in high-risk premises, such as construction sites. Since January 2014, 120 Stop Work Orders have been issued to construction sites to ensure that proper mosquito control measures are in place before construction resumed. In the longer term, NEA is exploring the suppression of the local dengue-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquito population through biological control, which is, the use of Wolbachia-carrying male mosquitoes."
2015-01-20-T-014-S-00214,2015-01-20-T-014,214,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"All home and premises owners, Town Councils and managers of public areas have to take responsibility to minimise the breeding of these vectors. NEA's officers cannot be everywhere anytime, all the time."
2015-01-20-T-014-S-00215,2015-01-20-T-014,215,Lily Neo,"Madam, may I ask the Minister whether NEA will further co-fund Town Councils on vector control, especially rodent and mosquito control? The other question is  will NEA step up preventive measures in rodent control at food centres, especially in taking those with unhygienic practices to task? Lastly, is there any update on vaccines for dengue?"
2015-01-20-T-014-S-00216,2015-01-20-T-014,216,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Member for the supplementary questions. On co-funding of some of these rodent control programmes, NEA is keen to work with the Town Councils. In fact, we have been working with the Town Councils since 2011 when we brought back the Rat Attack programme, and we will be happy to discuss with the Town Councils on how we can further collaborate and cooperate with one another on fighting rodents."
2015-01-20-T-014-S-00217,2015-01-20-T-014,217,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"I absolutely agree with the Member on the need for strict enforcement and, indeed, that is what NEA has done. We have been inspecting food establishments on a regular basis. In fact, we have increased the number of vector control officers in the last few years. So, we are putting more enforcement officers on the ground and, where we find infringements of regulations and unhygienic conditions, we will not hesitate to take strict enforcement steps."
2015-01-20-T-014-S-00218,2015-01-20-T-014,218,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"On the issues of vaccines, we are still watching the development closely. At this point in time, we do not have specific news to share with the House, but if we do, we will definitely do so."

2015-01-20-T-014-S-00220,2015-01-20-T-014,220,Penny Low,"Mdm Speaker, there have been more reports on the increase in rodents lately and I am wondering whether NEA has done any study to discover the reason for such an increase, or is it that there is just more visibility of rodents in, especially, housing estates."
2015-01-20-T-014-S-00221,2015-01-20-T-014,221,Penny Low,"Apart from rodents, there have also been quite a lot of reports about pigeon nuisance, especially roosting in HDB flats. Could NEA also take more stringent actions, especially on feeding, so that the issue does not multiply to affect all the other residents living the housing estates?"
2015-01-20-T-014-S-00222,2015-01-20-T-014,222,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mdm Speaker, with regard to the supplementary question about increased sightings of rodents, from NEA's point of view, it is still down to the very basic operations. In other words, keep the source of food in check, ensure that the available food sources for rodents are not there. That is the best way to eradicate the rodents."
2015-01-20-T-014-S-00223,2015-01-20-T-014,223,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"It is also enforcement as well. So, we have to step up on inspections and step up on operations. Again, I would like to emphasise that we need all the stakeholders, from food stall and restaurant operators to companies that are in charge of cleaning, commercial properties and so on, to really step up and play a part in ensuring that we have a hygienic and clean environment for everyone."
2015-01-20-T-014-S-00224,2015-01-20-T-014,224,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We have some studies on the population of rats but, really, the best way is to just make sure that they do not have the food sources that allow them to propagate."
2015-01-20-T-014-S-00225,2015-01-20-T-014,225,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"On the issue of pigeons, I believe that there is a subsequent Parliamentary Question (PQ) that, Mdm Speaker, if you would allow, I will answer the supplementary question along with the subsequent PQ."

2015-01-20-T-015-S-00230,2015-01-20-T-015,230,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Our approach is to work with our tripartite partners to promote work-life practices, including providing family care leave beyond the statutory requirements and flexible work arrangements."
2015-01-20-T-015-S-00231,2015-01-20-T-015,231,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"A survey by the Ministry of Manpower found that the proportion of employers providing parental care leave or parental sick leave has almost tripled from 6% in 2008 to 17% last year. The proportion of employers providing at least one form of flexible work arrangement (FWA) has also gone up from 28% in 2008 to 47% last year. The survey also found that almost seven in 10 employers, or 69%, provided unplanned time-off for their employees to attend to personal matters in 2014."
2015-01-20-T-015-S-00232,2015-01-20-T-015,232,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Employers are setting new industry norms and they recognise that such practices help to attract and retain talent. For instance, the Civil Service, as the largest employer in Singapore, provides two days of annual parent-care leave as a progressive employment practice."
2015-01-20-T-015-S-00233,2015-01-20-T-015,233,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We also introduced a series of family-related leave schemes on 1 May 2013, as part of the Marriage and Parenthood Package. Businesses are still adjusting and adapting to some of these leave requirements. So, let us monitor the impact of these changes before we consider legislating more family care leave."
2015-01-20-T-015-S-00234,2015-01-20-T-015,234,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Nonetheless, I would like to encourage more employers to adopt work-life practices, such as family care leave and FWAs, as a strategy to attract good workers in this tight labour market and motivate them."
2015-01-20-T-015-S-00235,2015-01-20-T-015,235,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Work-life practices lead to win-win outcomes – employees can better attend to their personal and family needs, while a more motivated workforce can benefit employers in terms of lower absenteeism, higher employee retention and better productivity."

2015-01-20-T-016-S-00239,2015-01-20-T-016,239,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, ""That the Bill be now read a Second time."""
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00240,2015-01-20-T-016,240,Tan Chuan-Jin,We all want to maintain and strengthen the harmonious industrial relations that we have here in Singapore. Managing our foreign workforce well is part of the effort. It is a wide-ranging topic. Much has been done and other new measures will also be introduced in good time. This Bill is one part of the broader effort. It is the result of work put in over the past few years and specifically addresses the regulations of larger dormitories.
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00241,2015-01-20-T-016,241,Tan Chuan-Jin,"I understand that there are current concerns regarding the housing and living conditions of some foreign workers and I appreciate the feedback that Members of this House and also fellow Singaporeans have been providing. Indeed, there is a comprehensive set of existing rules which regulate the living conditions of foreign employees, safeguard their safety and well-being and reduce disamenities on the neighbours. These apply to all forms of foreign worker accommodation and cover areas, such as building and fire safety, minimum living space and hygiene standards. These standards are in place and will be enforced and will continue to be so."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00242,2015-01-20-T-016,242,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Many of the unsafe or unsanitary conditions that some Members have referred to are conditions that already contravene these existing rules; and we have taken and will continue to take firm action against errant parties. All relevant Government agencies, such as the Building and Construction Authority (BCA), the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and the National Environment Agency (NEA), are committed to not only step up enforcement of existing requirements and deter such transgressions, but to also continue to raise standards over time."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00243,2015-01-20-T-016,243,Tan Chuan-Jin,"So, why is this Bill needed?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00244,2015-01-20-T-016,244,Tan Chuan-Jin,"First, the Government's longer-term view is that the accommodation needs of Work Permit holders are best met in such dormitories, where there are self-contained living, social and recreational facilities. We have been launching new and larger Purpose Built Dormitory (PBD) sites over the past few years and will continue doing so to meet housing demand for a foreign workforce, especially for the Construction, Marine and Process sectors. Such larger PBDs will form an increasingly prominent part of the foreign worker housing landscape."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00245,2015-01-20-T-016,245,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Second, and more importantly, there will be different concerns due to the scale of the developments. This Bill is, therefore, a progressive measure aimed at ensuring better design parameters and requirements that would be woven into the development of these new PBDs as they are being built. I would like to emphasise again that the existing regulations will continue to apply to both larger and smaller dormitories. The new regulations complement rather than replace existing ones."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00246,2015-01-20-T-016,246,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Madam, let me now move into the key provisions of the Bill. We propose to impose additional requirements on larger dormitories with 1,000 beds or more through a licensing regime. Dormitories which meet the threshold will be required to obtain a licence, in addition to complying with all existing regulatory standards. It includes existing dormitories which already house 1,000 foreign workers or are approved to house this number of workers, even if they currently do not."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00247,2015-01-20-T-016,247,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Broadly, the new licensing framework will mandate requirements that cover public health and safety, security and public order, and the provision and maintenance of social and commercial facilities and services. This is by way of licensing conditions which I will elaborate on later. A Commissioner for Foreign Employee Dormitories will be appointed to oversee the administration of the new Bill."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00248,2015-01-20-T-016,248,Tan Chuan-Jin,"The licensing regime will effectively cover all current and upcoming PBDs, as well as all dormitories on industrial premises, and even on-site workers' quarters that meet the 1,000-bed threshold. All the new PBDs coming on-stream will meet this threshold. Over the next two years, as more PBDs become operational, these higher standards will accordingly benefit a greater proportion of foreign workers."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00249,2015-01-20-T-016,249,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Then, there is also the matter of practicality. Some of these requirements that we will impose, such as outdoor recreation spaces and minimarts, are only possible in dormitories with a certain physical capacity."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00250,2015-01-20-T-016,250,Tan Chuan-Jin,"But what about the ""smaller"" dormitories – those that do not quite cross the 1,000-bed threshold? What then? As I have mentioned earlier, it is important to remember that these ""smaller"" dormitories will continue to be subject to our existing comprehensive regulations to protect the safety and well-being of residents. Residential premises not covered under the Bill will also continue to be subject to existing regulations pertaining to fire and structural safety, hygiene, subletting and change of use."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00251,2015-01-20-T-016,251,Tan Chuan-Jin,"We have also taken care to ensure that there is proper accountability. The holder of the licence, who will be the operator, is responsible for the day-to-day running of the dormitory. Actions by the operator can have a large impact on residents' well-being. Hence, in assessing the suitability of an operator for a licence, we will look at the prospective operator's financial capacity and track record and whether the operator can comply with the licensing conditions."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00252,2015-01-20-T-016,252,Tan Chuan-Jin,"In addition, the Commissioner may give a directive to the licensed operator to rectify a breach or unsatisfactory operations, or to do anything in the interest of public health and safety. If the licensed operator is prevented by the dormitory owner or proprietor from complying with any directive, we propose to be able to also hold the dormitory owner or proprietor accountable for failing to comply with the directive."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00253,2015-01-20-T-016,253,Tan Chuan-Jin,"I mentioned earlier that the Commissioner for Foreign Employee Dormitories will be able to impose conditions which licensed dormitories must comply with. Let me provide some examples of the conditions we will be imposing. These have been formulated in consultation with all relevant Government agencies; and informed by Members of Parliament, who have worked with us on foreign worker issues."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00254,2015-01-20-T-016,254,Tan Chuan-Jin,"One example is that operators must develop quarantine plans, in the event of an infectious disease outbreak, and provide sufficient sick bay facilities, based on guidelines set by the Ministry of Health. Another is to require operators to establish Emergency Response Plans in consultation with the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and the Police to deal with fires or other potential public order incidents."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00255,2015-01-20-T-016,255,Tan Chuan-Jin,"To cater to residents' social and recreational needs, we will require licensed dormitories to have indoor and outdoor recreation areas; amenities like Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), minimarts and mail collection points; as well as regular recreational events during Sundays and public holidays. These provide convenient options for workers to socialise. It also means that they do not have to travel far to run simple errands and eating into their rest hours."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00256,2015-01-20-T-016,256,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Bill also sets out the proposed penalties for the various infringements and other enforcement actions that might be taken. We have deliberately set relatively high penalties as a deterrent. We have also provided for a broad suite of tools to allow the Commissioner to require that errant parties remedy their breaches.
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00257,2015-01-20-T-016,257,Tan Chuan-Jin,"The highest proposed penalty is for operating an unlicensed dormitory under clause 7, and is a fine of up to $500,000, or imprisonment of up to two years, or both, for a first offence. For a repeat offence, the penalty will be doubled. We are also proposing a substantial penalty for the breach of each licensing condition. Clause 11 provides that the maximum penalty is a fine of up to $50,000, or imprisonment of up to one year, or both, for each condition contravened."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00258,2015-01-20-T-016,258,Tan Chuan-Jin,Licensed operators who intend to cease operating a dormitory must apply to the Commissioner for approval at least 28 days in advance. This is to provide sufficient lead time for employers and dormitory residents to secure alternative accommodation. Cessation of operations without the Commissioner's approval is an offence under clause 20.
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00259,2015-01-20-T-016,259,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Under clause 28, the Commissioner may choose to compound certain offences under the Bill, which are generally less severe in nature. This will allow flexibility to act against egregious breaches in a calibrated manner."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00260,2015-01-20-T-016,260,Tan Chuan-Jin,"In addition, we have put in place various provisions to ensure that any non-compliance can be remedied."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00261,2015-01-20-T-016,261,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Firstly, under clause 13, the Commissioner may issue a compliance directive to require the operator or proprietor to carry out specific instructions to remedy breaches or unsatisfactory operations, or in the interests of public health or safety. If rectification is not done to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, the Commissioner can also step in to carry out any works specified in the directive, and recover the costs incurred from the licensed operator or proprietor."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00262,2015-01-20-T-016,262,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Secondly, under clause 15, the Commissioner may issue a business restriction directive. Dormitories that are issued a business restriction directive can continue housing existing residents, but will not be allowed to renew or extend existing tenancy agreements, or enter into new contracts for a specified period."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00263,2015-01-20-T-016,263,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Additionally, the Commissioner also has the power to require the operator to furnish a performance bond, suspend a licence for up to six months, or revoke a licence. The Commissioner may also disqualify persons from managing or holding licences to operate dormitories for specified periods. The offences under the new legislation must be effectively enforced on the ground. To this end, officers who are appointed as dormitory inspectors will be provided with the necessary powers to enter, search and collect evidence from premises. These powers take reference from those currently accorded to inspectors under similar legislation, such as the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act and the Employment Agencies Act. Our inspectors will also be empowered to arrest suspected unlicensed operators or proprietors. I wish to assure the House that our officers will exercise these enhanced powers judiciously, balancing health and safety imperatives while minimising disruptions to business continuity where possible."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00264,2015-01-20-T-016,264,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Ultimately, it is in our interest to ensure that the new legislation can be practically implemented. To this end, we have extensively engaged the dormitory industry over the course of the last year. The industry has been largely supportive of the need for additional regulations for the larger dormitories."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00265,2015-01-20-T-016,265,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Nevertheless, we understand that existing large dormitories that were built based on earlier tender specifications may not be able to meet the new standards being set. We will, therefore, exercise some flexibility in implementation. We will allow a six-month transition period from the date the proposed Bill comes into effect in the second half of 2015 to enable them to level up their standards and obtain the necessary licence. We will also provide some assistance to dormitory operators to ease the transition and to mitigate the increased costs resulting from the additional requirements."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00266,2015-01-20-T-016,266,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Beyond the current Bill, I wish to assure Members that work on other foreign worker management initiatives is ongoing and different public sector agencies are doing their part. For example, agencies are keeping a close watch on areas where there are already clusters of foreign worker housing, especially where infrastructure, like roads and sewers, are unable to support further intensification. Since November last year, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has identified 12 industrial estates where it will no longer approve applications to convert factory space into new foreign worker' dormitories, as well as applications to increase the number of workers in existing factory-converted dormitories."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00267,2015-01-20-T-016,267,Tan Chuan-Jin,"The Government has also been launching dedicated foreign worker recreation centres, particularly in areas where larger numbers of foreign workers are housed. These centres provide alternative gathering spots for workers and offer a wider range of amenities that individual dormitories may not be able to."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00268,2015-01-20-T-016,268,Tan Chuan-Jin,
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00269,2015-01-20-T-016,269,Tan Chuan-Jin,"There are currently four such centres and more will be launched over the next two years. In addition, we will step up measures to educate foreign workers about Singapore laws and social norms. For known foreign worker gathering areas, we can deploy additional uniformed Auxiliary Police Officers and devote extra resources to step up cleaning efforts to meet the needs of residents living nearby. Our agencies also stand ready to work together, as we have done so with Members of Parliament and grassroots leaders to address local issues in a coordinated manner."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00270,2015-01-20-T-016,270,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, this Bill is the result of a lot of effort, work done over the past number of years. There have been extensive consultations with stakeholders and Members of the House. It is the culmination of intensive inter-Ministry work over a long period."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00271,2015-01-20-T-016,271,Tan Chuan-Jin,"This Bill gives us greater regulatory powers as larger PBDs are built to better address the housing and living needs of foreign workers. Due to the different dynamics that come with larger sites, it is necessary for the Government to start upstream and put in place these additional regulations. I will repeat, there are existing regulations that continue to be enforced and we continue to monitor them and to improve on them, to strengthen them as it goes on. Going forward, we will be seeing many more PBDs built of this scale, which is why it is important to add on some of these additional requirements, because the nature and dynamics of the far larger dorms are quite different from some of the smaller ones. For the smaller ones, some of the existing concerns can be addressed in different ways."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00272,2015-01-20-T-016,272,Tan Chuan-Jin,"I would, therefore, like to thank everyone who had contributed to making this Bill possible. With these enhanced levers, I am confident that we will be able to provide a good and safe living environment for dormitory residents and manage the dormitories' potential impact on their surrounding communities. Managing our foreign workforce is a wide topic. It is being addressed on many fronts. This Bill, in particular, addresses a specific area of concern, which is how best do we regulate the larger dormitories that are going to come online. With that Madam, I beg to move."

2015-01-20-T-016-S-00275,2015-01-20-T-016,275,Christopher de Souza,"Presently, such foreign worker housing, whether small or large, are subjected to rigorous regulatory standards. Such regulations include the safe upkeep and maintenance of sanitary and hygiene conditions."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00276,2015-01-20-T-016,276,Christopher de Souza,"However, in recent months, there have been several unsettling reports that have called our attention to the poor living standards and conditions that some foreign workers are subjected to. For example, in November last year, a spot check conducted by the Migrant Workers' Centre found about 50 construction workers from Bangladesh and India being housed in two-bedroom condominium apartments along Selegie Road. Possibly the most troubling was a photograph that was published in August, which exposed the deplorable living conditions and bathing facilities that some foreign workers were subjected to when they were housed on-site at a construction site in Punggol."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00277,2015-01-20-T-016,277,Christopher de Souza,"I support this Bill, Mdm Speaker, but I would like to ask three pertinent questions. The first is  would the Minister clarify why the proposed licensing regime only seeks to target larger dormitories with 1,000 beds and over, when a large proportion of foreign workers in Singapore reside in dormitories which have less than 1,000 beds? While these smaller dormitories will continue to be caught under existing regulations, what was the reason for not including them under the new framework as well?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00278,2015-01-20-T-016,278,Christopher de Souza,"Also, could the Minister outline how the Ministry will keep a close eye on dormitory operators to prevent them from deliberately keeping numbers below the 1,000-bed threshold to escape the licensing requirements proposed under this Bill?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00279,2015-01-20-T-016,279,Christopher de Souza,"Therefore, in setting out a new regulatory and licensing regime, we must be careful not to inadvertently incentivise dormitory operators to circumvent these important requirements by deliberately operating dormitories with less than 1,000 beds."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00280,2015-01-20-T-016,280,Christopher de Souza,"While the majority of foreign workers have expressed their satisfaction with respect to working conditions in Singapore, many of them leave their families behind in search of a brighter future. Therefore, we should respect the dignity of these foreign workers by providing them with safe and humane living conditions. I would like to ask the Minister whether there will be a move to extend the regulations contained in this Bill to dormitories which have less than 1,000 beds. Nonetheless, Madam, I support this timely Bill."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00281,2015-01-20-T-016,281,,"<strong style=""color  rgb(51, 51, 51);"">Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)</strong>"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00282,2015-01-20-T-016,282,,"Next, Madam, whatever the size of the dormitory, all of them play an important part and role in housing our foreign workers. They contribute to the brand name and reputation of Singapore when it comes to our handling of foreign workers. Therefore, I feel very strongly about this, that we should really review this on a more practical basis."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00283,2015-01-20-T-016,283,,"What about employers who house their foreign workers on factory sites, in office buildings and makeshift places, including some residential areas, which are also overcrowded? I hope that we can work in stronger partnership with the Ministry and the URA in handling some of these issues that we face at the ground level."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00284,2015-01-20-T-016,284,,"Next, can I also ask the Minister about the exclusion criteria being set at 1,000-bed spaces in the Bill as it stands? What proportion of our foreign workers currently will be excluded if we set this at 1,000-bed spaces, and what will be its target in the next three, five and 10 years perhaps?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00285,2015-01-20-T-016,285,,"Madam, the licensing framework is a good progressive move on the part of the Ministry and I applaud that. It is also a step in the right direction forward towards the proper management of our foreign workers and it is also linked to their welfare. Their compliance to these regulations and licensing requirements will certainly pose heavy investments in various areas, and my concern is also that this may ultimately trickle down to the employers of foreign workers. How will the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) be monitoring this as we move forward?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00286,2015-01-20-T-016,286,,"Next, the land prices for building dormitories have reached pretty high levels now and, at times, even unprecedented levels. For example, recently, a tender was awarded for nearly S$150 million for a dormitory for housing some 9,000 foreign workers on a 20-year-old piece of land. And this is just one example. This, again, represents the very heavy investment I referred to earlier."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00287,2015-01-20-T-016,287,,"Can the Ministry consider working with the relevant authorities to announce sites to be released for tender on a slightly longer term, perhaps on a yearly basis? This will help interested parties research and make more informed choices, such as sensible investment and pricing. Given the current and future climate of such developments, it is a big undertaking and bears huge risks for these employers."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00288,2015-01-20-T-016,288,,"Madam, finally, the current dormitory operators will be given six months to comply with the new regulations and policies. Will this time be sufficient? My concern is for the older dormitories which may need major renovations and upgrading to the stipulated standards. Will the Ministry be working with the operators to customise and give those who need a little more time to revamp their operations, logistics and practices some leeway, but, of course, with close oversight? Madam, I support the Bill."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00289,2015-01-20-T-016,289,Yeo Guat Kwang,"Mdm Speaker, the Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill holds special significance to the work that I perform as the Chairman of the Migrant Workers' Centre (MWC)."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00290,2015-01-20-T-016,290,Yeo Guat Kwang,"To MWC, the shortage of purpose-built housing facilities to meet the needs of our migrant workers has, in fact, been a major issue. Anecdotally, MWC's close working relationship with the operators of our commercial dormitories, as well as our housing activities for the homeless and destitute workers, has allowed our team to actually witness the dormitory rentals increase from about $170 per bed space in 2009 to about $350 today – a 100% increase within a period of just less than five years. Thus, in the last two years, Madam, calls from the migrant workers advocacy groups, including the MWC, have led to the Government's concerted efforts moving forward to open up more new supplies of purpose-built housing. This is encouraging and I must commend MOM, the Ministry of National Development and their agencies for this positive response."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00291,2015-01-20-T-016,291,Yeo Guat Kwang,"Yet, Madam, our authorities have themselves continued to be mindful that such a ramp-up will not be able to render the operation of smaller dormitory types, like the factory converted or temporary dormitories, obsolete. Statistics from our authorities, as reported in the media, show that roughly half of the 400,000-plus workers requiring customised migrant workers' housing are currently accommodated in the 50 purpose-built dormitories here, while the other half continue to be housed in smaller, often less well-run housing facilities."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00292,2015-01-20-T-016,292,Yeo Guat Kwang,"Madam, this is where our concerns are centred. The MWC has operated the only 24-hour distress hotline here for non-domestic workers from 1 July 2014 and has, through this facility, received quite a number of housing-related complaints from our migrant workers. Our case data shows that the complaints from migrant workers were almost all concerns about smaller factory-converted, temporary or even makeshift accommodation arrangements accommodating less than 1,000 workers. Just a few months ago, in November 2014, MWC itself responded quite aggressively to one such case in Selegie, where information uncovered by my team suggested that more than 100 migrant workers were being housed in just two small residential condominium units."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00293,2015-01-20-T-016,293,Yeo Guat Kwang,"Madam, it is precisely these experiences that lead us to the belief that while the Government strives to implement a viable long-term solution for high-standard, purpose-built migrant workers' housing, we cannot ignore, and should, in fact, redouble our efforts and also regulatory control against errant housing operators, especially among the smaller, less formal housing operations, plainly because this is where the bulk of the abuses have occurred and continue to occur. Madam, we hope the Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill could cover all dormitories in Singapore, regardless of size, type or management mode."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00294,2015-01-20-T-016,294,Yeo Guat Kwang,"While I applaud the policymakers for this strategic piece of legislation, l seek the Government's assurance that, in the interim, before we arrive at the desired state of affairs, its strict attention to and enforcement of all basic rules and standards, regardless of types and, especially size, will continue aggressively and in a coordinated, concerted fashion."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00295,2015-01-20-T-016,295,Yeo Guat Kwang,"MWC and, I am certain, all the other migrant activist groups, will continue to meet our authorities halfway in this endeavour, to surface intelligence as eyes and ears, as we are closest to the ground. MWC also stands ready to come in and partner the authorities to provide temporary housing or any other kinds of assistance where investigations or enforcement action renders workers without proper shelter or other protection and care."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00296,2015-01-20-T-016,296,Yeo Guat Kwang,"For example, after a fire had broken out at a workers' quarters in Geylang last December, and sadly led to the loss of lives and serious injury, the MWC team was among the first to arrive at the scene and the hospitals to offer our assistance and care to the workers. We continue to be in contact with the employers of the four deceased workers from the incident to ensure that they do right and stand by their workers and also help their next-of-kin. Recently, when the last seriously injured worker was discharged from hospital, and through his own wanting and was sent home, MWC was also on hand to offer support as well as observe the proper discharge of his employer's duties and responsibilities before he returned to Sabah."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00297,2015-01-20-T-016,297,Yeo Guat Kwang,"My MWC team will continue to work with all affected employers to see how, in addition to their legal responsibilities to their workers, a shared monetary token may also be given to the families of the seriously injured and the deceased."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00298,2015-01-20-T-016,298,Yeo Guat Kwang,"Madam, I would like to turn now to the feedback I have gathered from operators of larger dormitories to which the framework of the Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill will apply."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00299,2015-01-20-T-016,299,Yeo Guat Kwang,"MWC has long advocated for on-site social and commercial amenities to be included in the planning of new dormitories. Together with health and safety considerations as well as security concerns, whether within individual dormitories or in clusters, this effort had resulted in MWC being the first to moot the idea of forming an industry association, which could, aside from their other responsibilities, present an industry representative to work with our authorities in developing and implementing the industry-wide standards. Having advised on the formation of the Dormitory Association of Singapore Limited (DASL) in January 2013, and we have been working very closely with them, I was quite glad to know that actually they are in support of the Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill (FEDB). I must also thank the Government agencies for helping the members of DASL to be engaged and consulted to produce such an outcome."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00300,2015-01-20-T-016,300,Yeo Guat Kwang,"Madam, the licensing framework will no doubt enhance the ability to deal with large-scale public and personal security, and even health and also pandemic incidents arising within dormitories. More importantly, in the longer term, dormitories will need to direct their resources and leverage on economies of scale of their business and plough these back into catering in-house to the non-work amenities and needs of their residents."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00301,2015-01-20-T-016,301,Yeo Guat Kwang,"However, during our discussion, there is one worry that has kept coming up – the inadvertent creation and, much worse, perpetuation of a double standard by the FEDB's segregation of the smaller and larger dormitories. Even more worrying are the negative externalities that might arise if this ""double standard"" is allowed to become structured."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00302,2015-01-20-T-016,302,Yeo Guat Kwang,"Madam, let me elaborate. Today, employers constantly grapple with their business costs and, depending on the considerations that drive them and the degree of importance they place on keeping costs as low as possible, many of the more errant bosses prefer to house their workers in a cheaper, less favourable and often smaller accommodation. The cases are well-publicised and we know that the phenomenon is common. What is worrying for the operators of properly licensed dormitories is how the requirements and conditions in the FEDB will inevitably lead to further increases in their own running costs that will be passed on to consumers."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00303,2015-01-20-T-016,303,Yeo Guat Kwang,"The fear of this happening is that while the increase in cost of compliance applies to the larger dormitories that already practise higher standards today, the FEDB seems to leave the smaller operations to their own devices. The latter group will continue to serve a relevant purpose, as I have mentioned earlier, and it is difficult to argue with a simple economic proposition that higher costs for larger, purpose-built dormitories will make smaller, cheaper dormitories to be held to a lesser standard even more attractive to the employers. In the long term, if this preference begins to take root and the concern is not addressed, the large operators are concerned that the uneven treatment towards these two groups might pull down overall migrant housing standards in general."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00304,2015-01-20-T-016,304,Yeo Guat Kwang,"I would, therefore, suggest that our authorities guard against over-regulation of one segment of the industry and, as far as possible or appropriate, apply the standards and conditions as general as possible to all. The Minister has mentioned that, actually, there are already some existing regulations for the smaller operators. I would like to ask the Ministry  why does it not just group all these regulations together under this Bill and apply it to all?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00305,2015-01-20-T-016,305,Yeo Guat Kwang,"Madam, as the legislation is allowed time to take effect, I would also want to urge the Government to continue close consultation and engagement with the operators and migrant worker residents especially, as well as migrant advocates, like MWC, to quickly identify and address any negative trends that may develop. Madam, I support the Bill."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00306,2015-01-20-T-016,306,Pritam Singh,"Mdm Speaker, in between the First and Second Readings of this Bill – a period of two-and-a-half months – two stories about foreign worker accommodation, in particular, caught the public eye. Both stories unwittingly put the importance of this Bill and the scope of the work ahead to better manage and look after the well-being of our foreign worker population into acute perspective."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00307,2015-01-20-T-016,307,Pritam Singh,"On 6 December 2014, The New Paper reported that four Malaysian foreign workers who were employed as cleaners died in a fire at a Geylang Lorong 4 shophouse, in Singapore's worst fire in 10 years. Two firemen and eight other individuals suffered injuries from this blaze. The unit in question – reported to be an area only slightly bigger than 1,300 square feet – had nine rooms, each equipped with bunk beds, a tiny kitchen and a toilet. The Malaysian Star newspaper, Stomp and a TODAY article reported that the premises was occupied by some 100 foreigners from China, India, Bangladesh and Malaysia, partitioned into 11 units of rooms, each occupied by about 10 people. The local Chinese newspaper Shin Min Daily News, on the other hand, reported that the affected unit of the three-storey walk-up apartment had 11 rooms, each occupied by up to eight workers, which makes for a total of about 88 people in a single apartment."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00308,2015-01-20-T-016,308,Pritam Singh,"In a separate piece of news on 29 December 2014, The New Paper reported that eight blocks of HDB-managed flatted factories at Tampines Industrial Park A, comprising workshops, furniture manufacturers and warehouses, were operating as ""a secret dormitory"" for 1,000 foreign workers, in clear violation of HDB rules."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00309,2015-01-20-T-016,309,Pritam Singh,"While these stories were headline-grabbing, other articles pertaining to our foreign workers continue to make the news. On 21 November 2014, The Straits Times reported that a spot check by the Migrant Workers' Centre found more than 50 construction workers from Bangladesh and India crammed into two small apartments in Selegie Road, as enunciated most recently by Mr Yeo Guat Kwang. It is also reported that the men ""slept shoulder to shoulder, amid rotting food and soiled clothes"". The same article reminded readers that the paper had raised several reports earlier on unhygienic and overcrowded foreign worker housing, recounting an incident at a Punggol HDB construction site where hundreds of workers had to use choked and broken urinals, and another story covering the plight of about 5,000 workers living at Tuas View Square in factory-converted dormitories infested with rats and mosquitoes."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00310,2015-01-20-T-016,310,Pritam Singh,"A Business Times' story of the same month reported that of the 770,000 Work Permit holders, only 200,000 stay in purpose-built dormitories that this Bill will regulate, with requirements for a little less than double the amount. The rest of our foreign workers stay in a variety of places, like the putatively illegal dormitories in Geylang and Tampines, and in HDB flats in some cases, and at temporary housing at construction sites, all unregulated by an omnibus act of Parliament – notwithstanding the spaghetti bowl of guidelines and restrictions governing such accommodation from URA, SCDF, PUB, BCA, NEA and HDB."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00311,2015-01-20-T-016,311,Pritam Singh,"During the Second Reading of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Bill in 2012, the Minister informed the House that in 2011, MOM conducted close to 800 inspections of premises used as foreign worker housing and that in 2009, enforcement action was taken against 1,800 employers for housing their workers in unacceptable conditions. A recent Business Times' article reported that the first half of 2014 saw 360 inspections. However, the large number of these continuing violations and inspections suggest that Singapore, a First World economy by any stretch, does not host a robust enough framework governing the housing of foreign workers, even as this Bill is a step in the correct direction."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00312,2015-01-20-T-016,312,Pritam Singh,"Mdm Speaker, the Explanatory Note of the Bill defines ""foreign employee dormitory"" to mean a premises that provides accommodation for more than 1,000 workers. By this threshold, the Bill does not address the sort of accommodation at the centre of the 6 December Geylang fire and the ""secret dormitories"", such as those in Tampines. I would like to ask the Minister what plans are envisaged to reduce this threshold number within the context of the Bill since it is explicitly suggested in the Explanatory Note and, separately, how this figure of 1,000 was arrived at, in the first instance, in view of the need for greater oversight, regulation and enforcement across this industry, than is currently the case."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00313,2015-01-20-T-016,313,Pritam Singh,"Separately, a Straits Times' report of 19 August 2014 reported, rather oddly, that there were at least 5,000 empty beds still available at purpose-built dormitories that are covered by this Bill. The reason for this sudden turn of events was put down to more construction firms being permitted by the authorities to set up foreign worker quarters on the sites of major building projects, such as the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and HDB sites. I recognise that manpower proximity to the workplace helps reduce costs for businesses, particularly construction contractors. To this extent, Government policies should support such considerations wherever possible. However, rendering such operational flexibility for businesses would have been an opportune time to introduce clear licensing requirements, regulatory standards and a penalty framework for such temporary foreign worker quarters. This would have greatly supported the contractors on the one hand and improved the living conditions of foreign workers on the other."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00314,2015-01-20-T-016,314,Pritam Singh,"In drafting this Bill, I would like to enquire if the Ministry has considered, for example, introducing a separate category or categories of licensing for premises that operate as smaller foreign employee accommodation below the threshold number, so as to bring many more dormitories and places of accommodation for foreign workers under a licensing framework. Such a broad strategy would have been aligned with the purpose of this Bill, as spelt out in clause 4, which seeks to establish certain accommodation standards for foreign employee dormitories; for the appropriate mechanisms to ensure adherence to those very standards; and to promote the sustainability of, and continuous improvements in, the provision of services at foreign employee dormitories."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00315,2015-01-20-T-016,315,Pritam Singh,"One possible way to support SMEs and small businesses and contractors on the one hand, and the foreign worker community on the other, is for the Government to consider building and managing some dormitories for our foreign workers. For example, employers that employ 100 or less foreign workers, being more sensitive to cost pressures, can be eligible to house their workers in Government-built and operated dormitories which set the standard for the entire industry. The entry of the Government into the sector can be modelled along the entry of the Ministry of Education into the kindergarten business, which is to provide good preschool education and, more importantly, to catalyse improvements in this sector. If deemed appropriate, a fraction of the foreign worker levy can be used to establish such dormitories, with a subsidy for small companies that show real and sustained productivity improvements in their operations."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00316,2015-01-20-T-016,316,Pritam Singh,"Mdm Speaker, Part 5 of the Explanatory Statement of the Bill states that the Minister, by way of subsidiary legislation, can determine that several buildings on different parcels of land can be regarded as a single boarding premises and whether all the beds therein are to be counted to determine if the total threshold number is attained. This is a positive move as it would prevent savvy operators who would nonetheless operate assiduously to work around the 1,000-bed threshold by all means, effectively negating Parliament's intent, for example, by creating sister companies through friends and families. I would like to ask the Minister whether the Ministry has determined how many additional dormitory operators are likely to come under this scenario, as spelt out in the Explanatory Note, and how many beds, so to speak, would come under the licensing framework as a result of this envisaged subsidiary legislation."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00317,2015-01-20-T-016,317,Pritam Singh,"The Bill's intention to determine that several buildings on different parcels of land can be regarded as a single boarding premises should also attract potential investors. As recently as 2008, Avery Strategic Investments, an entity that was then 97% controlled by Morgan Stanley Real Estate, bought three foreign worker dormitories for $153 million when Jurong Town Corporation offered to sell these dormitories comprising a total of 13,544 beds. An officer of the minority shareholder, Averic Capital Management, was then quoted as saying, ""As the Singapore economy grows, likely so will the dormitory business. We're hopeful the economy remains robust; then there will be more opportunities to invest in this asset class."" About two-and-a-half years later, Morgan Stanley sought to exit the dormitory business, citing a dearth of sites made available for dormitory development by the Government, preventing them from enlarging their portfolio to spin off the business into a dormitory real estate investment trust. It was reported that the entity received expressions of interests ranging from $375 million to $450 million, a whopping $100 million more than the total cost of assets it purchased a mere three years earlier."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00318,2015-01-20-T-016,318,Pritam Singh,"Mdm Speaker, it is not in doubt that the market is the lifeblood of any society. However, for industries and sectors that have significant socio-cultural implications for an urban and high-density society like Singapore, the market approach should go hand-in-hand with responsibility towards our foreign workers. Apart from the dizzying dollars churned by the financial industry and the heady world of mergers and acquisitions, the concern of many Singaporeans and Members of this House, by virtue of this Bill, is primarily over the health, safety, security and safe lodging of our foreign workers."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00319,2015-01-20-T-016,319,Pritam Singh,"To this end, in MOM's press release on the Bill dated 4 November 2014, under the section covering penalties, it was stated, and I quote"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00320,2015-01-20-T-016,320,Pritam Singh,"""The holder of the dormitory licence will be the dormitory operator responsible for the day-to-day running of the dormitory. Nonetheless, the premises may be owned by a separate proprietor who either sublets the premises to the operator for use as a dormitory; or appoints the operator to manage the daily operations on his behalf. In such instances, we [the Ministry] will hold proprietors accountable where they, rather than the operators, have more control, for example, in making repairs or alterations to the premises."""
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00321,2015-01-20-T-016,321,Pritam Singh,"I seek some clarifications on this point in the press release since the Bill does not make specific reference to the degree of control as apportioned between, for example, the ultimate owner of a foreign employee dormitory and the licensed operator in the event of an infraction. For example, how far would an owner or a corporate entity be held liable if it can prove it had no control in making repairs and alterations to a boarding premises? Does that mean it is not responsible should foreign workers be found living in unsatisfactory conditions?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00322,2015-01-20-T-016,322,Pritam Singh,"The interpretation section of the Bill defines a ""proprietor"" as ""includes the owner of the premises who is the lessor or grantor of the licence to occupy"". Specifically, I would like to ask the Minister, how far does ownership extend, as defined by this definition? Would it cover financial institutions and funds that are the ultimate owners and who seek to unlock value in such investments? In keeping with the purpose of the Bill as made out in clause 4, would it not be less ambiguous and in keeping with the parliamentary intention of the Bill to make the licence holder and the owner or owners, regardless of their shareholding, jointly and severally liable for any infractions committed by the licence holder? A clarification of this point, in view of the Ministry's potentially ambiguous press release of 4 November, would be appreciated."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00323,2015-01-20-T-016,323,Pritam Singh,"Mdm Speaker, if this Bill is about providing for certain standards of accommodation and to promote the continuous improvement in the provision of services at dormitories, then I would argue that a firm enforcement regime that emphasises responsibility for foreign workers up and down the value chain be enshrined by this Bill and enunciated by the Minister. This is especially so since big corporates can potentially come on board and purchase strategic stakes in foreign employee dormitories as investors. The benefits of such a prospect should not be only to unlock shareholder value. I would argue that the benefits should flow back to the industry and to society and align itself to the purpose of this Bill. In some cases, the financial heft of big corporates and holding companies and their ability to undertake independent risk assessments put them in a good position to be the quasi-regulators of this industry, by virtue of ownership, alongside the Dormitory Association of Singapore Limited."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00324,2015-01-20-T-016,324,Pritam Singh,"In conclusion, Mdm Speaker, while I support the Bill, which seeks to regulate some aspects of foreign worker accommodation in Singapore, I fear it may be a half measure and rendered otiose if there is no parallel strategy to better regulate foreign employee accommodation per se – targeting not just big dormitory operators but the small-time businesses as well. Such an approach would be fairer and serve regulators and businesses better, too, as it would not unwittingly penalise honest businesses which operate large dormitories that this Bill will regulate who play the game by the rules and will do many Singaporeans a great service by improving the lot of our foreign workers. If Singapore manages to scale up its standards of foreign employee accommodation, our businesses are likely to attract higher quality workers and significantly lower the risk of another tragic and senseless fire in Geylang or, potentially, wanton violations of statutory regulations, as evidenced by the secret dormitories in Tampines."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00325,2015-01-20-T-016,325,Speaker,Order. I propose to take the break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair again at 4.15 pm.
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00326,2015-01-20-T-016,326,Speaker,Sitting accordingly suspended
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00327,2015-01-20-T-016,327,Speaker,at 3.50 pm until 4.15 pm.
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00328,2015-01-20-T-016,328,Speaker,Sitting resumed at 4.15 pm
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00329,2015-01-20-T-016,329,Speaker,[(proc text) Debate resumed. (proc text)]
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00330,2015-01-20-T-016,330,Lina Chiam,"Mdm Speaker, this Bill seeks to regulate operators of foreign employee dormitories with a new licensing framework to manage larger purpose-built dormitories with self-contained facilities to meet migrant workers' social and recreational needs outside work. It is a step to complement the various existing measures to manage foreign workers' housing. Mdm Speaker, I welcome this timely, long overdue Bill."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00331,2015-01-20-T-016,331,Lina Chiam,"Madam, foreign workers play a very important role in our society. They do the jobs which many locals would not or cannot do because of the poor working conditions of long hours and low pay. I am sure Members of this House will agree that without them, our economy might run to a standstill."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00332,2015-01-20-T-016,332,Lina Chiam,"In order to recognise their contributions to the nation, it is important for us to uphold their rights and take care of their interests and welfare while they are working in Singapore. For a developed nation which boasts of having one of the highest GDP rates in the world, the way we house our foreign workers leaves much to be desired."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00333,2015-01-20-T-016,333,Lina Chiam,"Way back in 2008, the then Minister for National Development, Mr Mah Bow Tan, had told the media that there were between 80,000 and 100,000 foreign workers who did not have proper housing. Why did we allow a floodgate of these migrant workers to work in Singapore without ensuring and giving them a decent place to live in? Was it an oversight or poor planning?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00334,2015-01-20-T-016,334,Lina Chiam,"NGOs I have spoken to, such as the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (HOME), told me that many foreign workers who approached them for assistance live in conditions which are crowded, dirty and full of pests, such as cockroaches, bed bugs and rats."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00335,2015-01-20-T-016,335,Lina Chiam,"Are there slums in our First World Singapore? Yes, by looking at the living conditions of many of our foreign workers. It is ironic to find foreign workers being housed in such appalling conditions while, at the same time, working hard to earn a meagre salary, with no minimum wage, to build luxury apartments and bungalows for Singaporeans and expatriates."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00336,2015-01-20-T-016,336,Lina Chiam,"A Straits Times report by the Dormitory Association of Singapore Limited have revealed that there are approximately 200,000 bed spaces in purpose-built dormitories. According to MOM statistics, there are approximately 770,000 foreign workers in Singapore. Where are the rest of the 570,000 living? About half of them are Malaysians, who commute to work daily across the Causeway. But the rest of the workers are likely to be housed in factory converted quarters, shophouses, private apartments, bungalows and construction sites which are often poorly managed without proper supervision and likely to be at the mercy of their own employers. Our liberal immigration policies have affected the welfare of the foreign workers themselves."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00337,2015-01-20-T-016,337,Lina Chiam,"In order to save on costs, many employers will squeeze foreign workers, sometimes 10 to 15 of them in a small room with hardly any space to move around, although URA regulations stipulate that walk-up apartments and shop houses should not accommodate more than eight persons in one unit. By going into any apartment and shophouse in Geylang and Little India, one will find these regulations widely flouted."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00338,2015-01-20-T-016,338,Lina Chiam,"The problem has existed for many years, but little has been done. Enforcement of existing housing standards is inadequate to ensure that such overcrowding does not happen. Overcrowding can be fatal, as we have seen from the recent tragic deaths of four Malaysian workers and eight injured last month when a Geylang shophouse caught fire."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00339,2015-01-20-T-016,339,Lina Chiam,"Housing standards vary across different types of housing. For instance, the standards which have been set for workers living in permanent buildings under construction are far lower than that for workers living in temporary buildings on worksites."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00340,2015-01-20-T-016,340,Lina Chiam,I would also like to ask the Minister whether it is legal for construction workers to live in buildings under construction which may take two to three years to complete.
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00341,2015-01-20-T-016,341,Lina Chiam,"Buildings under construction are often dusty, sandy and often pest-infested, with inadequate sanitation, inferior bath and shower facilities. I have heard of dengue outbreaks which have affected construction workers at these sites. The regulations for such housing are minimal and far lower than that of purpose-built dormitories and temporary housing structures."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00342,2015-01-20-T-016,342,Lina Chiam,"For example, in BCA's ""Use of Buildings under Construction as Workers' Quarters Regulations 2008"", it only ensures that the building is structurally safe and the rooms workers are housed in are of sufficient height and land space. Standards of ventilation in the regulations are vaguely worded. Sanitation facilities are inadequate."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00343,2015-01-20-T-016,343,Lina Chiam,"The Code of Practice in Environmental Health stipulates that there should be one toilet bowl, one wash basin and one shower for every 25 male workers, whereas International Labour Organization standards stipulate that the same facilities should be available for every six persons. Are our current codes and regulations in compliance with international standards with regard to worker's welfare, comfort and hygiene?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00344,2015-01-20-T-016,344,Lina Chiam,I urge the Government to review our existing legislation.
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00345,2015-01-20-T-016,345,Lina Chiam,"Workers living in permanent buildings under construction also do not have adequate electricity at night and are usually not protected in the event of a thunderstorm. There are no facilities, such as lockers for workers to store their personal belongings and there is hardly any privacy for them."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00346,2015-01-20-T-016,346,Lina Chiam,"It is also common for workers who are living in buildings under construction to be housed in the basement. When it rains, the area in which they are living in will flood. I urge the Government to reconsider allowing such forms of housing."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00347,2015-01-20-T-016,347,Lina Chiam,"The Foreign Employees Dormitory Bill relies on existing regulations with regard to ensuring adequate living standards for foreign workers. They are mainly the Building Control Act, the Control of Vectors and Pesticides Act, Environmental Public Health Act, Fire Safety Act and the Planning Act."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00348,2015-01-20-T-016,348,Lina Chiam,"One of the key features of this Act is the setting out of the licence conditions for a dormitory operator. I am happy to see that the licence conditions include provisions which concern the physical, mental welfare and security of foreign workers, including their meals. Standards concerning bedrooms, bathrooms and standards to prevent overcrowding are also mentioned in the Bill."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00349,2015-01-20-T-016,349,Lina Chiam,"Clause 11, under conditions of licence, I would like to ask the Minister whether he will consider making the licensed operator keep a register of all the occupants and also to submit a monthly report to MOM."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00350,2015-01-20-T-016,350,Lina Chiam,"However, these standards, which will have a positive impact on their workers' well-being, are not defined. How does this Bill, for instance, propose to look into the mental welfare of foreign workers, since it is one of the criteria? Counselling should be made available to cater to their emotional needs and others."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00351,2015-01-20-T-016,351,Lina Chiam,"Provisions should also be made to facilitate privacy and proper sleep for the workers. For example, lights and music should be switched off after 10.30 pm."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00352,2015-01-20-T-016,352,Lina Chiam,"I am also concerned that without clear guidelines and standards, enforcement officials will enforce these provisions arbitrarily. What safeguards are there to ensure this does not happen? Who will police the licensed operators? Is there a hotline for migrant workers to complain?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00353,2015-01-20-T-016,353,Lina Chiam,"As described earlier, accommodation standards for foreign workers vary across different types of housing. The Bill would have been a good opportunity to standardise accommodation standards for our migrant workers across different housing types, such as factory-converted dormitories and worksite housing. What are the reasons for not considering it? Also, are the existing provisions listed in the Bill sufficient to ensure they are properly housed and taken care of?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00354,2015-01-20-T-016,354,Lina Chiam,"A comprehensive Bill for dormitories would ensure consistent standards in terms of structure of the housing, proper beddings, adequate ventilation, sanitation, number of persons per room, security of belongings, sufficient privacy, laundry and cooking facilities, waste management and access to health care."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00355,2015-01-20-T-016,355,Lina Chiam,"Does the new law also apply to smaller dormitories? While we see these conditions for purpose-built dormitories as the ""favoured"" migrant worker housing solution for the future, we urge authorities not to overlook smaller dormitories. I am glad the Minister had addressed this issue when he introduced the Bill earlier."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00356,2015-01-20-T-016,356,Lina Chiam,"We also urge the authorities to build more dedicated migrant worker recreational centres in areas with larger clusters of dormitories not covered by the Bill, ensuring the availability of right amenities and services to our migrant workers, regardless of the size of their dormitory accommodation."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00357,2015-01-20-T-016,357,Lina Chiam,"I am also deeply concerned about the powers which have been given to dormitory inspectors in this Bill. Who is the dormitory inspector and what is his role? How will he or she be trained? The Bill mentions that if the dormitory officer or inspector believes that any offence under this new Bill has been committed, he or she may break open any door or window of the premises for inspection. He or she also has the power to arrest and detain someone for up to 48 hours. Why does the Bill give such broad powers to inspectors when we already have existing legislation, such as the Criminal Procedures Code (CPC) and the Police Force Act? According to sections 7 and 25 of the Bill, not having a licence to run a dormitory is an arrestable and detainable offence. What kinds of offences under this proposed Bill could be so serious that it is necessary for such actions?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00358,2015-01-20-T-016,358,Lina Chiam,"I would like to ask the Minister  where are the workers in the marine and process sectors, including the chemicals and pharmaceutical sectors, going be housed when HDB flats are no longer allowed to house them after May 2015, which is only a few months away? The new larger purpose-built dormitories will only be ready in two to three years' time."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00359,2015-01-20-T-016,359,Lina Chiam,"The new housing framework will lead to rising costs of doing business and, in turn, higher rentals. Is there a way to cap rentals from escalating, to prevent shortcuts in the housing standards for migrant workers?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00360,2015-01-20-T-016,360,Lina Chiam,"In conclusion, the Bill is a step forward in the right direction for the Government to continue its enforcement on the new licensing framework policies and to achieve overall improvement on the welfare of the migrant population. I would also like to thank all those involved in the policymaking of this Bill."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00361,2015-01-20-T-016,361,Lina Chiam,"Mdm Speaker, we must change our mindset and treatment of migrant workers and treat them as guests, by helping them to improve their basic working living conditions and, in turn, it will lead to better productivity and skills, which will benefit Singapore in the long run."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00362,2015-01-20-T-016,362,Gan Thiam Poh,"Madam, I declare my interest. I work in a local bank, which provides financing for foreign worker dormitories. Thank you for allowing me to join this discussion."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00363,2015-01-20-T-016,363,Gan Thiam Poh,"Presently, all foreign workers' accommodation has to meet regulatory standards set by no less than five Government agencies, namely URA, SCDF, BCA, PUB and NEA. These comprehensive rules set minimum space allocation, fire and structural safety, environmental health and hygiene, water and sewage standards to ensure the safety and well-being of workers."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00364,2015-01-20-T-016,364,Gan Thiam Poh,"However, in reality, enforcement of these standards has been a challenge. As there are so many foreign worker housing all over our small island, regular inspections of all of them are not possible. Errant employers and housing operators take advantage of this and their workers' helplessness to flout the law with impunity. Violations have been persistent and range from overcrowding to fire safety."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00365,2015-01-20-T-016,365,Gan Thiam Poh,"Hence, I agree with the Government's decision to increase the number of PBDs. Monitoring the standards of these PBDs will be more practicable and sustainable."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00366,2015-01-20-T-016,366,Gan Thiam Poh,"However, employers are naturally concerned that such a decision might favour dormitory operators and lead to higher business costs. They are worried that with no alternative accommodation for their employees, they would be at the mercy of dormitory operators. Would the Ministry consider setting up an independent council, similar to the Public Transport Council, to regulate the pricing of dormitories so that operators will compete instead on non-price factors?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00367,2015-01-20-T-016,367,Gan Thiam Poh,"This Bill encompasses additional regulations for dormitories with 1,000 or more beds. They address the management of public health and safety issues, security and public order issues and the maintenance of social and commercial facilities and services."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00368,2015-01-20-T-016,368,Gan Thiam Poh,"While I support these additional measures, I would like to ask the Minister how the figure of 1,000 was arrived at. Whether it is a smaller dormitory with a few hundred residents or a bigger one with 1,000, similar problems could arise. In the event of an infectious disease outbreak, racial or national tension, for example, the tipping point can be reached at 100 or 200 workers. In any dormitory with a couple of hundred workers from a wide mix of countries, there should be measures to ensure harmonious living."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00369,2015-01-20-T-016,369,Gan Thiam Poh,"Should the hundreds of thousands of workers housed in smaller dormitories, especially those within worksites, not be protected as well by the new regulations? In addition, how will it be possible for the Ministry to ensure a level playing field for all dormitory operators with different requirements for dormitories of different sizes?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00370,2015-01-20-T-016,370,Gan Thiam Poh,"Next, I would like to check if it is compulsory for Work Permit holders working in certain sectors to be housed in PBDs. If this is, indeed, the case, what are the reasons? Mdm Speaker, in Mandarin, please."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00371,2015-01-20-T-016,371,Gan Thiam Poh,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech on Pg xx.] This amendment is targeted at dormitories with 1,000 beds or more. Should the Government also consider setting a limit on the maximum number of beds for these facilities?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00372,2015-01-20-T-016,372,Gan Thiam Poh,"This is because we must make sure that if a conflict unfortunately breaks out, the Government can quell the unrest effectively in the shortest possible time, so that workers staying there and the managers are safe."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00373,2015-01-20-T-016,373,Gan Thiam Poh,"In my view, congregating the dormitories at one location or spreading them out to different places, each has its pros and cons; same with putting the majority of workers up at one dormitory or separating them at different dormitories."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00374,2015-01-20-T-016,374,Gan Thiam Poh,How to balance? The two are very important.
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00375,2015-01-20-T-016,375,Gan Thiam Poh,"Besides guidelines on hardware facilities, ""software"" issues, such as the proportion of dormitory staff and managers to boarders and staff training, are also important."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00376,2015-01-20-T-016,376,Gan Thiam Poh,"Communication between the dormitory staff/managers and the boarders is important, so also the care and concern shown towards the workers. This can effectively prevent unhappy incidents from happening and will help employers raise productivity."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00377,2015-01-20-T-016,377,Gan Thiam Poh,"Every now and then, we would hear about how awful the living conditions of some foreign workers' dormitories are. Unscrupulous employers and dormitory owners, in order to profit, knowingly put up the workers in overcrowded, unhygienic and unsafe dormitories, taking advantage of the fact that the workers are not familiar with Singapore and are helpless. The reason why we keep seeing this kind of problems is because the possibility of being caught is low and the punishment is not severe enough."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00378,2015-01-20-T-016,378,Gan Thiam Poh,"This Bill is in tandem with the long-term measures taken by the Government. At the same time, MOM should conduct surprise inspections and mete out punishments accordingly against those who flout the rules and make sure employers comply. Hope we can effectively solve this thorny problem once and for all."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00379,2015-01-20-T-016,379,Gan Thiam Poh,"(In English) 	Madam, I support the Bill."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00380,2015-01-20-T-016,380,Randolph Tan,"Mdm Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join this debate. This Bill is an important move to regulate accommodation for foreign workers, and I support it. However, I have two specific concerns which I would like to seek the Minister's clarification on."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00381,2015-01-20-T-016,381,Randolph Tan,"First, given the significant impact that large foreign employee dormitories could have on the welfare of their occupants, the condition of the immediate vicinity, as well as the general state of the neighbourhood in which it is located, I am concerned that none of these factors appear to have been explicitly included in the licensing conditions."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00382,2015-01-20-T-016,382,Randolph Tan,"At the moment, the licensing conditions do not require feedback from either the dormitory occupants, current or intended, the residents of the surrounding community, or any assessments of the impact on the immediate vicinity."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00383,2015-01-20-T-016,383,Randolph Tan,"I see that clause 13(c) does specifically include ""serious disruptions to the community"" as grounds for the Commissioner to issue a compliance directive. But that appears to imply that the preceding anomaly, such as a complaint, would be required as a trigger."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00384,2015-01-20-T-016,384,Randolph Tan,"Mdm Speaker, I am suggesting that accounting for such potential impact on the community should be built into the licensing requirement so that the operator is required to proactively seek community feedback as part of the conditions for renewal of licence. I am suggesting that such conditions be explicitly imposed. I am aware that it could impose additional costs on operators, which would, ultimately, have to be borne by employers. However, I believe that what we want is a system that will stand us in good stead for the longer term. Hence, I believe that this would be in line with the purpose stated in clause 4(c) of the Bill."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00385,2015-01-20-T-016,385,Randolph Tan,"If the regulatory burden on operators is too heavy, it will encourage flouting of the law. On the other hand, inadequate oversight will lead to a mismatch between the burden borne by employers and that borne by society. Although a balance has to be struck, it should be better to anticipate the natural concerns of the community hosting a dormitory, rather than to react to them only when they arise."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00386,2015-01-20-T-016,386,Randolph Tan,"Ultimately, if operators find that they need not care for the vicinity in which the dormitory is located, the costs will be transferred to the neighbourhood, which will only increase negative perceptions and threaten the sustainability of such facilities."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00387,2015-01-20-T-016,387,Randolph Tan,"My second concern is about the threshold number, which several hon Members have already spoken about before me. I appreciate that the Minister had already emphasised that smaller dormitories are not exempt from regulations. I hope you will allow me to press this point on the grounds that there are concerns that I feel exactly about the uneven treatment. Since a significant proportion of workers are housed in smaller dormitories which would be exempt from this Bill, I would like to ask if the Minister has any concerns about possible unintended outcomes. Is it the intention to impose a heavier regulatory burden on operators of larger dormitories?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00388,2015-01-20-T-016,388,Randolph Tan,"This raises other issues. First, operators will be subject to different standards, depending on their size, and the enforcement could become, therefore, correspondingly more onerous. Second, if employers gravitate towards smaller dormitories because of this loophole, this could encourage the sprouting up of such smaller facilities."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00389,2015-01-20-T-016,389,Randolph Tan,"As I had noted above, my concern is that when accommodation standards are unacceptable, this increases the overall cost that would have to be borne by society."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00390,2015-01-20-T-016,390,Randolph Tan,"On a different note, I would like to express my strong support for the Ministry's decision to allow operators a transition period in moving to these new standards. In fact, I would like to echo Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef's point earlier that perhaps we should consider allowing an even longer period of adjustment. What we are stipulating are standards that we should not compromise on once they have been met."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00391,2015-01-20-T-016,391,Randolph Tan,"In conclusion, I want to urge the Ministry to ensure that enough resources are allocated to enforcement. Accommodating large numbers of foreign workers carries a cost to society as a whole. It is the responsibility of employers to fully price such costs into their operations. Workers need to be taken care of according to standards that the social conscience of Singapore today requires. Very often, the social cost of accommodating low-wage workers are hidden from view and not properly accounted for. In that sense, poor quality conditions in accommodating foreign workers often push the cost to society."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00392,2015-01-20-T-016,392,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"Madam, Singapore depends on foreign workers for many jobs, especially in the construction, process and marine industries. Most of these are jobs that Singaporeans do not want to do, but which are necessary for providing the services and infrastructure that help improve the quality of life for Singaporeans and to keep our economy growing."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00393,2015-01-20-T-016,393,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"Many Singaporeans take pride in the magnificent skyline of Marina Bay and the country's iconic buildings, such as the public housing project Pinnacle@Duxton, the first one in the world to have two sky bridges linking the seven towers."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00394,2015-01-20-T-016,394,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"Indeed, most Singaporeans live in HDB flats which are continuously being upgraded. But we know that these would not have been constructed in the first place had it not been for the thousands of foreign workers toiling day and night to build them brick by brick, sometimes, risking life and limb."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00395,2015-01-20-T-016,395,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,We owe it to our foreign workers to ensure they are provided with decent living conditions in Singapore and are not vulnerable to exploitation on account of their weak bargaining power and their willingness to suffer hardships just to work here.
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00396,2015-01-20-T-016,396,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"Their main purpose of coming to Singapore is to earn money to create better lives for themselves and to send back the money to their families in their home countries. With this as their top priority, many of them are reluctant to report any abuse of their poor living conditions, out of fear of losing their jobs and being sent home."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00397,2015-01-20-T-016,397,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"Many of the foreign workers here have no problems with their housing but it is unconscionable that, despite Singapore's progress as a First World city and their contribution to its growth, over the years, a proportion of them have been found holed up in cheap and makeshift shelters with conditions akin to a Third World slum. We continue to read reports of such abuses today, as highlighted by other Members before me."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00398,2015-01-20-T-016,398,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"I know that MOM takes seriously any breach of the various regulations which protect the rights of our foreign workers. It is, indeed, assuring to know that MOM has been conducting inspections of foreign workers' dormitories and cracking down on housing violations."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00399,2015-01-20-T-016,399,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"I share the Ministry's stand that, in the longer term, it is better to house Work Permit holders in PBDs where there are self-contained facilities to meet their social and recreational needs outside work. Such well-equipped dormitories, if run well, will provide foreign workers with a better living environment and the motivation to give of their best in their jobs here. Like other human beings, they have their legitimate needs and aspirations, to rest, play and be treated with dignity and respect."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00400,2015-01-20-T-016,400,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"This Bill is a significant move in laying the groundwork for realising this larger vision. But in the short term, we have to address the fact that, despite the availability of such PBDs for years, some employers have shunned them, preferring to house their foreign workers elsewhere, including rat-infested makeshift shelters."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00401,2015-01-20-T-016,401,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"One obvious reason for this is cost. Employers are, above all, driven by cost considerations, especially given the significant increase in foreign worker levies over recent years. They keep costs as low as possible to maximise profits. It costs $300 to $350 per head for PBDs, without including transport. It costs much less to house them anywhere else, especially onsite."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00402,2015-01-20-T-016,402,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"Currently, about 200,000 foreign workers are housed in smaller dormitories below the 1,000-bed threshold, including those situated within worksites. So, for example, if you take the construction sector, it is much cheaper to house them onsite in uncompleted buildings or temporary makeshift quarters. MOM, in fact, allows this, as long as they comply with the various requirements, such as fire safety and providing adequate and proper sanitary and bathing facilities."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00403,2015-01-20-T-016,403,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"This is an entirely rational decision, especially for large projects involving thousands of workers, as it reduces the need for the workers to be ferried to and from their workplaces and also reduces traffic congestion on the roads."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00404,2015-01-20-T-016,404,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"It also makes economic sense  the average salary for foreign construction workers is between $450 and $600 a month. Very low pay, with very low status. Their foreign worker levy ranges from $300 to $950, depending on their skill levels. The numbers add up."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00405,2015-01-20-T-016,405,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,What incentive does the employer have to house their low-wage foreign workers in the high-cost PBDs when they can get away with cheaper if sub-standard ones? This is especially so for subcontractors involved in smaller-scale projects operating on tight margins.
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00406,2015-01-20-T-016,406,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"I would like to ask the Minister  given the current realities, what assurances are there that, first, employers would house them at PBDs even if more were built; and second, that the employers would not try to pass on the higher cost of such housing to the foreign workers by squeezing their salaries?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00407,2015-01-20-T-016,407,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"How would the market equilibrate? Evidence suggests that, for such matters, it cannot be left to the dictates of the free market. One way is to regulate the fee structure of PBDs so that prices will come down to a level that will provide a level playing field. After all, the Government gives funding assistance to existing dormitory operators to retrofit their dormitories to meet the Government's new higher standards."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00408,2015-01-20-T-016,408,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"To add another safeguard, it should be made illegal for employers to pass on the cost of accommodation to the Work Permit holders, just as it is now illegal to pass on the cost of the foreign worker levy and insurance premiums to them. There should also be a tightening of the permits granted for new quarters on construction sites and factory-converted dormitories."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00409,2015-01-20-T-016,409,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"MOM should also conduct regular spot checks and enforce stringent standards with deterrent penalties imposed on housing violations, whatever the size of the dormitory. These penalties were doubled only two years ago, when the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act was amended in November 2012. Employers found guilty of failing to provide acceptable accommodation can be fined up to $10,000, and/or jailed for up to 12 months. But since then, how many employers have been prosecuted under the Act with deterrent penalties?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00410,2015-01-20-T-016,410,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"I am aware that checks and inspections are labour-intensive and MOM's manpower resources are stretched. But I echo the concerns expressed by other Members on the need to pay even closer attention to smaller dormitories where the most egregious housing violations tend to take place in tandem with these additional regulations for larger dormitories under this Bill. In other words, pay more attention to the smaller dormitories even as we enforce this Bill."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00411,2015-01-20-T-016,411,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"It is good to see the media taking on the role of watchdog on this issue, staking out suspicious sites and exposing them. The newspapers seem to have received quite a few tip-offs from members of the public. I hope that this will have a salutary effect on employers."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00412,2015-01-20-T-016,412,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"But MOM needs to beef up on its enforcement, so that the public can have confidence that it will also take prompt action on a tip-off. That said, it is unrealistic, however, to rely on tip-offs for large dormitories which are closed to members of the public. Even I, as a Member of Parliament, have no access. I tried to gain access to a large dormitory recently with a polite request for a visit to discuss community engagement but was denied."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00413,2015-01-20-T-016,413,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"This leads me to my other concern  that PBDs may become very restrictive places for foreign workers to live, confining them with strict rules governing their hours and their behaviour, especially with the additional licensing requirements under this Bill. It is important to guard against the danger of PBDs becoming more like a prison or a labour camp, rather than a temporary home for guest workers."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00414,2015-01-20-T-016,414,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"We know that there is resentment among some quarters in Singapore against the presence of foreign workers in shared public spaces. But we must send a very clear signal to all that the construction of PBDs is to provide more decent housing for Work Permit holders with better facilities and space; it is not to render them invisible to the public eye or to completely cut them off from society. Already, it is a tough life for them here  they work six to seven days a week, often under hot and difficult conditions that not many Singaporeans would put up with. They are entitled to their rest, with some freedom of movement."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00415,2015-01-20-T-016,415,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"We should shape the attitudes of employers towards them with all the levers that the Government has at hand. They are guest workers. They are not slaves. Negative attitudes, if left to persist, would also have repercussions in the wider society. Already, there seems to be an increasing divide between Singaporeans and foreign workers in our midst. Nasty comments both ways are not uncommon in the social media. These should be discouraged and the deeper issues addressed. The Government is already tightening the inflow of foreign workers, to the point that some companies have to close shop in Singapore and move elsewhere. Despite the pain felt by businesses, the Government must press on with the economic restructuring to operate at a higher level with higher productivity."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00416,2015-01-20-T-016,416,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"To attract more Singaporeans into the industries which rely on foreign workers, such as construction and F&B, the wages must be increased and the working conditions and processes improved. It is also important to change the public perceptions towards these jobs as low status jobs. With these changes, attitudes towards foreign workers and the jobs that they do will also change. This will make for a more united Singapore  open, decent and fair to all."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00417,2015-01-20-T-016,417,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"In conclusion, Madam, as we celebrate Singapore's 50th anniversary and look with some pride at all that we have achieved, let us recall the role played by foreign workers over the years. Let us ensure that they are trained well, treated well and housed well. Hopefully, when they go back to their home countries eventually, they will have good memories of working in Singapore and be our ambassadors in portraying a good image of us as a society. With that, I support the Bill."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00418,2015-01-20-T-016,418,Lee Bee Wah,"Mdm Speaker, I am pleased that the Government is addressing the concerns of poor living conditions and overcrowding in foreign worker dormitories. This Bill will certainly home in on the current shortcomings in housing for foreign workers who come here to work, and also ensuring that the concerns of Singaporeans who live near to these dormitories are also looked into."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00419,2015-01-20-T-016,419,Lee Bee Wah,"In Chinese, there is a saying, “又要马儿跑， 又要马儿不吃草”. It means that ""You can't expect the horse to run fast when you don't let it graze"". But let me clarify that the reference to horses is not meant to be taken literally. Rather, it is to appreciate the hard and long hours that these workers have been putting in each day to help us realise our infrastructure developments."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00420,2015-01-20-T-016,420,Lee Bee Wah,"If we want our construction projects to be completed on schedule and with efficiency, it only makes sense that we protect the basic rights of these contributors with adequate and proper living quarters where they can rest well after a day's hard manual work, relax and be comfortable."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00421,2015-01-20-T-016,421,Lee Bee Wah,"I am in support of the Bill, but I believe we can do more. Firstly, why are only large dormitories with 1,000 or more beds subject to licensing? How did this magic figure come about? I would think putting a few hundred people under a roof is a sizeable crowd. It poses challenges to manage even with just 50 people under one roof, from fire safety, cooking area, toilets to space for clothes. Failure to manage the living quarters of a few hundred people can certainly give rise to problems in terms of public health and safety, security and public order."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00422,2015-01-20-T-016,422,Lee Bee Wah,"I wish to ask the Minister how many percent of our workers are living in large dormitories with 1,000 or more beds. I strongly believe that we should lower the threshold for the Bill to include smaller dormitories to ensure that these workers have a safe and hygienic accommodation during their stay in Singapore."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00423,2015-01-20-T-016,423,Lee Bee Wah,"Without proper supervision, there may be some errant dormitory operators who will comfortably slip past licensing requirements. There is certainly nothing to stop an operator from putting 999 workers there and thus escape scrutiny."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00424,2015-01-20-T-016,424,Lee Bee Wah,"Last October, there was a report in The Straits Times on the living conditions at some factory-converted dormitories. There were workers who complained of being plagued by mosquitoes, rats and ants. I would be surprised if the dormitories are not infested with cockroaches and bed bugs. They had nowhere to store their groceries and food. There was no proper space to dry their wet clothes and uniforms. Windows are sometimes boarded up, which meant poor ventilation. Will this Bill cover such dormitories? Will this Bill prevent such things from occurring again? Definitely not, as most such factory dormitories are less than 1,000-bed capacity."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00425,2015-01-20-T-016,425,Lee Bee Wah,Let us take this opportunity to examine the overall welfare of our foreign workers.
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00426,2015-01-20-T-016,426,Lee Bee Wah,"Next, not all employers are open to housing workers in PBDs. It is more cost-effective to house them in cheaper onsite facilities. Due to the limited space and lack of amenities, these facilities tend to become cramped and unsanitary. Thus, I believe such facilities, though they house fewer foreign workers, would still need to be subject to monitoring as well."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00427,2015-01-20-T-016,427,Lee Bee Wah,"I propose making it compulsory to provide additional frequently used amenities, such as free wi-fi, TV and proper storage facilities, and recreational corners if space permits. Many own smartphones to keep in touch with their families back home."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00428,2015-01-20-T-016,428,Lee Bee Wah,"Free wi-fi would certainly come in handy and save them some expenses. Instead we often see them squatting along the roadside or areas where they can tap on free wi-fi. Some have taken to going to HDB void decks and commercial buildings to tap on the free wi-fi, for example. Mdm Speaker, in Mandarin, please."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00429,2015-01-20-T-016,429,Lee Bee Wah,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech on Pg xx.] Mdm Speaker, in the past few years, Yishun Group Representation Constituency (GRC), especially Yishun South, saw many new construction projects and Build-To-Order (BTO) flats coming up, very much like bamboo shoots springing up after the rain. While it is good to help young people to fulfil their dream of home ownership, some residents are disturbed by the constructions."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00430,2015-01-20-T-016,430,Lee Bee Wah,"Residents often told me that, every night, they would see foreign workers lingering around their void decks. Some workers would leave a large amount of trash behind, such as cigarette butts and beer bottles."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00431,2015-01-20-T-016,431,Lee Bee Wah,"As Singapore's largest developer, HDB perhaps should take the lead to ask the contractors to provide free Wi-Fi at the workers' dormitories and some basic recreational facilities. These will not only keep the workers at their dormitories but also reduce the inconvenience to nearby residents."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00432,2015-01-20-T-016,432,Lee Bee Wah,"We can also provide training and seminars for foreign workers to better understand and integrate into our culture. For example, short courses on not littering, safety guidelines for pedestrians and cyclists, laws and customs, will reduce the friction between the locals and foreign workers."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00433,2015-01-20-T-016,433,Lee Bee Wah,"I also received a number of feedback on foreign workers driving on our roads. Many residents feel that it is too easy for foreign workers to convert their driving licence into a local one. They feel that due to the differences in driving behaviour, culture and road conditions, foreign workers should take some driving tests before they are allowed to convert their licence. This will improve our road safety. Mdm Speaker, I support this amendment Bill."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00434,2015-01-20-T-016,434,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill. I am heartened by the introduction of this new licensing framework which seeks to regulate operators of foreign worker dormitories. Under the new Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill, dormitories for foreign workers with more than 1,000 beds will need to be licensed from the second half of 2015. Under the proposed Bill, operators or proprietors must obtain a licence to run the dormitories and this is over and above existing regulatory standards and requirements."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00435,2015-01-20-T-016,435,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"The imposition of new conditions and requirements through this new licensing framework is laudable. I welcome this move as we must ensure our foreign workers have a proper living environment which caters to their well-being and health while, at the same time, ensuring the local community where they reside in close proximity is not overly inconvenienced by their presence in numbers."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00436,2015-01-20-T-016,436,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Foreign worker dormitories have a huge impact on their surroundings. This is especially so when these dormitories are located near to residential communities. The proposed Bill aims to ensure safety, security and public health in the vicinity where these dormitories are housed. I spoke on this challenge last year in Parliament and I am glad that this new Bill has been introduced."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00437,2015-01-20-T-016,437,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"On behalf of Nee Soon GRC and, in particular, my Nee Soon East constituency, there are several blocks of flats which are in close proximity to two existing foreign employee dormitories, namely, Simpang Lodge 1 and Lodge 2, located along Yishun Avenue 7. During my weekly house visits and grassroots events, I have gathered feedback from residents as well as grassroots leaders living within a stone's throw from the lodges on some of the social disamenities which they had to contend with. I will attempt to share some of the challenges faced, what are the actions taken by us thus far and suggestions moving forward in light of this new piece of legislation. I would classify them into three broad categories, namely, (a) safety and security, (b) environment and (c) transport."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00438,2015-01-20-T-016,438,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"The first challenge faced by residents who live at the HDB blocks in close proximity involves safety and security issues. These include congregation at void decks and open grass patches, public consumption of liquor, illegal tapping of wi-fi and cycling on pedestrian footpaths. All these create a sense of insecurity and concerned parents become worried for their daughters and children who come home in the evenings or late at night."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00439,2015-01-20-T-016,439,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"The second challenge involves the environment. The congregation and activities at HDB void decks and open patches have resulted in littering, with drink cans, bottles and packaging left behind, as well as noise which affects the peace and quiet in the neighbourhood at night."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00440,2015-01-20-T-016,440,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"The third challenge involves transport in that they fuel the overcrowding of feeder service 811 during peak hours. Although the majority of foreign workers living at Simpang lodges 1 and 2 have company-provided transport, the remainder do not. As such, they utilise feeder service 811 located nearest their dormitories daily to get to Yishun bus interchange and Yishun MRT station. This further exacerbates the already well-utilised service 811 as many of our Yishun residents, including students, use that feeder service each morning to get to school or go to work. The overcrowding occurs during peak hours in the morning and crowding at the bus interchange in the evening for the return trip."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00441,2015-01-20-T-016,441,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"I am glad to share that we have formed a task force a year ago. In the past 12 months, our Nee Soon East grassroots team has been working closely with several Ministries and Government agencies, including MOM, MND, BCA, HDB, Nee Soon Town Council, NEA, the Ministry of Home Affairs/Singapore Police Force (SPF) and LTA. The task force sought to address the three broad challenges shared thus far."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00442,2015-01-20-T-016,442,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"In the area of safety or security, Police officers from the Neighbourhood Police Centres have stepped up patrols, including deploying plainclothes officers, to maintain law and order. Auxiliary Police Officers have also been deployed at the areas of possible congregation to carry out foot patrols. Targeted enforcement against errant cyclists who ride on pedestrian footpaths has also been taken. Our grassroots volunteers also perform Citizens on Patrol to augment the forces. Police CCTVs have also been installed at the lift and staircase access points of the HDB blocks in proximity and CCTVs deployed at alcohol sales locations. We have also asked the dormitory operators to provide free wi-fi."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00443,2015-01-20-T-016,443,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"With respect to environmental issues, the task force and, in particular, MHA/SPF, grassroots, Town Council, NEA and Migrant Worker Centre, have also carried out numerous events and engagement sessions at these two dormitories to educate them on the laws, cultures and social norms, and help them assimilate into our country and neighbourhood. In my visits during these events and sessions, I can see that the workers are supporting our drive."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00444,2015-01-20-T-016,444,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"As for the SMRT feeder service transport overcrowding issue, I am glad that LTA has added extra runs in the past year and other interventions like the peak period short service and a new service 803 to cater to BTOs along the route. However, we still receive feedback of crowding and we have since deployed bus ambassadors at those bus stops to ensure commuters move to the rear of the bus and queue up to board in an orderly manner."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00445,2015-01-20-T-016,445,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Despite the initial successes, I urge all the partners, especially MOM, MND, BCA, MHA/SPF and LTA, to continue the good work of the task force by helping and supporting the grassroots volunteers to sustain the efforts. I submit that there should be a single point of contact so that our grassroots need not have to deal with so many different agencies. I urge also that alcohol sales and consumption be better managed, including affected areas in the neighbourhood and community."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00446,2015-01-20-T-016,446,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"In particular, I hope that even more can be done to further mitigate the 811 feeder service crowding. In fact, I just did my house visits to the three affected blocks two days ago and the residents there shared that the safety and security and environment issues have improved but quite a number still encounter long waits and overcrowding on bus service 811 during peak hours as well as on weekends. This is further exacerbated by the fact that there is bunching of buses as well as commuters not moving to the rear. I submit and recommend that a 811 peak period service dedicated solely to those two bus stops within close proximity to the Simpang lodges, or a new bus service be catered to alleviate the load."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00447,2015-01-20-T-016,447,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"The proposed Bill assures us that the authorities have a proper system in place to tighten the control over the challenges caused by large foreign dormitories. From a worker-centric point of view, one of the gaps of this proposed Bill is that it does not cover dormitories with less than 1,000 beds, such as those located within worksites. I know there are large numbers of foreign workers living in dormitories with less than 1,000 beds."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00448,2015-01-20-T-016,448,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"I urge MOM to fill the lacuna by bringing these smaller dormitories within the auspices of this new Bill. In the interim, I urge MOM to continue scrutinising these smaller dormitories and not let our guard down."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00449,2015-01-20-T-016,449,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Nonetheless, I am glad to note that the Bill provides for the ""threshold number"" of 1,000 to be replaced with a lower number by the Minister publishing a gazette notification if and when needed. I am also encouraged that this Bill will also mean dormitories can be required to provide dedicated recreational facilities within these dormitories to provide the workers with breathing space and also ease the load off neighbourhood community facilities."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00450,2015-01-20-T-016,450,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"In conclusion, at the end of the day, we want to move towards a system where migrant workers are treated with dignity. We want to help them become socially integrated and adapted to our society through understanding our cultures, behaviours, customs, attitudes and laws. Having this new licensing framework is a good start as a good environment in these dormitories will go a long way towards increasing their productivity, and new conditions will help eradicate the social disamenities and enhance the overall living environment of the foreign workers and the residents living in close proximity to these dormitories. I support this Bill."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00451,2015-01-20-T-016,451,Foo Mee Har,"Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill. It is disquieting to hear of cases where foreign workers, usually Work Permit holders, have had to endure overcrowded and unhygienic housing conditions when their unscrupulous employers flout the law. Workers have been found shoehorned into cramped shophouses, apartments and temporary dormitories, living in conditions that many of us would consider uninhabitable."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00452,2015-01-20-T-016,452,Foo Mee Har,"I am pleased that the Government intends, over the long term, to house all Work Permit holders in PBDs, where there are self-contained facilities to meet the workers' social and recreational needs outside work. These will not only cater to the lifestyle and recreational needs of the foreign workers, but will also help preserve the communal space for Singaporeans and minimise the impact of large concentrations of foreign workers on neighbouring local communities."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00453,2015-01-20-T-016,453,Foo Mee Har,"I had called on the Government to pursue this very approach during the 2013 Committee of Supply debate and am thankful that they have taken decisive action in the form of regulatory provisions, the building of more foreign worker recreation centres and the rapid increase in bed supply in PBDs."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00454,2015-01-20-T-016,454,Foo Mee Har,"The Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill requires dormitories with 1,000 or more beds to meet licensing conditions covering a wide range of areas, from public health and safety, security and public order issues to the provision and maintenance of social and commercial facilities and services."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00455,2015-01-20-T-016,455,Foo Mee Har,"Mdm Speaker, clause 29 of the Bill states that every foreign employee dormitory is to be deemed a public place for purposes of enforcing laws on drunken behaviour. I am concerned that curbs on alcohol consumption at the dormitories will mean drinking at other places around the dormitories. This will cause great inconveniences to local communities in the neighbouring estate. Can the Minister please clarify how this risk can be mitigated?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00456,2015-01-20-T-016,456,Foo Mee Har,"I support the security requirements for dormitory operators to implement computerised access systems, CCTVs, segregation gates to isolate disturbances to within the dormitory compound, and an Emergency Response Plan to deal with potential public order incidents. I am also pleased with the requirement for sick bay isolation facilities to contain any infectious disease outbreak, which could spread quickly in a densely populated dormitory."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00457,2015-01-20-T-016,457,Foo Mee Har,"However, given the size and footprint of PBDs, I would like to ask the Minister what measures, other than those required of the operators, will be put in place by the various Government agencies to prevent and mitigate security and public order issues, if and when they arise from these large concentrations of foreign workers."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00458,2015-01-20-T-016,458,Foo Mee Har,"Madam, despite the best efforts to provide for the foreign workers' needs in their dormitory compounds, it is inevitable that many will feel the need to venture outside the dormitories, into the nearby local estates. I would like to ask the Minister what planning parameters are used to determine how foreign workers' dormitories should be sited in Singapore, how the impact on local residents is assessed and what additional resources, such as law enforcement officers, are then deployed in neighbourhoods close to foreign worker dormitories."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00459,2015-01-20-T-016,459,Foo Mee Har,"I recognise that given Singapore's small size, it is inevitable that some dormitories will be sited near our local communities. I believe that providing transparency around this issue will help manage the expectations of Singaporeans who live close to such dormitories and help them understand the situation. It will also help assure local residents to learn of additional measures taken by the authorities to mitigate any impact on their neighbourhood, security and lifestyles."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00460,2015-01-20-T-016,460,Foo Mee Har,"Madam, while I applaud the Government's efforts to set out comprehensive requirements for dormitory operators, complete with hefty penalties for non-compliance, this may also lead to dormitories being dominated by a few large players. Besides health and security measures, the proposed legislation requires dormitory operators to provide workers with a comprehensive range of daily conveniences at the dormitories, including minimarts, ATMs, regular events on Sundays and public holidays, and dedicated transport to and from the dormitories."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00461,2015-01-20-T-016,461,Foo Mee Har,"Marginal or smaller players will be squeezed out by these onerous conditions and high investment requirements. The business of operating dormitories will need to achieve a certain scale to justify the building of these facilities expected of the operator. Both the dormitory owners as well as the operators may feel the need to build financial buffers to hedge against potential liabilities. As licences will only be valid for up to three years, it will also mean that capital expenditure will need to be depreciated over a relatively short period of time."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00462,2015-01-20-T-016,462,Foo Mee Har,We should be cognisant of the cost structure in this industry and how they may translate into affordability issues for employers seeking dormitory beds for their employees. I would like to ask the Minister what safeguards he will put in place to prevent cost escalation and profiteering by a few large dominant players.
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00463,2015-01-20-T-016,463,Foo Mee Har,"Foreign worker dormitories are projected to house as many as 385,000 non-domestic non-Malaysian Work Permit holders – this is an infrastructure on a very large scale. Perhaps the Government should consider taking on the role of developer or proprietor of foreign worker dormitories, so as to disintermediate, or remove one layer of commercial profit-making. Some commercial entities may be allowed to own and develop dormitories if they intend to operate the dormitories or are meant to house their own staff, as in the case of Keppel Corp and SembCorp. This approach offers the Government more control over the dormitories' ""hardware"" and the flexibility to choose qualified dormitory operators whose key focus will just be to run the day-to-day dormitory operations effectively and efficiently."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00464,2015-01-20-T-016,464,Foo Mee Har,"The new regulations are designed to minimise the impact of foreign worker dormitories on neighbouring communities. Whilst many Singaporeans will welcome this, it is important that we do not inadvertently encourage discrimination and prejudice against foreign workers, or confine them to a ghetto, and restrict their opportunity to assimilate and appreciate Singapore's culture and way of living. We must continue to foster a sense of mutual respect between Singaporeans and these workers, who are here to do jobs we would rather not do and to help build our economy. For example, in my ward, I have found it useful to involve workers from nearby dormitories in community events and projects, as well as join our Citizens-on-Patrol, as a means to understand each other better."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00465,2015-01-20-T-016,465,Foo Mee Har,"Madam, whilst I support having clear penalties to encourage good behaviour, as laid out in the Bill, the powers given to the Commissioner appear sweeping. In particular, the Explanatory Notes state that compliance directives may be issued to a licensed operator without the need for the licensed operator to be heard and that non-compliance is an arrestable offence. We need to ensure that any such directives issued are with transparency and fairness and do not serve to discourage genuinely interested and qualified operators from entering this industry."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00466,2015-01-20-T-016,466,Foo Mee Har,"Likewise, clause 25 states that ""A Police officer or dormitory operator may arrest without warrant any individual whom the Police officer or dormitory inspector, as the case may be, reasonably suspects is committing or has committed an offence under section 7"". Here, again, we need to ensure that enforcement of this clause is fair and proportionate. I would also ask that dormitory operators and Police officers be properly trained to conduct inspections with due respect and sensitivity towards dormitory residents."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00467,2015-01-20-T-016,467,Foo Mee Har,"In addition, as a multi-agency approach will be adopted to ensure that the licensing conditions will be enforced, the different Government agencies should work seamlessly, expediently and coherently together."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00468,2015-01-20-T-016,468,Foo Mee Har,"Mdm Speaker, in conclusion, it is heartening to learn from a recent survey that an overwhelming 90% of foreign workers in Singapore are satisfied to work here, 92% plan to continue working in Singapore, and 81% would recommend Singapore to friends and relatives as a place to work. Singapore continues to depend on these workers to build our infrastructure and support our economy. The Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill is a step in the right direction towards building living spaces where all residents, whether local citizens or foreign workers, can live and work together in comfort, safety and harmony. Madam, I support the Bill."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00469,2015-01-20-T-016,469,Speaker,Minister Tan Chuan-Jin.
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00470,2015-01-20-T-016,470,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank Mr Christopher de Souza, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef, Mr Pritam Singh, Mrs Lina Chiam, Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Assoc Prof Randolph Tan, Ms Irene Ng, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, Mr Patrick Tay and Ms Foo Mee Har for their views and support for the Bill."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00471,2015-01-20-T-016,471,Tan Chuan-Jin,"We all acknowledge the importance of the Bill as a progressive and much needed measure to provide the Government with additional levers to manage larger dormitories over and above current regulations. With that in place, we will be able to better design dormitories and to deal with these issues upstream when we are designing the dormitories, so that we can ensure that we provide better living, social, recreational alternatives for workers. This will also help to facilitate the harmonious co-existence with our residents from the surrounding communities."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00472,2015-01-20-T-016,472,Tan Chuan-Jin,"A number of Members raised comments on a broad range of issues, including employment standards and protection for workers. They are all important. I would like to again emphasise that the management of a foreign workforce is a very wide-ranging topic. A number of these measures are already in place. A number of major steps have been put in place in the preceding years. For example, the changes that we have made to the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act represent a step in that direction."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00473,2015-01-20-T-016,473,Tan Chuan-Jin,"I would address most of the concerns specific to the issues of the Bill which is about regulating larger dormitories, but I would also like to take the opportunity here to make some broader points about the state of foreign worker welfare in Singapore; they are from some of the descriptions and points raised."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00474,2015-01-20-T-016,474,Tan Chuan-Jin,"It is important for the House not to have the wrong impression that there is widespread mistreatment of foreign workers in Singapore. I do agree, for example, in various instances highlighted by a number of Members – Mr Christopher de Souza, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Mr Pritam Singh, Mrs Lina Chiam, Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Ms Irene Ng – of workers being housed in poor, unhygienic conditions. I do know because I accompany my officers when they go for inspections and I have seen many of such similar cases."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00475,2015-01-20-T-016,475,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Does it mean that every single accommodation in Singapore is in that fashion? No. Are there egregious cases? There are. But I would like to emphasise that these instances that we see, they are unacceptable; and in many instances, they already violate existing laws. Regulatory agencies will take to task any person found to have violated the prevailing standards and ensure that the affected workers are relocated to approved accommodations."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00476,2015-01-20-T-016,476,Tan Chuan-Jin,"My officers are out every week inspecting, following up on leads and tip-offs. Many of these do not make it to the headlines. What you see represents some of the cases that have been highlighted, some have been tipped off to the media, some have been tipped off by the public, some by the NGOs, and they are valid because there are these cases and many more that our people see. We do need to deal with them. But does it mean that, across the board, the situation is dire, as highlighted by Ms Foo Mee Har?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00477,2015-01-20-T-016,477,Tan Chuan-Jin,"We have taken this issue on board. We have tried to make sure that we survey the foreign workers in a large enough sample to understand what are the conditions. Our survey showed that nine in 10 foreign workers are satisfied with working in Singapore and an equally high proportion would recommend that their friends come here to work. Again, that does not mean that there are no egregious cases."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00478,2015-01-20-T-016,478,Tan Chuan-Jin,"For example, in terms of existing regulations – in terms of enforcement – last year, MOM alone took more than 1,400 employers to task for providing unacceptable accommodation to their workers. We relocated close to 3,000 as a result of poor living conditions. We have prosecuted offenders in egregious cases. Other agencies, such as URA, NEA and SCDF have also taken errant premises owners to task for flouting existing regulations which cover areas, such as illegal subletting, inadequate bathing and toilet facilities and overcrowding. As the Government, we are not only stepping up enforcement of existing requirements, but we are also continuing to review and raise these standards over time, and this is what we are going to do."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00479,2015-01-20-T-016,479,Tan Chuan-Jin,"This Bill addresses one part of the issue, which is dealing with the dormitories that are far larger. The rest of the other regulations continue to be in place, tracked and strengthened over time. In particular, housing types raised by Members, for example, onsite workers' quarters – that is one area that we are looking at as well. I would also add that the authorities are also watching the density and use of these sites. Apart from managing the standards that are expected and required, we are also looking at what sites ought to be approved, where are the areas that ought to be approved and, as we build up more PBDs, we are also looking at being a lot stricter in giving approvals for the use of various premises for housing foreign workers."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00480,2015-01-20-T-016,480,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Let me also state this again about foreign workers being housed in dormitories. The dormitories are more relevant for non-Malaysian workers in the construction, marine and process sectors. This group forms only about half, not the whole of the 770,000 or so Work Permit holders in Singapore. Half of them are Malaysians. Many of them commute daily and do not need dormitories, or are workers in the manufacturing and services sectors who may live in rented residential premises near their workplaces."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00481,2015-01-20-T-016,481,Tan Chuan-Jin,"With regard to Ms Foo Mee Har's query on how the locations of dormitories are determined, the relevant Government agencies do take into account many factors, including technical and infrastructural constraints like suitability of roads, adequacy of sewers in the area as well as recreational and social amenities that the dormitory can support. I would also like to assure Mr Gan Thiam Poh that similar care is taken in determining the capacity for each dormitory as well as the number of dormitories allowed within an area."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00482,2015-01-20-T-016,482,Tan Chuan-Jin,This level of coordination is going on across Government agencies and we do continue to want to strengthen that. This may not always be apparent because this often takes place in the background. But this work will continue and we will continue to emphasise and strengthen the collaboration and cooperation across various stakeholders.
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00483,2015-01-20-T-016,483,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh also raised the issue of whether employers from specific sectors should be allowed to house their workers in better-equipped PBDs. While the Government's view is that PBDs can better cater to Work Permit holders' housing needs, there are also merits to housing workers on or near their worksites. For example, this would alleviate the need to transport them back and forth. There will be an impact on productivity. There will also be less loading on the public transport system during peak hours. Therefore, such non-PBDs still remain a space which we need to look at in terms of providing housing options, provided they continue to meet the existing regulatory requirements on appropriate housing standards. Where these requirements and standards are not met, we urge the public and those who are aware of such violations to raise them. Our authorities will inspect and take action. That is what a lot of officers do on a week-to-week basis."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00484,2015-01-20-T-016,484,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mr Christopher de Souza, Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Mr Patrick Tay, Mr Pritam Singh and Mr Gan Thiam Poh had also noted that there is still a significant number of workers who are being housed in the dormitories that will not come under the ambit of this new Bill. This is one of the common concerns that have been raised by many about why only those dormitories with above 1,000 beds; how about those with less? They suggested lowering the 1,000-bed threshold to cover dormitories housing fewer workers. Assoc Prof Randolph Tan has also asked if concerns about unintended outcomes arising from the threshold had been considered."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00485,2015-01-20-T-016,485,Tan Chuan-Jin,"To put things in perspective, the threshold of 1,000 beds will cover all existing PBDs, and all the new PBDs coming onstream will offer 1,000 beds and above. That is where we are going with PBDs. It is important for us to factor in these requirements upstream, so that they are designed and worked into the building of the PBDs; not just the physical infrastructure, but the way in which it has to be run. It does not mean that the rest of the space is not being regulated; they are. It also does not mean that we will not look at whether and how to strengthen the regulations for the smaller dormitories or accommodations which house fewer than 1,000 beds."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00486,2015-01-20-T-016,486,Tan Chuan-Jin,"It is a considered decision. We had also debated why 1,000 beds, should it be fewer, should it be more. We looked at the spread of the different housing types and the numbers that they house. We felt that, going forward, that is what we are going to do with PBDs – we are going to have a lot more of these and that is why it is important for this Bill to move now rather than wait for a complete solution. The rest of the other measures will unfold with time as we look into it and see how best to strengthen them."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00487,2015-01-20-T-016,487,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Over time, as more PBD sites are launched, we will expect the proportion of foreign workers staying in larger dormitories within the threshold to increase. As I have mentioned earlier, we will also manage in terms of the permission given for contractors and developers, in terms of requesting various sites to house their workers. As more of these PBDs come onsite, we will also begin to take a stricter view about how workers are housed elsewhere. Therefore, you will begin to see a lot more of them shifting towards PBDs."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00488,2015-01-20-T-016,488,Tan Chuan-Jin,"There is, therefore, this need to manage upstream the different dynamics that come with a larger site. As I have highlighted earlier, the 1,000-bed threshold was selected because of the different challenges posed by such larger dormitories, as well as the fact that the requirements that we will impose, such as outdoor recreation spaces and minimarts, are only possible actually in larger dormitories."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00489,2015-01-20-T-016,489,Tan Chuan-Jin,"For smaller dormitories – for smaller factory-converted dormitories, for example, they may not have the scale to be able to put in place some of these measures. There are other solutions. For instance, we also encourage the building of recreational centres which cater to clusters. For example, there are areas where there, perhaps, may not be so many of such PBDs but there are facilities housing smaller numbers of workers, but there is a whole cluster of them which have needs to be met, and that is where recreational centres are being built to address those."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00490,2015-01-20-T-016,490,Tan Chuan-Jin,"There are practical reasons why this is so. For example, we are aware of security concerns. We are also aware of healthcare concerns. For smaller dormitories or smaller accommodation spaces, when outbreaks happen, you can manage it, you have quarantine. But when you have a much larger dormitory, the requirements are quite different, the scale is very different. We need to weave this into the design of the dormitories themselves."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00491,2015-01-20-T-016,491,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Instead of just lowering the threshold, the more practical approach, we believe, is to add on additional requirements for dormitories above 1,000 beds. I emphasise again  existing regulations continue to be there. They continue to be important. They continue to cover a wide range of the concerns that we have today, and they will be looked at and will continue to be strengthened over time. But for the many PBDs that are going to come on line – the existing ones and the new ones – we do need these additional requirements because the scale of those dormitories is quite different. These requirements will be on top of the existing levers which will continue to apply."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00492,2015-01-20-T-016,492,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Having said this, we will also bear in mind the suggestion, the possibility, of having different classes of licences in the future, should experience show that this is needed. Which is why the way the Bill is structured allows us to have the space to have different classes of licences and to be able to adjust the numbers accordingly, should the need arise."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00493,2015-01-20-T-016,493,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Pritam Singh were also concerned that operators could potentially escape licensing by subdividing their premises to fall slightly below the threshold of 1,000 beds; or as Er Dr Lee Bee Wah mentioned, ""What about the 999-bed dormitories?"" We have recognised this and we know that people are very creative. Whatever laws that we come up with, they will find creative ways to circumvent them."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00494,2015-01-20-T-016,494,Tan Chuan-Jin,"For the vast majority of dormitories which will be Government-tendered, the proprietors are obliged to provide enough bed spaces for a predetermined number of workers. Any request for subdivision will be evaluated and will be subjected to approval by the relevant authorities. Moreover, we have made provisions in the Bill precisely to prevent this kind of gaming by empowering the Commissioner to deem a group of buildings, structures or facilities as one dormitory for the purpose of dormitory licensing. We are fully aware that there is a likelihood, in fact, in our discussions with the various stakeholders with the dormitory operators themselves, they have also raised various questions, ""What happens if we have this, that and the other?"" This is where we share the same concern as Members do, and we have worked it into the Bill so that we make sure we are able to prevent such gaming of the system."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00495,2015-01-20-T-016,495,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Members, such as Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef and Ms Irene Ng, have commented on the affordability of PBD beds, in particular, that dormitories may raise bed prices in response to the cost of meeting higher regulatory standards. The Government has also been injecting more land for development of PBDs over the last few years. As PBDs are completed over the coming years, more bed spaces are coming online in the next few years, we have reasons to believe that the dormitory operators will need to keep prices competitive to attract tenants. At the same time, as I have mentioned earlier, we are also watching the space in terms of permission granted for other types of dormitories being set up, housing smaller numbers of workers in other types of accommodations."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00496,2015-01-20-T-016,496,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Let me point out that the additional requirements to be imposed through this regime have been included in the tender conditions for new dormitories since last year. What it means is that the bidders of these sites must calculate the necessary compliance costs, including the additional regulatory requirements of larger dormitories as part of their overall business plans and, therefore, adjust the costs in their bids accordingly. This mechanism will also allow them to ensure that they do not just pass on the cost. Often times, if you overbid for a particular project, you will have to find ways to recover that. But when all these requirements are upfront, they will have to factor that in so that they bid accordingly. This will help to manage the cost and to ensure that they do not transfer it on to others, especially to the workers."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00497,2015-01-20-T-016,497,Tan Chuan-Jin,"For existing dormitories which were not built to the new standards, as many Members have acknowledged, it is important for us to allow some flexibility on a case-by-case basis when it is extremely difficult for the dormitory to comply. We will give time and we support their effort. For instance, there may be space constraints and it might just not be possible to provide sufficient outdoor recreation space. We will provide some form of financial assistance to retrofit existing dormitories to ease operators into the new framework and reduce the need to pass on the cost through higher bed prices. More details will be provided to the industries when these are finalised."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00498,2015-01-20-T-016,498,Tan Chuan-Jin,"With regard to Ms Foo Mee Har's comments on the impact of the licensing tenure on the recovery of capital investments, dormitories with longer land leases may renew their licences if they comply with the licensing conditions and if the location continues to be deemed suitable for foreign worker housing."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00499,2015-01-20-T-016,499,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Ms Foo Mee Har also asked about the other measures in place to mitigate contingencies involving security and public order. We have kept such contingencies in view and consulted quite extensively with the relevant agencies, including SPF, MOH and NEA, when formulating the licensing conditions. Many of the requirements imposed on the dormitory operators are devised precisely to facilitate the intervention of the relevant agencies in an emergency. We would also like to assure Ms Irene Ng that it is not the intention of the Government to make dormitories restrictive places to live in. There are also extensive requirements pertaining to areas, such as social and recreational amenities, which ensure that dormitories better meet the needs of the residents."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00500,2015-01-20-T-016,500,Tan Chuan-Jin,"I would like to thank Mr Gan Thiam Poh for the suggestion to include other requirements in the licensing conditions. We have worked closely with the Members on the licensing conditions and have incorporated their inputs where possible. The licensing conditions set the minimum standards that the licensed dormitories have to comply with, and are intended to complement the broader suite of foreign worker management initiatives that I have earlier mentioned. Nonetheless, we will encourage operators to provide additional services or amenities that best serve the specific needs of their residents."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00501,2015-01-20-T-016,501,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Ms Foo Mee Har and Mr Patrick Tay also highlighted the importance of managing alcohol sale and consumption. In the upcoming Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill, which MHA has tabled, will deal with this issue."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00502,2015-01-20-T-016,502,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Assoc Prof Randolph Tan noted the importance of ensuring that the new regulations are effectively enforced. I fully agree with that. Assoc Prof Tan can be assured that sufficient resources have been allocated to the task. On the other hand, I would also like to assure Ms Foo Mee Har and Mrs Lina Chiam that we will not go overboard either and that the powers of the Commissioner and inspectors will be exercised judiciously. They will have a wide range of tools and levers that can be calibrated according to the situation. For example, the offence of running a large dormitory without a licence is a particularly egregious one. We have, therefore, made this an arrestable offence."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00503,2015-01-20-T-016,503,Tan Chuan-Jin,"It is also imperative that the Commissioner has the powers to use compliance directives to respond effectively to disorder and risks to the dormitory residents' health and safety. In such exceptional circumstances, when time is of the essence, the Commissioner needs to have the power to direct dormitories to comply immediately with the necessary requirements, even if these have not been communicated beforehand. As many Members have shared, for instances of violations, we do take these quite seriously. The changes we have made in EFMA in the preceding years and some of these measures we are putting in place are to give the authorities more clout to be able to step in, in a much more decisive fashion. We are going to do the same for dormitories and housing arrangements for fewer than 1,000 workers."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00504,2015-01-20-T-016,504,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Nonetheless, there will be appropriate appeal and review mechanisms, including for compliance directives and the modification of licence conditions under both normal and extraordinary circumstances. For instance, for the modification of licensing conditions, the Commissioner must give a notice period of at least 14 days, during which the operator may make written representations. Clause 13(2) also states clearly the circumstances under which the Commissioner may issue a compliance directive, for instance, when the dormitory has contravened a licensing condition."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00505,2015-01-20-T-016,505,Tan Chuan-Jin,"We also recognise that, from time to time, there are genuine issues on the ground that even the best of regulations might not have been taken fully into account, particularly in areas where there are high concentrations of foreign workers. Agencies have, therefore, been working with Members and grassroots leaders to tackle the challenges on the ground, and we will continue with these efforts. I am glad that Mr Patrick Tay agrees that these interventions have helped to alleviate the challenges faced in his constituency and we will continue to work closely with him to address the remaining issues."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00506,2015-01-20-T-016,506,Tan Chuan-Jin,"On this note, I would also echo that whatever regulations we put in place, whether it is managing dormitories of 1,000 beds and more, or smaller, even in the present situation, we do see violations. My officers see violations every week. Are we able to eradicate them? It is probably difficult and probably not possible to say we can eradicate them completely. But we must endeavour to eradicate as much of them as possible. This is where we do need the strength of the regulations and the laws for us to be able to take action. We do need enforcement to be strengthened. That is something that we plan to do."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00507,2015-01-20-T-016,507,Tan Chuan-Jin,"We have been carrying out enforcement and we do plan to step up efforts. We do need the community, just as in terms of managing the congregational issues that we face on the ground, we also need the community to provide us with information for us to act. We do receive many leads and so on, but we have also been on many wild goose chases – times when we were given information and we carry out the inspection and nothing is there. So, we also need to evaluate that. But information is important, whether through industry insiders, members of the public, the media or NGOs. It takes the community to play a part. When egregious cases are noticed, give us information and we will endeavour to act on it and take the necessary action."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00508,2015-01-20-T-016,508,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, this Bill will enhance the levers to address the different dynamics that come with larger dormitories. This Bill also seeks to provide a good and safe living environment for dormitory residents and manage the potential impact on surrounding communities."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00509,2015-01-20-T-016,509,Tan Chuan-Jin,"This Bill does not address all issues pertaining to the management of foreign workers. It is meant to address a particular trend; it is to address dormitories housing more than 1,000 foreign workers, because that is where we are going with a lot of PBDs. Existing regulations are in place, we will continue to work on them, along with other measures to better manage our foreign workforce in order to better look after them. They play, as many Members have highlighted, a very important role in building up Singapore, and it is our responsibility and duty to look after all our workers, whether foreign or local."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00510,2015-01-20-T-016,510,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Notwithstanding what we see sometimes online, I do believe that many Singaporeans do appreciate the contributions of foreign workers. In fact, in many of the surveys and in many of the conversations I have had with foreign workers, many of them are happy here. It is not a perfect life by any means, but many of them appreciate the kindness and warmth shown to them by the many Singaporeans whom they come into contact with on a daily basis."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00511,2015-01-20-T-016,511,Tan Chuan-Jin,"I echo Ms Foo's sentiment that we do not, and should not, inadvertently encourage discrimination or prejudice against foreign workers. To address what some critics have from time to time claimed, it would be wrong to associate the steps that we are taking to make dormitories safer, more secure and better able to meet the needs of the residents with the xenophobic sentiments."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00512,2015-01-20-T-016,512,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Once again, I do very much thank Members of the House for their support of the Bill. Many of the views that you echo and the concerns you have expressed, I share them wholeheartedly. As I have said, this Bill is meant to address a particular space. The space is a very large one. There are existing measures in place, there will be new measures and new initiatives put in place to further improve it and we look forward to Members' suggestions on how best to do that."

2015-01-20-T-016-S-00515,2015-01-20-T-016,515,Yeo Guat Kwang,"Mdm Speaker, I would like to seek a few clarifications from the Minister. The Minister mentioned that the Bill targets those dormitories that are housing 1,000 workers and above. But this Bill's name is ""Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill"". Why do we not call the Bill the ""Purpose-Built Dormitory Bill""? That is, we call a spade a spade. It is still important for us to ensure that all the other dormitories are properly regulated. Because of the fact that many Members have raised the concern, may I now ask the Minister if he would recognise that there is a big gap? In his reply, he mentioned that, currently, there are already a lot of existing regulations to regulate the other dormitories. But how are we going to enhance them?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00516,2015-01-20-T-016,516,Yeo Guat Kwang,"I would also like to ask the Minister  why do we not consider, like the Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill yesterday, grouping all the other relevant regulations into the Bill to make the whole regulatory regime more comprehensive?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00517,2015-01-20-T-016,517,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, it is important for us to understand that this Bill addresses a specific issue, which is how best to regulate the larger dormitories, basically 1,000-bedders and above, because we are building PBDs of that size. It does not mean there are no regulations in place; it does not mean that the present regulations governing the welfare of the foreign workforce are inadequate. There are, for example, in the many instances highlighted in the media, the egregious cases we have seen over the past couple of months – in fact, over a long period, there have been various issues that have been cropping up – all those cases violate existing regulations."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00518,2015-01-20-T-016,518,Tan Chuan-Jin,"What we intend to do is to make sure those regulations remain in place. They continue to remain in place, even for the larger dormitories. But the larger dormitories bring with them a different scale, which is why it is important for us to provide some of these added requirements, because the scale adds a very different dimension to it."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00519,2015-01-20-T-016,519,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Now, does it preclude that we, going forward, do not bring in some of these measures for some of the smaller dorms? It does not preclude that. Does it mean that we will not eventually have an over-arching Bill that brings in together everything? No, it does not preclude that either. What we are saying is that there are already a lot of measures in place and continue to be in existence. We do not want to wait for this mother-of-all-Bills to cover everything, because it is pressing for us to address the 1,000-bedders and above, because these PBDs are coming online. We want the contractors and developers to build this into the requirements and to the design of not only the physical infrastructure, but in the way in which they are run, so that the playing field is clear, all these things are fused in and we do not need to do this retrospectively. We will continue to work on this space to improve the management of our foreign workforce, whether in terms of their living or working conditions."

2015-01-20-T-016-S-00524,2015-01-20-T-016,524,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"Mdm Speaker, I share the concerns raised by the hon Member Yeo Guat Kwang on the need to have a more comprehensive regulation that encompasses as well the smaller dormitories. I understand the Minister's point that the smaller dormitories are already governed by the existing regulations. But the concern that many Members here share is that while we have tough laws for the smaller dormitories, the enforcement may not have been as tough."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00525,2015-01-20-T-016,525,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"That is why one of the questions I raised in my speech was  within the last two years ever since the Act was tightened and penalties increased for housing violations, how many cases have been brought to bear and with deterrent penalties on errant employers? While we have this new tough Bill for 1,000-bedders and above, we would like an assurance that the smaller dormitories will not escape the gaze of MOM."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00526,2015-01-20-T-016,526,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"My other question is to clarify whether the Minister is saying that the direction where MOM is moving is towards encouraging, or maybe a gentle persuasion for, employers to go into PBDs; or is he tightening the screws in terms of tightening permits for new quarters, squeezing out available options in the market for smaller dormitories so that they will be herded into PBDs?"
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00527,2015-01-20-T-016,527,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, I am not sure ""herding"" will be the appropriate term to use in this context. But the idea is that, going forward, we will be building more PBDs of that size. We would like to shift more of the housing accommodation needs of our foreign workforce into that sector. It does not mean that the need for some of these factory-converted dormitories (FCDs) does not exist. We do know there are also many FCDs, for example, that do need regulations and which are of a suitable standard to provide housing and accommodation for the foreign workforce. There is a reason for that, because housing them, for example, onsite, would actually be a lot more productive, would save a lot of time, I think for the foreign workers themselves as well. But the standards must be met."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00528,2015-01-20-T-016,528,Tan Chuan-Jin,"As we go forward, as we build and provide more of this bed space elsewhere, we would also look at the approval process for the different accommodation for workers. For example, URA has also issued some guidelines on some of the areas. If we have a number of FCDs and we feel that the density has exceeded what we feel is comfortable, we will place a cap and basically not allow further FCDs on those premises."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00529,2015-01-20-T-016,529,Tan Chuan-Jin,"But as we have more PBDs, we will begin to see more and more of our foreign workforce living in those conditions. And there are better controls, which is why it is important to bring about this Bill."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00530,2015-01-20-T-016,530,Tan Chuan-Jin,"It is also important to understand – and I have emphasised this repeatedly – that bringing about this Bill does not mean that the accommodation spaces and the needs of the workers who are staying in dormitories which are smaller than 1,000 beds are not important. They continue to remain important. And it continues to be important that we not only regulate but regulate them effectively."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00531,2015-01-20-T-016,531,Tan Chuan-Jin,The reason why this Bill is in place is so that we can make sure that these measures and parameters are worked in early. The existing space for some of the smaller living accommodation and spaces do remain important. They are quite substantial in numbers and we do want to make sure that the regulations continue to be enforced.
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00532,2015-01-20-T-016,532,Tan Chuan-Jin,"What the Member raised is not about the regulations not being comprehensive. It is about enforcement. Is it sufficiently effective? So, we recognise that. Enforcement is in place but we will step it up."

I have asked the Minister whether the Government would take on the role of a developer or proprietor for foreign worker dormitories so as to remove one layer of commercial profit-making."
2015-01-20-T-016-S-00535,2015-01-20-T-016,535,Foo Mee Har,"All the Government needs to do is focus on appointing people who are good in dormitory operations and these people do not have to have a lot of investments and they focus on the day-to-day operations of the dormitory, making sure they are run effectively and efficiently. So, maybe a little bit like going back to the old days of JTC building worker dormitories so that this does not have to be because I think the risk of the very comprehensive set of regulations and the hefty penalties may preclude some of the smaller players from coming into the space. After a few years they may be worried about having discussions about cost escalation and monopoly by a few large players."

It is something that we are fully aware of and we will track the developments as they go on.</span>"

2015-01-20-T-018-S-00549,2015-01-20-T-018,549,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what measures is the Ministry looking into to help businesses, in particular the SMEs, adjust and cope with rising costs while they are still embarking on productivity improvements which will take time to show results."
2015-01-20-T-018-S-00550,2015-01-20-T-018,550,Lim Hng Kiang,"As part of economic restructuring, the Government has provided continued support to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to upgrade their capabilities and improve productivity through schemes, such as the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC), Innovation and Capability Voucher (ICV) and Capability Development Grant (CDG). We are seeing some encouraging developments and positive results from these initiatives. In a recent survey conducted by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 90.3% of surveyed companies have adopted productivity measures in 2014, compared to 83.9% in the previous year. Another survey conducted by DP Information Group in 2014 showed that a growing number of SMEs are pursuing productivity improvements and investing in new technologies."
2015-01-20-T-018-S-00551,2015-01-20-T-018,551,Lim Hng Kiang,"The Government has been actively engaging SMEs to raise awareness and to help them apply for different Government grants and assistance schemes. We have collaborated with trade associations and chambers to set up a network of 12 SME Centres to assist SMEs from different parts of Singapore. The SME Workgroup, comprising representatives from the Government and private sector, has also been reaching out to SMEs to gather feedback and explain how the companies can benefit from different Government schemes. Some initiatives which we will be implementing based on industry feedback are to facilitate the participation of SMEs in Government procurement tenders by publicising more information on how SMEs have successfully bid for such tenders and to work with the Singapore Business Federation on a fair to increase awareness of the available opportunities."
2015-01-20-T-018-S-00552,2015-01-20-T-018,552,Lim Hng Kiang,"To date, more than 22,000 companies have benefited from the productivity initiatives introduced by the National Productivity Council. Export-oriented sectors registered healthy productivity growth of 2.1% per annum from 2010 to 2013, which is significantly higher than the 0.2% per annum growth for the overall economy. These sectors accounted for 56% of value-added in Singapore’s economy. For other sectors, including retail, food services and construction, the Government will continue to work with companies and industry associations to raise productivity and improve efficiency. We have to persevere with these efforts as sustained productivity improvements are essential for Singapore’s economy to remain competitive and to provide good jobs for Singaporeans."
2015-01-20-T-018-S-00553,2015-01-20-T-018,553,Lim Hng Kiang,"The Government has also taken steps to manage cost increases affecting SMEs. For example, rentals for industrial space have been moderating, following our release of more land and space over the past few years. In the third quarter of 2014, the rental indices for overall industrial space and multiple-user factory space fell by 1.3% and 2.3% respectively, on a year-on-year basis. This is the first year-on-year decline since 2010. There will also be a steady supply of industrial and retail space in 2015 and 2016, which will help to exert downward pressure on industrial rents and land prices. In addition, we are improving the transparency of rental data for industrial, retail and office space, which will provide more information for SMEs to make their leasing decisions."
2015-01-20-T-018-S-00554,2015-01-20-T-018,554,Lim Hng Kiang,"The Government will continue to support our SMEs on the economic restructuring journey, to help them become more competitive and productive. This requires the collective efforts of all parties, including the Government, employers and workers. We will also actively engage SMEs and gather their feedback on how Singapore businesses can benefit from new growth opportunities through internationalisation, innovation and collaboration."
2015-01-20-T-019-S-00555,2015-01-20-T-019,555,Zaqy Mohamad,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether regulations and enforcement on animal feeding are adequate to address irresponsible behaviour that results in proliferation of rats and mosquito breeding; and (b) how does the Ministry balance the wants of animal lovers in the residential areas to continue to feed and the need to feed in a responsible way that does not result in unwanted pests or inconvenience to others.
2015-01-20-T-019-S-00556,2015-01-20-T-019,556,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Food that is left on open ground or improperly disposed of causes the proliferation of rats, cockroaches and other vermin. The containers with stagnant water also allow mosquitoes to breed. Consequently, irresponsible feeders who do not clear away the leftover food after feeding of stray animals may be fined up to $2,000 for littering under the Environmental Public Health Act."
2015-01-20-T-019-S-00557,2015-01-20-T-019,557,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Managing the danger posed by irresponsible animal feeding requires a collective effort by Government agencies, animal welfare groups and the public. The health and safety of humans must remain paramount. We hope the public will understand and support these measures."
2015-01-20-T-020-S-00558,2015-01-20-T-020,558,Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs whether the Ministry will consider giving an award/grant to families of the Ministry's uniformed service officers who have died while in service since 1965, in recognition of the officers' contributions to nation-building and as part of SG50 celebrations."
2015-01-20-T-020-S-00559,2015-01-20-T-020,559,Teo Chee Hean,"Home Team officers put their lives at risk every day to protect Singapore and Singaporeans. We value and appreciate them for the important contribution that they make to keep Singapore safe and secure. We remember and honour our officers who passed away in the course of duty in several ways, such as the award of medals, posthumous promotions and ceremonial funerals. We also provide assistance and financial support to their families. We know that this will never be enough for the huge sacrifice they have made and hope that the recognition and support will be a source of comfort for their families."
2015-01-20-T-020-S-00560,2015-01-20-T-020,560,Teo Chee Hean,"The Singapore Police Force also remembers and pays tribute to its officers who have lost their lives in the service of the nation during the annual Police Day, with the observance of a minute of silence."
2015-01-20-T-020-S-00561,2015-01-20-T-020,561,Teo Chee Hean,"In our SG50 celebrations this year, we will commemorate the contributions of our officers who have lost their lives in the course of duty. The Home Team will also have a series of events to honour, thank and remember our pioneers. Our Home Team pioneers were instrumental in fighting many serious threats during our critical nation-building years – communist terrorists and assassins, violent crime, secret societies, industrial and student unrest, Konfrontasi, racial riots, drugs and major fires. They laid the foundations for the safe and secure home that we enjoy today."
2015-01-20-T-020-S-00562,2015-01-20-T-020,562,Teo Chee Hean,"Through these events, we hope that the younger and future generations of officers will be inspired by their courage, dedication to duty and sacrifice."
2015-01-20-T-021-S-00563,2015-01-20-T-021,563,Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) how do the 2014 readings of the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) compare with those recorded for 2013; and (b) whether progress is made towards achieving clearer skies and better air quality with the enactment of the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act.
2015-01-20-T-021-S-00564,2015-01-20-T-021,564,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Using the new PSI incorporating the PM2.5 readings which the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) introduced in April last year, our air quality was in the ""Good"" and ""Moderate"" range for 353 days in 2014, and 350 days in 2013. We continue to be affected by transboundary haze from the region. The number of hotspots detected in Sumatra and Kalimantan in 2014 was, in fact, higher this year – 28,580 hot spots, compared to 18,129 in 2013. We were only spared poorer air quality because the wind conditions were favourable to us."
2015-01-20-T-021-S-00565,2015-01-20-T-021,565,Vivian Balakrishnan,"This is why MEWR enacted the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act on 25 September 2014. The Act is not a silver bullet and we do not underestimate the challenges of implementing it. Nonetheless, the enactment of this legislation has focused domestic and international attention on the haze problem and placed errant companies on notice that their irresponsible actions will attract prosecution."
2015-01-20-T-021-S-00566,2015-01-20-T-021,566,Vivian Balakrishnan,Regional cooperation within ASEAN remains a critical pillar of the ultimate solution. Local enforcement by local authorities at the sites of the fires is essential. MEWR and the National Environment Agency will continue to work closely with the region’s authorities and non-government organisations to resolve this recurrent regional problem collectively.
2015-01-20-T-022-S-00567,2015-01-20-T-022,567,Christopher de Souza,"asked the Minister for Manpower how will the drive towards a more productive economy be made sufficiently flexible to accommodate manpower-intensive industries, such as the construction industry and those industries that are heavily dependent on foreign workers."
2015-01-20-T-022-S-00568,2015-01-20-T-022,568,Tan Chuan-Jin,"The Ministry of Manpower understands that foreign manpower needs differ across sectors. We have catered for sector-specific needs by applying different dependency ratio ceilings to the five broad sectors – construction, manufacturing, services, marine and process. In general, higher dependency ratio ceilings are granted to industries where the nature of work tends to be relatively unattractive, as locals are less inclined to perform these jobs. For instance, both the construction and process sectors enjoy a very high dependency ratio ceiling of seven foreign workers for every local worker hired. We have also provided flexibility in industries where there is an essential economic or social need on an exceptional basis. This explains why we have specific provisions for industries like conservancy and healthcare."
2015-01-20-T-022-S-00569,2015-01-20-T-022,569,Tan Chuan-Jin,"While some flexibility is accorded, we cannot afford to entrench our dependence unsustainably on large numbers of low-skilled foreign workers. For the industries that many of us perceive to be ""manpower-intensive"" and ""heavily dependent on foreign workers"", we should ask ourselves whether such industries are similarly labour-intensive in other developed countries. Often, they are not, with reliance on technology or self-service instead. The higher productivity level of such industries then allows higher wages to be paid."
2015-01-20-T-022-S-00570,2015-01-20-T-022,570,Tan Chuan-Jin,"So, we must change the nature of work of many labour-intensive industries to be manpower-lean. Even if it is difficult to attract locals to do such roles, it should still be done with fewer foreign workers, who have good skill levels. Manpower-intensive industries, such as construction can rely on less manpower once a better quality workforce is built up. Our recent announcements, such as mandating a minimum R1 proportion in the construction sector from 2017 onwards, support this shift."
2015-01-20-T-022-S-00571,2015-01-20-T-022,571,Tan Chuan-Jin,A productive economy has to be well-supported by an experienced and highly skilled workforce. I strongly urge all industries and firms to invest in raising the quality of their workforce and other productive technologies in rising up to our productivity challenge.
2015-01-20-T-023-S-00572,2015-01-20-T-023,572,Seah Kian Peng,"asked the Prime Minister (a) whether there is a rise in occurrences of rude and confrontational behaviour towards public servants, in particular front line staff and nurses; (b) if so, what are the reasons for this; and (c) what are the most common occurrences."
2015-01-20-T-023-S-00573,2015-01-20-T-023,573,Teo Chee Hean,"Good service delivery to citizens is important to the Public Service. It works best where there is mutual courtesy and respect. I am happy to note that while there are reported cases of abuse, the vast majority of service interactions between members of the public and public officers are conducted in a courteous and professional manner."
2015-01-20-T-023-S-00574,2015-01-20-T-023,574,Teo Chee Hean,"The frontline agencies with significant public interactions include the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority, Central Provident Fund Board, Housing and Development Board, Inland Revenue Authority, Ministry of Manpower, Ministry of Social and Family Development and National Environment Agency. Among these seven agencies, there were 45 cases of harassment or abuse reported to the Police in 20141. This was an increase from the 25 cases reported in 2013. Among the restructured hospitals, there were 31 reported cases in 2013 and 34 cases in 2014. The Public Service receives more than five million service requests through physical channels each year. The incidence of abuse should thus be seen in this overall context."
2015-01-20-T-023-S-00575,2015-01-20-T-023,575,Teo Chee Hean,"The majority of these cases are incidents of verbal or physical abuse which amounted to intimidation and obstruction of public officers in performing their duties. In some instances, members of the public turned abusive when their requests or appeals were turned down."
2015-01-20-T-023-S-00576,2015-01-20-T-023,576,Teo Chee Hean,"We take a serious view of abuse of public officers, and the more severe cases of abuse will face criminal prosecution under the Protection from Harassment Act which was passed by this House on 13 March 2014. The Act extended protection from harassment for public officers to include Public Service workers who deliver public services that are essential to Singaporeans’ daily lives, such as nurses working in our restructured hospitals. It also provides for increased penalties to reflect the seriousness of harassment against public officers and Public Service workers when they are performing their duties. Our Public Service officers and workers endeavour to serve Singapore and Singaporeans well. We will continue to protect them from abusive behaviour that prevents them from performing their duties."
2015-01-20-T-024-S-00577,2015-01-20-T-024,577,Seng Han Thong,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether major construction works on the North-South Expressway (NSE) will commence in 2015 as scheduled; (b) whether the exact locations of the 16 entrances and 17 exits along the corridor have been confirmed and, if so, when will they be made known to the residents along the NSE corridor; and (c) how will the LTA manage road traffic in the Ang Mo Kio area when major construction work begins as there are two MRT stations in the vicinity currently under construction."
2015-01-20-T-024-S-00578,2015-01-20-T-024,578,Lui Tuck Yew,"The North-South Expressway (NSE) is a major project and will be carried out in phases over a number of years. The detailed engineering study is ongoing and requires more time than initially envisioned due to the complexity of the project. Thereafter, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) will conduct the tender for construction, which will take about six months. Thus, construction will likely only commence in 2016."
2015-01-20-T-024-S-00579,2015-01-20-T-024,579,Lui Tuck Yew,"The locations of all the entries and exits for NSE are available on LTA’s website. The construction area of NSE will not overlap with that of the two MRT stations. Nevertheless, before construction works begin, LTA will carry out traffic impact assessments and engage affected stakeholders on mitigation measures. For roads that are affected by construction works, lane for lane replacements will be provided wherever possible. Even with these mitigation measures, some inconveniences are inevitable and we seek the public’s understanding."
2015-01-20-T-025-S-00580,2015-01-20-T-025,580,Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) since the launch of their ""Fox Hunt"" campaign in July 2014, whether the Chinese government has requested Singapore to assist in the extradition of Chinese nationals who are suspected of corruption and the return of ill-gotten gains seized; and (b) if so, how many cases are there."
2015-01-20-T-025-S-00581,2015-01-20-T-025,581,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"It is our policy, in line with international practice, not to comment on whether a foreign government has made a request for legal assistance on specific cases, whether for international criminal cooperation or extradition matters."
2015-01-20-T-025-S-00582,2015-01-20-T-025,582,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"China has stepped up its anti-corruption efforts. Its President and top leadership have expressed their determination to combat corruption wherever it may occur. While fighting corruption is a long-term challenge, its success in this area will be a tremendous boost to its development and stability. China’s anti-corruption efforts have been welcomed by foreign investors."
2015-01-20-T-025-S-00583,2015-01-20-T-025,583,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In Singapore, anti-corruption is equally important to us. We maintain a firm and principled stance against corruption and other financial crimes. Singapore is a responsible and effective member of the wider international cooperation network in combatting transnational crime. For example, amendments to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act (MACMA) were passed by Parliament in July 2014 to enhance mutual legal assistance and facilitate greater international cooperation against transnational crime. Singapore also proactively shares our experiences with other countries at various fora, such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)'s Anti-Corruption and Transparency Experts’ Working Group."
2015-01-20-T-025-S-00584,2015-01-20-T-025,584,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Should foreign countries, such as China, require our assistance, including in the area of asset recovery, Singapore is prepared to study the merits of the specific request. We will continue to cooperate closely with all our partners on this front, in accordance with our domestic laws and international obligations."
2015-01-20-T-026-S-00585,2015-01-20-T-026,585,K Karthikeyan,asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider reviewing the present payouts under the Work Injury Compensation Act with the inclusion of PMEs and all employees in the Act.
2015-01-20-T-026-S-00586,2015-01-20-T-026,586,Tan Chuan-Jin,"The Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA) offers a no-fault, expeditious and low-cost route to compensation for any injury arising out of and in the course of employment. To ensure that payouts under WICA remain relevant, my Ministry will conduct regular reviews on its compensation limits to account for changes in nominal median wages and healthcare costs."
2015-01-20-T-026-S-00587,2015-01-20-T-026,587,Tan Chuan-Jin,We had increased WICA’s compensation limits twice since the Act was expanded to cover all employees in 2008 and the last increment was made in 2012. We are in the midst of our three yearly review of the compensation limits and will announce more details once the review is completed.
2015-01-20-T-027-S-00588,2015-01-20-T-027,588,Zainal Sapari,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the safeguards which are required of developers to be put in place during the construction of buildings near densely populated residential areas that minimise the health and environmental hazards to residents nearby; and (b) what recourse can residents take should the developers fail to undertake these measures diligently.
2015-01-20-T-027-S-00589,2015-01-20-T-027,589,Khaw Boon Wan,It is the duty of the contractor overseeing the construction site to ensure the construction has minimal impact on the residents. There are regulations in place to minimise the health and environmental impact of construction.
2015-01-20-T-027-S-00590,2015-01-20-T-027,590,Khaw Boon Wan,"Under the Building Control Regulations, prior to project commencement, the contractor has to carry out a pre-construction survey to assess the existing conditions of the buildings and structures which are in close proximity to the building works. This survey would be used to determine whether the construction works have affected the surrounding properties."
2015-01-20-T-027-S-00591,2015-01-20-T-027,591,Khaw Boon Wan,"During project implementation, the Building Control Act requires contractors to erect protective hoarding around the site boundary to prevent construction debris from posing a hazard to the public and the environment. Measures must also be in place to minimise any soil movement which could affect the environment. For construction works that cause vibrations, the contractors have to ensure the vibration level is within the recommended limits based on international standards and practices. These are specified in the Code of Practice."
2015-01-20-T-027-S-00592,2015-01-20-T-027,592,Khaw Boon Wan,"Contractors must comply with the maximum permissible noise levels regulated by the National Environment Agency (NEA). To meet these noise standards, contractors could put in place measures, such as setting up noise barriers. In addition, NEA imposes the no-work rule on Sundays and public holidays on construction sites that are located near residential and noise-sensitive premises, such as hospitals."
2015-01-20-T-027-S-00593,2015-01-20-T-027,593,Khaw Boon Wan,"In addition, the Environmental Public Health Act requires construction sites of contract sums exceeding $10 million to employ an Environmental Control Officer to anticipate and eliminate situations which could result in environmental health problems, for example, mosquito breeding."
2015-01-20-T-027-S-00594,2015-01-20-T-027,594,Khaw Boon Wan,The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and NEA regularly share good practices with the industry through seminars. BCA has also put in place the Green and Gracious Builders Scheme to promote environment protection during construction and to recognise contractors who do so.
2015-01-20-T-027-S-00595,2015-01-20-T-027,595,Khaw Boon Wan,"Residents can provide feedback on building safety to BCA and on environmental health issues to NEA through their hotline numbers which are displayed on signboards at the construction sites. And if the contractor flouts the rule, the contractor could be fined or prosecuted in Court under the specific laws."
2015-01-20-T-028-S-00596,2015-01-20-T-028,596,Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for Manpower whether sufficiently tough penalties are in place to deter companies from posting discriminatory job advertisements and unfairly replacing Singaporeans with foreigners.
2015-01-20-T-028-S-00597,2015-01-20-T-028,597,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) takes a firm stance against discriminatory employment practices. All employers are expected to consider Singaporeans fairly by complying with the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) and the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices.
2015-01-20-T-028-S-00598,2015-01-20-T-028,598,Tan Chuan-Jin,"MOM does not hesitate to take action against employers who are found to have discriminatory employment practices. Last year, MOM investigated and took action against 150 firms for having discriminatory employment practices. Some were given stern warnings while others had their work pass privileges curtailed for up to two years. We might also name and shame these employers. One example is Prime Gold International Ltd after investigations revealed that the firm discriminated against Singaporean employees by unfairly replacing them with foreigners. There has been a couple of high-profile cases highlighted in the media recently. I would like to assure the House that my Ministry has looked into the cases and will take the necessary action when investigations are completed."
2015-01-20-T-028-S-00599,2015-01-20-T-028,599,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Besides acting on complaints, we also proactively identify and engage firms with a disproportionately low share of Singaporeans compared to other firms in their industry. We have identified some firms with shortcomings in their HR practices and required them to implement an action plan to address these shortcomings. We also scrutinise their work pass applications closely."
2015-01-20-T-028-S-00600,2015-01-20-T-028,600,Tan Chuan-Jin,"However, enforcement alone cannot be the only way to address the issue of unfair and discriminatory employment practices. We have complemented our enforcement action with the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP)’s promotion and education efforts. Our current approach has worked well. Companies that were approached by MOM and TAFEP have generally responded positively and are supportive of upholding fair employment practices. For unresponsive and recalcitrant employers, we are prepared to take further action where necessary."
2015-01-20-T-028-S-00601,2015-01-20-T-028,601,Tan Chuan-Jin,"To conclude, let me emphasise that there is no place for employment discrimination in Singapore and the current penalties in place are sufficient to deter such practices. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and will review our approach if necessary."
2015-01-20-T-029-S-00602,2015-01-20-T-029,602,Zainal Sapari,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the rationale for imposing a higher interest rate for home owners who take a third housing loan from HDB; (b) what is the income profile and circumstances in which a person will be granted a third HDB housing loan; and (c) whether the interest rate can be equalised regardless of the number of housing loans taken.
2015-01-20-T-029-S-00603,2015-01-20-T-029,603,Khaw Boon Wan,"The Housing and Development Board (HDB) provides up to two concessionary rate loans to eligible flat buyers, with interest rate at below market rates over the long term. Under exceptional circumstances, HDB may grant a third housing loan, but it will then be at the market rate. Typically, this is for those who are in urgent need of housing but, due to poor credit records, are unable to secure a bank loan even though they have a steady income."
2015-01-20-T-029-S-00604,2015-01-20-T-029,604,Khaw Boon Wan,"Providing a third housing loan at a higher rate is to discourage churning of resale flats. However, for genuine hardship cases, HDB may help with a concessionary rate loan, if the case merits such consideration."
2015-01-20-T-030-S-00605,2015-01-20-T-030,605,Zaqy Mohamad,asked the Minister for National Development whether lifts in newer HDB flats are designed to accommodate an ageing population that may require wheelchair access and ambulance stretchers to quickly evacuate emergency cases using the lifts; (b) what proportion of existing HDB flats are not able to accommodate ambulance stretchers or to move deceased persons easily; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider enhancing lift regulations to accommodate the above in future lift upgrades.
2015-01-20-T-030-S-00606,2015-01-20-T-030,606,Khaw Boon Wan,"The Building and Construction Authority’s Building Control Regulations stipulate that in buildings with lifts, at least one lift has to be designed to allow the access of wheelchair users with a minimum internal lift car dimension of 1.2 metres by 1.4 metres. In practice, the lifts in newer Housing and Development Board residential blocks are larger than 1.2 metres by 1.4 metres, and can accommodate a wheelchair or an ambulance stretcher in an inclined position."
2015-01-20-T-030-S-00607,2015-01-20-T-030,607,Khaw Boon Wan,The Building Control Regulations do not require the lifts to fit stretchers in a flat-lying position.
2015-01-20-T-030-S-00608,2015-01-20-T-030,608,Khaw Boon Wan,"Currently, about 15% of lifts in HDB residential blocks can accommodate a wheelchair, but not an ambulance stretcher in an inclined position. But in most of these blocks, there will be some lifts which are big enough to do so."
2015-01-20-T-030-S-00609,2015-01-20-T-030,609,Khaw Boon Wan,Enlarging the lifts beyond what is stipulated in the Building Control Regulations is constrained by the size of the existing lift wells.
2015-01-20-T-031-S-00610,2015-01-20-T-031,610,K Karthikeyan,asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider having toilets or signs for nearby public toilets in all park connectors.
2015-01-20-T-031-S-00611,2015-01-20-T-031,611,Khaw Boon Wan,"The National Parks Board (NParks) has built about 240 kilometres of park connectors, which will continue to grow. Due to their extensive nature, amenities, such as benches, shelters, fitness equipment and toilets, are provided at selective sites where they can better serve park users."
2015-01-20-T-031-S-00612,2015-01-20-T-031,612,Khaw Boon Wan,"For existing park connectors, NParks is currently working to improve the signages that direct visitors to the nearest toilet facilities, such as those located at nearby shopping malls, food centres and petrol kiosks. These signages are currently placed at strategic spots, such as the junctions of the cycle tracks and gathering points."
2015-01-20-T-031-S-00613,2015-01-20-T-031,613,Khaw Boon Wan,"Where toilet facilities are not available within close proximity to the park connector, NParks will study the feasibility of putting in such facilities, such as where pockets of spaces are available. Going forward, the new Round Island Route development, which is an expansion of the Park Connector Network, will also incorporate toilet facilities at appropriate locations."
2015-01-20-T-032-S-00614,2015-01-20-T-032,614,Seah Kian Peng,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether the Working Mother's Child Relief and Foreign Maid Levy Relief can be extended to taxpayers who are single mothers and, if so, what are the estimated tax savings for this group of taxpayers."
2015-01-20-T-032-S-00615,2015-01-20-T-032,615,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The Government provides support and a range of benefits to families for the care of children at different stages of a child’s development in areas, such as childcare, healthcare and education. A number of these benefits are provided, regardless of their parents’ marital status and extend to single mothers. These include centre-based infant and childcare subsidies, MediSave grants for newborns and MediShield coverage for congenital and neonatal conditions."
2015-01-20-T-032-S-00616,2015-01-20-T-032,616,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Working Mother’s Child Relief and the Foreign Maid Levy Relief which Mr Seah asked about are intended to support married women who remain in the workforce and raise their children within the context of marriage. They reflect the prevailing societal norm where marriage is the first step towards family formation.
2015-01-20-T-032-S-00617,2015-01-20-T-032,617,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The tax savings arising from both reliefs would depend on the individual circumstances of the taxpayer. As single parents currently do not claim for these tax reliefs, we do not have sufficient data, such as whether they have children who are studying full-time and their incomes if the children are working, to accurately estimate the tax savings arising from the reliefs."
2015-01-20-T-033-S-00618,2015-01-20-T-033,618,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (a) for each year from 2012 to 2014, what is the Primary 1 student enrolment figure for each of the full-time madrasahs; and (b) what are some of the measures that MUIS has put in place to encourage such enrolments."
2015-01-20-T-033-S-00619,2015-01-20-T-033,619,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"On average, Madrasah Alsagoff Al-Arabiah enrolled about 30 Primary 1 students each year from 2012 to 2014 whereas Madrasah Al-Maarif Al-Islamiah enrolled about 67 students and Madrasah Al-Irsyad Al-Islamiah, which is under the Joint Madrasah System (JMS), admitted about 204 students each year during the same period."
2015-01-20-T-033-S-00620,2015-01-20-T-033,620,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Madrasahs Aljunied Al-Islamiah and Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah ceased taking in Primary 1 students from 2009 when these madrasahs became part of the Joint Madrasah System, under which they only take in secondary school students."
2015-01-20-T-033-S-00621,2015-01-20-T-033,621,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Madrasah Wak Tanjong Al-Islamiah did not enrol any Primary 1 students between 2012 and 2014. Under the Compulsory Education (CE) Act, our full-time madrasahs are required to meet the annual PSLE benchmark in order to continue to admit students at Primary 1, and Madrasah Wak Tanjong Al-Islamiah did not meet the benchmark in the assessment period of 2008 to 2010. Madrasah Wak Tanjong Al-Islamiah has since met the benchmarks and has started admitting students at Primary 1 in 2015."
2015-01-20-T-033-S-00622,2015-01-20-T-033,622,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"The madrasah education system requires primary students to take five additional Islamic subjects on top of the four PSLE subjects. The madrasahs conduct admissions tests to ensure that students who enrol will be able to cope well with the demands of the curriculum. In total, Primary 1 enrolment of the full-time madrasahs caters for up to 400 places."
2015-01-20-T-033-S-00623,2015-01-20-T-033,623,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"MUIS, together with the madrasahs, are committed to providing a quality education for our madrasah students. Besides recruiting and retaining quality teachers, MUIS also invests in the professional development of madrasah leaders and teachers."
2015-01-20-T-034-S-00624,2015-01-20-T-034,624,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,asked the Minister for National Development (a) how are the season parking rates for Class 3 passenger vans determined; (b) whether the length and height of the passenger van is a determining factor; (c) under what circumstances will a Class 3 passenger van be required to pay the parking rates of a heavy vehicle; and (d) whether there is a different parking rate for the aforementioned vehicle types in properties administered by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and Housing and Development Board (HDB).
2015-01-20-T-034-S-00625,2015-01-20-T-034,625,Khaw Boon Wan,"The rates are based on the unladen weight of the van. Those below 1,800 kilogrammes in unladen weight can be parked in normal car lots at the season parking rates for cars. Heavier vans are not allowed to be parked there for safety and environmental reasons. However, HDB exercises some flexibility and has allowed some drivers to use the residential car parks if the van can fit within a standard car lot and does not obstruct or endanger other car park users. They will be charged the heavy vehicle season parking rate."
2015-01-20-T-034-S-00626,2015-01-20-T-034,626,Khaw Boon Wan,"For passenger vans that are unable to fit within a standard car lot or are unable to park within multi-storey car parks due to height or weight limits, their drivers will have to park them in heavy vehicle parking lots. There is a range of heavy vehicle season parking rates depending on the location of the parks. For a similar type of locations, the rates levied by HDB and URA are largely similar."
2015-01-20-T-035-S-00627,2015-01-20-T-035,627,Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Defence (a) if he will provide an update on the progress that has been made in the relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase; and (b) when is the relocation expected to be completed.
2015-01-20-T-035-S-00628,2015-01-20-T-035,628,Ng Eng Hen,Paya Lebar Airbase (PLAB)’s relocation will be a long-term and complex undertaking that will be realised in about 2030 and beyond as Changi Airbase East (CAB) and Tengah Airbase (TAB) will have to be expanded to accommodate various assets and facilities to replace PLAB. This ensures that the RSAF’s operational readiness to defend our skies is not compromised.
2015-01-20-T-035-S-00629,2015-01-20-T-035,629,Ng Eng Hen,"Over the past year, the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) has been working closely with the Ministry of National Development (MND) and other relevant agencies on the planning and implementation details associated with the relocation. The current focus is on expanding CAB and building a new runway at Changi, a complex undertaking that requires highly-skilled engineering as well as close coordination with the ongoing runway and terminal expansion works at Singapore Changi Airport. Construction of facilities at Changi will commence after detailed site surveys and land preparation works are completed. For TAB, the current effort is on the detailed airbase facility design."
2015-01-20-T-035-S-00630,2015-01-20-T-035,630,Ng Eng Hen,"To ensure the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF)’s operational readiness is maintained, RSAF has put in place plans to build up various capabilities which include a state-of-the-art Island Air Defence System, fighters and other key mission capabilities. The ASTER-30 Surface-to-Air Missile System and the recently announced aerostat system are part of this effort. RSAF will also be upgrading and renewing some of our older systems to meet our long-term security needs."
2015-01-20-T-035-S-00631,2015-01-20-T-035,631,Ng Eng Hen,"MINDEF will continue to work closely with MND and the relevant agencies on the detailed planning and implementation of the relocation. At the same time, we will ensure that RSAF maintains its deterrent edge and continues to be an effective and formidable force to safeguard Singapore’s peace and security."
2015-01-20-T-036-S-00632,2015-01-20-T-036,632,Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Defence (a) if he can give an update on the progress made by the multinational coalition forces in their fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria; and (b) what is the morale of SAF troops that have been deployed in the surrounding region in support of the coalition forces.
2015-01-20-T-036-S-00633,2015-01-20-T-036,633,Ng Eng Hen,"In response to a separate but similar Parliamentary Question on 19 January 2015, an update was provided on Singapore’s deployment to the multinational coalition forces in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). ["
2015-01-20-T-037-S-00634,2015-01-20-T-037,634,Fatimah Lateef,"asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs with a new President and appointed leadership in Indonesia, whether there will be changes in the bilateral relations between Singapore and Indonesia as well as multilaterally in ASEAN."
2015-01-20-T-037-S-00635,2015-01-20-T-037,635,K Shanmugam,"Singapore’s relations with Indonesia have always been broad-based and multifaceted. This is underpinned by mutual respect and ""win-win"" cooperation in various fields, such as the economy, education, environment, health and defence. Our ties at the leadership level are excellent and are buttressed by strong people-to-people links."
2015-01-20-T-037-S-00636,2015-01-20-T-037,636,K Shanmugam,"We have also stood together in solidarity during times of crises. For instance, we just commemorated the 10th anniversary of the tsunami that devastated Aceh on 26 December 2004. The Singapore Armed Forces worked closely with the Indonesian military to help the victims and their families in the aftermath of the disaster. During the recent crash of AirAsia flight QZ 8501, Singapore supported the search and locate and subsequent recovery efforts led by Indonesia. Our agencies operated closely with their Indonesian counterparts, leveraging on the close ties forged over many years."
2015-01-20-T-037-S-00637,2015-01-20-T-037,637,K Shanmugam,"Similarly, we have cooperated closely in international and regional forums. Singapore and Indonesia share similar views on the need for a stable region with an open and inclusive regional architecture. We have worked well together to promote Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) centrality, stability and prosperity. When there are outstanding or difficult issues, we have been able to discuss them in a frank and constructive manner in order to find a way forward. Ultimately, we understand that, as neighbours and regional partners, there is much to be gained in strengthening the relationship between our two countries. I am confident that this will continue to be the case going forward."
2015-01-20-T-037-S-00638,2015-01-20-T-037,638,K Shanmugam,"Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong visited Jakarta to attend Indonesian President Joko Widodo’s inauguration on 20 October 2014 and hosted a breakfast for the latter in Singapore on 22 November 2014. In their discussions, Prime Minister Lee and President Joko committed to maintain the strong cooperation between our countries. Prime Minister Lee expressed Singapore’s willingness to work closely with President Joko’s Administration in areas where there are complementarities."
2015-01-20-T-037-S-00639,2015-01-20-T-037,639,K Shanmugam,"I also met my foreign affairs counterpart Ms Retno Marsudi on a number of occasions recently. She visited Singapore for her introductory visit on 26 November 2014 and I visited Jakarta in December 2014 to have discussions with her and other Indonesian leaders. Similarly, many of our Ministers and officials have good ties with their counterparts in President Joko’s Administration and are committed to advancing the relationship."
2015-01-20-T-037-S-00640,2015-01-20-T-037,640,K Shanmugam,"Indonesia is a key player internationally and regionally, especially within ASEAN. Indonesia’s support will be crucial for the success of the ASEAN Community in 2015 and beyond. As the region’s largest economy, Indonesia’s continued stability and development are vital to us all. I am confident that Indonesia will continue to play a constructive role in the region. We look forward to maintaining our close cooperation with Indonesia in ASEAN and other forums."
2015-01-20-T-038-S-00641,2015-01-20-T-038,641,Lina Chiam,"asked the Minister for Health whether there are any plans to include perfusionists, podiatrists, respiratory therapists and physician assistants in the Healthcare Professional Conversion Programme."
2015-01-20-T-038-S-00642,2015-01-20-T-038,642,Gan Kim Yong,"Today, we have Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) for mid-career professionals who are keen to join healthcare as nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists or diagnostic radiographers. Under the Healthcare PCPs, trainees receive funding that covers the full fees of a local training programme, a monthly training allowance and a Career Transition Bonus upon graduation."
2015-01-20-T-038-S-00643,2015-01-20-T-038,643,Gan Kim Yong,"Our Healthcare PCPs focus on disciplines where we have the most significant manpower needs and where there is adequate faculty to support a local training programme. There are currently no plans to extend the PCPs to podiatrists, respiratory therapists, perfusionists or physician assistants."
2015-01-20-T-038-S-00644,2015-01-20-T-038,644,Gan Kim Yong,"Instead, the Ministry of Health offers scholarships for Singaporeans to be trained as podiatrists and respirational therapists overseas. Over the past five years, we have awarded 20 scholarships for podiatry and 12 scholarships for respiratory therapy. Our public healthcare institutions also provide in-house training for biological sciences graduates to become perfusionists. We presently do not have physician assistants in the healthcare sector but are reviewing the various healthcare provider roles as we plan for the future."
2015-01-20-T-038-S-00645,2015-01-20-T-038,645,Gan Kim Yong,We will continue to review our Healthcare PCPs as part of our strategy to grow and develop healthcare manpower.
2015-01-20-T-039-S-00646,2015-01-20-T-039,646,Seah Kian Peng,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the cost of providing free MRT and bus rides to all Singaporeans above 60 years old, 65 years old and 67 years old respectively; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider providing free transport to all Singaporeans above 67 years old."
2015-01-20-T-039-S-00647,2015-01-20-T-039,647,Lui Tuck Yew,It is difficult to estimate the costs as the travel patterns of the senior citizen group can vary considerably with different policies in place and because we only have the data of those who hold the senior citizen concession card and not that of the entire senior citizen population.
2015-01-20-T-039-S-00648,2015-01-20-T-039,648,Lui Tuck Yew,"That said, to give an idea of the costs for which the Member has requested, the annual cost of travel incurred by the 580,000 senior citizen card holders, all of whom are Singaporeans 60 years old and above, is about $200 million annually. If we look only at the card holders who are 65 years old and above, and 67 years old and above, the cost is about $125 million and $95 million respectively. With free travel, the travel patterns may change and the estimates may rise due to induced travel demand. Furthermore, the population of all Singaporeans 60 years old and above is about 660,000 today and rising, more than the 580,000 senior citizen card holders and, therefore, the estimates are on the low side."
2015-01-20-T-039-S-00649,2015-01-20-T-039,649,Lui Tuck Yew,"Another consideration would be that all senior citizens who are 60 years old and above already enjoy today, generous discounts of 25% to 59% off adult fares, depending on the distance they travel. Senior citizens who travel frequently can also cap their public transport expenditure by using the monthly concession pass priced at $60."
2015-01-20-T-039-S-00650,2015-01-20-T-039,650,Lui Tuck Yew,"Given these generous discounts and the significant additional cost taxpayers and other commuters will have to foot, I am not sure we need or should move to completely free travel for our senior citizens at this time. We will, however, revisit this issue from time to time and continue to pay very close attention to fare affordability for vulnerable groups of Singaporeans, including senior citizens."
2015-01-20-T-040-S-00651,2015-01-20-T-040,651,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) for each year from 2012 to 2014, what is the number of public feedback received on the language abilities of bus captains, in particular, their ability to converse in English; and (b) for a legitimate feedback, what are the steps taken to rectify the problem."
2015-01-20-T-040-S-00652,2015-01-20-T-040,652,Lui Tuck Yew,"Over the past three years, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has received around 200 pieces of feedback relating to the language abilities of bus captains, most of which were on their ability to converse in English."
2015-01-20-T-040-S-00653,2015-01-20-T-040,653,Lui Tuck Yew,"Currently, all bus captains are required to demonstrate basic competency in conversational English before being deployed. Upon receiving a legitimate piece of feedback, LTA will inform the Public Transport Operators, who will send the bus captain for a refresher course. The bus captain will be redeployed only after passing a language test."
2015-01-20-T-041-S-00654,2015-01-20-T-041,654,K Karthikeyan,asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider increasing the current minimum annual leave entitlement of seven days under the Employment Act.
2015-01-20-T-041-S-00655,2015-01-20-T-041,655,Tan Chuan-Jin,"The Employment Act (EA) stipulates minimum labour standards to be complied with by all employers and so ought to be kept basic. Under the EA, an employee who has served an employer for at least three months is entitled to seven days of paid annual leave in the first year of service. Subsequently, for every year of service with the same employer, he is entitled to an additional one day’s paid annual leave, up to 14 days. However, employers are encouraged to consider more generous leave benefits as a strategy to attract good workers in this tight labour market."
2015-01-20-T-041-S-00656,2015-01-20-T-041,656,Tan Chuan-Jin,"A 2014 survey by the Ministry of Manpower showed that many companies already provide more days of annual leave than what is legislated. About half of the establishments2 provided more than the minimum seven days of annual leave for their rank-and-file employees, and 35% already provide 14 days or more."
2015-01-20-T-041-S-00657,2015-01-20-T-041,657,Tan Chuan-Jin,"Employees, who see that their organisations are more generous than just following the minimal provisions of the law to protect the most vulnerable, are likely to be more committed. A more motivated workforce can, in turn, benefit employers in terms of lower absenteeism, higher staff retention as well as better productivity."
2015-01-20-T-042-S-00658,2015-01-20-T-042,658,Christopher de Souza,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether the former Surrender Chamber in the old City Hall building will be restored to its former state when the renovations are completed and the National Gallery Singapore opens next year."
2015-01-20-T-042-S-00659,2015-01-20-T-042,659,Lawrence Wong,"The City Hall Chamber, commonly known to be the ""Surrender Chamber"", is being restored and will retain its original features when the National Gallery opens next year."
2015-01-20-T-042-S-00660,2015-01-20-T-042,660,Lawrence Wong,"Key elements, such as the timber flooring, chandeliers, wooden wall panelling and mezzanine viewing gallery, have been well-preserved. Subtle spot-lighting has been the only notable addition to the space."
2015-01-20-T-042-S-00661,2015-01-20-T-042,661,Lawrence Wong,"The Chamber is where the occupying Japanese forces surrendered on 12 September 1945. It also bore witness to two significant events in the history of modern Singapore – the swearing-in of Singapore’s first Prime Minister and Cabinet on 5 June 1959, and the inauguration of Singapore’s first Yang-di Pertuan Negara on 4 December 1959. The National Gallery Singapore will feature these and other significant historical events related to the building through information panels, guided tours and multimedia guides."
