2015-01-30-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,asked 	 the Minister for National Development why it is not made compulsory for all residential and commercial property owners to take up property fire insurance.,1,1,2015-01-30-T-001-S-00001
2015-01-30-T-001,Desmond Lee,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"Mdm Speaker, as with many other forms of insurance, fire insurance for properties is not mandated. It is the responsibility of property owners to ensure that they have the financial means to repair and restore their properties should these properties be damaged in a fire.",1,2,2015-01-30-T-001-S-00002
2015-01-30-T-001,Desmond Lee,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"Nevertheless, HDB home owners who take up HDB loans are required to purchase fire insurance from the HDB-appointed insurer. In addition, under the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act, Management Corporations are required to obtain insurance for strata-titled developments, so that they are able to undertake restoration work to the developments in the event of accidents such as a fire.",2,3,2015-01-30-T-001-S-00003
2015-01-30-T-001,Desmond Lee,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"Regardless, I encourage all owners to ensure that their properties are adequately insured against damages caused by unfortunate accidents such as a fire. It would be prudent to do so.",3,4,2015-01-30-T-001-S-00004
2015-01-30-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Mdm Speaker, I appreciate that HDB wants to give flexibility for property owners to decide on insurance coverage. In the unfortunate event of a fire, it is not only the owner but, sometimes, third parties are also involved. Relations can be strained because of claims or compensation, especially when the victims are not insured or adequately insured. Can I ask how is HDB encouraging property owners or flat owners to purchase fire insurance, what is the success rate and what is the proportion of flat owners who buy fire insurance even when they are not still servicing their housing loans?",1,5,2015-01-30-T-001-S-00005
2015-01-30-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mdm Speaker, in response to the Member's questions, more than 80% of HDB flats are covered by basic fire insurance that is offered by HDB's appointed insurer. We do not track the number of HDB flats covered by fire insurance that is offered by other insurers. So, the actual percentage would probably be much more than that.",1,6,2015-01-30-T-001-S-00006
2015-01-30-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Of those who have taken up HDB's basic fire insurance, certainly, more than half do so voluntarily and not because they are currently still servicing HDB loans. This is because HDB writes to and encourages them to apply for or renew their HDB basic fire insurance cover. But for those who are still on HDB loans, HDB will remind them when their policy is near expiry and if they for some reason forget or omit to do so, HDB will procure the insurance for them first and then recover the premiums later.",2,7,2015-01-30-T-001-S-00007
2015-01-30-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Premiums for HDB's basic fire insurance policy are very affordable. For instance, if you are an owner of a 4-room flat, coverage for five years would cost you $5.40 for five years; for a 5-room flat, $6.60 for five years.",3,8,2015-01-30-T-001-S-00008
2015-01-30-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"This basic fire insurance cost covers the basic building structure of the flat, the fixtures and the fittings provided by HDB, to keep these premiums low and affordable for all homeowners of HDB flats. If they wish to get additional coverage of costs, they may need to get further insurance for their personal properties as well as their renovations. I hope that adequately answers the Member's questions.",4,9,2015-01-30-T-001-S-00009

2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, ""That the Bill be now read a Second time.""",1,12,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00012
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Madam, in September 2012, MHA embarked on a review of our liquor control measures. The review was prompted by several factors. The Ministry had received considerable public feedback on law and order concerns and disamenities arising from liquor consumption and drunkenness in public places. These concerns were echoed in media reports, with businesses and members of the public voicing concerns about youths congregating and getting inebriated in public areas, creating noise and causing other disturbances.",2,13,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00013
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Several Members of this House had also raised similar concerns on behalf of their constituents. Residents in the heartlands were worried about people gathering and consuming liquor along pavements, at HDB void decks, parks, playgrounds and other community places and spaces. These individuals would often disrupt the peace and leave a trail of broken bottles and other litter. Sometimes, the drinking led to fights and disorderly conduct, compounding the sense of insecurity. These problems were exacerbated by the easy availability of takeaway liquor from nearby retail shops.",3,14,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00014
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Separately, the Police have also been monitoring incidents associated with the consumption of liquor. Last year, there were 47 cases of rioting linked to the consumption of liquor. ""Rioting"" is defined here in the law as groups of five or more persons engaging in fights and inflicting violence on others. In addition, there were about 100 cases of affray – meaning fewer than five but also involved in such public fights and there is a link to alcohol consumption. There were also 115 cases of serious hurt, which were also related to the consumption of liquor. These serious hurt cases include stabbing, cutting using dangerous weapons and inflicting severe bodily pain on victims. In other words, if I can put it a different way, on average, there was one rioting incident and two cases of serious hurt each week that was related to alcohol consumption. And the trend has been on the rise. The incidents occurred across the island, with nine out of 10 occurring after 10.30 pm.",4,15,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00015
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Lest there be any misconception – this is not attributable to any one nationality. And, indeed, I would say that the statistics speak for themselves. Generally, foreigners are not disproportionately represented in these statistics. Singaporeans and locals are also implicated in many of these incidents.",5,16,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00016
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Also, over the last three years, there was an average of 530 cases of persons found to be drunk and incapable in public places. And these numbers do not take into account the many cases of noise and other disturbances arising from liquor consumption, which are often unreported. Neither do they capture fully the inconveniences and sense of insecurity that affected residents had had to live with.",6,17,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00017
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Hence, there were widespread calls and compelling needs on the ground for MHA to consider proactive measures to restrict the supply and consumption of liquor in public places, in order to avert these significant disamenities caused to residents, and mitigate the risks to law and order.",7,18,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00018
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"As part of the review, MHA conducted extensive public consultations – specifically between October 2013 and August 2014 – and received about 400 pieces of written feedback from individuals and various organisations. The Ministry also engaged about 180 stakeholder groups, including members of public, grassroots representatives and industry groups. In general, they were unequivocal in their support for the introduction of measures to curb retail sale of liquor and its consumption in public places to keep their neighbourhoods safe and minimise the occurrence of fights, rowdiness and other disamenities.",8,19,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00019
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"The Little India riot occurred in December 2013, in the midst of this process. The Committee of Inquiry into the riot later concluded that liquor was ""a major contributory factor to the nature and escalation of the riot."" Shortly after the incident, MHA implemented measures approved by this House, under the Public Order (Additional Temporary Measures) Act, to restrict the supply of take-away liquor and its consumption in public places within the designated special zone in Little India. Notwithstanding some of the initial concerns that were expressed, the implementation has been without incident. Residents and stakeholders in Little India have generally welcomed the positive impact of these measures including a heightened sense of safety and orderliness and a significant reduction in disamenities.",9,20,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00020
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"MHA has also studied the practices in major cities in the United States, Australia and Europe. It is noteworthy that we have a rather liberal regime compared to major prominent cities around the world. Their liquor regulatory regimes vary, from those that impose a complete ban on the consumption of liquor in public areas, such as New York, Washington D.C, Gold Coast and Perth, to those that have strict controls in certain areas such as in Sydney, Austin and Paris. Our purpose in these studies was to understand how such curbs were implemented in such cities without diminishing their vibrancy or imposing undue constraints on their citizens.",10,21,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00021
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Madam, this Bill is the culmination of a deliberate two-year process that has been informed by the Police's operational assessment of the ground; widespread feedback and consultation; the experience of other jurisdictions, and, indeed, our own experience implementing similar measures in Little India. Its provisions address the demand and supply aspects in order to foster greater responsibility in the sale and consumption of alcohol. We sought a set of measures that is clear and consistent, easy to understand and comply with and causes minimal disruption to the usual legitimate activities of residents. Any curbs on the retail sales of liquor also had to take into account the impact on businesses.",11,22,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00022
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"The Bill also provides for a range of enforcement powers that enables the Police to take more calibrated action in circumstances that might pose a risk to public order. This measured and holistic approach is necessary and entails important trade-offs, because what this Bill proposes, in effect, is a transition from the current regime which has very few restrictions, to one which has carefully calibrated restrictions that allow most alcohol-related activities to carry on as usual, but places restrictions at those times when they are most likely to cause disamenities to others and in areas where there are law and order concerns. This proposed regime will set new norms of individual behaviour with respect to the purchase of takeaway liquor and consumption of liquor in public places, in order to reduce the disamenities and risks to public order inflicted on the wider community.",12,23,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00023
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Madam, the Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill will provide the legislative framework to regulate the supply and consumption of liquor in public places. It will also provide for enforcement powers to mitigate the risks of public disorder and disamenities arising from public drunkenness. It consolidates and enhances existing provisions in various pieces of legislation, and introduces new provisions.",13,24,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00024
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Madam, let me now highlight key clauses in the Bill.",14,25,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00025
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"One component of the Bill relates to provisions on the public consumption of liquor and public drunkenness. Under Clause 12, the Minister can prescribe ""no-public drinking periods"" during which the consumption of liquor in public places is not permitted. As announced earlier, MHA intends to disallow the consumption of liquor in public places from 10.30 pm to 7.00 am daily, with stricter hours in specified zones, specifically in Geylang and Little India. Exemptions from this restriction will be provided under clauses 12 and 13.",15,26,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00026
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Madam, some have suggested that rather than a general restriction, we should impose restrictions on specific problem areas. We did consider this approach but it poses several problems. First, liquor-related law and order issues and disamenities are not confined only to certain ""hot spots""; in fact, they occur in different parts of the island. Second, dividing up a typical area which has residential units, some common areas such as void decks, playgrounds and neighbourhood parks and some F&B and commercial outlets, into multiple finely delineated liquor control zones would lead to confusion and make compliance and enforcement more difficult. Third, the designation of special zones is likely to displace activity to neighbouring areas. Indeed, the Police have observed some evidence of this in areas adjacent to Little India. Potential trouble-makers could also play cat-and-mouse with enforcement officers by simply taking a step across the boundary.",16,27,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00027
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Also, the proposed restriction period of 10.30 pm to 7.00 am is intended to minimise the disruption to the usual activities of most residents. Individuals can continue to consume liquor in public places before 10.30 pm, except in the two specified zones. 10.30 pm is the closing time of most businesses in residential areas, and indeed, many close earlier. And it is also when most social and community activities, such as local celebrations, ""getai"" and grassroots events end.",17,28,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00028
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Individuals can continue to consume liquor at licensed premises, such as coffee shops, beer gardens, restaurants and bars, during their licensed hours, even if this is beyond 10.30 pm. So, there is no change.",18,29,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00029
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Members of the public attending an event in public places can also continue to consume liquor beyond 10.30 pm, if the organiser has obtained the requisite permit from Police as provided for under clauses 12 and 13. Where possible, the Police intend to streamline this process to obtain such permits.",19,30,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00030
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Let me now turn to clause 14 that deals with public drunkenness. Today, there are provisions under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act and the Penal Code to curb offensive behaviour, including being drunk and incapable of taking care of oneself and being drunk and creating public annoyance or disorder. These provisions will be transferred to the new legislation and they will attract similar penalties.",20,31,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00031
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"A person who is drunk and incapable is liable to a fine of $1,000, or an imprisonment term of one month, or both. The offence of drunk and creating public annoyance will result in a fine of up to $1,000, or imprisonment of six months, or both. And repeat offenders will face higher penalties. These are similar to the penalties under the current laws.",21,32,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00032
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"A definition of being ""drunk"" is also introduced under clause 14 to provide clarity on what Police take into consideration in assessing drunkenness. This, however, does not change the threshold that has to be met for an offence to be meted out.",22,33,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00033
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Under current laws, the Police only have the power of arrest to deal with these offences. And understandably, the Police exercise this power of arrest only in the most egregious cases. Consequently, residents, as well as Members of this House have often raised the point that Police do not seem to be able to act when Police turn up in response to residents' complaints and that the public drinking nuisance recurs when Police leave the scene. With the proposed Bill, the Police will be able to take a more calibrated set of enforcement measures based on the circumstances on the assessment of the situation. In particular, clauses 14, 21, 22 and 33 allow the Police to require information, require persons to dispose the liquor, issue orders to move on and leave the place and issue composition fines in lieu of prosecution.",23,34,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00034
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Under clauses 22 and 23, the Police can also inspect personal belongings and search places for liquor containers. These powers can only be exercised upon reasonable suspicion that an offence has been committed.",24,35,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00035
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"With this range of powers, the Police will be able to intervene early and more effectively with calibrated enforcement to deal with nuisance related to public consumption of alcohol and before drunken behaviour escalates into public disorder.",25,36,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00036
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Madam, another component of the Bill pertains to liquor licensing. The existing provisions on liquor licensing will be transferred from the Customs Act to the new law, and some changes made to the licensing framework.",26,37,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00037
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Clauses 4 to 7 provide for the regulation of the supply of liquor. Licensees are permitted to supply liquor only at premises and during trading hours specified in the licence. The Minister for Home Affairs will be empowered under the new law to prescribe trading hours that can override those specified in the licence. This effectively allows the Minister to prescribe shorter trading hours in areas that might pose a more significant risk of public disorder associated with the consumption of liquor. In line with the general restriction on the consumption of liquor in public places, the retail sale hours for take-away liquor will also be required to end at 10.30 pm. Requests for extension of sale hours beyond 10.30 pm will be considered on a case-by-case basis.",27,38,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00038
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"The regulatory functions that are currently vested with the Liquor Licensing Board will be vested in a Licensing Officer appointed by the Minister. Under clauses 8 and 9, the Licensing Officer is empowered to grant, renew, suspend or cancel liquor licences in accordance with the object of the law. The Licensing Officer may also impose or vary licensing conditions in his or her discretion, after giving the licensee an opportunity to be heard. The Liquor Licensing Board will be renamed the Liquor Appeal Board as it will continue to hear appeals. This delineation of roles and responsibilities will ensure clear accountability.",28,39,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00039
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Clause 10 provides the basic powers of entry and search to allow enforcement officers to conduct checks on premises to ensure that the law is being complied with. In addition, in the event that there is a significant threat to public safety, order or peace, or if an offence involving violence is suspected to have been committed on the premises, the Commissioner of Police can, under clause 11, order the closure of the premises for up to 72 hours. He can order the licensee to take certain measures to mitigate the risks, and to vary the licence or suspend the licence until the significant threat or risk no longer exists or the remedial measures have been taken. This allows the Police to take swift action to mitigate many serious threats to public order.",29,40,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00040
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"The penalties for offences related to liquor licensing under clauses 5 to 7 will be enhanced from a maximum fine of $5,000 to $10,000. Clause 4 increases the penalty for the more egregious offence of unlicensed supply of liquor to a maximum fine of $20,000, with an imprisonment term of up to six months for repeat offenders.",30,41,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00041
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Madam, let me now elaborate on the Liquor Control Zones. In areas where there is a heightened risk of public disorder associated with liquor consumption, more stringent measures will be imposed to mitigate the risks. Clause 15 empowers the Minister to designate such areas as Liquor Control Zones.",31,42,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00042
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"As I explained earlier, based on Police's current operational assessment, there is, in general, a material number of cases or incidents of serious crimes or incidents involved with liquor consumption. And there is a disproportionate number of law and order incidents in Little India and Geylang that are associated with liquor consumption. The regular and large congregations of people, both local and foreign, in these areas exacerbate the risk.",32,43,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00043
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"To illustrate, about one-fifth of all rioting cases island-wide occur in Geylang and Little India. About 10% of serious hurt cases were in Geylang and Little India. Also, 40% to 50% of serious incidents in Geylang and Little India are linked to liquor consumption; and that is about twice the national average.",33,44,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00044
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Hence, under the proposed Bill, specified areas in Little India and Geylang will be designated as Liquor Control Zones. Stricter restrictions on the hours for the supply and consumption of liquor, similar to those applied in Little India under the Public Order (Additional Temporary Measures) Act, will be implemented in these zones.",34,45,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00045
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Clauses 16 to 20 provide for enhanced measures and penalties for offences committed within the Liquor Control Zones, commensurate with the higher risk. Liquor-related offences committed within the zones will result in a penalty of one and a half times that in non-designated areas. The Commissioner of Police will also be empowered to require a person to cease business activities in a Liquor Control Zone if he is found to have repeatedly supplied liquor without a valid licence from his premises. This prevents businesses from continuing to circumvent regulation and supplying liquor freely within the zones.",35,46,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00046
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),The Commissioner of Police or authorised officers will also be empowered under clauses 18 and 19 to issue a banning notice to an individual if he has committed a liquor-related offence in the zone and is assessed to likely to commit it again and cause public disorder. The banning notice will prohibit him from returning to the Liquor Control Zone for a period not exceeding 30 days. This measure is intended to be used in egregious cases. The Police will also be empowered under clause 20 to refuse entry or remove a subject from a Liquor Control Zone for up to 24 hours if he does not comply with Police's orders or has committed offences related to liquor consumption or intoxication.,36,47,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00047

2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Madam, to conclude, Singapore is a compact and densely populated city with mixed land use and development as well as residential and commercial areas that flow into each other and are in close proximity. Residents in many areas want a more peaceful and orderly living environment, especially at night, even on weekends, when they and their families want to rest. In particular, the adverse effects of public drunkenness and the associated disorder and disamenities, are keenly felt by residents in many quarters.",40,51,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00051

All the arguments made will likely be rehashed in this House today. But once we drill down to the details, the conclusion is clear  everyone wants the same thing. We all want peace and quiet at night where we live. We all do not want the problems associated with irresponsible drinking, including the noise, the littering and the risk of bad or criminal behaviour. At the same time, we also want the freedom to relax and drink responsibly, whether in private or public.",1,54,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00054
2015-01-30-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The real question for this House, therefore, is this  can we draft a law or pass a law which meets all these interests? Is there a sweet spot in the middle? And if we cannot – and this is the real test – which side should the law lean in favour of and are there any ways to mitigate the effects on the other side? In this case, where both sides have reasonable and legitimate concerns, it is not enough to say you agree or disagree with the law. You need to say how you propose to address the real concerns of the other side.",2,55,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00055
2015-01-30-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"To deal with whether the Bill strikes that right balance, there are a number of questions we need to tackle.",3,56,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00056
2015-01-30-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"First, if the concern is about alcohol-fuelled misconduct, are our current laws not already sufficient? And the answer is no. Our laws criminalise some types of behaviour. For example, it is an offence for someone to be drunk and incapable of taking care of himself in a public place – section 18 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act. It is also an offence for an intoxicated person to appear in a public place and cause annoyance to any person and that is section 510 of the Penal Code.",4,57,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00057
2015-01-30-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"On paper, these appear adequate. But in reality, these do not go far enough. Take, for instance, the complaint of – and I am sure, many of us in this House often hear – people gathering, drinking and making noise late at night at void decks or nearby sitting areas. The resident is disturbed from his rest. He bears the burden of calling the Police. The Police take time to respond as this is not an emergency situation. And when the Police arrive, they have very little power to do anything if the people are not intoxicated, because there is a difference between being high and loud on alcohol and being so drunk as to be incapable of taking care of oneself, or at least I am told.",5,58,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00058
2015-01-30-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The Police have no power to tell them to leave and even if they could, the drinkers will just end up in another part of the neighbourhood. So, the Police advise them to tone it down, they agree and then they start up once again when the patrol car turns a corner, or they return again another night. The game plays itself out time and again. So, who suffers? The residents. Why should they have to put up with this? And do we really want vital Police resources to be taken up to deal with such issues?",6,59,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00059
2015-01-30-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The second question  is this such a big problem? Some commentators have asked the Ministry to provide statistics. And if they are available, they should be shared. But realistically, I would be surprised if the data is meaningful precisely because many of these incidents, like the example I gave, do not involve criminal behaviour. And not everyone who is affected will call the Police. But I have received enough such complaints on my walkabouts and block visits about the ruckus caused by drinkers who gather at void decks or nearby benches to know that this is a real issue. Apart from the noise, residents are worried for the safety of their family members when coming home late. They are also angry about the trash that is left behind. Besides, the problem is particularly acute for families who live near popular gathering spots. So, the numbers are not going to tell the whole story or convey the real suffering these families put up with. In short, we cannot dismiss this as a fictitious problem or one that affects only a handful. Our residents have legitimate concerns that we should address.",7,60,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00060
2015-01-30-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Third, can we not just give the Police more enforcement powers? The answer is we can, but that will not solve the problem. Residents will still have to call the Police when disturbed. And unless we expect the Police to arrest everyone who makes noise, it is simply not practical. Besides, who gets to define what is a disturbance, and if it is vague, how are the Police going to do their job? The Bill improves the current position as it makes enforcement simpler and clearer.",8,61,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00061
2015-01-30-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"To put it another way, an offence framed in terms of consumption is better because it is difficult to draft an effective law in terms of conduct. But more importantly, with this law, I expect that there will be fewer incidents of people drinking past 10.30 pm in public places and, therefore, far fewer incidents of residents being disturbed.",9,62,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00062
2015-01-30-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The fourth question  does this law curb personal liberties? Of course, it does. People will no longer have the freedom to drink in public places or to buy takeaway alcohol past 10.30 pm. But let us put things in perspective. The right to drink wherever you want and whenever you want is not a fundamental liberty. We have prohibitions against other types of behaviour where the public interest is affected. Smoking in public, for example, is heavily restricted and many people are glad for it. In the case of drinking, there is indisputably a public interest in ensuring that residents are not disturbed in their own homes.",10,63,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00063
2015-01-30-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The Bill does not make us unique. Many jurisdictions have adopted partial restrictions comparable to these. London has Controlled Drinking Zones where police can request people to stop drinking alcohol and ask them to surrender their drink. In Adelaide, areas such as the CBD and parklands have been designated alcohol-free zones. Even in Rome, the Eternal City, public consumption of alcohol from glass bottles is banned from 10.00 pm to 7.00 am. And for all other alcohol, the ban begins at midnight. Some jurisdictions have even gone further  in New York City, Ontario, Oslo and Perth, public alcohol consumption is banned at all times.",11,64,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00064
2015-01-30-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I cite these examples not to say that we should copy others, but simply to suggest that the argument that the Bill makes Singapore different or gives Singaporeans less rights is inaccurate.",12,65,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00065
2015-01-30-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"More importantly, drinkers have options that residents do not. The Bill does not stop people from drinking in coffee shops, restaurants, bars, clubs, private homes and at licensed events even after 10.30 pm. While those who wish to drink have alternatives, residents who are disturbed do not. What about their right and liberty to peaceful and safe surroundings?",13,66,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00066
2015-01-30-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Fifth, if the concern is about residential areas, can we not confine the new restrictions to those areas alone? In fact, that was my first reaction when I heard about the Bill.",14,67,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00067
2015-01-30-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The problem then, I think, becomes one of legal definition. It is easy to say ""non-residential areas"", but that is very difficult to define, to rationalise and to enforce. This is important because there is no point having a law if people do not know where the prohibited areas are or how it will be enforced. It is easy to take out a map and circle areas which appear far enough from residential areas. But how do you reflect this on the ground? And you will have the absurd situation where the length of one foot step or the length of one stride is the difference between lawful and unlawful behaviour. And to paraphrase Charles Dickens – the law should not be an ass.",15,68,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00068
2015-01-30-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"So, it is clear that it is difficult to find the sweet spot and that the balance has to lean to one side. I am in favour of leaning it on the side of folks who are affected by bad behaviour. But that should not be the end of the matter. We should also make sure that we do not make things difficult for people who drink responsibly. That should be in the way the law is implemented.",16,69,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00069
2015-01-30-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"First, in the application for a permit. For example, take a person who is now required to get a liquor consumption permit to drink past 10.30 pm at, say, a BBQ event at East Coast. He should be allowed to ask for that permit as part of the application for the BBQ pit itself. In other words, make it as simple and as painless as possible, without involving multiple steps – perhaps an additional box to tick in the online application with no extra charge.",17,70,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00070
2015-01-30-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),The same spirit should underlie enforcement measures. The Police should exercise leniency where the drinking occurs in areas far away from residential areas and where there is no unruly behaviour.,18,71,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00071
2015-01-30-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The Ministry has, in fact, sought to reassure the public that the Police will exercise their discretion in a tempered manner. That being the case, I would like to ask the Minister  will the application process for a permit be made simple and how will it be made simple and what guidance will officers be given in respect of the enforcement of the law?",19,72,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00072
2015-01-30-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Next, a point on resources. Police officers, but not auxiliary police officers, have powers of arrest under section 30 of the Bill. Given this difference in powers, I would like to ask the Minister  will more police officers be deployed in the liquor control zones given that these have been designated areas with higher risks? Further, now that we have two zones, do we have sufficient resources to meet our needs?",20,73,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00073
2015-01-30-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Finally, if I have one criticism of this Bill, it is that, it unnecessarily, I think, singles out foreign workers. While the rest of us will not be allowed to drink in public places past 10.30 pm, we are free to drink in our homes. But that same consideration does not apply to foreign workers. Section 38(5) designates foreign worker dormitories as a public place for the purposes of section 14(1).",21,74,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00074
2015-01-30-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The concern I believe is that since foreign workers can no longer drink in public, they will go back to their dormitories to drink. That may be so, but unless there is good evidence that this will cause problems – and I hope that the Minister will tell us what that evidence is – there is no reason to single them out.",22,75,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00075
2015-01-30-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),I think it sends the wrong message and it may feed certain perceptions and I hope the Minister will reconsider this provision. The concern could perhaps have been addressed in enacting appropriate rules and regulations governing the use and residence in foreign worker dormitories.,23,76,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00076
2015-01-30-T-002,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"To conclude, I support the Bill as it is an attempt to find a fair and reasonable compromise between several legitimate but conflicting interests. Those who oppose it should say how they will look after the interests of the other side. But from a practical point of view, these laws are logical and effective, provided they are implemented in a sensible manner. With that, Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.",24,77,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00077
2015-01-30-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the Liquor Control Bill. It is high time that Singapore institute laws that govern the supply and consumption of liquor. These proposed measures are a response to complaints from the public about disamenities and concerns about law and order resulting from excessive alcohol consumption and drunkenness in public places.",1,78,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00078
2015-01-30-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Apart from this, there are other reasons to be worried about from excessive alcohol consumption  alcohol is a psychoactive substance and an addictive drug, and its misuse is associated with a wide range of adverse health effects that may cause harm to the individual, his family and society.",2,79,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00079
2015-01-30-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Madam, liquor laws exist in many countries across the world; some for a very long time. Many of the most vibrant global cities, including New York, London and Sydney, have laws in place to restrict alcohol consumption – these range from a total ban on open containers of alcohol in public places to controlled liquor zones. Alcohol restrictions have not adversely impacted the vibrancy of these cities in any way – rather, they have helped to keep these cities safer and cleaner.",3,80,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00080

In both phases of the public consultation exercise, more than 80% of the respondents were supportive of the proposal to restrict the consumption of liquor in public places. A survey conducted in my own constituency involving 120 residents resulted in similar findings. A recent survey commissioned by the Government feedback unit REACH found that 81% of the respondents polled were in favour of the Bill.",4,81,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00081

For these individuals, perhaps the Government could consider designating specific ""public places"" to be ""coolspots"", where people can gather to drink beyond 10.30 pm, as long as they do not cause disamenities to others and measures are in place to address the safety and security concerns.",5,82,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00082

2015-01-30-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Madam, I am all for restrictions in alcohol consumption in public places. However, there are different approaches to implementing these restrictions and we should choose one that is targeted, calibrated and best serves our needs. This Bill before us proposes an island-wide ban on consuming alcohol in public places after 10.30 pm – this might be excessive in unaffected areas in Singapore, but might be inadequate for hotspots known for drinking-related problems, but not zoned as Liquor Control Zones.",7,84,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00084
2015-01-30-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"As the Minister explained, by imposing an island-wide ban, the authorities avoid shifting the problem from one area to another, as drinkers can simply move away from a Liquor Control Zone to an area without restrictions, drink excessively and cause problems there.",8,85,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00085
2015-01-30-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"However, as most people in Singapore enjoy alcohol in a moderate and responsible manner, we should consider targeting restrictions only at problematic hotspots, where large groups of people congregate to drink alcohol and where they have earned a reputation for public disamenities, resident complaints or risks to law and order. We could start rolling out restrictions in these vulnerable areas and widen coverage as and when other areas are red-flagged. Clause 12(2) in the Bill has made a provision for the Minister to prescribe different no-public drinking periods for different public places.",9,86,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00086
2015-01-30-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Madam, this approach would help manage our law enforcement resources, as officers focus their efforts on hotspots and do a thorough job there. Such a consideration is especially important, given our limited pool of law enforcement officers, who also have to cope with other Home Team initiatives, such as Community Policing and the Safer Roads Singapore programme. An islandwide ban would spread our law enforcement resources thinly across Singapore to guard against all areas, instead of concentrating them effectively where they are needed most.",10,87,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00087
2015-01-30-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"At this point, I would like to ask the Minister the basis on which Little India and Geylang were marked as Liquor Control Zones. What specific criteria and threshold are used to identify them? How can vulnerable areas like Teban Gardens in my division receive a higher degree of protection from problems associated with drinking in public places, particularly if the problems persist in spite of the new laws? At some places at Teban Gardens, foreign workers gather to drink at around 8.00 pm, especially during weekends and public holidays, with the full impact of disamenities, such as littering, noise, vomiting and drunkenness, can be felt well before 10.30 pm.",11,88,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00088
2015-01-30-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Madam, there is clear evidence linking the availability of alcohol and problems relating to drinking.

This will help to focus the licensees on compliance and encourage them to play an active role in promoting responsible drinking.",14,91,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00091
2015-01-30-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Madam, this Bill does not deal with the issue of alcohol advertising and promotion. I am not proposing that we ban particular modes of marketing, but rather that all marketing of alcohol be undertaken in a responsible manner and encourage responsible drinking amongst its customers. Messages contained in alcohol advertisements play an important role in influencing social attitudes about alcohol consumption. It is, therefore, important for the alcohol industry, alcohol retailers and producers to apply a clear set of principles in the promotion, marketing and selling of their products, to encourage responsible drinking.",15,92,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00092

One day after the First Reading of the Bill in Parliament, 78% of 9,000 Straits Times readers who participated in the poll disagreed with the proposed Bill.

This is borne out of the lived experience of many residents in various HDB estates. However, greater policy clarity is required for certain public areas like hawker centres which may not be situated in residential areas and where the liquor consumption rules can be made subject to greater flexibility. For example, it is understood that liquor sale and consumption in places like coffee shops would be subject to liquor licensing conditions and customers will be allowed to consume alcohol within these premises beyond the 10.30 pm guidelines, depending on the conditions of the respective licence.",9,105,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00105
2015-01-30-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"However, it is unclear whether a similar licensing philosophy can be extended to hawker centres where customers drink liquor, purchased from stalls within their premises where patrons could, for example, be allowed to continue consuming liquor till midnight. In this context, I ask if the Ministry can consider allowing the consumption of liquor at hawker centres, akin to the licensing framework similar to that applied in the case of coffee shops.",10,106,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00106
2015-01-30-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Similarly, a more liberal liquor consumption regime should also be considered at places away from residential areas, like East Coast Park. Such a regime would also address the real concerns of the unnecessary atmosphere of control, prejudicing and targeting the majority of Singaporeans, who, I would argue, drink responsibly. It would also obviate the need for permits that add an administrative burden not just for the Police but for the public as well.",11,107,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00107
2015-01-30-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Secondly, the Workers' Party is of the view that the blanket ban covering the retail sale of alcohol up to 10.30 pm may be too interventionist and too strong a measure, one that operates to underestimate and may even undermine the capacity of Singaporeans to engage in responsible behaviour, as alluded to earlier.",12,108,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00108
2015-01-30-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Workers' Party proposes that the retail sale of alcohol be allowed to continue as long as an individual does not consume the purchased alcohol in a prospectively disallowed public area, as it is foreseeable that such purchases may be for private consumption, rather than at bars and clubs where alcohol is usually more expensive to purchase.",13,109,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00109
2015-01-30-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"It follows that the operational implementation of the new liquor control measures should not be applied bluntly, painting every liquor retailer with the same brush. A flexible licensing regime can be accommodated, as licensing officers are empowered with extensive powers to add or remove conditions from retail licences. This is conceivable in cases where community feedback, for example, determines that a certain retail outlet should stop the retail sale of liquor after a certain point and depending on the individual case, even before 10.30 pm, if necessary. Such a regime puts self-regulation and community engagement in as a first step before regulation kicks in. It is also likely to be fairer in principle and more calibrated in application.",14,110,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00110
2015-01-30-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, my colleagues will share with the House, perspectives on Police enforcement of the measures proposed, amongst other points relevant to the Bill.",15,111,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00111
2015-01-30-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To recap, while the Workers' Party agrees with the principle of the Bill, we are of the view that the regulations proposed by the Bill need to be scoped more finely to better balance and to reflect the public interest.",16,112,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00112
2015-01-30-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Mdm Speaker, I speak in support of this Bill. I first learnt about the problems related to the public consumption of alcohol very early on in my stint as a Member of Parliament. As soon as I did a block visit near one of the local shops, I was told, ""You have to stop liquor in this coffee shop. People drink beyond the hours. They make a lot of noise. We cannot sleep. It is even worse at about two, three o'clock. There are no toilets and they urinate at the void deck"". This is a perennial problem. It continues. There are probably one or two tables of people at most who drink beyond the coffee shop hours, but they create disamenities for the entire three or four blocks that are in that vicinity. The Police are called every now and then and that creates the ""cat and mouse game"" that some Members mentioned earlier. They disappear for awhile and they come back later.",1,113,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00113
2015-01-30-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"In that sense, this Bill addresses a very real concern for many residents in the heartlands. It also addresses concerns for residents who live near the so-called hot spots, the party areas. Many people were saying that areas like Clarke Quay and so on should be permitted to be designated party areas. But my understanding is, the local hon Member, there was probably one of the first to crusade against the sale of alcohol to the public in Clarke Quay because of the public order issues. So, I believe that even in the so-called party areas, there is a necessity to limit unruly behaviour and public consumption of alcohol.",2,114,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00114
2015-01-30-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"When this Bill first came up, I was quite happily in support of it. Of course, as soon as the Bill was announced, the immediate reaction perhaps from the more vocal group was quite different. Some of my colleagues came up to me and said ""So, do you support the anti-alcohol Bill?"" I answered, ""Anti-alcohol Bill – what does that exactly mean?"" Actually, we were talking about this Bill. Well, I said, ""I support the Bill. I do not quite think it is an anti-alcohol Bill"". So, then they said, ""Do you drink?"" ""Yes, I do, but not in public and not after 10.30 pm in open areas."" When you ask the next question to many of them, ""Do you actually drink on the bridge, drink at the void deck?"" They would say, ""No, actually we do not, but our right to do so has been taken away."" And they were quite indignant.",3,115,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00115
2015-01-30-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The reality is that when you talk to people more and you explain to them the issues that arise and how other people suffer as a result of it, many people start to understand why this Bill was necessary. Everyone wears two hats  one hat is of them as a resident, and the other hat is of them as a free-spirited person who likes to do what they will. And sometimes, the two are inconsistent.",4,116,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00116
2015-01-30-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"If you look at how this Bill balances things, I think it strikes the right balance. There is no one answer. You cannot have a perfect solution to deal with the two competing tendencies. On the one hand, people want the freedom to drink; on the other, people want the right to have a quiet and peaceful life at home. This Bill does do a good job in striking the right balance.",5,117,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00117
2015-01-30-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Let me talk about the components of what I mean is the right balance. This Bill could have taken many different forms. In countries like Australia and the US, in many parts of those countries, there is a complete ban on public consumption of alcohol. In many parts of the US, you cannot even have an open bottle of alcohol on the street. That is one extreme that you could go to. We did not go that far. We only stopped the public consumption of alcohol between specific times – between 10.30 pm and 7.00 am. And this is flexible. The Minister has the flexibility to amend those times, if necessary, at a later stage. So, we certainly did not go to the most extreme measure of banning public consumption of alcohol.",6,118,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00118
2015-01-30-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I also think it plays an important part in allowing intervention before problems get serious. Right now, the current legislative framework allows you to intervene only when things go seriously wrong, if there is a public order issue, say a fight starts or there is affray or violence. Or, in the other extreme, where the person is incapable of taking care of himself after getting drunk. But there is nothing that allows you to intervene before we get there. So, you can have people getting very drunk in public areas, making some noise but not exactly committing an offence. That is when you have the problem with the Police coming by but not being able to do very much.",7,119,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00119
2015-01-30-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"At least, with this Bill, you are giving intermediate power for the authorities to step in and prevent problems from getting that bad. That, I think, is an important part of striking the right balance, too.",8,120,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00120
2015-01-30-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The third aspect that I think is very important is the flexibility to designate special zones. Clearly, you cannot treat every area as the same. In some areas, the problems are greater than others. Where the problems are greater, it makes sense to have greater restrictions.",9,121,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00121
2015-01-30-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"At the moment, I understand the special zones that will be designated are Little India and Geylang and this is largely a result of the figures based on the public order issues there. Having experienced the Little India riot, I think everyone here would not disagree that Little India is definitely an area that needs special care.",10,122,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00122
2015-01-30-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I also understand that the figures of public order issues in Geylang are quite serious. We definitely do not want another issue like that there. Certainly, the legislation is flexible enough for more special zones to be designated. In that sense, this legislation framework, I think, is broad and flexible enough for us to expand, if necessary, or even cut back, if necessary. If an area gets safer and there are less concerns, it may no longer need to be designated as a special zone.",11,123,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00123
2015-01-30-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"One other aspect of this Bill that is quite interesting is that the Police have gradated powers of intervention. So, it is not envisioned that the first thing the Police would do is to go round and arrest someone for being caught with an opened bottle, as I think some scare-mongers were spreading. What they would probably do in the first instance is to tell people that they should move somewhere else, move back home and that power is within the framework. If the person does not listen, then the Police have escalated powers. These powers are a step-up provision and it is something that allows the Police to have some teeth but also give them the flexibility not to have to wield too heavy a stick. In that sense, I think this is quite an interesting component of the Bill that gives enough flexibility for the enforcement authorities to do what they feel it is necessary in a particular situation.",12,124,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00124
2015-01-30-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Like Mr Hri Kumar, I also share the concern about whether or not Police resources will be adequate to deal with this. I envision there will be a lot more complaints, at least when this Bill first comes about. And given the additional powers, there will probably be an expectation from residents that the Police will intervene. There might be expectations that the Police will have to come down very quickly to deal the issues relating to public consumption of alcohol.",13,125,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00125
2015-01-30-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I expect this concern to get better with time. As the public understands the new rules, behaviour normally changes. This is what has happened in places like Australia and the United States. And once behaviour changes, I do not think there will be a need for an extended period of policing. But at least in the initial stage, I expect the Police will get a lot more complaints on this front.",14,126,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00126
2015-01-30-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I have a few questions for the Minister as well. The first is, at the moment, with the designation of special zones, I understand the main concern with public order-related issues and Geylang and Little India have been designated as the main ones. But are there any other zones that the Minister thinks we should be keeping a look out for, based on these public order statistics? Anecdotally, different people have mentioned different names. I will not mention any here but I am just curious whether or not there is a range of places that have been monitored and whether others may also be designated based on these public order concerns.",15,127,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00127
2015-01-30-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The second is whether the Minister might consider a slightly more flexible framework in the future. Some areas of flexibility include longer hours in areas that are further away from residential areas. One area that has been mentioned quite commonly is the beaches or, at the very least, the barbecue pits at beaches.",16,128,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00128
2015-01-30-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I can understand why the Minister would not want to designate this as purely an area where drink is allowed at all times, just in case that becomes a congregation area for anyone who wants to drink, including foreign workers and everyone else. But I can see a fair argument in favour of maybe slightly longer hours, say, at the barbecue pits at East Coast Park, up to midnight or something, because that is quite far away from the public and that is the place where people ordinarily gather to have drinks and parties. This could even be tied up to, say, the booking of the barbecue pits, if you want to restrict it even more. But I think there is some merit to having a slightly more flexible framework going forward.",17,129,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00129
2015-01-30-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Broadly speaking though, I think this is a very good Bill, it solves very real problems we have. It strikes the right balance in not being too heavy-handed in approach while, at the same time, doing the minimum necessary to deal with the problem of public consumption of alcohol. With that, I support this Bill.",18,130,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00130
2015-01-30-T-002,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Mdm Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate. This Bill is the result of a one-year long public consultation by MHA to counter problems caused by public drinking. Eighty percent had supported a partial ban on alcohol consumption and sales. I, too, support a partial ban and find the Bill's current form overly restrictive. In fact, according to a recent Straits Times online poll, over 75% of the 12,000 participants indicated that they did not support the Bill. The main concerns were ""over-regulation and discriminatory practices"".",1,131,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00131
2015-01-30-T-002,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"However, 81% of a recent REACH survey involving 1,145 respondents supported the Bill. As these are randomly selected Singaporeans and Permanent Residents and data had been weighted to ensure it represented the demographics of Singapore, it does show that the majority of the general public is supportive of such a law. However, most netizens have painted a different picture. Just on my own social media pages, I have received comments, such as ""This law is silly"", ""Singapore is again a nanny state, with a drinking curfew"", ""It is nice to know that the Government wants to take care of us but please do not treat us as small kids"". Is this merely a difference between online and offline comments and maybe, between younger and older members of the public?",2,132,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00132
2015-01-30-T-002,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"So, I do not think that these people who find the law restrictive are frequent or even regular drinkers, but they feel that if Singapore wants to be a mature society, this measure is regressive, drastic and unnecessary.",3,133,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00133
2015-01-30-T-002,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"While I have no issue with stopping retail alcohol sales at 10.30 pm, I do not think that it is necessary to ban alcohol consumption in all public areas from 10.30 pm to 7.00 am. Generally, most drinkers here are responsible. Singaporeans do not have a drinking problem. To deal with the minority who create trouble, the Bill is taking pre-emptive measures several steps upstream. If one drinks in public after 10.30 pm, one might get drunk, hence, one might end up with undesirable anti-social behaviour, therefore, no public drinking after 10.30 pm. Perhaps, the solution is not a ban but an increase in our efforts in public education. The focus should also be on managing the law breakers instead of imposing a blanket ban. Or we could reduce the number of retail stores that could sell alcohol, especially in residential areas.",4,134,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00134
2015-01-30-T-002,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"So, while the good intent of this Bill is clear, it, unfortunately, sends a dampening message. Therefore, Madam, I would like to make a suggestion. Instead of a nationwide ban, we could increase the number of Liquor Control Zones. In addition to Little India and Geylang, other areas may include Clarke Quay, Boat Quay, Chinatown, Golden Mile Complex and locations with existing problems of frequent public nuisances due to drinking. The law could empower the Minister to designate additional areas as Liquor Control Zones, as and when necessary.",5,135,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00135
2015-01-30-T-002,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"We hear the problem of displacement. So, therefore, the Ministry may consider increasing the buffer zone by between 500 m and 1 km. The Little India Liquor Control Zone has a well-delineated border surrounded by commercial and Government buildings which contains potential displacement. For example, a 500-m buffer zone around Little India would cover areas up to Orchard Road, Kallang Road, Boon Keng Road and the CTE. It is unlikely that people who frequent Little India for the shops, services and activities would spill over to these areas just to drink in public. The Geylang Zone, however, may benefit from an enlarged buffer zone in the north and south as there are a number of residences beyond Sims Avenue and Guillemard Road.",6,136,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00136
2015-01-30-T-002,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"I would also request that the Ministry ensure that approval for extended hours of drinking at social activities, such as barbecue parties, be simple and easy to obtain. Regulations should spell out clearly under what circumstances an application would be rejected. It should also be made clear what constitutes a public place. For example, are chalets public or private places? Now, Madam, I would like to continue my speech in Mandarin.",7,137,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00137
2015-01-30-T-002,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.]  Mdm Speaker, drinking can put you in a happy mood but it can also make you lose self-control. So, the aim of this Bill is to control the latter, not the former. Some people take to drinking to forget their sorrows but they get even more sorrowful. We also do not want people to live a befuddled life, getting drunk whenever alcohol is available or to be emboldened by alcohol to commit dangerous acts. To have a few drinks, get slightly tipsy but still in full control of oneself is a good way to be relaxed and to enjoy life.",8,138,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00138
2015-01-30-T-002,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"In modern city living, the pace of life is fast and, after a long week of work, on a Friday or weekend night, you would want to relax. But after 1 April, after 10.30 pm, you can only do so in licensed coffee shops, restaurants and bars. Some low-income people may not be able to afford this. Of course, you can drink at home, but you must buy the alcohol before 10.30 pm.",9,139,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00139
2015-01-30-T-002,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"What I am more concerned about is the impact on some of the Chinese traditions, such as the Seventh Month dinners. Currently, when organisations, such as temples, community or commercial groups, apply for a permit, they have to agree to end their activities by 10.30 pm. However, there would usually be auction of items at such events; people can get enthusiastic and it would overrun past 10.30 pm sometimes. The organisers will tone down the volume after 10 30 pm so that it will not disturb the nearby residents. People are generally tolerant of this.",10,140,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00140
2015-01-30-T-002,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Public areas with tentage are also considered a public space. I would like to ask the Minister, upon reaching 10.30 pm, do they have to clear or pour all the alcohol on the tables? Or is it considered not an offence as long as they do not drink alcohol?",11,141,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00141
2015-01-30-T-002,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"It is easy to simply turn the knobs on the sound system but not so easy to clear glasses on dozens, or even hundreds of tables quickly. Can they apply to drink after 10.30 pm? What documents are required – the number of people, their names, the type and quantity of the alcohol? How long beforehand do they have to apply and how long will the authorities take to make a decision?",12,142,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00142
2015-01-30-T-002,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Four months after the new Bill comes into effect will be the Seventh Month of the lunar calendar. So, I hope the Ministry would provide the detailed information as early as possible so that people can get ready in good time. Mdm Speaker, I support this Bill.",13,143,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00143
2015-01-30-T-002,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, fellow Members, good afternoon. Firstly, I would like to declare that I am the President of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry.",1,144,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00144
2015-01-30-T-002,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"I support the Bill. From the feedback that I have gathered from those in the business community, their reaction has generally been positive. Businesses, including the most affected ones, such as the mini-marts, share the same concerns as the Government about public order, safety and anti-social behaviour arising from public drinking. The coffee shop operators are also relieved that the Government did not shorten the hours stated on their existing liquor licences and recognised that they need to smartly manage their operations on the ground in order to comply with the law. However, having said this, we hope the Government can find a balance between achieving public security, being pro-business and maintaining Singapore's tourism appeal.",2,145,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00145
2015-01-30-T-002,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),Please now allow me to elaborate on my speech in Mandarin.,3,146,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00146
2015-01-30-T-002,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.]  Mdm Speaker, last week, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI) invited the trade associations affected by the Bill to a closed-door dialogue to understand their views on the proposed Bill, especially the challenges that SMEs will face after the Bill comes into effect. Earlier on, in English, I have briefly shared the main content of the meeting.",4,147,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00147
2015-01-30-T-002,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"At the dialogue, the trade associations' representatives talked about four main points.",5,148,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00148
2015-01-30-T-002,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"First, can the licences which have been revoked be reinstated? In the past year or so, the liquor licences of about 40 coffee shops in Geylang have been revoked and the reason is because they have contravened the regulations. Inspectors have found people drinking in their premises outside the hours stipulated on their licences. Because their liquor licences have been revoked, their business is down by 20% to 30% and they do not know whether they are going to get their licence back eventually, or it has been permanently revoked. These businesses hope that the Government can give them a clear answer so that they can adjust their businesses if necessary.",6,149,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00149
2015-01-30-T-002,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"Second, our members suggested introducing a demerit point system. If they really contravene the regulations, we suggest that the inspector issue a written warning upon the first violation, instead of the current practice of informing the business only when their licence is about to be revoked. The businesses hope that with this demerit point system, they will have a point deducted for each offence and at each offence a written warning will be given. When all the points have been deducted, then the licence will be revoked. This measure will have a strong warning effect to the businesses, reminding them not to contravene the regulations. The consequences can also be seen clearly. Compared to the current practice, the demerit point system is more transparent and will help the operators to exercise self-discipline.",7,150,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00150
2015-01-30-T-002,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"Third, deal with drinkers who have contravened the rules. Of course, the business operators have to comply with the laws strictly, but the drinkers who have repeatedly violated the rules should also be severely dealt with. Hence, the businesses hope that the Government will use different channels to educate the public on the Bill. From past experiences, although the operators have reminded their customers to buy and consume their liquor before midnight, there are still some customers who refuse to listen to them. If the inspector happens to turn up at this time, it will be the business operator who will get into trouble.",8,151,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00151
2015-01-30-T-002,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"Fourth, maintain Singapore tourism's vibrancy. Singapore is a global metropolis. There are many flights to and from Singapore and tourists arrive round the clock. When the new Bill comes into effect, no drinking will be allowed at public places after 10.30 pm, which aims to reduce the potential threat to public order. Many of the nightlife places frequented by tourists have liquor licences which allow them to sell liquor up until 3.00 am or 4.00 am. They hope that this can be extended to 6.00 am. Many places start the merrymaking after midnight. Stopping the selling of liquor at 3.00 am or 4.00 am does seem a bit early.",9,152,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00152
2015-01-30-T-002,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"In conclusion, we support the new Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill. It will mitigate a threat to public safety. However, we hope that the Government can strike a balance between being pro-business and maintaining public order. In particular, we hope they will be sympathetic towards the small businesses.

The purpose of this Bill, as I understand, is to target socially-ill behaviours that might cause public disorder, nuisance and even risks to others, especially residents.

Information, such as that shared by Minister Iswaran just now and during the Second Reading, about the national data and places where there are higher incidences of public disorders and so forth, I find are very, very useful data.

I would like to seek clarification that an individual who was consuming liquor in a licensed premises and who leaves the licensed premises with open and unconsumed liquor in a container during the prescribed ""no drinking"" period has not committed any offence under this Bill.

Excessive alcohol consumption is the fourth leading preventable cause of death in the United States and I believe it is also a cause for concern in Singapore.

The make-up of these groups is quite diverse, ranging from youngsters, young adults to foreigner workers. Not only do they create noise, the sight of the drinkers also poses fear and anxiety to the women residents and parents with young children. So, therefore, I strongly support the Bill.",2,197,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00197

The particulars of the offenders would be recorded and the Police could consider charging the recalcitrant repeat offenders.",4,199,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00199

It is also being viewed as too paternalistic. In the past, most supermarkets or hypermarkets close at 10.00 pm. Increasingly, we see more of them operating 24 hours to cater to the changing lifestyle of Singaporeans, who work late and could only do their grocery shopping late at night, including the shift workers.",7,202,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00202
2015-01-30-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"I suppose the main objective of the Bill is to curb consumption of alcohol at public places after 10.30 pm. Hence, the prohibition of sales of alcohol after 10.30 pm can be seen as too restrictive. I would like to urge MHA to be more lenient in granting permission for supermarkets to sell alcohol beyond 10.30 pm, especially for hypermarkets that are not too near to housing estate. This is especially so during this festive period where many retail outlets are extending their operating hours and shoppers are doing late night shopping to stock up for Chinese New Year.",8,203,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00203
2015-01-30-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"But to compensate for the seemingly more lenient approach as suggested earlier, I would like to suggest that the Police consider tapping on technology for better enforcement and it is difficult to enforce island-wide ""no drinking"" after 10.30 pm. For example, the Police could consider developing a smart phone application for Singaporeans to snap photographs of people violating the alcohol restrictions and send these to the Police via the app. This is similar to the app developed by the Municipal Service Office (MSO). The photographs snapped by the smart phone will reveal the date, time and place where the photo is taken using the Global Positioning System or GPS technology. To deter frivolous submissions, only registered user logging in with SingPass password will be allowed to send violation photographs via the app. And such submissions will also allow the Police to track public feedback and identify problem areas where the public is most concerned with.",9,204,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00204
2015-01-30-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"The rationale of my above proposals such as having a transition period, simplifying the process of applying consumption permit, allowing some supermarkets to sell liquor beyond 10.30 pm is to soften the onset of the new alcohol restrictions. However, it should be accompanied by tight enforcement of the law and the phone app is one of the ways the Police could involve the community to assist in the enforcement. In this way, offenders know that the chances of being caught are high and thus serving as a strong deterrent.

2015-01-30-T-002,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"I can understand and empathise with how the second group of Singaporeans feel. Sometimes, after a long day of work, all they want to do is to grab a can of beer – not high in alcohol content anyway in one can of beer – sit quietly by the river alone or with a close friend and indulge in simple pleasures. For some, especially younger Singaporeans, going to a coffee shop for a beer does not exactly offer the ambience they desire and going to a bar or pub can be too costly for them. Therefore, with this Bill, this group of Singaporeans will inevitably feel deprived of the freedom they had and unfairly penalised because of a group of irresponsible drinkers.",3,245,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00245
2015-01-30-T-002,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"In contrast, the first group of Singaporeans had experienced or recognised the disamenities that irresponsible drinkers can bring. Most commonly known to Members in this House is perhaps how residents suffer from the incessant noise made by drinkers who drank at the void deck or small pavilions in the neighbourhood, got drunk and made merry without any inhibition or regard for others. Apart from noise, some of these irresponsible drinkers engaged in destructive acts of mischief, damaging public and private properties while being drunk. In less disruptive but rather annoying instances, these drinkers drank in public areas where toilets are too far for their drunken selves to reach and thus, decided to pee in public. HDB residents' complaints about stairwells frequently reeking of pungent urine smell are aplenty and this is despite best efforts by the Town Councils to clean up every morning. Installation of CCTVs – one suggestion that has been frequently made by residents – cannot effectively solve the problem as the culprits simply move up one more floor or move to another stairwell to do it. The problem persists.",4,246,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00246
2015-01-30-T-002,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"Of course, some of these anti-social behaviours displayed by irresponsible drunks can be deemed as offences under existing regulations. However, the difference is the preventive, albeit blunt, nature of this Bill. The Police cannot take enforcement actions unless the person has already been confirmed to have committed the offensive act. Even so, there is a certain threshold that must be met before actions can be effectively taken to penalise the offender. However, by that time, disturbances and damages would have already been committed. For residents who have to suffer this repeatedly every day or every other day coupled with the fact that they live there and, therefore, they cannot escape from these disamenities, the feeling is pretty miserable. Whereas, this Bill can be seen as addressing these problems upstream and, hopefully, minimise the risk of such disamenities adversely affecting the quality of life for the general resident population.",5,247,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00247

2015-01-30-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, protecting quality of life in neighbourhoods. The need to have tighter alcohol controls stems largely from the density of human activity in Singapore.

While the permits or permission for such events require the events to stop at 10.30 pm, it is common in these social gatherings for bottles of alcohol to be shared in the course of the evening. Even after the events formally end, it is common for attendees to stay back to quietly finish up their drinks together after 10.30 pm. To now say it is illegal to drink after 10.30 pm would mean everyone would have to either waste their drinks or to drink up to meet the timeline, which will be harmful and an overkill.

Currently, most retailers of alcohol for off-premise consumption are able to sell alcohol until midnight, for example, convenience stores, supermarkets and petrol stations. I am not convinced that this should change. Many consumers purchase alcohol for takeaway between 10.30 pm and 12 midnight to drink at home or to bring along to social gatherings at the homes of relatives and friends. Since alcohol consumption in public after 10.30 pm will soon be outlawed, one will no longer be permitted to hang around a public place to consume alcohol after 10.30 pm. Therefore, the main concern about disamenities caused by public drinking late at night would have been significantly addressed.",8,264,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00264
2015-01-30-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"On the other hand, by prohibiting takeaway sales between 10.30 pm and midnight, a person who wants some drinks, say, after working late, can no longer purchase takeaway alcohol for consumption at home. He or she will have to go to a licensed premise to consume the alcohol there before the journey back. This may inadvertently lead to a higher incidence of persons riding or driving under the influence of alcohol.",9,265,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00265
2015-01-30-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Since the Bill will already curtail consumption at public places after 10.30 pm, I do not see the need to have a general prohibition on takeaway sales between 10.30 pm and midnight for private consumption.",10,266,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00266
2015-01-30-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, Madam, let me move on to some questions about the intended policing approach.",11,267,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00267
2015-01-30-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Firstly, for public places in general that are not liquor control zones, will the 10.30 pm rule against consumption be actively policed? For example, do we expect to have foot patrols searching for violators or will the Police only act on complaints?",12,268,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00268
2015-01-30-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Secondly, what will be the approach to drinkers found drinking in public after 10.30 pm but do not appear drunk and are not creating any annoyance to anyone? Under clause 12(4), such an individual commits an offence of prohibited consumption. How will the Police handle this? Would the Police just ask the person to leave with no questions asked or will records be kept? As for persons found drunk and incapable, or drunk and causing annoyance, clause 14(3) seems to favour an approach of just directing the person to go away and pouring away the alcohol. Are there expected to be further follow-up steps after these or will the authorities prosecute only when persons do not comply with directions of the Police to leave the place?",13,269,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00269
2015-01-30-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Another matter of interest is the division of work between the Police and the auxiliary police. The Act distinguishes between Police officers and the auxiliary police, the latter of whom are termed ""approved persons"" under clause 3 of the Bill. While there are some powers under the Bill that can be used by both Police and auxiliary police, under clause 30 of the Bill, only a Police officer may arrest without warrant a person committing an offence in the Police officer's line of sight. Thus, if an offence of drunken trespass under clause 14 is committed in front of auxiliary police officers, it would seem that these auxiliary officers cannot arrest the suspect but can only direct the suspect to leave the place. If he does not, it is not clear what, if anything, the auxiliary police officers can do at the scene.",14,270,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00270
2015-01-30-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Accordingly, I would like to ask if the proposed mode of operation is to team up both Police and auxiliary police officers in joint patrols, or to respond to cases jointly. If they are to be working separately, there could be some awkward situations where auxiliary police may have to wait for Police to arrive to take certain actions, by which time, harm may already have been caused.",15,271,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00271
2015-01-30-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Finally, Madam, I would like to make a general observation about the approach to enforcement. During the Committee of Inquiry into the Little India riots, the then-Commissioner of Police spoke about the policing challenges in Geylang and noted that there was open hostility and antagonism towards the Police in Geylang. He called Geylang ""a potential powder keg"". Have the Police thought about how the open hostility and antagonism can be ameliorated?",16,272,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00272
2015-01-30-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Force-wide, the Police have embraced community-oriented policing as a model. This model requires relationship building and partnerships and removing distrust. It is important that the public, whether local or foreign, understand the need for enforcement measures and believe the enforcement approach is fair and also reasonable.",17,273,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00273
2015-01-30-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"To this end, I was glad to note that just five days ago, the Police launched Project Transient Workers Outreach, an initiative aimed at promoting mutual understanding and creating awareness of Singapore's laws among foreign workers. While various Government agencies were reportedly involved in the project, such as the Civil Defence Force and the Central Narcotics Bureau, it was not mentioned whether the auxiliary police are in any way involved in such outreach.",18,274,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00274
2015-01-30-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"As auxiliary Police will be at the forefront of enforcing the Act, I am concerned that they are traditionally not trained in community policing and relationship building. Their historical focus was to protect the property of their clients and guard installations, though in recent years their roles have expanded to include policing migrant workers in public places. I believe it is critical to look at how to involve the auxiliary police in building bridges with the community. Otherwise, all the outreach efforts by the Police may be undermined.",19,275,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00275
2015-01-30-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Furthermore, if we expect the auxiliary police to engage the public and manage potentially hostile situations, they must be given the training and support to enable them to enforce the law purposefully and with discretion. I note that in the Police Force (Amendment) Bill tabled for First Reading yesterday, there is a provision to formally expand the role of auxiliary forces to include assisting the Police in detaining and arresting offenders. This further underscores the need for the training and mindsets of our auxiliary police forces to be raised closer to the level of the state Police.",20,276,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00276
2015-01-30-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"To summarise, Madam, I support in general the Bill's purpose of restricting the public consumption of alcohol after 10.30 pm for the greater good of all. However, once this is done, I believe that we can retain the status quo for takeaway sales. We also need to ensure that those who are enforcing the provisions of the Bill act with reason and discretion, and that the auxiliary police are adequately trained.",21,277,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00277

2015-01-30-T-002,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.]  I have received feedback from several grassroots members in my area and also from the employers of foreign workers about this Bill.,2,279,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00279
2015-01-30-T-002,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"One area of concern is that the definition of ""public areas"" is too wide. Will the public areas in condominiums or private housing estates be subjected to the ban on liquor consumption under this Bill? Will a person commit an offence if he consumes liquor after 10.30 pm when he is relaxing at the poolside of his condominium?",3,280,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00280
2015-01-30-T-002,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Seeing that this Bill has designated two areas that are frequently visited by foreign workers as Liquor Control Zones, many employers and foreign workers are questioning the need for foreign worker dormitories to be designated as public areas. Those who gave their feedback to me felt that we should exercise more flexibility so that these foreign workers can relax with their work colleagues to recover from fatigue and work stresses. Therefore, it would be good if, for the consumption of liquor within these foreign worker dormitories, it is left to the dorm operators to establish their own conditions.",4,281,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00281
2015-01-30-T-002,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Mdm Speaker, there are also grassroots members who want the ban on liquor consumption in public areas to be imposed at all times. This approach has been implemented in several cities like New York, Sydney, Perth and Oslo. Allowing the consumption of liquor during the hours before 10.30 pm can still bring about problems related to liquor consumption like drunkenness, brawls and indiscriminate littering. Therefore, in their opinion, it will be better to ban the consumption of liquor in all public areas at all times.",5,282,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00282
2015-01-30-T-002,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I have also received feedback from liquor retailers for the restriction on the hours of liquor sales not to be imposed. This is a reasonable request because this Bill has already banned the consumption of liquor in public areas during certain hours. Therefore, why impose the ban on liquor sales on these retailers after 10.30 pm? Some feel that this ban will burden the lower and middle income groups who want to consume liquor in their homes after 10.30 pm because the prices of liquor in the retail shops are much lower than the prices at the coffee shops in the housing estates.",6,283,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00283
2015-01-30-T-002,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Mdm Speaker, with regard to the payment of fines for the offence of consuming liquor in public areas during the restricted hours, many would also like to know how it is derived. Some feel that the fines imposed should be lesser compared to the penalties imposed for anti-social behaviour that is worse, for instance, littering and spitting in public areas.",7,284,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00284
2015-01-30-T-002,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"(In English)  On the issue of enforcement, will the public call for effective enforcement put a greater strain on the local Police force, channelling their efforts into controlling consumption of alcohol in a public area rather than focusing on more pressing issues? What are the plans by the Ministry to ensure effective enforcement?",8,285,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00285
2015-01-30-T-002,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Mdm Speaker, I would also like to know what are the Ministry's plans to ensure that sufficient outreach and awareness is made known to foreigners on the restrictions placed on the consumption of alcohol as stipulated by this Bill. I fear that this may produce a dilemma for local authorities given that they have to balance a thin line between tempering mercy for tourists who are genuinely unaware and also tackling the problem of locals who may have flouted the law. Should these groups be found in the same place, what is the course of action that we would undertake in the interest of fairness for all?",9,286,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00286

2015-01-30-T-002,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),The reactions to the Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill appear to be very intense.

2015-01-30-T-002,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),Why do some people choose to protest only now?

They feel that businesses are already facing challenges due to the labour shortage and rising cost and to ban liquor consumption after 10.30 pm will cause a chain reaction. If the customers who are used to drinking outdoors do not go out, take a taxi, order food or consume anything, then not only will the retail business be affected, other businesses may also be adversely affected. In the end, it is the employees who will be impacted the most. This is something that the Government must pay attention to.",5,312,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00312
2015-01-30-T-002,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"In addition, some temple organisations are concerned that the liquor control may prevent them from organising the annual Seventh Month celebrations outdoors and other religious activities. The reason is that the dinners usually start at 8.30 pm, and because there is the bidding of items, it is difficult to finish before 10.30 pm. They hope that as long as they do not disturb the residents nearby, the Police and authorities should allow them to go beyond 10.30 pm to early morning so that the committee members can have some time together after the event, have a bit of drink and discuss the affairs of the temple and bidding matters. This time of interaction is very important for the temple activity organisers. So, I hope the authorities will allow them to continue to organise their religious activities as per normal.",6,313,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00313

It will play an important role in maintaining social order, reducing incidents caused by liquor consumption and creating a responsible drinking culture. However, as long as it is not harming the interests of the majority and if the venue is far away from the residential area, the authorities may consider giving some flexibility to impacted businesses and religious activity organisers – for example, by extending the alcohol ban hour by another 30 or 60 minutes, depending on the nature of the event.",7,314,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00314

During the alcohol ban hours, do we have enough Policemen to patrol the estates to protect the peace and quiet of the area? Those who contravene the law knowingly must understand the consequences. It should not be simply telling them to leave or pouring away the alcohol. The authorities can also consider setting up a hotline so that members of the public can report incidents of illegal drinking and drunken behaviours. This is to ensure quick and effective response.",7,321,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00321
2015-01-30-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),I hope the authorities can draw up the manpower requirements and the details of implementation. Only then can the Bill achieve its desired objectives. I support the Bill.,8,322,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00322
2015-01-30-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill. There has been an intense furore online and in the media since this Bill was introduced 10 days ago. There have been accusations of it being a killjoy Bill, a modern day prohibition in Singapore and along with the weather changes that Singapore is now going dry.",1,323,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00323
2015-01-30-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"But let us be clear, this is not a simplistic Bill but one that has been well researched and consulted on. It needs to be read through carefully to gain a full understanding. We must not succumb to judgement based on headlines alone.",2,324,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00324
2015-01-30-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"This Bill is not about curbing anyone's wish to have a drink but about public order, especially for many neighbourhoods in Singapore who face real problems from binge-drinking and drunken and disorderly behaviour. The problems are real. We have heard the numbers  47 cases of rioting, 100 cases of affray and countless number of other disamenities that residents face. In my block visit just this Sunday past, residents were worried about the constant stench of urine at the stair landing because people were drinking at the foot of the block late into the night and wanted somewhere ""convenient"" to relieve themselves. Therefore, they have gone for the stair landing. This may be a problem for the Town Council to clean up. But if people were not drinking late into the night and relieving themselves, we would not have got into this stage.",3,325,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00325
2015-01-30-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"Yew Tee, the estate that I Iook after, does not boast of any well-known nightspots but, like other neighbourhoods mentioned by hon Members before me, residents have legitimate concerns over irresponsible drinking within their estates.",4,326,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00326
2015-01-30-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"To be honest, existing laws and police powers are not sufficient to deal with these issues. We have had cases of Police officers unable to act or even if they are able to ask drinkers to leave the spot, they may just move to another void deck or come back the next day. Therefore, we really do need to take a more comprehensive, proactive and preventive approach to deal with these issues.",5,327,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00327
2015-01-30-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"Having said that, no one really wants to be accused of being a party pooper. As such, calibrating the restriction measures is definitely not an easy process. Stakeholders' needs need to be balanced and the interests are quite diverse and sometimes conflicting. Having been involved in the focus group discussions from the early stages, trying to find a balance definitely has not been easy. The two-stage public consultation by MHA and REACH ended in August 2014 and the feedback obtained called for ""measures to reduce threats to public safety and order, and mitigate disamenities associated with the sale and consumption of alcohol in public places"".",6,328,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00328
2015-01-30-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"With that in mind, I am glad that the Ministry's proposed measures in this Bill have been formulated after extensive consultation and balancing the needs of all. I am also glad that rather than a far more restrictive system that exists in other legislation, this Bill has taken on feedback and calibrated it as such. For example, there has been concern by organisers of Seventh Month events as well as temple groups that a formal restrictive system would curtail their activities. Therefore, I am glad that the 10.30 pm timing matches the permit that is given to them to organise their activities. I am also glad that despite our lack of any famous nightspots in Yew Tee, our friendly neighbourhood coffee shops are not adversely affected by this Bill.",7,329,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00329
2015-01-30-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"There have been strong calls from the public to protect their neighbourhoods from alcohol-related harm. Our towns have developed quite a fair bit over the years. Our landscape has changed. The distinctions between residential and commercial areas are getting blur and they have started to merge as well. This really means that it will be difficult at times to designate clear zones. We, therefore, need a model that really makes sense.",8,330,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00330
2015-01-30-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"It, therefore, bears repeating that the general restriction at night proposed in this Bill is not uncommon. A number of major cities have already introduced similar or tougher measures. Nice in France and Beer Sheva in Israel are two cities that have most recently implemented similar restrictions as we have seen in this Bill.",9,331,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00331
2015-01-30-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"In my recent discussion with residents, there were concerns raised that this Bill may mean that the Police will have a field day in enforcing the law and issuing summonses. I am, however, confident that the Police will enforce this in a calibrated way and enforcement will only target problematic areas.",10,332,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00332
2015-01-30-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"With this Bill, Police will also be given additional powers and tools to deal with various situations that they were powerless to act on before. This will help the Police to conduct enforcement far more effectively.",11,333,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00333
2015-01-30-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"The agencies involved in enforcement, especially the Police, have adopted and, I truly believe, will continue to have a balanced and calibrated approach. Such powers that exist and have been provided to them before them have not been abused. This has been seen in the way Little India zoning was managed by the Police to work with grassroots leaders as well as local stakeholders. But in the same vein, I echo the call made by the hon Member, Mr Hri Kumar, as well as the speaker before me, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, that our foreign workers should not be unfairly targeted by the specific provision in section 29.",12,334,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00334
2015-01-30-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"I, therefore, urge a review of this particular section, where possible. Overall, I hope the Police will continue to take a light touch approach, especially with the applications of permits or exemptions to be made less onerous.",13,335,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00335
2015-01-30-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"I met with temple representatives over the last two weeks and they have concerns that are valid.

2015-01-30-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"Ultimately, individual responsibility is the key factor to the success of these measures. The measures set in place clear norms for responsible drinking in public. It is important for the law to be effective, together with public education and outreach. Retailers themselves must also do their part. Anyone who has recently called by convenience stores at Clarke Quay, River Valley or Boat Quay would perhaps have taken a double take and thought they had entered a liquor store with the wall-to-wall display of everything from alcopops to much harder stuff.",15,337,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00337
2015-01-30-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"I, therefore, reiterate my view that most Singaporeans are, at the end of the day, responsible drinkers and the measures are unlikely to affect most people. We just really need to ask ourselves, when was the last time you held a can of beer or a bottle of alcohol and drank it on the streets late at night? And the answer is, perhaps, not many of us.",16,338,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00338
2015-01-30-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"Life will go on as per normal for many of us who either do not drink or do so responsibly.

In general, they have expressed support for the intent of the liquor control measures that the Ministry intends to implement. However, there have also been a diversity of views on a range of issues – the need for the Bill, geographic coverage, time restrictions and so on – and I will endeavour to address them in turn.",2,344,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00344
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, several Members have highlighted that this Bill is timely, even long overdue, and that it will bring relief to residents in various localities who have been enduring disorder and disturbances arising from irresponsible liquor consumption in their neighbourhoods. And it is for the same reason that we commenced this review of our liquor control measures more than two years ago.",3,345,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00345
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Alex Yam and Mrs Lina Chiam had asked about statistics of liquor-induced crimes. I had shared them. I will reiterate one or two key points and, in particular, the fact that we have had rioting incidents, at least once a week which had been attributed to liquor-related practice. We have also had other forms of serious hurt cases, twice a week, which have also been attributed to liquor-induced practice. And we have had a variety of other crimes that have been contributing to this general concern. The problems are also compounded by voluminous incidents of affray, disorderly behaviour and public nuisance.",4,346,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00346
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Pritam Singh asked for more resolution on liquor-related disamenities across the rest of Singapore and in particular, in areas like Geylang and Little India. As I have said earlier, 40% to 50% of serious incidents in Geylang and Little India are linked to liquor consumption. That is twice the national average. And nationwide, 30% of serious incidents are liquor-related. Nine in 10 of all serious incidents occurred after 10.30 pm. And this is consistent across the island, including Geylang and Little India.",5,347,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00347
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But after all these granularities and all this data-sharing and fine-tuning, I think we need to come to a consensus. Is there a need to take action with regard to this matter? And I think the spirit of the debate in this House has been to confirm that there is a need to do so. The question then arises, how do we go about it and, in particular, when does a Bill stop being blunt and over-reached? And when does it start being comprehensive and effective? We can have a lot of rhetorical flourishes and pose interesting questions, but at the end of the day, we need to make a decision. That decision applies not just to general principles, but also to specific steps that need to be taken on the ground.",6,348,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00348
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In doing so, our guiding principle has been two-fold. The first is to make sure that we minimise the disamenities and threats to public order that would arise from public consumption of liquor. And second, in terms of our approach, we have endeavoured to be balanced, trying to reconcile quite diverse views and interests in order to achieve a pathway forward that we can all commit to and achieve some level of unanimity and take steps according to that.",7,349,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00349
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Baey Yam Keng and Mrs Lina Chiam suggested that we should put more men on the ground and that might be the solution; in other words, more enforcement. But while enforcement may be an important factor, it is by no means the solution in total and it is only one part of the equation. We must address the issues of consumption and sale of liquor in order to set expectations and foster a culture of shared responsibility introspect to this matter. It is equally important – which Mr Alex Yam has in fact emphasised – it is equally important that individuals and the community take responsibility and exercise restraint. In this respect, the restriction of public consumption of liquor serves as the marker for members of public to abide by.",8,350,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00350
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,Several Members talked about the mode and representation of various polls and also how we have undertaken consultation.,9,351,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00351
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, I just want to emphasise that MHA engage in a concerted, inclusive and deliberate process of consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, including residents, various businesses and dormitories operators. We also put up consultation papers, two of them for the public to provide comments. Each phase of this public consultation was widely publicised in the mainstream papers. Ultimately, it is the responses of citizens, active citizens to step forward and give their views so that those views can be counted and take into account when we formulate the policy.",10,352,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00352
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I do not want to get into a detailed discussion on the various polls that had been conducted on this matter. Several Members have entered opinions. It would suffice to state two points. The statisticians assure me that the sample size of 1,145 in the MCI poll is sufficient for statistically significant conclusions to be drawn. And secondly, and perhaps even more importantly, we did not base the proposed Bill and its specific measures on the basis of polls. It was on the basis of specific assessment of operational needs on the ground plus feedback we have gotten in order to achieve our objectives – reducing disamenities in preserving public order.",11,353,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00353
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Ms Foo and Mr Baey were part of the Members who have raised this issue on whether we can keep restrictions to specific problematic areas and widen the coverage when problems are flagged out elsewhere. This is part of the larger discourse we have been having on various issues. Geographic coverage – should it be focused, should it be general? In terms of timing, should we put a restriction, should we have a total ban, should we delay the timing to 12 midnight and so on?",12,354,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00354
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, with respect to geographic restrictions, as I have explained earlier, liquor-related law and order issues and disamenities do occur islandwide. We cannot predict exactly where it might occur next. There were also strong calls based on consultation to restrict liquor consumption at void decks, parks, and other common places in residential areas. If we were to draw zones around these areas, the boundaries and rules will be confusing and to say, the least, ambiguous. I think, in extremis, you will probably need a GPS enabled app to guide you as you move around, in which zone and what rules apply. This is not the kind of situation that we want, smart nation notwithstanding. And as Mr Hri Kumar quite aptly pointed out, ""the law should not be an ass"".",13,355,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00355
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Furthermore, drawing experiences from similar measures in other cities and in Little India in the past year, the displacement effect is real and it can be difficult to manage, especially depending on the terrain. And I think Ms Denise Phua attested to this in her speech.",14,356,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00356
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Having a series of Liquor Control Zones (LCZs) would simply exacerbate the problem for neighbouring areas. We should not wait until we receive complaints from residents that the restrictions in nearby neighbourhoods have caused the problems now to shift, before we take further action. In that scenario, we would then be accused of being slow to react, ""Why are you not more proactive?"" So, is this over-reaching or is this being proactive? The greater the gradient between the measures in different locations, the greater the propensity for displacement. I think we should all acknowledge that.",15,357,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00357
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"On timing  to address Members' questions on what is the rationale for this restriction at 10.30 pm. The Police's record of past incidents shows that the bulk of liquor-induced violence and disamenities happen at night, after 10.30 pm. We can fine-tine this and get down to the last half hour and so on, but that is a general marker. It also aligns with the end-time for many activities we have in the community, as we have all discussed, whether it is ""getai"", whether it is Hungry Ghost Festival or the Seventh Month dinners and so on. The restriction will not stop people from congregating and consuming liquor in public before 10.30 pm, but it does reduce the window period when people typically consume liquor, because after 10.30 pm, we have the restriction. It greatly reduces the propensity of them becoming drunk and creating noise disturbances when residents are resting later in the night. The correlation is real and I would say that wherever you draw the line, whether it is 10.00 pm, 10.30 pm, 12 midnight, there will always be a debate about why not before, why not later.",16,358,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00358
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Zainal and Ms Sylvia Lim asked about the rationale of restricting the retail sale hours for takeaway liquor. The first point I want to make is you cannot decouple consumption from the sale of retail with public consumption. Imagine in extremis the scenario where you have total ban on public consumption but total freedom for retail sales, do you think that is tenable solution? So, you need to start somewhere because those who buy retail sales do not all go home and drink, or at least, there will be a temptation to do other things. So, we do need to have some reference points.",17,359,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00359
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, unlike in coffee shops, restaurants and bars where the licensees are responsible to ensure that liquor is not served to patrons who already appear intoxicated, the consumption of take-away liquor is often unchecked. As many Members have highlighted, the problem is exacerbated by easy access to takeaway liquor sold in nearby shops. So, a curb on the supply will reduce the propensity of drinkers obtaining liquor and consuming it in public late at night. This has been an effective measure in other cities. Does it mean that there would be no gaming around the end times? Probably not. But that does not mean that we should not take a position on this, which we think it is sensible and consistent with the large objectives that we have set out to achieve.",18,360,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00360
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Several Members have raised concerns about the impact of restricting retail sale hours on residents and businesses. Currently, most shops and supermarkets generally close by 10.30 pm. The proposed restriction is not an absolute one, in the sense, that requests for extension of sale hours beyond 10.30 pm will be considered on a case-by-case basis and we have made that apparent.",19,361,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00361
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Some businesses that depend solely on the sale of liquor retail sale will be affected. We can see that from our experience in Little India. But it is also clear that over time, the business community will adapt and diversify and they will create new business opportunities and a different mix of trades. So, I think the fact that major retailers like 7-Eleven and Cheers, have committed that they will align themselves to support the overall objectives is a welcomed development and they will find a way of work closely with the industry to make sure the transition is an effective one with minimal disruption to business.",20,362,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00362
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Alex Yam asked a question on the conditions that the licensing authority will impose in granting extensions on retail sale hours.

2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Several Members have asked about the criteria for designating Liquor Control Zones. Madam, the intention of having these few specific Liquor Control Zones is to better control law and order problems in areas where the risks of public disorder related to liquor consumption are more significant. Stricter restrictions on the supply and consumption of liquor will be imposed, along with enhanced powers to remove persons from the area if they pose risks to public peace and order.",22,364,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00364

In cases where drinkers are creating public annoyance, officers have the power to remove their liquor and require them to move on and leave the place. These are actions that enforcement officers can take and they serve as a strong deterrent to anti-social behaviour.",25,367,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00367

One pertains to the definition of ""public place"" and the places that the law will cover. A public place under the Bill is a place where members of the public can have access as of right, or with permission. This includes places like void decks, parks and pavements. Places where members of the public cannot freely enter are not public places and the provisions in the Bill will not apply. Therefore, the restrictions on the consumption of liquor do not apply in private condominiums where access is restricted to residents and guests only, or in the private quarters of the foreign workers' dormitories.",28,370,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00370

Individuals can continue to drink in restaurants, coffee shops and bars. This includes any outdoor refreshment area that has been approved by the relevant authorities. To answer Mr Pritam Singh's question, hawker centres are under the same licensing regime as coffee shops. Operating hours are based on the location and the environment in which the hawker centre or coffee shop is based, whether it is a residential or commercial area.",29,371,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00371

Some even talked about star gazing in the park over a glass of wine. I would like to assure Members that these are not activities that we seek to restrict, particularly if the adverse impact on the community is not significant. We are committed to make it simpler for event organisers to obtain relevant permits where they are needed, or in some cases to exempt activities in certain places. The details are being worked out and we will announce them when they are ready.",30,372,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00372

2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I want to clarify a point which several Members have raised on foreign worker dormitories. The ""public place"" seen in clause 38 of this Bill relates to a consequential amendment to the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act, which was passed in this House two weeks ago. Under the Act, MOM had decided that dormitories should be deemed as ""public places"" solely for the purpose of the provision relating to drunkenness under section 18 of the Miscellaneous Offences Act. As this provision will be transferred to this Bill, we need a consequential amendment under this Bill.",32,374,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00374
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, it is a technical matter but I want to basically assure Members that we have no intention to single out foreign workers and I fully agree with Mr Hri Kumar and many others who have expressed the sentiment. That is not the object of this Bill. The amendment does not turn dormitories into ""public places"", neither does it forbid workers from consuming liquor within the foreign worker dormitories. Workers can continue to drink in their private quarters according to whatever rules they have within their dorms. Some dorms have varying rules on this matter in terms of where their private quarters are. And they can also continue to drink in the beer gardens in their dormitories until such time as it is allowed under the licence. So, we will license the areas; there are these today and those areas will continue to be available to the workers. So, it will not unduly constrain foreign workers in the dorms.",33,375,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00375
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Zainal and Mr Ang asked about easing the public into the new measures and plans to ensure that individuals are not unfairly caught by the law. Mrs Lina Chiam also raised concerns about enforcement. Police will work with licensees and all the relevant authorities to put in place appropriate information, signages to remind members of the public of the rules. In enforcing the law, enforcement officers will take a calibrated approach.",34,376,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00376
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Let me elaborate on how enforcement will be calibrated. When a person is found consuming liquor during the restricted period, that is, after 10.30 pm, the Police are empowered to take down his particulars and require him to dispose of his liquor. At any time of the day, before or after 10.30 pm, a person found consuming liquor and creating public annoyance may also be required to move on and leave the place, even if he is not drunk. No further action will be taken if he complies.",35,377,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00377
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"If a person ignores Police's advice, or if he is a recalcitrant offender, the Police may consider stiffer actions, such as issuing him a composition fine or, in extremis, arresting him. As is the practice today under existing laws, persons who are disorderly or pose a threat to public order and safety may also be arrested and prosecuted. Mr Yee Jenn Jong has asked about the offence on consumption of liquor. To clarify, mere possession of liquor is not an offence.",36,378,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00378
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, it is not our intent to restrict people from enjoying liquor per se, but to encourage personal responsibility and considerate behaviour. The Police will focus their enforcement on areas where there are public disorder and disamenities associated with the consumption of liquor and take even-handed actions. It is certainly not the intent of this Bill to seek out every person who is consuming liquor peacefully in a remote place. I do not think the Police have the resources for this. Should the Police encounter such situations, they will assess each circumstance carefully and not resort to issuing penalties, whether it is fines or arrests in the first instance.",37,379,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00379
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Alex Yam asked about the treatment of inebriated youth. In the event that the Police encounter an individual who is drunk and incapable, the Police will as per current practice, take him back to the station and issue him a warning when he comes around. If he repeats the offence, the Police may, depending on circumstances, take further actions.",38,380,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00380
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,I want to come to the specific enforcement powers and penalties. Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mrs Lina Chiam sought clarification on the rationale and safeguards of various powers.,39,381,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00381
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In particular, clause 30 which is a standard provision for arrest power that is common in many pieces of legislation, such as the Public Order Act, the Protection from Harassment Act and the Miscellaneous Offences Act. And given the propensity for violence and public disorder of liquor-related offences, they should be made arrestable without warrant so that Police can take swift actions. As I have reiterated – and I want to do so again – Police will not make arrest in the first instance.",40,382,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00382
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Clause 22 relates to inspection powers that are adopted from the special event provisions in the Public Order Act. Where an individual is suspected of having committed an offence related to liquor consumption and drunkenness and has hidden the liquor among his personal belongings including his clothing, clause 22 allows enforcement officers to inspect his belongings for any incriminating evidence. This is not a new power for the Police. We had a debate over this in the past. The Police have well-established protocols to assess when certain inspection is necessary and how it is to be administered based on their operational experience applying such powers to special events such as National Day parades, for example.",41,383,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00383
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Assoc Prof Fatimah asked about the rationale of imposing a banning notice period of 30 days. Under the current Public Order (Preservation) Act, there is a provision for indefinite exclusion. We do not need such strict powers in this Bill. Thirty days is a reasonable period. The Commissioner of Police or an authorised officer will then have to make an assessment whether to issue another notice or whether the individual can then be allowed to re-enter the place.",42,384,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00384
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Zainal asked about the penalty quantum for offences related to the consumption and sale of liquor. These take reference from the existing laws and what we already have. In enforcing the law, Police will be given the option to issue composition fines in lieu of prosecution and such composition fines will be of the lower quantum than the penalty prescribed in the law. Penalties related to the supply of liquor by businesses are aligned with those under the public entertainment regime.",43,385,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00385
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"On liquor licensing, Ms Foo suggested that we consider restricting liquor licences in a community and seek stakeholders' feedback in considering licence applications. I want to make the point that while restricting the number of licences is one of the tools available, the number of licences in an area per se may not truly reflect the situation on the ground because you may have one licensee who behaves irresponsibly, you may have many licensees who actually are very compliant and are responsible in the way they conduct their sales. So, the closure of any one shop will not necessarily reduce the overall problem on the ground. But what we will do – and the Police will do – is we will assess the situation in a locality and consider which levers are to be used, including whether there should be restrictions on the number of licences.",44,386,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00386
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Thomas Chua made several suggestions relating to the liquor licensing regime to balance the need between achieving public security, being pro-business and maintaining Singapore's tourism appeal. We will take note of all his suggestions including the idea of a demerit points system and we will review them. As of now, we do not have any plan to have such a system but we will continue to engage the industry and refine our processes.",45,387,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00387
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,Several Members have asked about the Police enforcement and resourcing for that purpose. I am very glad so many of you have raised this and I will urge you to hold that thought. The Committee of Supply is around the corner and you should make a strong pitch for MHA.,46,388,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00388
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In enforcing this law, the Police will focus resources on problematic areas, particularly in the two Liquor Control Zones. In other words, the way we will prioritise. These are areas with greater law and order concerns where we already dispatch more resources today, to patrol and respond to incidents. As with the current practice, Auxiliary Police Officers (APOs), who are trained and supervised by Police, will be deployed to patrol areas such as Little India where large congregations of people frequently gather and consume liquor. These APOs are also empowered under the Bill to assist and supplement Police in enforcing the law on public consumption of liquor, including effecting arrests.",47,389,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00389
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I agree with Ms Lim and, in fact, this is a point we have discussed in this House before. We do need to ensure that our APOs are well trained because of the interface they have with the larger community and that is, indeed, the basis on which the Police engage the APOs and ensure that there is a rigorous training regime for them and we will continue to do so.",48,390,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00390
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In areas that do not pose as many problems, the enforcement officers also have the levers and powers to take decisive and quick actions, when they come across such cases in the course of their work or if it is brought to their attention through a report or notification. We do not envisage a significant increase in resource requirement because of this prioritisation approach and the way the Police will respond.",49,391,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00391
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, I want to say that we will commit ourselves to resourcing the Police as necessary to do not just the enforcement of this Bill and its provisions but, in general, we have larger law and order and security concerns. The resourcing of the Police has to take into account this larger context. It is not about this particular Bill per se.",50,392,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00392
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Having said that, I do want to make the point that in the context of this Bill, it takes the concerted effort of all stakeholders to ensure that the objectives of the Bill are met. Enforcement alone will never be sufficient. We need the industry and the community to take responsibility, exercise more self-control and be proactive in mitigating liquor-related risks.",51,393,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00393
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mrs Lina Chiam has suggested that we commit this Bill to a Select Committee. I disagree with her and I will argue against it. There is no need because the policy behind this Bill has undergone a long period of deliberation and consultation with a wide range of stakeholders. The public has generally shown support and this is underscored by various polls and, indeed, I think the discussion in this House confirms it. The offences in the Bill are also not new; the powers are scoped tightly and are similar to those that we have in existing legislation and Police's enforcement approach will also be targeted, balanced and measured, as with the enforcement of any other law.",52,394,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00394
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, to conclude, the intent of the Bill – proposed measures and enforcement are guided by and focused on averting disorder and disamenities, to deter and to deal with troublemakers and trouble-making.",53,395,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00395
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"We have sought to take a calibrated and balanced approach to deal with a somewhat complex issue. This will guide both the geographical areas that we focus on for our enforcement and the enforcement touch and the approach that is adopted on the ground. We have heard a great diversity of views in this House and outside, but from all this diversity, I think one key clear point is that we are united in the desire for the same outcome – a safer and more secure living environment for all Singaporeans and other residents here.",54,396,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00396
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"We are not transplanting policies of other cities indiscriminately but we are learning from their experience and adapting some useful examples for our purposes. In general, if you look around at the examples we have cited and others that you may have experienced personally, these cities have not lost their buzz and I do not think their residents or their citizens feel unduly put upon by some of the restrictions that have been put in place.",55,397,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00397
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, the proposed measures are reasonable, balanced, focused and not excessive. We are not setting out to stop people who want to enjoy their liquor; rather, this Bill aims to set the norms for liquor consumption in public places and purchase of takeaway liquor to be conducted in a responsible way. Ultimately, we do need all parties to step forward – individual responsibility, cooperation of the community, industry has to play its part. We need effective enforcement and, of course, we need to educate all so that we can achieve the full intent of this Bill.

2015-01-30-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Thank you, Madam. I have three clarifications for the Second Minister. Earlier in his round-up speech, he was saying that hawker centres were treated under the same regime as coffee shops. I would like him to clarify that because in the literature of the MHA statements, they put coffee shops as licensed premises but in some of the FAQs we have seen, hawker centres appear not to be licensed premises but I am not sure whether those stallholders selling drinks there are considered to be retailers or off-premise consumption. So, I would like him to clarify that, if different rules would apply.",1,400,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00400
2015-01-30-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Secondly, could the Minister comment on the scenario that some of us brought up about the Seventh Month dinners. What would happen to the people who have opened drinks after 10.30 pm? That would be important, I think.",2,401,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00401
2015-01-30-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"And the third point is, Geylang, since it is going to be zoned as a Liquor Control Zone, I was asking in my speech whether the Police had looked into the reasons why there is antagonism towards the Police in Geylang and how we could actually ameliorate that?",3,402,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00402
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, first on the issue of hawker centres, the licence does not apply to hawker centres as a whole but particular shops will receive the licence. If I remember correctly, they are given a beer licence or a beer house licence and the requirement is that the consumption takes place on the premises, meaning within the hawker centre. What that means in practice is if a shop in a hawker centre is to sell a can of beer, they are required to pop the can, so that there is a point made about consumption on premises. So, that is the basis on which the licensing is conducted. In that sense, it is similar to coffee shops and they have prescribed times and so on for their operations.",1,403,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00403
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"On the Seventh Month dinner, I think what the Member is suggesting is that the 10.30 pm time limit is observed more and it is breached. Is that her point? Basically, the Seventh Month dinners are required, by permit and the licence they have, to end by 10.30 pm. I think the Member's point is that these inevitably spill over and we are aware of this situation on the ground. That is why I have made the point that for these kinds of activities, because our object is to minimise the impact on normal activities and the Seventh Month dinners would constitute that, we will see how best to facilitate that. Perhaps, in the application process – because they will need a permit if they are going to hold it in a public area – we can embed this requirement in there as well. But we will have to study this and see how to make it seamlessly. We have a few months before this is upon us.",2,404,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00404

2015-01-30-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"No, Madam, my question was whether the Police had looked into the reasons for the antagonism and how they could actually build some bridges, in that sense, to ameliorate that because part of effective policing is for you to have the buy-in of the community, as far as you can go.",1,406,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00406
2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I would not say that this is a particularly sharp issue which we are seized with. In general, the Police have very clear strategies in engaging the community. It is not just in Geylang but it is across the island. Community policing is a key part of their policing strategy and that entails building relationships, bridges and bonds of trust in the community. You cannot just rely on enforcement, we need this. So, it is part and parcel of the Police's overall strategy to keep Singapore safe and secure.",1,407,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00407

Yes, I understand and I agree that we need to minimise disamenities and disorder while balancing the needs of the population. The Minister shared quite a bit of statistics today. To help my understanding in the implementation, I would like to know what sort of evidence do we have of rioting and serious hurt incidents in the coastal parts, for example, East Coast Park. Have there been many complaints regarding this sort of areas about drinking?",1,408,2015-01-30-T-002-S-00408

If the Member wishes, he can file a question and I would be quite happy to give the information. But I would make a more important and general point.

2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I urge the Member to consider the consequences and whether the residents would thank you, or those who go to East Coast Park, if some of the concerns we have actually materialise. Because inevitably what you are going to have is if there are restrictions in many areas and then you have this oasis for consumption, human behaviour will sort of find a new level.

2015-01-30-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I do agree with the Member what it does mean is that in some of these recreational areas, such as East Coast Park, the enforcement has to be calibrated – some have used the term ""light touch"" – but also we need to make sure that we find the balance which allows people to have their fun in a legitimate way, which is unchannelled and, at the same time, we also ensure the concerns in terms of public order and safety are preserved.
