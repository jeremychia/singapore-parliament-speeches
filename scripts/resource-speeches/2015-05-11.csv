2015-05-11-T-001,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,asked  the Minister for Foreign Affairs what is the assistance which Singapore has rendered to Nepal to help Nepal recover from the recent earthquake that took place on 25 April 2015.,1,2,2015-05-11-T-001-S-00002

2015-05-11-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Thank you. Mdm Speaker, within hours of receiving the shocking and sad news, the Singapore Government mobilised a disaster relief team for deployment to Nepal in aid of relief efforts. The Home Team mounted its largest-ever deployment for an overseas disaster relief operation. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) formed ""Operation Lionheart (Nepal, Earthquake)"" – the 14th such Lionheart mission – comprising a 60-member search-and-rescue team. In addition, a 66-member strong Singapore Police Force (SPF) contingent, including Gurkha Contingent (GC) officers, was also deployed to Nepal.",1,5,2015-05-11-T-001-S-00005
2015-05-11-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Over the course of the deployment, the SCDF and SPF contingents operated in several areas in Nepal, such as Lalitpur district around Kathmandu, Pokhara and Gorkha. The SCDF and SPF contingents worked with the Nepalese authorities and other foreign teams to provide humanitarian assistance, including search-and-rescue, relief aid and medical assistance, to the affected people, with the GC officers helping to facilitate relief operations as they were familiar with the language, terrain and local communities. MFA also despatched a four-person Crisis Response Team to Kathmandu to provide consular assistance to Singaporeans stranded in Nepal. Our Embassy in New Delhi also sent an officer to support the team subsequently.",2,6,2015-05-11-T-001-S-00006
2015-05-11-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"At the same time, the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) immediately mobilised a joint medical team of 22 personnel and an advance team of six personnel from the Changi Regional Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) Coordination Centre or RHCC. C-130 aircraft were also deployed to airlift the personnel, equipment and relief supplies into Kathmandu.",3,7,2015-05-11-T-001-S-00007
2015-05-11-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"A further six personnel from the Changi RHCC were deployed together with additional medical supplies. Eight members of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces and seven members from the Ministry of Health (MOH) were also deployed together with the SAF's medical team. The combined medical team, to date, treated more than 3,000 patients. The RHCC assisted the Nepalese national disaster management authorities and military with their efforts to coordinate the relief efforts. Eleven sorties have been flown in and out of Kathmandu by the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF), transporting more than 100 tonnes of equipment and relief supplies, various Singapore contingents, as well as evacuating Singaporeans from Nepal.",4,8,2015-05-11-T-001-S-00008

2015-05-11-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In addition to mobilising our assets, the Singapore Government contributed a total of S$250,000 through the Singapore Red Cross (SRC). An initial S$100,000 was given as seed money to help kick-start the SRC donation drive. However, as news of the severity and scale of the disaster became clearer and there were increasing calls for international aid, we increased our contribution by another S$150,000, to support the SRC's efforts to purchase emergency supplies. To date, SRC has raised more than S$4.5 million, sent 14 personnel, including two medical teams with a total of 11 personnel, and S$200,000 worth of emergency supplies and relief items including food, household kits and shelter tool kits to Nepal.",6,10,2015-05-11-T-001-S-00010
2015-05-11-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"This financial contribution complements the on-going efforts by Singaporeans and Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) to raise funds for the relief efforts in Nepal. Many Singaporeans have been moved by the tragedy. They have dug deep into their pockets and contributed generously. Other NGOs including Mercy Relief and religious organisations have also raised more than S$800,000 to date, with many of them mounting medical and humanitarian missions to Nepal. The government of Nepal has expressed appreciation for Singapore's assistance and support to Nepal and the Nepalese people.",7,11,2015-05-11-T-001-S-00011
2015-05-11-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mdm Speaker, I would like to assure the House that in the midst of these relief efforts, the Government also spared no effort in looking after the welfare of Singaporeans affected by the disaster in Nepal.",8,12,2015-05-11-T-001-S-00012
2015-05-11-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MFA's Crisis Response Team arrived in Kathmandu within a day to assist Singaporeans wishing to return home. MINDEF facilitated the return of 71 Singaporeans, along with 24 other nationals, on the returning C-130 aircraft. Throughout the crisis, MFA continued to reach out to Singaporeans in Nepal to render assistance and within five days of the earthquake, accounted for the safety of all Singaporeans who eRegistered with MFA.",9,13,2015-05-11-T-001-S-00013
2015-05-11-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mdm Speaker, one takeaway for me from this crisis is  help us to help yourselves. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to encourage Singaporeans travelling overseas to eRegister so that we can contact you or your Next-of-Kin promptly in the event of a crisis.",10,14,2015-05-11-T-001-S-00014
2015-05-11-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As for Mr Ang's question of what assistance Singapore has rendered to help Nepal recover, at present, international efforts are still focused on disaster relief and humanitarian aid. We will continue to do what is within our means to assist and support Nepal during this difficult time.",11,15,2015-05-11-T-001-S-00015
2015-05-11-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mdm Speaker, in conclusion, I would also like to express our deepest condolences to the government and people of Nepal during this difficult period, and to extend comfort to the families of our Gurkha contingent in Singapore.",12,16,2015-05-11-T-001-S-00016

2015-05-11-T-001,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),"Thank you, Madam. It is heartening to see how readily Singapore responded to the disaster in Nepal. I would like to ask the Second Minister this  now that the disaster relief phase is coming to an end, how would Singapore contribute to the long-term reconstruction phase that follows? Nepal is one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world and needs international support to carry on its work to reconstruct the whole country. Singapore has expertise in various areas, especially in master-planning and housing. Can I ask the Second Minister if Singapore would be contributing to the reconstruction efforts in Nepal?",1,18,2015-05-11-T-001-S-00018
2015-05-11-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"It is clear that the disaster in Nepal has taken a very big toll on the Nepalese as well as on the country. At this point in time, as I mentioned, an assessment has not been made. The Nepalese are still asking for help in humanitarian aid, and the outpouring has not been coordinated. Until such time, we do not want to pre-empt the kind of aid that is needed.",1,19,2015-05-11-T-001-S-00019
2015-05-11-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In the same way, too, when the relief and rescue work was done, not everything that went into the place were things that the Nepalese needed. So, when the international community comes together to help them with reconstruction, Singapore will do our part to contribute expertise in a way that we can, and not over-extend ourselves so that we do not over-reach what we can do as a nation.",2,20,2015-05-11-T-001-S-00020
2015-05-11-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"But we should also not discount the public in Singapore, and NGOs such as Mercy Relief as well as SRC, to extend their help also, in the development and rebuilding of Nepal.",3,21,2015-05-11-T-001-S-00021
2015-05-11-T-001,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Second Minister for the comprehensive reply. Firstly, I want to offer my condolences to the Nepal citizens who have lost their loved ones in this earthquake and also congratulate and thank our Singapore team members – Singapore Police Force officers, SCDF officers, and SAF officers – for doing a great job in Nepal. I also feel for the Singaporeans who were affected by the earthquake in Nepal.",1,22,2015-05-11-T-001-S-00022
2015-05-11-T-001,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"I understand the Second Minister had answered that we would look at what kind of effort we could provide Nepal in due time. However, I would specifically like to ask the Second Minister would the Government consider assisting Nepal to rebuild parts of the destroyed areas, similar to what we have done for Aceh.",2,23,2015-05-11-T-001-S-00023
2015-05-11-T-001,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Secondly, I would like to ask the Second Minister how MFA kept in touch with the Singapore Mount Everest Climbing team after the 25 April earthquake. What advice did MFA give to the team when the team initially decided to carry on with their climb despite extensive damages in Kathmandu and the risk of avalanche in the mountain areas? I understand the team only decided to end its mission on 29 April, four days after the earthquake.",3,24,2015-05-11-T-001-S-00024
2015-05-11-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I thank the Member for the question. As I mentioned, it is too early to pre-empt the kind of aid that we should be giving to Nepal or whether to scale it to the kind of aid that we gave to Aceh. Clearly, even in Aceh, all our NGOs played a very big part, because they were our good neighbours, they had connections, and sometimes, NGOs can do a better job than governments.",1,25,2015-05-11-T-001-S-00025
2015-05-11-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In terms of the expedition by Singaporeans who went there, they were in very close touch with the authorities, as well as the base communications. At times, they also communicated personally with me. We always assured them that if they needed to get help, if they had the wherewithal to do it, they will be supported. You must remember that the Everest base camp was also part of the disaster area. Many people, climbers, also died there. It was a very difficult terrain. Despite that, arrangements were made, they came out, went back to Kathmandu, and they are now back in Singapore. So, we are really thankful for the efforts they have made to fly the Singapore flag, to get up to the peak of Everest, to celebrate SG50. Unfortunately, they did not achieve it but in the process, they knew what was more important – to keep safe, to make sure that they can come back safely and without harm to themselves, and hopefully, one day, they can pursue their dreams.",2,26,2015-05-11-T-001-S-00026
2015-05-11-T-002,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,"asked  the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) whether he can provide an update on the progress of preparations for the 28th Southeast Asian Games to be held in June 2015; (b) what is the number of sports that will be featured; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider having a special exhibition accessible to SEA Games participants and the public that showcases Singapore's relations with its ASEAN neighbours over the past 50 years.",1,27,2015-05-11-T-002-S-00027

2015-05-11-T-002,Lawrence Wong,"The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong)","Based on the experience of past SEA Games, the focus during the Games tends to be on the athletes and the competitions. For this reason, we do not think it will be so useful to have a dedicated exhibition on Singapore's relation with our ASEAN neighbours. Instead, we will find different ways to highlight this throughout the Games. For example, it can be done in the Opening Ceremony, or it can be done through social media platforms where we can promote ASEAN and our relations in ASEAN.",3,30,2015-05-11-T-002-S-00030

We are also planning to field Team Singapore's largest-ever contingent, with 748 athletes representing Singapore in the Games. Our athletes are training intensively; I have spoken to many of them. They have told me that they are determined to do their best, and to do Singapore proud. In their preparatory and qualifying competitions in the run-up to the Games, many athletes have posted outstanding performances, achieved new personal bests, and broken long-standing national records. What remains is for Singaporeans to come forward to attend the Games with family and friends, to cheer for our Team Singapore athletes. While being gracious hosts to our Southeast Asian friends, let us also make the home ground advantage for Team Singapore count by being the to cheer our athletes on.",5,32,2015-05-11-T-002-S-00032

2015-05-11-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mdm Speaker, the ticket sales are progressing well. It is somewhat uneven. There are some events which are very popular; I think if you are planning to buy a ticket for the Opening Ceremony, I am sorry to say that tickets have probably been sold out. And if you are going for very popular games like the water polo finals, that event is also sold out; swimming events, very popular. Certain events have been very popular. Some are still progressing slowly, steadily, partly because the fixtures have just been announced. For example, football fixtures were just announced; and some other sports, the fixtures had just been announced. It may take a bit more time.",1,36,2015-05-11-T-002-S-00036
2015-05-11-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But I would say that, based on past experience, compared to other games and other sporting events, the ticket sales so far have been better than expected, compared to previous events. We will continue to encourage all Singaporeans to, like I said earlier, take this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to support Team Singapore on home ground in a new competition venue like the Sports Hub.",2,37,2015-05-11-T-002-S-00037
2015-05-11-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"It is true that we will host the SEA Games again 20-something years later because all the Southeast Asian countries will take turns every two years.

2015-05-11-T-002,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"Thank you, Madam. Some quick supplementary questions for the Minister.",1,39,2015-05-11-T-002-S-00039
2015-05-11-T-002,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"The Sports Hub is touted to be the centrepiece of the SEA Games, so, I would like to ask about the status of the hybrid Desso pitch that was much talked about and whether it could stand the robust tests during the SEA Games. What are some of the marquee fringe activities and events that Singaporeans and participants can look out for? Of course, some of the events are already way over-sold. So, are there any plans to expand the capacity or even look at alternative sites so that it can accommodate more Singaporeans and participants to cheer Team Singapore on?",2,40,2015-05-11-T-002-S-00040
2015-05-11-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, on the pitch of the Sports Hub at the National Stadium, as I have explained before, the SHPR, the Sports Hub consortium, has already put in place a lay-and-play solution, meaning to say, they are growing the grass somewhere else and they will be laying it on later when the pitch is needed. So, if you were to go to the National Stadium now, the entire pitch has been covered for the rehearsals and the Opening Ceremony. Naturally, when you open the covering, all the grass there would have died. It is only natural, because it is covered for days or weeks. But because we have a lay-and-play solution, the grass is being grown elsewhere. And I have seen the grass grown elsewhere. It is fine, it is luscious. The grass is good. So, the next step is when the grass is needed, it will be transferred over as part of this lay-and-play solution. The company that has been contracted will be in charge of doing that.",1,41,2015-05-11-T-002-S-00041
2015-05-11-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The hon Member also asked about marquee fringe events. Indeed, that is what we are planning to do, because many people come for these events not just for the games and the sports but also as part of a lifestyle experience. So, we will be having carnivals at the Sports Hub and also at the Marina Bay. At Marina Bay, we are hosting all our sailing and dragon boating events. There will be a big carnival there. And in the Sports Hub where many events are going to be held, we are also going to have a sports carnival around the Sports Hub. So, hopefully, that will draw more people to come for these carnivals and then to support and watch our Team Singapore athletes in action.",2,42,2015-05-11-T-002-S-00042
2015-05-11-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the over-subscribed events, whether or not we can find ways to broaden their viewing, I would say that we are doing it through various means. One, the events will be telecast live on TV. So, we can put up community screening sites for people to watch. We are also making it available on social media platforms, so you can download an app which will be announced very shortly and you can even watch the events live on your mobile platforms, whether it is a handphone or a mobile device. These will allow also for viewing of all the different sports.",3,43,2015-05-11-T-002-S-00043

2015-05-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In Iskandar and Johor, some reports have highlighted aggressive land-banking by developers. There is, indeed, a real concern about future over-supply in the property market there and, hence, the potential decline in value of homes. Based on data from Malaysia's National Property Information Centre, there are around 336,000 new private residential units in the pipeline. This is more than the total number of private homes in Singapore. So, everything that is coming through in the pipeline, incoming and being planned, is already more than the total number of private homes in Singapore. The data do not include another 1,400 hectares of reclaimed land near the Tuas Second Link that will come on stream from 2020 onwards.",5,56,2015-05-11-T-004-S-00056

2015-05-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Given these indications, there are many reports that indicate that buyers are becoming more cautious. Official Malaysian data suggest that the Johor housing market is already slowing down, with the value of residential property transactions falling by 42% on a quarter-on-quarter basis in the fourth quarter of 2014. Singaporean buyers, too, are becoming wary. According to surveys of real estate agencies in Singapore, the number of Malaysian properties bought through these agencies dropped from 2,609 in 2013 to 838 in 2014.",7,58,2015-05-11-T-004-S-00058

Hence, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Council of Estate Agents (CEA) will continue to step up efforts in raising awareness and highlighting these risks. For example, the CEA has issued guidelines on what investors in overseas properties should look out for. These include finding out about rules or restrictions on foreign property purchases and ownership, the taxes payable, and the dispute resolution avenues available in the foreign market. This is besides the risk of oversupply that I mentioned earlier, resulting in potential investment losses.",9,60,2015-05-11-T-004-S-00060

2015-05-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"At the systemic level, financial institutions in Singapore do not have large exposures to loans for the purchase of overseas properties. In fact, the banks themselves are cautious about financing the purchase of overseas properties. Hence, such loans make up only 2% of the housing loan portfolios of the key mortgage lenders in Singapore. In addition, the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) framework introduced by MAS in June 2013 requires lenders to assess the debt servicing ability of their customers for all new property loans, regardless of whether the property is in Singapore or overseas. All existing debt obligations, including those for overseas property purchases, must be included for such assessments.",11,62,2015-05-11-T-004-S-00062

2015-05-11-T-004,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I thank the Minister for the answer. According to the feedback from my friends and residents, a lot of Singaporeans have gone overseas to buy properties because of the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty imposed in Singapore, coupled with aggressive advertisements by foreign developers, including those from Iskandar Malaysia. I would like to ask the Minister  is there any possibility or any review on lifting the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty for Singaporeans?",1,65,2015-05-11-T-004-S-00065
2015-05-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, we should look at this separately because we have a set of cooling measures which is put in place taking into account global conditions and our domestic property market, and we know why there is a need for that. It is really because, globally, interest rates are low, returns are low, there is a lot of liquidity in the market, and investors everywhere, including in Singapore, are looking for things to invest in. If we are not careful, then you can easily have a bubble being built up, which is why we had to put in place cooling measures in our property market. In that context, whatever we do on the cooling measures has to take into consideration the broader global developments as well as our domestic property market trends, and ensure that we continue to have a stable and sustainable property market within Singapore.",1,66,2015-05-11-T-004-S-00066
2015-05-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the advertising standards which the hon Member talked about, that is something which we can and should look into. In fact, I understand that the Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore is already looking into reviewing their guidelines for advertising on investment in properties, and the guidelines would apply to investments in property both locally as well as overseas. They are reviewing the guidelines and I think they will put in place a set of more stringent guidelines in future. What is important at the end of the day is that individuals must have responsibility when they make these decisions, and we have to continue to raise the awareness of potential investors and educate them to make sure that they do sufficient due diligence before they make any property purchases, overseas in particular.",2,67,2015-05-11-T-004-S-00067
2015-05-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"There are many risks. I have mentioned over-supply risks as one of the considerations. There are also foreign exchange risks which can move easily against the investors' favour. There are risks of changes to tax and regulatory frameworks governing property ownership. For example, there may be rules that restrict the non-residents' ability to sell a property in that country easily. And these are risks that can happen in any investment in overseas property. These are risks that we must continually emphasise. The CEA and MAS, as I mentioned earlier, will step up their efforts to help investors understand these risks better and do their due diligence.",3,68,2015-05-11-T-004-S-00068

2015-05-11-T-005,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Teo Ser Luck),"Our broader transport goal is to encourage the use of public transport and reduce reliance on private vehicle ownership, whether they are EVs or not.

2015-05-11-T-005,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Minister of State for the answers. I have three supplementary questions. The first is on the duration of 10 years for Phase 2. Ten years seem to be quite a long time. I understand that yes, there is a need for the investment to be recuperated. But given that many cities have already moved on to large scale commercial implementation, it means that these countries will gain the advantage of wide-scale EV implementations over us. Will we lose out in terms of building capabilities among our companies and also in our country's leadership in sustainable and liveable cities, if we wait 10 years before even implementing this on a larger commercial scale basis? And is EV something that is important for us to invest in our economic development?",1,74,2015-05-11-T-005-S-00074
2015-05-11-T-005,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"The second question is on EV ownership. I would like to ask whether EV ownership can be factored into this Phase 2's 10-year period when there has been sufficient infrastructure that has been built. Given the high cost of adoption, will there be incentives such as COE and tax rebates to encourage adoption so that we can have even larger scale of implementation?",2,75,2015-05-11-T-005-S-00075
2015-05-11-T-005,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Lastly, I would like to ask regarding other types of electric vehicles. Will buses and taxis also be factored in Phase 2, since they are also heavily used and have a shared fleet that can be maintained by operator with rapid charging facilities? So, this will also give us the larger scale implementation that we need.",3,76,2015-05-11-T-005-S-00076
2015-05-11-T-005,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck,"I thank Member for the questions. As an overall basis, it is still under the study phase. We have just completed the Phase 1, going to Phase 2. From Phase 1, testing the vehicle out on the roads and then to Phase 2 of rolling out fleet base, we are still undergoing the research and the study. Technology changes all the time. So, the duration of the 10 years is a safer duration for operators when they make for investment. Also, over the 10 years, technological advancements will change. You can see that there are many different types of technology that is advanced – today with batteries that are rechargeable and actually last longer and takes a shorter time to charge.",1,77,2015-05-11-T-005-S-00077
2015-05-11-T-005,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck,"EV ownership right now is still in the study phase but the policy intent has always been not to have individual car ownership and as best possible to use public transport. Nevertheless, we want to give more options to consumers. We have to wait till the Phase 2 study is over because individual ownership is beyond the Phase 2 study right now. So, let us let this Phase 2 to progress and let the operator make the necessary infrastructure investments with the fleet base operation, and see what is the result of that.",2,78,2015-05-11-T-005-S-00078
2015-05-11-T-005,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck,"As far as rebates is concerned, I will refer that to the Ministry of Transport to study what is available and whether it is necessary to come out with the other types of rebates and COE rebates. Currently, they have a review, but I am not too sure if the outcome is in the near term or not.

First, looking at the past few years of financial figures for SMRT, we note that the revenues and earnings of SMRT, fare-based versus non fare-based, there has been a greater discrepancy. There are more profits generated from non-fare businesses. So, how does the Government ensure that the management's attention is not distracted, given that other businesses are bringing the company more profitability?",1,104,2015-05-11-T-008-S-00104
2015-05-11-T-008,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"The second question is regarding the fines. If you look at the fines imposed on SMRT over the last three years, they constitute about, at most 2% of the overall profits that the company made. How is the Government able to ensure that this fine amount or the system of penalty is adequate enough to make sure that the fines serve as an adequate deterrence and penalty for the PTOs?",2,105,2015-05-11-T-008-S-00105

Is this just a goodwill gesture of the company, or is it featured in PTC's assessment of any fare increase proposals by the PTOs? And whether this goodwill could be mandated as a condition for such PTOs to be allowed to diversify into other businesses so that the public interest of Singaporeans and commuters, is protected.",3,106,2015-05-11-T-008-S-00106

It is indeed true that for the last few years, the vast majority of the profits have come from non-fare revenue. In the recent financial year, the profit for the entire SMRT Group is about $91 million.

That is not to say that for every incident, we will fine them to this amount. It really depends on the matrix of factors including, for example, the severity of the disruption, the number of commuters that are affected, and so on and so forth.",3,109,2015-05-11-T-008-S-00109
2015-05-11-T-008,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The reason why this limit was raised was that when we did a review following the December 2011 incident, we felt that the $1 million limit was insufficient for an incident of that severity.

As far as we are concerned, public transport fares are governed by the fare formula that the PTC works on. It is the formula that is used to determine the extent of the fare increase or reduction should the factors call for a reduction, as we expect for this year's exercise. Having said that, PTC will, of course, look into the financial performance of the operator and one of the features is that it requires the operators, if they are doing well, to make a contribution to the Public Transport Fund. Both SBST and SMRT made a contribution last year. This year, when we had the fare increase in April, they made a larger contribution to the Public Transport Fund.",5,111,2015-05-11-T-008-S-00111

I am glad that the Minister mentioned about keeping SMRT focused on operating guidelines and requirements. To keep SMRT focused and to ensure that the profits that it gains every year are not misconstrued as profiteering from passengers, what is stopping the regulator – LTA or the Ministry, for example – from ensuring that every new non-fare business that SMRT undertakes, they have to set up a separate subsidiary?

Actually, it is on the fare revenue of the operations itself which is the vast majority of total revenue. So if you are looking at revenue by far, the vast majority of it comes from operating trains, but in terms of profits, the bulk of the profit, probably up to 90%, actually comes from the non-fare businesses that they run.",2,115,2015-05-11-T-008-S-00115

Therefore, any profits from other businesses, they should use it to cross-subsidise the public transport. Otherwise, why should we allow them to venture into other businesses?

The penalty is up to $1 million or 10% of its annual fare revenue of a rail line. Does that refer to a particular line that has suffered some breakdown or disruption or the rail revenue for all rail operations under the PTO?",1,118,2015-05-11-T-008-S-00118

Right now, we also have an issue of SMRT wanting to go into another area of business which is not its core business. I know the Minister has stated that the Ministry will ensure that they continue to give good services and adhere to the transport standards that are required, but in more specific terms, how would the Ministry ensure that they do not get distracted by making more profits, seeing of course that the computation of the penalties could possibly be quite minuscule, particularly if it is limited only to the revenue of a particular line.",1,120,2015-05-11-T-008-S-00120
2015-05-11-T-008,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew :,"I would say that in reply to the point that the penalty could be minuscule because it is only on the revenue of a particular licensed system, it probably is not so. If you look at the revenue for the North-South and East-West Lines, that constitutes the bulk of the revenue. It could be a very, very hefty fine well beyond $1 million should there be a breakdown that is so severe that the LTA has to impose the 10% limit.",1,121,2015-05-11-T-008-S-00121

And, of course, like I have mentioned earlier, parental guidance is very, very critical. To this end on the parental front, if there are some parents who face difficulties in addressing their children's challenging behaviour, whether online or offline, there are platforms where they can approach community agencies, for example, the Family Service Centre (FSC).

Other countries that have expressed interest to build IRs would be like Japan and Taiwan. This is the international competitive landscape in terms of major cities improving their tourism attractions. This will be one set of considerations that we have to take into consideration as and when we consider the next steps.

For example, it would not be in the public interest to have youth crime take root in society or go out of control. While rehabilitative options are available for young offenders who are suitable, the courts have also meted out more severe punishments if the offence was a serious one, including deterrent sentences to send a strong signal that such criminal behaviour will not be condoned nor taken lightly.

One good example is the Delta League Sports Challenge, which is carried out in June and December, where many youths who have been identified to be at-risk have been engaged by the Police, given mentoring programmes, as well as professional coaching by our S-League teams to give them a sense of purpose and divert them away from crime.",1,175,2015-05-11-T-013-S-00175

2015-05-11-T-013,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We have also launched what we call the Youth GO! programme by the Central Youth Guidance Office. It is a pilot in the Northeast and Northwest districts to look out for youths who hang out late, beyond 11 pm. These youth workers go out beyond 11 pm to identify youths who are regularly out there, not under supervision, so that they can have a person they are familiar with who can work with them should they have issues and prevent them falling into crime.",3,177,2015-05-11-T-013-S-00177

Some of them may just have some form of severe discipline problems in school. This does not necessarily mean they will fall into crime. But if we can engage them early, get them onboard programmes that will put them on productive purposes so that they do not come into bad company. We do not generally want to just address youths at-risk. We want to make it as broad as possible so that even those at the fringes should be involved. That is the hardest part because those youths who have already been arrested, and even given stern warnings, we know who they are, and we are engaging them. But the biggest problem is those who are at the fringes or suffering some form of problems at home or in school that we need to be aware of.",1,179,2015-05-11-T-013-S-00179

Some of these reasons received from the GPs include GPs being satisfied with their own current patient load; some GPs also perceive that the additional administrative burden that comes along with the schemes are quite onerous; some GPs are also quite concerned about the audit process, especially the amount of effort that is needed in the process, such as time needed to retrieve and photocopy relevant documents for the audit; and some GPs are not keen to take on a larger chronic caseload.",1,188,2015-05-11-T-014-S-00188

2015-05-11-T-023,Benedict Tan,Dr Benedict Tan (Nominated Member),"One, the codification of customer due diligence requirements is certainly a large step in the right direction. We have heard stories of how businesses have migrated from one financial institution to another, in search of lower account opening due diligence requirements. Some have experienced how one bank might ask fewer questions about the provenance of funds compared to another bank. How will MAS ensure that the playing field is level for all banks, and that there are no loopholes or leakages?",3,291,2015-05-11-T-023-S-00291

However, banking confidentiality, which has been an important foundation of success, continues to be critical. We must safeguard against spurious international requests, and also safeguard bona fide client confidentiality. In addition to paragraph 30Z on the Conditions for Provision of Assistance to AML/CFT authority, can the House be provided with more concrete details about how these safeguards will work in practice?",4,292,2015-05-11-T-023-S-00292
2015-05-11-T-023,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"Mdm Speaker, I declare my interest as a professional working in the banking industry. I spoke in the House during the Second Reading of the amendment of the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act (TSOFA) in 2013. The amendments were to increase the maximum fine for terrorism financing offences, to make tipping off an offence, to protect the identity of informers, to refine the exemption provisions and to consolidate the terrorism financing provisions under TSOFA. Singapore has, over the last few years, aligned the Banking Act and the Insurance Act as well. These reviews and updating of our laws show our commitment to fight money laundering and to counter terrorism financing.",1,293,2015-05-11-T-023-S-00293

Over the years, the financial sector has seen an exponential increase in the transactions and an increase in players in the form of financial institutions globally operating in and through our front yard. The Government and the regulators have put in place a tough regime that includes much of the prudence I spoke of during the Second reading of TSOFA amendments. I liken the regulators to be the constructors of a shark net protecting the swimmers in a lagoon. They are also the lifeguards, the inspectors of the nets and the ones keeping up-to-date with technology and innovation to improve the reliability of the shark nets and, therefore, the safety of the swimmers.",2,294,2015-05-11-T-023-S-00294
2015-05-11-T-023,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"Our financial sector is the lagoon that financial professionals and financial institutions operate in. Sharks are known to penetrate shark nets and cause serious injuries to swimmers and fatal attacks are not rare. Translate that into our financial sector, an important engine of Singapore's survival, it would damage our reputation as a financial centre. To not have AML and CFT elements penetrate our strict standards and regime is unrealistic.",3,295,2015-05-11-T-023-S-00295

2015-05-11-T-023,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"First, the Act gives MAS the power to conduct AML/CFT inspections to an expanded scope of FIs, particularly holders of stored value facilities and non-bank credit card or charge card issuers. This is an important move in the fight on AML. Ask any banker and they will tell you their antennae are raised if their clients or if they hear from prospective clients that they deal with non-bank financial institutions. In practice, this would trigger enhanced due diligence processes. Bringing into the fold under the Act to regulate such vehicles is to be applauded. Such vehicles count amongst the tools in the arsenal of money launderers.",6,298,2015-05-11-T-023-S-00298
2015-05-11-T-023,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"The second aspect I would like to touch on is the introduction of ""Assistance to Foreign Authorities and Domestic Authorities for their Supervisory and Actions in respect of Money Laundering, Financing of Terrorism and other Offences"". While I am glad to see that there are legislative safeguards to prevent ""fishing expeditions"" and the abuse by a foreign AML/CFT supervisory body, I would like to hear even more from the Minister, the oversight and administration to ensure that the safeguards are indeed adhered to in practice. Some of the concerns were alluded to by Dr Benedict Tan a moment ago.",7,299,2015-05-11-T-023-S-00299
2015-05-11-T-023,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"As important as Singapore's financial sector to be part of the global effort in anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing, we must also ensure that this role, this commitment and stance cannot impinge upon the understanding and the branding of Singapore being a banking centre where the clients or would-be clients of FIs place their trust in that their banking and personal information is well guarded.",8,300,2015-05-11-T-023-S-00300
2015-05-11-T-023,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"Lastly, to have CDD enacted as a primary legislation to be consistent with other jurisdictions also demonstrates our commitment to FATF and Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. This would even send a stronger signal to professionals in the industry that CDD and the maintenance of transaction records and the review of the same will ensure that our surveillance ""radar"" is always up. Proper retention and maintenance of records will be a focus when the situation arises where MAS or the foreign supervisors need to carry out investigations related to AML and CFT.",9,301,2015-05-11-T-023-S-00301

Amongst clients that an FI may have, may already have, may exist one or some who may be sympathisers for a particular group or have grown to be sympathisers for a particular group. They may have had a long and cosy banking relationship stretching back many years.

2015-05-11-T-023,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"First, Dr Benedict Tan asked how MAS can ensure a level playing field for banks with regard to the implementation of customer due diligence requirements. Madam, as I mentioned earlier, detailed customer due diligence requirements are set out in the AML/CFT Notices issued by MAS to financial institutions. The Notices specify what customer due diligence entails and the specific requirements.",3,305,2015-05-11-T-023-S-00305
2015-05-11-T-023,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mrs Lina Chiam alluded to the fact that these requirements may put banks in a conflicting position between developing and growing their business, and being subject to these regulatory requirements. But, Madam, I would say that all the banks and financial institutions around the world understand that there is a need in today's environment to perform such functions to be able to identify and verify the customer's identity, to screen customers against sanctions list and other published databases. This is not an imposition or additional requirement. This is basic to what a bank should do and it is essential, in fact, in preserving trust and integrity in order to develop the banking sector. In fact, these requirements are benchmarked against international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), as well as industry best practices.",4,306,2015-05-11-T-023-S-00306

2015-05-11-T-023,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Arthur Fong likened financial regulators, like the MAS, to builders of a shark net to protect swimmers in a lagoon from the sharks. I would say it is a very vivid analogy. While MAS may be responsible for setting the AML/CFT rules, the integrity of our financial sector is a collective responsibility. Industry stakeholders play a critical role in making sure that these rules translate into an effective regime. We must all work together to make an effective net.",7,309,2015-05-11-T-023-S-00309
2015-05-11-T-023,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Both Mr Fong and Dr Tan asked for more details about how the safeguards for international cooperation will work in practice. Madam, the sharing of information with foreign supervisors is intended to support the effective AML/CFT supervision of international financial groups. While customer information may be relevant in certain cases, information requests will generally relate more to the financial institution itself, such as its policies and procedures, management or control structure information, control lapses that may be identified through inspection and supervisory actions taken against the institution.",8,310,2015-05-11-T-023-S-00310
2015-05-11-T-023,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I had earlier highlighted the key safeguards for ensuring that only bona fide requests are acceded to and that the information shared is kept confidential. To facilitate MAS' assessment, the Act requires that the foreign supervisor be specific on the purpose of the request, the nature of the assistance, and the relevance of the information requested to the foreign supervisor's oversight of the institution it is in charge of. This will address some of the broad requests with tenuous grounds that are typical of the ""fishing expeditions"" that Mr Arthur Fong mentioned.",9,311,2015-05-11-T-023-S-00311

After five years, the average earned interest per year will match the return of a five-year SGS issued at the point of purchase.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will announce each month's issuance size on the first business day of that month. Individuals can apply for the bonds via ATMs of participating banks, at a transaction fee that is charged by the banks. In any month, individuals will be able to apply for the bonds with as little as $500. For a start, each individual can apply for up to $50,000 per issue and can hold up to $100,000 of Savings Bonds at any point in time.

If total applications exceed the total issuance size in a particular month, the MAS will allocate bonds to all applicants in increasing multiples of $500. The allocation to each individual will stop when the individual gets the full amount applied for, or when all the available bonds have been allocated, whichever comes first.

2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Josephine Teo),The Government Securities Act currently allows Government securities to be transferred and pledged. This means that securities-holders can freely transfer ownership to other parties or trade the securities in the open market. The Bill proposes an amendment to allow the Government to impose restrictions on such transfers and pledges in future new issues. This change will allow Savings Bonds to be issued as non-tradeable securities.,23,347,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00347

2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Josephine Teo),"The change is necessary to protect individuals from capital losses. When interest rates rise, instead of selling the bonds in the open market at a price that is possibly lower than the purchase price, individuals are assured of getting their full capital back should they decide to redeem the bonds with the Government. On the other hand, when market interest rates fall, while bond-holders will not enjoy possible price appreciation or capital gain, they would benefit from the higher-than-market interest rates of their existing Savings Bonds which had been locked in at the point of purchase.",25,349,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00349

2015-05-11-T-024,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mdm Speaker, first and foremost, I would like to declare my interest that I work in a financial institution and do engage in bond trading activities in my professional work. This amendment to the Government Securities Act facilitates the issuance of a new class of non-tradeable securities to the public.",1,356,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00356
2015-05-11-T-024,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I support the amendments and the ensuing introduction of the Saving Bonds. There are three reasons why. Firstly, it is an investment with almost zero risk of default; being issued by an ""AAA"" rated sovereign. It will appeal to investors with very low risk appetite. Secondly, it offers holders of the bond a long-term Government bond yield pick-up and at an affordable denomination of just $500. Thirdly, it does not impose penalty or price risk should investors need to encash the bond before the 10 years maturity; yet enjoy interest coupons even when redeem earlier. In other words, it allows investors to enjoy the higher interest rate premium from the longer end of the yield curve without having to give up on liquidity.",2,357,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00357
2015-05-11-T-024,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In this day and age where markets are volatile and full of surprises; and where investment products are increasingly complex, the Saving Bonds is just what some financially less literate individuals would need; the peace of mind of a safe credit and a steady stream of returns with flexible redemption options.",3,358,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00358
2015-05-11-T-024,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Given the simplicity of Government issued Saving Bonds, we can expect investors to be spared the many pages of terms and conditions of a typical investment product as well as both the fine and the bold prints.",4,359,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00359
2015-05-11-T-024,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Of course, the other plus is that the transaction cost for such investment is likely to be lower than those offered by financial institutions. Hence, it is most suited to ordinary investors who just want a simple and low-cost investment alternative with reasonable returns and flexible tenures for their financial planning as well as to meet their long-term retirement needs.",5,360,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00360
2015-05-11-T-024,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Currently, the closest comparable is the Singapore Government Securities (SGS), which comes in higher denominations and investors would have to take the price risk when it is sold, as the bond is traded in the secondary market.",6,361,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00361
2015-05-11-T-024,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"From a risk-return analysis stand point, the Saving Bond is certainly of more value than SGS as it comes with a free put option for investors to put the bond back to the Government if they need the cash. In market terms, this is known as the ""free lunch"" part of the Saving Bond. When the bond is being put, investors still get the returns for the shorter tenure they hold.",7,362,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00362
2015-05-11-T-024,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Given this free put option feature, I agree that the bond should be targeted and limited to individual investors and not to institutional investors.",8,363,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00363
2015-05-11-T-024,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Also, there is a need for the cap as otherwise we may potentially see a huge surge in bank deposit withdrawals due to the attractiveness of the Saving Bonds. The implication is that it may push up bank interest rates and result in a tighter monetary condition in the financial system.",9,364,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00364
2015-05-11-T-024,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"While it is mostly pluses of the Saving Bonds, I would like to point out a few areas where investors of Savings Bond ought to take note of. Firstly, the interest rate for the bond is fixed at the time of the purchase and does not change for the life of the bond. So, in a rising interest rate or rising inflation environment, the return of the bond might not keep up with inflation or with rising interest rates. Of course, if the investors of the Saving Bonds take the view that interest rate or the inflation is rising, the investors can early redeem the bond and re-invest later when the rates increase. But that would require investors to understand the interest rate markets; which is not something that is easy for a layman to understand. Hence, I hope that Government would consider to also issue inflation-linked bonds in future so that there is a safe avenue for retirement savers to hedge the inflation risk other than by way of investing in stocks or property which comes with downside risks.",10,365,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00365
2015-05-11-T-024,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Secondly, based on current SGS yields, the CPF rates still offer better returns. It still makes sense to save most of the retirement money in CPF LIFE. However, in times of changing interest rates environment, retiring investors may need guidance as to whether they should maximise their savings in CPF or withdraw some of the funds to invest in the Saving Bonds.",11,366,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00366
2015-05-11-T-024,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"During the Ministry of Manpower Committee of Supply debate, I am glad to learn that the Government will be providing guided one-to-one retirement planning service for CPF members approaching retirement. Saving Bonds should feature as another instrument in the portfolio of retirement planning and the guidance will be helpful to CPF members who are approaching retirement.",12,367,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00367
2015-05-11-T-024,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I have a few questions for the Senior Minister of State. Firstly, can the Saving Bonds be transferred or inherited by their beneficiaries should the investors pass away? Secondly, how would the Government intend to use the funds raised from the Saving Bonds if they are given the money condition may not have the opportunities where the Government could invest at a return higher than what the bond is paying and whether there will be also an overall cap as a proportion to the Government total debt? Thirdly, would the statutory boards also consider issuing Saving Bonds in future?",13,368,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00368
2015-05-11-T-024,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mdm Speaker, with our society ageing rapidly and individuals needing to save even more due to increasing longevity as well as in anticipation of rising cost of healthcare, the Saving Bonds is a thoughtful initiative by the Government to help Singaporeans better plan for retirement and is another compelling investment alternative worth considering for the public at large. Madam, I support the Amendment Bill.",14,369,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00369
2015-05-11-T-024,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"Mdm Speaker, as the Senior Minister of State has explained, the amendment to this Bill is to prepare for the recently announced Government Singapore Saving Bonds. The Senior Minister of State has also explained the mechanisms of the Saving Bonds. These bonds have a 10-year term with step-up interest and which rates are linked to the long-term Singapore Government Securities (SGS) rates. Unlike existing SGS, the new Saving Bonds will not be transferable, hence, necessitating this amendment to the Bill.",1,370,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00370

2015-05-11-T-024,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"Interest rates in Singapore have been low. The average member of the public has few alternatives to invest in very safe asset classes to meet their long-term financial goals and to save extra for retirement needs. Yields on bank savings have been extremely low. Fixed-term deposits, or FDs, with banks have slightly better rates but are of relatively short duration of up to around two years. Even with their better yields, fixed-term deposit rates from banks have lagged behind inflation rate for many years already.",3,372,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00372
2015-05-11-T-024,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"Corporate bonds have better yields, but most required investments of $250,000 and above per transaction. More retail corporate bonds have recently been launched since changes to our policy on corporate bonds which have made it easier for companies to issue retail bonds. But interest by companies to issue such bonds is still low. There are also risks in corporate bonds as they are primarily based on the financial stability of the issuing company. Ten-year SGS, whose recent yield has been between 2% and 3% per annum, can already be purchased on tranches of $1,000 and above. However, there appears to be low interest in SGS by retail investors. Not many understand the mechanism and how to trade this on the secondary market, if they wish to cash out before the maturity, plus there may be capital loss when sold on the secondary market.",4,373,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00373
2015-05-11-T-024,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"In the search for better returns on savings in this period of low interest rates and high liquidity, many small investors have dabbled in risky investments or penny stocks without fully understanding the risks, with some losing a good part of their hard-earned savings while trying to beat returns from bank savings. The to-be-launched Singapore Savings Bond is, therefore, a useful new instrument that can help the average small investor save for the long term and get yields close to inflation rate. Investors should keep the Savings Bonds to maturity to maximise the returns but can sell back to the Government at any time at a lower interest rate, depending on the durations that the bonds had been kept for. They act like FDs offered by the banks but have more flexibility in withdrawals. The Singapore Savings Bonds could push banks to work harder on making their FDs more competitive.",5,374,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00374
2015-05-11-T-024,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,I have three questions for the Senior Minister of State regarding these Savings Bonds.,6,375,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00375
2015-05-11-T-024,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"First, I would like to know what will happen should a person who owns such Savings Bonds passes on. The Bonds will form part of his estate. However, this Bill makes such Bonds non-transferable. These Bonds would then have to be sold back to the Government and the monies returned to the estate. However, the family members would then lose the advantage of the step-up interest rates. Can the Bonds be transferable in the event of death if one wishes to hold on to the Bonds received through inheritance? Are there special circumstances where the Bonds can be made transferable?",7,376,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00376
2015-05-11-T-024,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"Second, I would like to know how investors' education would be conducted with the launch of the Savings Bonds and how purchases can be made easily. I think the Bonds can encourage people with spare cash to save more for retirement in a safe instrument while maintaining the flexibility to cash out on the investments if needed. It would be a pity if the take-up rate is low due to a lack of understanding of the product and also due to maybe difficulties in purchase. The Bonds can be sold through existing financial institutions, as the Senior Minister of State has said. Are incentives attractive enough for banks to promote these Bonds, given that they may sell other instruments that may pay better commissions but may be riskier for investors? Furthermore, the Savings Bonds compete directly with FDs offered by the banks. So, banks may not be interested to market these.",8,377,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00377
2015-05-11-T-024,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"Third, I understand from reports that there is a cap on the amount that can be invested on the Savings Bonds by any persons. I would like to know how the cap will be set because, if it is set too low, it may not be attractive enough to encourage retail investors to bother with yet another investment to keep track of. If yields on the Savings Bonds are equivalent to the SGS 10-year bonds, may I know why there is a need to restrict the amount that can be invested by any one person? Thank you.",9,378,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00378
2015-05-11-T-024,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the Government Securities (Amendment) Bill. We know the main reason for this deck of amendments is to facilitate the issuance of the Singapore Savings Bond. I applaud this move by the Government to introduce this ""first-of-its-kind"" and ""one-of-its-kind"" financial instrument for the benefit of the people of Singapore.",1,379,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00379
2015-05-11-T-024,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"I recall after the sub-prime crisis in 2008 and the collapse of Lehman Brothers that many Singaporeans, including numerous organisations, suffered deep and painful monetary losses. Those affected delved into products, such as the High Notes and Pinnacle Notes, which were actually instruments whose risks were not apparent to many investors. Many Singaporeans burnt a big hole in their pocket thinking that 4% to 5% returns placed them in better stead for the same period than in fixed deposits and other structured instruments.",2,380,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00380
2015-05-11-T-024,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"Since that saga, I believe many local investors have become more apprehensive and careful with the rich diversity of financial products available in the local market. There have also been many who have urged the Government to offer alternative savings plans, other than the CPF, which can afford security and guaranteed returns but allow for flexibility and liquidity. It is with this as a backdrop that this Bill is introduced and comes, with it, the new Singapore Savings Bond which will be introduced later this year to offer a new instrument which is safe, secure, guaranteed, flexible and yet affordable for the general populace to benefit and save their excess cash for a rainy day.",3,381,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00381
2015-05-11-T-024,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),There are three reasons why I strongly support the introduction of these amendments and the Singapore Savings Bond.,4,382,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00382
2015-05-11-T-024,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"Firstly, the building of retirement savings. The step-up interest provided under the Singapore Savings Bond encourages savings for the longer term yet does not penalise early termination nor withdrawals which sometimes are done for exigencies or a sudden need for cash. This will also fill the lacuna of fixed deposits which are traditionally for one to two and, sometimes, three-year periods. It also provides a much better yield than putting your cash into savings account whose interests rates are a far cry and pale in comparison with the payoffs from the Singapore Savings Bonds.",5,383,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00383
2015-05-11-T-024,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"Secondly, principal protection and it is flexible. Laudably, it is going to be a low-risk and safe long-term savings instrument for excess cash. The Singapore Savings Bonds will be backed by the Government and will not be traded and there is no risk that an investor gets back less than his investment. The flexibility also gives Singapore Savings Bonds an edge over a fixed deposit with a bank, which pays no interest if the principal is withdrawn before the account's maturity.",6,384,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00384
2015-05-11-T-024,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"With the potentially low tranches and denominations of $500, many Singaporeans will be able to benefit from it. In particular, many middle-income Singaporeans, especially Professionals, Managers and Executives, and those who have cash in bank which they set aside for rainy days, can utilise this long term and secured savings instrument and benefit from the steady interest payouts. This is particularly so as there is a cap in the amount which a person can lock into his CPF account as well as the Supplementary Retirement Scheme. Having this new instrument will provide more options and encourage more Singaporeans to build up their nest egg in a safe and flexible manner. This will also circumvent the unnecessary risks associated with instruments like those affected during the 2008 and 2009 financial crises.",7,385,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00385
2015-05-11-T-024,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"Thirdly, there is no lock-in period and it is liquid. What is most attractive about this Savings Bond is that there will be no lock-in period as they are going to be issued at regular intervals and can be redeemed the same. There are also no penalties and one still earns the accrued interests for early redemption. This will offer strong liquidity and also peace of mind for Singaporeans who place their monies in them.",8,386,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00386

2015-05-11-T-024,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"How will the Singapore Savings Bond adjust and reflect market sentiments, especially when interest rates rise much above the coupon rate and in instances where they fall rock bottom or when inflation propels? With guaranteed and fixed interest payouts, how is the Singapore Savings Bond going to stay true to its credo of being flexible, safe and protected? On this note, I agree with hon Member Mr Liang Eng Hwa's suggestion of having inflation rate-linked bonds as well.",12,390,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00390

2015-05-11-T-024,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"I am also urging if Government can allow SRS monies be used to purchase these bonds since, unlike CPF monies, SRS monies left with the bank earn a meagre interest rate.",14,392,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00392

2015-05-11-T-024,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon),"Finally, I hope the Government will make the purchase and redemption of these bonds easy and accessible by all Singaporeans and only Singaporeans. The passing of this Act and introduction of this bond is a milestone. But the follow-through, implementation and execution will be crucial as the beneficiaries are individual Singaporeans. I urge the Government to enhance the communication of this product so that even more Singaporeans can be made aware and benefit from this scheme, particularly the middle-income and PMEs and any Singaporean who have cash to save for a rainy day.",16,394,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00394

Second, it is also a low-cost instrument which you can invest in with as little as $500, and this will benefit many middle-income PMEs. Third, it is a flexible investment option which allows you to redeem at any time, and you will not suffer any losses from early redemption.",19,397,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00397

Let me address the points raised by the Members, together with some of the feedback that we have received from the public, on the Savings Bonds programme.",1,401,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00401
2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"First, I would like to assure Members of the House and the public that the programme will not adversely impact the Government's finances. All proceeds from bond issuances cannot be spent but are instead invested. As a result, Government's assets will increase by the same amount as its liabilities, leaving the reserves unchanged. Overall, as a Government, we continue to maintain our strong net asset position, and expect the returns from investments to cover the interest cost of the bonds.",2,402,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00402
2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Additionally, the liquidity risk from the programme will be manageable as the total issuance is not expected to add significantly to the size of total Government borrowings. In any case, total Government borrowings will be kept within the limit authorised by Parliament under the Government Securities Act.",3,403,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00403
2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Liang has asked if Statutory Boards will consider issuing Savings Bonds. The proceeds from bonds issued by Statutory Boards are used primarily to meet payments of development projects on a continuing basis. It may, therefore, be difficult for them to manage the liquidity required by the flexible early redemption feature of the Savings Bonds.",4,404,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00404
2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Liang has pointed out that the cap on individuals' holdings of Savings Bonds will mitigate the programme's impact on the banking system. In addition, we expect the programme size to be small relative to total bank deposits, and the impact on the banking system is, therefore, likely to be limited.",5,405,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00405
2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,I will now move on to address the questions raised on the features of the Savings Bonds.,6,406,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00406
2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Tay has asked how the Savings Bonds will reflect market sentiments and remain flexible, safe and protected when there are market interest rate movements and changes in inflation.",7,407,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00407
2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Like conventional SGS, the interest rates on Savings Bonds are set to compensate for expected future inflation. But interest rates on such bonds may not offer full protection against unexpected inflation. However, the key difference from conventional bonds is that holders of Savings Bonds enjoy full protection from price depreciation or capital losses. In the case of conventional bonds, which are tradable, prices fluctuate with interest rate changes. During a period of rising inflation expectations, interest rates may adjust upwards and cause the prices of conventional bonds to fall. Savings Bonds, however, can always be redeemed at the initial purchase price. This full-redemption feature of Savings Bonds prevents such rising inflation expectations from eroding the value of the savings.",8,408,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00408
2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"I should add that the redemption and interest on Savings Bonds are guaranteed by the Government, which has received ""AAA"" credit ratings from international credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Moody's consistently since 2003. It is therefore a very safe investment option.",9,409,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00409
2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Tay has noted that Savings Bonds have a fixed interest rate schedule, which provides greater certainty to individuals as the interest income will not fluctuate with market movements. It is fixed, it is logged in at the point of issue, the schedule is known to the person buying the Savings Bonds. And even if there are market changes in interest rates, that schedule will be honoured. When market interest rates fall, existing bond-holders will therefore benefit from receiving higher-than-market interest rates. On the other hand, when interest rates rise, bond-holders can make use of the flexibility of the early redemption feature to redeem their bonds if they wish to do so. They can then re-invest the proceeds in the new issues of the Savings Bonds.",10,410,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00410
2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"We have also received some feedback from the public on whether the Savings Bonds can be floating-rate bonds, where the interest rates move with the market. Some have also asked if new Savings Bonds can be issued to existing bond-holders automatically when interest rates rise.",11,411,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00411
2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,The Government has carefully considered and decided against including these two features in the design of the Savings Bonds. Let me explain why.,12,412,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00412
2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"First, issuing floating-rate bonds creates more uncertainty for the individuals, as there would be both upward and downward movements over time. And, as I explained earlier, in a rising interest rate environment, the bond-holder can redeem his existing Savings Bonds at the initial purchase price and re-invest the proceeds by applying for new issues of the Savings Bonds. In this way, he can potentially enjoy higher interest rates without having to face the downside risks of floating interest rates.",13,413,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00413
2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Second, an automatic rollover into new Savings Bonds may not be beneficial for all bond-holders. To illustrate, take a 10-year Savings Bond issued in January 2016 that will earn 2.5% interest per annum if held to the full 10 years. Let us say that in the first year, this bond earns 0.9% and the interest rate will step up to 1.9% by the fifth year. Suppose in the fifth year, the bond-holder could also purchase a new 10-year Savings Bond issued at 3% interest which pays a first year interest of 1%. This is clearly not an attractive option, compared to the 1.9% he is already getting on his existing bond by then. Even if the first-year interest rate of a new issue was attractive in comparison, the bond-holder may prefer to hold on to the existing bond because the interest payment is due shortly – and he would like to be able to use the money, or wait for even higher interest rates before switching. Therefore, the choice of whether to redeem existing Savings Bonds and apply for new issues with higher interest rates will be better left to the individual bond-holders than to have the Government automatically roll it over.",14,414,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00414
2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"To reiterate, the design of the Savings Bonds is expected to offer a safe savings option for individuals while also allowing them the flexibility to redeem their bonds in any given month. It may not be an inflation-linked bond as Mr Liang and Mr Tay have asked the Government to consider, but in effect, the full-redemption features allow bond-holders to mitigate against risks of soaring inflation and higher interest rates.",15,415,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00415
2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"On a related note, some people have also asked if Savings Bonds offer good returns, compared to existing savings and investment options.",16,416,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00416
2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,Mr Tay will be pleased to know that the interest received on Savings Bonds will be tax-exempt.,17,417,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00417
2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The returns on Savings Bonds are pegged to the market yields of conventional Singapore Government Securities, commonly known as SGS. The full interest rate schedule for each bond will be announced by MAS when the application period opens each month. Over the past 10 years, the 10-year SGS yield has generally been between 2% to 3%. Compared to SGS, the Savings Bonds offer attractive returns, considering the additional benefits of capital-guarantee and flexible redemption. Mr Liang has characterised this as a ""free lunch"". There are very few ""free lunches"".",18,418,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00418
2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"We expect that the interest rates paid by the Savings Bonds would be higher than that of shorter-term fixed deposits but lower than the longer-term CPF monies. Savings Bonds are thus meant to complement, and not replace, existing instruments like fixed deposits, bonds and equities. Mr Yee also talked about corporate bonds. But I should add that the other investment options carry varying levels of risk which investors ought to familiarise themselves with before plunging in.",19,419,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00419
2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,Mr Tay has also asked that investors be allowed to use their Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) monies to buy Savings Bonds. Others have pointed out that CPF monies cannot be used. The Government will consider the suggestion of allowing SRS or CPF monies to be used to buy Savings Bonds. It makes sense to start the Savings Bonds with cash purchases as it complements the CPF scheme. There are also ongoing reviews to provide CPF members more investment options. We will consider all these in totality.,20,420,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00420
2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"To address Mr Liang and Mr Yee's query, the Government will allow Savings Bonds to be transferable to beneficiaries in the event of death of a bond-holder. Such transfers can be effected in full, without being constrained by the cap on individual holdings. However, a beneficiary will not be able to apply for new Savings Bonds if his total holdings exceed the cap, until maturity or redemption of the existing bonds brings him below the cap.",21,421,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00421
2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Tay and Mr Yee have also noted the importance of communicating the details of the Savings Bonds programme to the public. To ensure that Singaporeans are aware of the features and application process of Savings Bonds, MAS will be conducting a public education campaign through the media and its industry partners. A dedicated website will also be set up for the public to obtain information on Savings Bonds, and a public hotline to answer enquiries.",22,422,2015-05-11-T-024-S-00422

2015-05-11-T-024,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"As to why there is a cap on individual holdings, it is precisely to allow as many individuals as possible to gain access to the Savings Bonds.

However, there is a risk that drone operators may unintentionally fly too close to an aerodrome or military installation. This will pose not just a security risk, but also a safety threat to aircraft taking off and landing. As such, has the CAAS considered requiring drones above a certain weight or size to be equipped with geo-fencing capabilities? Using geo-fencing, the drone can be programmed with the coordinates of aerodromes and security-sensitive areas in Singapore. If it tries to enter these areas, it will be forced to turn around or land.

It was recently reported that the US Federal Aviation Administration is working with private companies to test commercial drones that can fly beyond an operator's line of sight. This will open up the possibility for more sophisticated drone operations, such as package delivery.

In particular, I would like to highlight that aerial filming of sports events is fast becoming a norm, and it is a trend that we should encourage, to keep sports exciting, thereby attracting an active following.",3,512,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00512
2015-05-11-T-025,Benedict Tan,Dr Benedict Tan,"The organising of sports events is becoming increasingly complex and onerous, as we set higher standards for sports safety and compliance. For example, to organise a race at the National Sailing Centre at East Coast Park, organisers require a permit from the Maritime Port Authority. On top of that, to do aerial photography of the event as part of the media coverage, it seems a permit is also required from the Commissioner of Police to bring the unmanned aircraft into a special event area, and yet another from the CAAS to operate the unmanned aircraft for commercial photography within 5 km of an aerodrome. I would like to ask if it is possible for the Minister to streamline the application of multiple permits and provide a timeline for the application process, to reduce the hurdles for event organisers.",4,513,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00513
2015-05-11-T-025,Benedict Tan,Dr Benedict Tan,"Paragraph 14(b) of the Bill clarifies the definition of an unmanned aircraft. The definition clarifies specifically that an unmanned aircraft excludes a balloon or kite. In a similar vein, given the rapid growth of the sport of kite boarding / kite surfing, I hope the Bill will also clarify specifically that kite boarding equipment – including those with GoPro cameras mounted – are also not considered unmanned aircraft.",5,514,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00514

2015-05-11-T-025,Mohd Ismail Hussein,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"However, as I have lately discovered, there is more to these devices than its use in the military or as a hobby. Most recently in Nepal, drones were used in rescue missions to photograph and map areas affected by the earthquake in Nepal. It proved useful in aiding crews and rescue workers to plan and pin-point areas to focus on. Due to its versatility, drones with cameras attached have also found its uses in law enforcement, scientific research and journalism, just to name a few.",2,517,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00517

2015-05-11-T-025,Mohd Ismail Hussein,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"Firstly, there seems to be very little data on how prevalent are usages of drones in Singapore.

2015-05-11-T-025,Mohd Ismail Hussein,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"Secondly, given that offences related to the use of drones are strict liability offence, there should be a greater effort by the Ministry to educate the public on the do's and don'ts in using drones as well as better information on where are the protected or restricted areas in Singapore where flying drones are off-limits. Does the Ministry have any plans to educate the public and can the Ministry share what these plans are? Can the Ministry provide more clarity and specifics on the use of drones in residential areas, schools, high-rise buildings, stadiums, parks, etc. especially where there is higher possibility of causing injury to people or damage to properties?.",7,522,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00522
2015-05-11-T-025,Mohd Ismail Hussein,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"Thirdly, there are already businesses out there exploring the commercialisation or the commercial use of drones for example in film-making, photography, journalism, etc. Does the Government have any plans to regulate the sale of drones and to what extent will it be regulated so as to strike a balance between encouraging innovation and ensuring responsible use of drones?",8,523,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00523
2015-05-11-T-025,Mohd Ismail Hussein,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),My last question is on insurance coverage.

2015-05-11-T-025,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mdm Speaker, first, let me thank all six speakers who have spoken out and all of you have supported the Bill. You have raised a number of interesting questions, comments and queries. Let me try to group them together into issues and address them in turn.",1,538,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00538
2015-05-11-T-025,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"By way of introduction, I think basically many have spoken out in support of the potential for the use of drones, whether it is in terms of dealing with natural disasters or commercial potential. Dr Benedict Tan spoke very eloquently on the use of it to support sporting activities, for filming purposes and so on. And yet, I think everyone has also spoken on their concerns over privacy, on security and safety. Indeed, that really is the challenge and the dilemma we face - how to find a judicious balance that would safeguard us as much as possible with regard to issues of safety and security, and so on, and yet allows sufficient potential for operators and individuals to experiment, to innovate and to use it for the right purposes.",2,539,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00539
2015-05-11-T-025,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Ismail Hussein asked if we could provide information on the prevalence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in Singapore and how many known users and suppliers there are, both for hobby and commercial purposes. But the answer is that actually we do not know because right now we do not track the number of unmanned aircraft users and suppliers. For us, I think this is somewhat difficult and, to a large extent, impractical because the public can easily purchase unmanned aircraft in many stores in Singapore - for hobbyists, order them online from overseas; or for the enthusiasts, they will actually build or modify some of these unmanned aircraft themselves. What we do know is that, on average, on a monthly basis, over the course of the first few months of this year, we are receiving about 50 applications for permits. Fifty applications per month this year, compared to about, on average, 12 applications per month last year. And so you have seen that huge increase over the course of the first few months for this year, and you expect that this will increase especially with the new regulations. But also without the regulations, I think there is a greater interest. Hence, we think that there is a need to introduce this Bill both to educate and alert the public but also to put in place the right processes.",3,540,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00540
2015-05-11-T-025,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Dr Tan asked if kite boarding equipment is considered unmanned aircraft. Let me give him the definition. A device that is not manoeuvred by electronic means but is physically tethered such as through strings and manoeuvred by these physical means or are uncontrolled such as free balloons does not fall under the definition of unmanned aircraft for the purposes of this Bill. Under the Air Navigation Order, kiteboarding activities are already regulated. So the answer is that it does not fall under this Bill but if you are speaking specifically on kiteboarding, that is already being regulated.",4,541,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00541
2015-05-11-T-025,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Some have asked on the number of incidents or near misses involving UAVs in Singapore. There have been over 20 unmanned aircraft incidents reported in Singapore since about a year ago. So far, we have not received any reports of injury or damage to property associated with these cases, but I think it is really more of good fortune than anything else.",5,542,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00542
2015-05-11-T-025,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Ang Wei Neng had a very interesting query on whether there were incidents of unmanned aircraft dropping onto MRT tracks. Actually, there have been two such reported incidents. In both incidents, a member of the public was flying the unmanned aircraft in a nearby open field and lost control of the unmanned aircraft, and this is within visual line of sight, this is not even EVLOS. But even within visual line of sight, he lost control of the aircraft in a nearby open field and one of them came to rest on the side of the track and, fortunately, no train service was disrupted, no damage was caused to the MRT tracks, no one was injured. One of these incidents is under Police investigation while in the other incident, the member of the public was issued a stern warning for an offence of ""Negligent Act which Endangers Life or Personal Safety of Others"" under the Penal Code.",6,543,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00543
2015-05-11-T-025,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Ang has proposed that train depots be added to the list of security sensitive locations. In designating security sensitive locations, I think the Government needs to take a calibrated approach based on an overall threat assessment. Let me assure him that although MRT depots may not be designated as security sensitive locations, any reported incident of aerial surveillance by unmanned aircraft will still be investigated by the Police, who have the necessary powers to deal with persons with malicious intent to compromise the security of such places.",7,544,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00544
2015-05-11-T-025,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"As for the threat to safety of train services, this is covered by existing regulations and guidelines. The operation of heavier unmanned aircraft which may cause serious damage and unmanned aircraft operations for commercial purposes will soon require a permit. For hobbyists and operation of light unmanned aircraft, we have enhanced guidelines for their use, and the Police have powers under the Penal Code to charge those who operate unmanned aircraft in a negligent and irresponsible manner which harms or threatens public safety.",8,545,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00545
2015-05-11-T-025,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Some of you have also asked questions on special event areas. Let me try to address this. Examples of special event areas could include venues of major events where a significant congregation of people can be expected, for example, at the Sports Hub, the Padang and their vicinity during the National Day Parade. To ensure the safety and security of people attending these events, all operation of unmanned aircraft over such areas will require a special permit from the Police, which will determine the conditions under which the unmanned aircraft can operate. The carriage of payload, if any, must also not compromise the safety of the intended flight.",9,546,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00546
2015-05-11-T-025,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Ang Wei Neng, Mr Gan Thiam Poh and others asked about the enforcement powers related to unmanned aircraft. Breaches of unmanned aircraft regulations will be investigated by Police officers or safety inspectors authorised by CAAS or auxiliary police officers that are authorised by SPF or CAAS. The enforcers are given powers to assume control of an unmanned aircraft in order to fly the aircraft or to end the flight of the aircraft, or to land it. How this will be done will depend on the circumstances, taking into consideration the need to ensure public safety.",10,547,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00547

I think it is something that needs to be built up and increase over time. But this is really not so easy an issue to deal with. Some Members have pointed out that times to shoot it down may actually cost more damage and I fully agree with you on that. So, any action that we take, we have to consider very carefully.",11,548,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00548
2015-05-11-T-025,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh had a question on enforcement could be done before the unmanned aircraft carrying any prohibited items takes off, especially if explosives are being carried. A lot of it will depend, for example, on intelligence, on early warning, perhaps given by members of the public and the Police will have to assess any information received and, if necessary, take pre-emptive action to deal with it. In addition, when Police officers respond to unmanned aircraft-related incidents or come across suspicious persons with unmanned aircraft during their patrols, they will check to see if the unmanned aircraft is carrying any prohibited item. The shorter the range, meaning if it is within line of sight, it is easier for the Police to try and trace it back, try and deal with it; the longer the range, the greater the area of uncertainty and the more difficult the job will be for the Police.",12,549,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00549
2015-05-11-T-025,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Ismail Hussein had a very interesting question on strict liability offences. Let me clarify that even though the prosecution does not need to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew or had reason to believe that the area flown over is a protected one – meaning that the prosecution does not need to prove beyond reasonable doubt – the accused also has the defence that the unmanned aircraft was not flown intentionally into the protected area but the overflight was caused perhaps by weather conditions or perhaps some other unavoidable cause. So, this would have to be taken into account even though we go with a strict liability regime. I would also like to assure Members that protected areas will be properly described and published in the Gazette that CAAS will be issuing so that there will be no mistake on the part of the accused or ignorance that we really do not know that these are the gazetted areas.",13,550,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00550
2015-05-11-T-025,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"On extent of punishment, there were some who felt that the punishment may not commensurate with the threat that such UAVs pose. In particular, Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked if the penalty for committing an offence for carrying dangerous substances using an unmanned aircraft is too light.",14,551,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00551
2015-05-11-T-025,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mdm Speaker, if a person plans to use the unmanned aircraft as a weapon or as a means to carry out an attack, he may be prosecuted under a host of other Acts. For instance, under the Terrorism Act, the Chemical Weapons Act, the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act or the Penal Code. In reality, we have no shortage of Acts to try and catch you in a very comprehensive manner. The penalties for these offences can range from up to 10 years imprisonment, up to $1 million fine and caning. In more extreme cases, offenders found guilty could face the death penalty or life imprisonment.",15,552,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00552
2015-05-11-T-025,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Let me now touch on privacy issues because quite a number of Members – Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Dr Benedict Tan, Mr Gerald Giam – have highlighted privacy as an area of concern.",16,553,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00553
2015-05-11-T-025,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Privacy-related incidents where a person uses an unmanned aircraft to pry into another person's property and privacy will be investigated on a case-by-case basis. As a general principle, enforcement action will be taken against users whose activities constitute an offence under existing laws such as the Penal Code and the Protection from Harassment Act 2014. The inter-agency Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Committee, which I spoke about in my earlier speech and which was formed at the beginning of the year, is also looking into a comprehensive framework on the use of unmanned aircraft in Singapore and will look specifically and more deeply into the issue of privacy, to see if our current laws are adequate and if any regulatory enhancements are needed.",17,554,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00554
2015-05-11-T-025,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"It was mentioned that maybe, the lighter unmanned aircraft ought to be regulated differently. I think it is a complex issue. The threshold that we use today is 7 kg. I will try to address the points raised by Mr Seng Han Thong because it can seem quite confusing. Anything that is less than 7 kg, flying below 200 feet, outside of 5 km of an aerodrome, not flying over gazetted areas and special event areas, not carrying out commercial and special activities, do not need a permit. Let me try to say that again because I know that there are a lot of ""nots"" somewhere. Not more than 7 kg, not higher than 200 feet, not within 5 km of an aerodrome, not carrying out commercial activities, not overflying specially gazetted areas or special event areas, you do not need a permit. Anything else – and that means over most of Singapore – you need a permit.",18,555,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00555
2015-05-11-T-025,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"As for between 2 kg and 7 kg, can we have a different regime? I think that is something that we can look at more deeply. Right now, the regime in many countries is using 7 kg. This is all up weight – it is not just the weight of the drone itself. It is all up weight, 7 kg. It is something that most countries use and, in fact, CAAS is working with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to try and see if there a way to harmonise as well as to expound on some of the requirements for unmanned aircraft going forward, because I think this is a challenge that many countries are indeed dealing with.",19,556,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00556
2015-05-11-T-025,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"On public outreach and awareness, Members have also mentioned this and it is really an important area. CAAS has started distributing an advisory to all households on the safe and responsible use of unmanned aircraft for recreation and private uses. As Mr Seng Han Thong has said, there are six ""dos"" and eight ""don'ts"". Thank you for reminding us. He is an expert in this House on this area. We will also be distributing posters to all educational institutions and hobbyist clubs next month. CAAS will also be conducting a series of briefings for key stakeholders, such as operators of unmanned aircraft for commercial and specialised services, as well as hobbyists, recreational users and retailers. Further information can be found on the CAAS website.",20,557,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00557
2015-05-11-T-025,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"On permits, some Members have asked about permits and I have tried to explain under what circumstances those are required. There are others who have expressed some concern that you might need a multitude of permits from different agencies. I certainly understand that concern. CAAS will be the one-stop agency for the application of all permits needed for unmanned aircraft operations. Depending on the scope, the complexity, the type of operations, CAAS will then need to coordinate with other agencies in the evaluation of the application and the relevant permits will be collated into a single document for issuance to the applicant. Mr Gerald Giam had a query on how long it would take. The permits will take on average about two weeks but it depends really on the complexity of the application. On average, we take about two weeks.",21,558,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00558
2015-05-11-T-025,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"There are also a number of other points that Mr Giam has raised, a number of useful suggestions and we will certainly take them back and look at them a little bit more. I just wanted to make a clarification on why we single out commercial operators which was the point that he talked about. On the one hand, we do not want to be overly prescriptive and hence, we decided not to say that you must have geo-fencing, so on and so forth. That could be overly prescriptive in mandating certain requirements.",22,559,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00559
2015-05-11-T-025,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"What we do is try and adopt a risk-based approach and to assess the operator, the applications on their own merits. But we think that requiring a commercial operator to have a permit, both an operator permit as well as activity permit, is probably the right thing to do just to ensure that we look more carefully into its operations, into the way that they deal with safety, and even to some extent, if necessary, into the training of the people operating this. Why? Because we believe that for commercial operations, they could be using a range of UAVs. There could be a wide range of activities and so the risk exposure will vary accordingly. If you have a range of UAVs, different people operating them, covering a range of different activities in different areas, the risk of exposure could vary and increase accordingly. And because the activities are likely to be repetitive, possibly, the risk will also correspondingly increase. So, its activities, its flight paths may be complex, it may entail the delivery of a payload, it could entail more challenging manoeuvres being conducted. And so, we think that for commercial operators, we will require an operator permit and then the activity permit. If there are repeated activities over the same area doing the same thing, a little akin to what Mr Seng Han Thong had mentioned for his grassroots activities, we think you could have one single activity permit covering that same range of activities but it covers you for a period of time.",23,560,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00560
2015-05-11-T-025,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Finally, on insurance. Let me address Mr Ismail's queries on insurance coverage. Based on checks done by CAAS, there are insurers that are prepared to offer third party liability coverage for property damage and injury to persons arising out of unmanned aircraft operations. There is coverage for damage to the unmanned aircraft too. But I understand not many queries, not many interested parties that have been made queries about purchasing such insurance coverage. The UAS Committee has included insurance as part of its work in studying the regulation of unmanned aircraft activities in the longer term. It is not covered in this Bill but it is certainly something that we are looking at for the next round.",24,561,2015-05-11-T-025-S-00561

In any case, when CAAS evaluates applications for unmanned aircraft operations, for example, from commercial operators, whether the operator has applied for relevant insurance coverage will also be a consideration, and could be quite a significant consideration, especially in cases where the unmanned aircraft operation may pose some level of safety concern. That is something that we will take into account but certainly, the next time round, when we have to address and revise some of these regulations, we certainly shall have a more definitive stance on this position.

Clause 3 requires all third-party taxi booking services with more than 20 participating taxis to register with LTA, in order to operate in Singapore. We think ""20"" is a reasonable threshold. It allows very nascent services to be exempted from registration, which would provide them some room to experiment before their size reaches the registration threshold. Clause 7 specifies that anyone providing an unregistered service is liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both. These penalties are the same as those prescribed in the Road Traffic Act for a person operating an unlicensed taxi company.",15,585,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00585

First, third-party taxi booking service providers must dispatch only licensed taxis and drivers who hold valid Taxi Driver's Vocational Licences, if the commuter requests only taxis.

Second, to ensure that taxi services remain a mode of public transport that is equally accessible to all members of the public, bidding and pre-trip tipping for taxi services will not be allowed.",19,589,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00589

2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"We have all heard that the third-party taxi booking apps are fast gaining popularity among commuters. Besides making it easier to match taxi drivers to commuters, it also helps commuters at remote locations find a taxi more conveniently. Whilst the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has reiterated before that taxi services are de-regulated, efforts now to regulate third-party taxi booking should not be seen as a reversal of policy. Rather, I think it will give the LTA power to safeguard the interests of commuters.",3,664,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00664
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Many of us learn of the concerns of third-party booking apps from news reports elsewhere in other cities, highlighting safety concerns and risks that commuters faced. Protests by taxi drivers in other cities against such apps and private hire cars also raise confusions on the legitimacy of such services. In fact, in many cities, if you read the news reports, the initial euphoria of cheaper commuting and greater flexibility has since evaporated and replaced by risks and concerns that commuters may face.",4,665,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00665
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"For our commuters, there are four concerns which I wish to highlight for which the LTA may need to take steps to address.",5,666,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00666
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"First, I am glad that the regulations address concerns such as whether the taxi driver dispatched by the third-party taxi booking apps has a proper vocational driving licence; and whether a properly inspected taxi is being used instead of a private car where issues such as insurance coverage remain hazy; or whether the commuters will end up having to pay for hidden surcharges for using such services.",6,667,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00667
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Secondly, most third-party taxi booking apps require commuters to set up an account and provide sensitive information such as credit card details. This raise concerns on how the service providers may use the data. I hope the Ministry can offer assurance whether the Personal Data Protection Act or other regulations will be able to address this particular concern.",7,668,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00668
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Thirdly, there are also commuters who asked if non-taxis could be used for bookings made through app service providers. This is especially so as the same third-party apps operator can have different products and services to meet the needs of commuters, either for normal taxi hire or for private limousine services. Invariably, this will lead us to consider the role played by operators such as Uber and Grab. You see, in the market, I think there is some confusion. For Uber, they have various sub-products ranging from UberTaxi, UberX and Uber Exec. For Grab, you have GrabTaxi and GrabCar options.",8,669,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00669
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Commuters need to know under what conditions such private limousine services are allowed. For instance, some operators have this convenience built into their booking systems where after three unsuccessful taxi-matching efforts, commuters will be prompted with an offer for a private limousine service. Some commuters have been reported to be confused, not knowing whether to reject the car that came to pick them up or how to deal with or lodge complaints against these drivers should disputes arise.",9,670,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00670
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Fourth, the next concern relates to how some of these drivers and apps service operators operate. Unlike conventional private limo services which only levy flat charges, some commuters are surprised when they find surge pricing levied by the new private car hire services they took on via these third party apps. For example, during rainy weather or peak demand period, such as concert, end of concert, end of major events, such services levy higher charges and many commuters are unfamiliar or unaware, feeling aggrieved that they may have been ripped off. Private limousine services should also not be offering metered charges but yet, their apps allow them to contain fare meter options similar to taxi meter, whereby drivers can use it to take on street hails or driving by taxi stands or popular tourist attractions to offer their services to commuters and tourists.",10,671,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00671
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"The second group that may be affected are taxi drivers. And to that end, I would like to declare my role as the Executive Advisor of the National Taxi Association. There are, indeed, increasingly more taxi drivers who use these apps services so that they can take on additional bookings on top of their taxi operator's booking, street hails and commuters waiting at taxi stands.",11,672,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00672
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),I would like to urge that the LTA be ready to intervene when it is clear that the interests of taxi drivers may be compromised and there are four concerns that I wish to highlight.,12,673,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00673
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"First, how do we ensure that third-party taxi booking operators are held financially accountable? They do not have huge investments in vehicle fleet to at least be held financially liable should the need arise. Some drivers shared with me that they did not receive prompt payment of their fares from these operators, causing them cash flow problems such as rental fees, fuel costs and ERP charges that they incur daily. So if there is a delay in collecting payment, they would have to find other ways to pay for these costs. Some drivers have also gone as far as to worry whether these operators will exit the market suddenly, taking along with them monies and incentives owed to taxi drivers or even refunds owed to commuters.",13,674,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00674
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"The second concern  how do we ensure that third-party taxi booking operators treat our taxi drivers fairly? These new operators have started to choose taxi drivers, using their own internal rating systems to deactivate taxi drivers' accounts with the third-party taxi booking services. This is of particular concern as these apps companies are seeing fast growing numbers of registered drivers and users. Whilst it is important to create new urban transport solutions, we have to be mindful that checks and balances need to be in place to ensure that no one operator becomes the most dominant, and end up with the power to dictate the way services are delivered, how fares are set and how drivers are selected.",14,675,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00675
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Taxi drivers also shared with me that there are increasingly more incidents of commuters who made bookings but did not appear at the pick-up points. A driver recently related his experience where the commuter he picked up using his taxi operator's call booking system also made a booking using the third-party apps, resulting in two taxis arriving at the same location to ""fight"" for the same commuter. There are currently no penalties imposed on these no-shows but conversely, if a taxi driver does not appear on time, he faces disciplinary action by the taxi operators, and now, he, too, faces disciplinary action by third-party taxi operators. And taxi drivers may also be blacklisted from future bookings or even be called up for interviews by the LTA should the commuters send in a complaint.",15,676,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00676
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Thirdly, taxi drivers also shared how drivers of private limousine services start to show up at taxi stands to pick up customers they have secured using third-party booking services. There have been instances of those who even tout their services at taxi stands, cruise terminals, tourist attractions, hotels and night spots and even compete for street hail jobs using their metered functions in the apps. We have surfaced the feedback to the LTA and it is important that educational efforts be enhanced and enforcements be undertaken so that the drivers and commuters know where the regulations lie relating to these two different types of transport services.",16,677,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00677
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Fourthly, should there also be regulations governing the licensing of private limousine services and the types of drivers they hire? Currently, these drivers do not need to possess a vocational driving licence and there are no requirements for retraining unlike those imposed on taxi drivers. Some have called for these drivers to undergo security screening, medical check-ups and compulsory Medisave top-ups and LTA's Vocational Licensing Points System to be levied on them. For a level playing field, it may be necessary for the LTA to also regulate third-party bookings and drivers for private limousine services.",17,678,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00678
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"The third group of persons that is affected by this new regulation are taxi operators. Currently, taxi operators in Singapore have to meet strict service and availability standards set by the LTA. They have also sunk in huge investments to meet these licensing conditions. In fact, not long ago, a taxi operator had to surrender his taxi operator licence and sell off his fleet because he failed to meet the standards.",18,679,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00679
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Today, not many cities in the world have ventured into legislations on the use of third-party taxi apps. This is despite the fact that many taxi operators and their hirers have taken their displeasure to the streets with the uneven level playing field available to third-party booking services. As such, LTA's move to ensure some level of consistency and business operating conditions for third-party booking operators should be a welcomed move by the taxi operators in Singapore.",19,680,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00680
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"The fourth group is the new group of players in this market and these are the third-party service operators. Disruptive technologies such as those brought on by third-party taxi booking apps, are bringing about new urban transport solutions and prompting existing operators to explore new possibilities to stay competitive. As these apps are able to link commuters and drivers from all taxi fleets, they have maximised the matching processes.",20,681,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00681
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"While these have been popular and convenient, some of their practices, however, are questionable. For instance, some operators have been advertising through their apps that their fares using their own private limousine services can be cheaper than taxi services, leading commuters to feel that the two are the same. These operators have also urged drivers to set up their own transport company and legally become a one-man private limousine service. Thereafter, they will lease a car to these drivers and send them bookings through their third-party apps. In reality, limo rental companies and third-party booking operators should employ these drivers instead.",21,682,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00682
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Mdm Speaker, we need to right-size our rules. I agree that we need not start off with too many rules to reduce all the risks that commuters and drivers may be exposed to. We should instead take note that commuters' habits are changing, and that it may be better to regularly review the rules governing the relationships between commuters, taxi drivers and taxi operators. For example, the existing tripartite framework involving the LTA, taxi operators and the National Taxi Association can also be expanded to include the third party taxi booking services operators. Incorporating them into this framework may enable them to emulate efforts by existing taxi operators, for example, by contributing towards helping taxi drivers with their Medisave contributions and other positive efforts that they can do to create a better industry for all.",22,683,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00683
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Under the new regulatory framework, I am also uncomfortable with the restriction that says taxi booking services cannot ask commuters to indicate their destinations. Third-party booking apps allow us to consider the possibility of implementing a taxi shuttling service. While this is not available today, this service can help us resolve some level of our taxi availability issues and make every taxi work harder, but not necessarily every taxi driver. These smart apps can easily calculate the fare for each driver based on the pick-up and drop-off locations, offering separate meters for each commuter in the same taxi. The driver can pick up two to three commuters along the way if the apps can assign the jobs effectively. People do not need to necessarily board the taxi at the same point, but they can be dropped off at points near to one another.",23,684,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00684
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Furthermore, the prevalent use of third-party apps has already hit our shores. We should also find ways to acknowledge their role in addressing taxi availability and also take a re-look at the Taxi Availability Indicators, especially in relation to the 250-km daily mileage requirement where with better taxi matching, there has been less empty cruising and enhanced taxi availability at remote locations.",24,685,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00685
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Mdm Speaker, beyond taxi booking, it is important that our early efforts in regulating apps booking or matching services send the right signal to investors, inventors, users and businesses. To this end, I believe Singapore can be the right place to promote innovations of technologies to solve urban needs – not just taxis but other urban needs – and yet, be the unique location to have the right-sized regulations to ensure that all the stakeholders' interests are safeguarded.",25,686,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00686
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"I would only like to urge that at the end of the day, no one single operator or industry player should be allowed to have huge control of the market share, whether in terms of customer base or drivers' fleet, to the extent that the dominant player ends up dictating the service delivery and terms, benefitting neither the commuters nor taxi drivers. With that, Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.",26,687,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00687
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mdm Speaker, first let me thank all four Members who have spoken on the Bill and for their expression of support. They have raised a range of different issues. Let me start by addressing those issues that are not covered under this Bill called the Third-Party Taxi Booking Service Providers Bill.",1,688,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00688
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Seng Han Thong, Mrs Chiam and Mr Ang Hin Kee gave their comments on distinguishing between taxi booking services and chauffeured vehicle matching services.

2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Some third-party taxi booking services in the market today – GrabTaxi, Easy Taxi and uberTAXI – can also match their users to chauffeured vehicle services. This is actually not a bad thing, because chauffeured vehicle services can plug the gap when taxi demand is extremely high. For instance, on some Friday evenings, it can be difficult to hail a taxi on the roads, or even to book one. And for those who really would like to pay more just in order to be able to get a ride to their chosen destination, chauffeured vehicle services actually can be the means for them to do so. So, some people welcome the convenience. They do not mind paying more to book a chauffeured vehicle service now and then, especially when demand for taxi services are high.",3,690,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00690
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"But what we want to do is to make sure that commuters are allowed to choose and receive the service they want and, therefore, we will require service providers to provide clear, and not misleading, information on the different services available.",4,691,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00691
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"This is why the proposed regulations will require service providers to ensure that their taxi booking service and any other transport matching service that is offered under the same application are clearly distinguished from each other, for example, by using separate and distinct icons. The differences in charges between these services must also be highlighted upfront and highlighted clearly. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, third-party taxi booking service providers can only dispatch licensed taxis and taxi drivers if the commuter requests taxi services specifically. So, the third-party booking app is prohibited from sending a chauffeured vehicle and charging chauffeured vehicle rates if a commuter books only a taxi on his third-party app.",5,692,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00692

While this is not within the scope of this Bill, I do acknowledge the concerns raised. Let me briefly outline the Government's current approach towards this issue.",6,693,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00693
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Chauffeured vehicle services are not new. They have been available in the market. They are commonly used especially for corporate trips and special occasions like weddings, for instance. But what is different today is that the technology has made these services much more easily accessible in terms of matching passengers to chauffeured cars more seamlessly, just like how technology has improved the matching of taxis to commuters.",7,694,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00694
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"There are regulations in place for chauffeured vehicle services. They must be pre-booked. They cannot be hailed on the streets or to pick up passengers at taxi stands like taxis – this is one distinction between taxi services and chauffeured vehicle services. I know Mr Ang mentioned this point, and we certainly welcome feedback and specific information that we can use to track the individuals and the use of such vehicles so that LTA can investigate this more thoroughly.",8,695,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00695
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Chauffeured vehicle services can only use private hire vehicles, which must be registered to business entities. They must also have the necessary insurance cover to be used for hire or reward. Private cars cannot be used to provide chauffeured vehicle services, and any person who does so is liable on conviction to a fine, imprisonment and/or forfeiture of his vehicle.",9,696,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00696
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,The law is clear on the classification of the various types of vehicles and the regulations for each class. The penalties are stiff. LTA will strictly enforce against people who are found to flout the law.,10,697,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00697
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Similar to taxi services where fares have been deregulated since 1998, fares for chauffeured vehicle services are also not regulated. Different service providers charge fares in different ways, depending on the type of services offered and market conditions. This, I believe, encourages more competition and provides a wider variety of services for commuters, although commuters need also to be mindful of the terms and conditions before engaging such chauffeured vehicle services.",11,698,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00698
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Let me also clarify that it is not against the rules for chauffeured vehicle services to utilise their apps as a ""meter"" to charge passengers based on distance travelled and/or time. Some chauffeured vehicle services already do this, while others offer a flat rate. Commuters are free to choose which service they prefer, taking into account the charging methods.",12,699,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00699
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Seng has suggested requiring drivers offering chauffeured vehicle services to hold some form of vocational licence or certification. This is something that we are prepared to consider in the future, if we decide that we need to further regulate the chauffeured vehicle services industry. But at this point in time, I would encourage the service providers to do more to train and to develop the competency of their drivers and to monitor the performance of their drivers more closely.",13,700,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00700
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"We will continue to monitor the chauffeured vehicle service industry. We will refine the regulations if needed. We know that in many countries and cities, there is a tussle involving the taxi companies and taxi drivers on one side, who feel that the responsibilities on them are much more onerous, versus chauffeured vehicle services on the other side, with a lot less regulation and a lot less pressure on these other services. So, we are watching it closely and you can be assured that we will take steps, if necessary, to address any concerns that may arise in our current situation.",14,701,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00701
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Overall, to sum it up, the chauffeured vehicle service industry is fundamentally different from the taxi industry, even if the line today is no longer as clear as it was before. Also, to some extent, many chauffeurs are today former taxi drivers and they welcome the flexibility of another employment option. And so, it is also necessary for us to be quite cautious in how we go about further regulating the chauffeured vehicle industry if we are mindful to do so.",15,702,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00702
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Having addressed that, let me move back to the main topic on third-party taxi booking services. One of the more innovative features offered by some apps is the ability to provide post-trip feedback on taxi drivers. Such feedback mechanisms help to improve accountability, which in turn enhances safety for commuters and encourages higher service standards. In fact, one taxi company – ComfortDelGro – has recognised this benefit and built in a similar feature in the latest version of its own booking app. So, there you see the interplay between third-party taxi booking apps and some of the features that they have, and how it links back to what the taxi companies are doing. And some of these features can actually help to raise the overall standard of the provision of taxi services in Singapore.",16,703,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00703
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"It is also understandable that third-party service providers would want to set internal service standards for their drivers to meet, so as to differentiate themselves to attract as well as retain commuters. On the other half of the equation, some service providers charge a cancellation fee if a commuter cancels his booking, or ban commuters for repeated no-shows . This helps to protect the taxi drivers to some extent. Overall, there are positive developments which benefit the taxi industry.",17,704,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00704
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Ang also spoke about some taxi drivers receiving late payment from service providers, causing them cash flow problems. I understand these concerns. That is why even while we want to try and keep the market competitive, and we do not want to over-regulate, there has to be certain minimum thresholds before we allow some of these service providers into the system. On one hand, certain Members have talked about clause 10 of the Bill, and asked why LTA needs some of those criteria to assess an applicant, why not allow this to be a completely free market. On the other hand, I think Mr Ang has also talked about the need to hold third-party service providers financially accountable because they can exit the market suddenly, and they need to treat the drivers fairly. So, we are trying to find the right equilibrium point, the right balance. We need to keep the market competitive so that there is every incentive for service providers to manage their drivers well and provide good services to commuters. It is not good for the taxi industry in Singapore if we just let any and every applicant, even though it may be below the threshold, into the market. As we have seen in Singapore today, we have quite a number of third-party service providers competing with each other. We think that there is actually more room for others to come in as well, provided they are serious players, provided they treat their drivers fairly and provided that they are financially strong and they are able to last the competition in the market.",18,705,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00705
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Having said all that, I think there may still be occasional disputes between taxi drivers and service providers. And here, I encourage the National Taxi Association – as the representatives of taxi drivers – to assist them in exploring the avenues of recourse available. And LTA stands ready to assist, if necessary.",19,706,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00706
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"To Mr Seng Han Thong's query, LTA will modify the Taxi Service Operator Licence to apply the regulatory conditions on third-party taxi booking services, to taxi booking services offered by taxi companies, where relevant.",20,707,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00707
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Moving on to possible concerns from commuters, Mr Ang may wish to know that third-party taxi booking service providers must comply with all applicable laws, such as the Personal Data Protection Act, and ensure that the privacy of commuters is appropriately safeguarded, as well as the data that they hold.",21,708,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00708
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Some service providers collect personal information, such as credit card details, to provide a more seamless booking and payment experience for their customers. There are also other service providers that do not necessarily require such information, and these can cater to commuters who are not so comfortable with providing their personal information.",22,709,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00709
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Ang and Mrs Chiam voiced some discomfort that the regulations will prohibit third-party taxi booking services from mandating commuters to specify their destination when making a booking. This condition is important. It addresses concerns amongst commuters that some taxi drivers may not accept bookings when they see that the passengers are travelling only short distances, or to certain locations that are more far-flung or where there is a lower chance of picking up another fare on their return journey. We do not want taxi drivers to cherry pick their fares. This is consistent with the approach that we have taken for street hail.",23,710,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00710
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"So, I think we need to clarify and make sure that it is properly understood that commuters, if they choose to do so, can still indicate their destination if they want to. Commuters can still choose to indicate their destination if they think that this will increase their chances of getting a taxi. But what the regulations spell out is that they are not compelled to do so. So, the choice is with commuters – you choose or you choose not to. You choose maybe because you think it gives you a better chance of getting a taxi or, in certain instances, commuters say that ""I better choose not to so because if it is too short a distance, or if it is to a far-flung place, the taxi drivers may actually prefer not to take me or respond to my booking"".",24,711,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00711
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mrs Chiam had another area of discomfort, which is that the booking fee that third-party service providers can charge cannot exceed that charged by taxi companies. She felt that we should let the free market prevail, and let the service providers charge what they wish, to a limited extent.",25,712,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00712
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"I will explain the reasoning for this. I do not want to give third-party service providers the flexibility to charge higher than the taxi companies because I know that in a very short while, the taxi companies will come back to me and say, since MOT allowed a third-party app to charge $4, instead of $3.30, for instance, as a taxi operator, I also want to do the same. I do not want that to happen, because I think it will lead to price inflation for the commuter. Today, there is a certain standard that we have arrived at over time. This is what the taxi companies charge, so we require the third-party apps to charge at this level or no more than this level.",26,713,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00713
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Seng Han Thong asked whether LTA would look into the existing QoS standards imposed on taxi companies for call booking. So far, we have not observed any significant deterioration in their QoS performance. What we plan is for the third-party service providers to give us their data on bookings and which taxis from what companies answered to these bookings, so that we can match this together with the data provided to us by the taxi companies. If some taxi companies fall short and they claim that it is because their taxis have all been answering to all these other bookings, we can match the information provided by the third-party taxi service providers and the taxi companies. That is the intent behind some of the regulations.",27,714,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00714
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"In a nutshell, Mdm Speaker, this Bill aims to safeguard commuter interests by implementing a basic regulatory framework for third-party taxi booking services. At the same time, we hope it provides sufficient space for those services to grow, and we believe that over time, as we have seen already, it will benefit both commuters as well as taxi drivers.

I would just like to seek Minister's answer to the question I asked about clause 10(b)  why LTA would be basing its decision on licensing the third-party taxi booking services on the existing demand of these taxi booking services. It should not matter whether or not there is demand, because if there is demand, then the service would be used, and if there is no demand, then the service would just fade out. So, there is no need for the regulator to decide for the consumers.",1,717,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00717
2015-05-11-T-026,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I think the Member has made a fair point. Overall, clause 10 gives LTA the opportunity to more comprehensively assess the potential of a possible player as well as the potential impact that an additional third-party taxi booking service has on our transport landscape. We always need to have that flexibility in order to assess the impact as well as to assess that individual applicant. But I do agree with the Member that all service providers, ultimately, need to assess the market conditions for themselves and the viability of their business case. Our approach and intent is to be light touch, to be facilitative, but we also want to avoid some of the problems that Mr Ang had mentioned where third-party service providers have delays in paying the drivers, refunding monies, and so on, and we want to try to minimise those situations as much as possible.",1,718,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00718
2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee,"I would like to ask the Minister  earlier you mentioned that chauffeured services vehicles, basically, will regulate their drivers, put them on training and the likes of it, but the reality in the market today is, a lot of the limo leasing companies are urging individual drivers to register themselves as a company. After you register yourself as a one-man company, you go ahead and rent a vehicle from this limo services and you take on bookings from the third-party apps.",1,719,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00719

2015-05-11-T-026,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee,"So I hope that LTA will pay particular attention to this category because, in all intents and purposes, what they are basically doing is to operate like taxi drivers without having to comply with any of the regulations. In reality, if this phenomenon is allowed to grow, it will really put a lot of delays in our efforts to try to ensure that the third-party taxi booking services in Singapore grow in a proper manner whereas you have another group that is basically behaving in an illegitimate manner.",3,721,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00721

It is something that we are mindful of and, in fact, LTA has been stepping up its checks both in response to whistleblowers as well as mystery shopping that it is doing on its own. In recent months, there were a couple of cases that we managed to catch where these people were flouting the law. Moving forward, if you know of more of such cases, or if taxi drivers know of more of such cases, please do report them to LTA. Like I said, we will be happy to step up the checks but also, over time, look more carefully into the issue that you have raised, whether there are measures that we need to take, regulations that we need to adopt, in order to arrest this issue.",1,722,2015-05-11-T-026-S-00722

There are also some parks which have been designated as smoke-free parks as they are in close proximity to institutions such as hospitals and polytechnics. Smoking is also prohibited in selected areas of other parks, such as covered spaces, buildings like shelters and toilets, playgrounds and fitness corners. The National Parks Board works with the Health Promotion Board and its volunteers under the Blue Ribbon project on outreach efforts to discourage smoking in all parks. The Ministry is also considering enhanced smoking prohibition in other premises such as Institutes of Higher Learning.",2,752,2015-05-11-T-032-S-00752

2015-05-11-T-034,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Rental leases are decided based on commercial considerations, with the rates determined by supply and demand. As a general principle, we should allow the market to operate without the Government prescribing how landlords and tenants structure their leases. This would lead to inefficient outcomes and make all parties worse off.",1,758,2015-05-11-T-034-S-00758

2015-05-11-T-035,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Agencies actively enforce these rules, and special attention is paid to higher risk areas such as Geylang. Public officers are empowered to enter premises under specific circumstances for the purposes of conducting an inspection. MOM, SCDF, SPF and URA regularly conduct joint enforcement; and this can be stepped up when necessary. For instance, over the past six months, agencies have systematically inspected more than 600 units known to be housing foreign workers in Geylang. All errant owners or operators of overcrowded properties, and negligent employers, uncovered as a result of these inspections are being taken to task. Agencies will continue to take a targeted, intel-driven approach to prioritise inspections.",4,765,2015-05-11-T-035-S-00765
2015-05-11-T-035,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Beyond enforcement, we are also seeking to raise public awareness so as to change behaviour on the ground.

Within the classroom, our students participate in scenario discussions, projects and deep structured reflection. Outside the classroom, students are exposed through experiential activities, such as community service projects, field trips, and dialogues with community leaders. Through these experiences, our students come to appreciate the importance of respecting diversity and maintaining racial and religious harmony, and to develop empathy and the skills to achieve effective intercultural communication. The importance of respect and cultural sensitivities are also instilled through student code of conduct which prohibits inflammatory content and emphasise mutual respect in all social interactions and online exchanges.",4,772,2015-05-11-T-036-S-00772

Other offences, such as being a member of an unlawful assembly, do not result in debarment. This calibrated approach is needed to maintain public confidence in the safety of our taxi services, especially as it is common for taxi passengers to travel alone and sometimes late in the night.

For lifetime wages specifically, we will look at the individual’s total CPF contributions accumulated over his or her working life as a proxy, and consider those with lower total CPF contributions before they reached 55.

2015-05-11-T-045,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Making sure SEPs comply with mandatory contributions to their CPF Medisave accounts has been challenging. The CPF Board reaches out to SEPs through mailers and road shows to encourage them to make regular Medisave contributions. CPF Board also facilitates arrangement for those who wish to make their Medisave contributions via instalments, and has partnered several Licensing Authorities (LAs) to ensure that their licensees contribute to Medisave. These efforts are complemented by industry or company-led initiatives, such as the Drive-and-Save Scheme by the National Taxi Association and the Serve-and-Save Scheme by Woodlands Transport Services, where the companies make co-contributions to their SEPs Medisave. In addition, the CPF Board has recently introduced the Earn-and-Save Scheme to the real estate industry. Under this scheme, SEPs can authorise their companies to deduct Medisave contributions from their commissions.",3,808,2015-05-11-T-045-S-00808

The higher CPF contributions will go towards helping all CPF members including SEPs meet their ongoing healthcare needs including paying for MediShield Life premiums. In addition, with effect from 1 January 2016, the Government will pay an additional interest of 1% on the first $30,000 of CPF balances for members aged 55 and above. This will be on top of the existing 1% extra interest on the first $60,000 of CPF balances. This means that CPF members aged 55 and above can earn up to 6% interest in total on their CPF savings.",4,809,2015-05-11-T-045-S-00809

For partially closed valves (often due to earlier works which required them to be closed), the problem is resolved by fully opening the valve in the water supply pipe, either by the customer, by the TC, or by PUB. Many of these cases are resolved easily by PUB advising owners over the telephone. For cases due to stoppage of pumps (usually caused by power failure or a faulty valve in the pump system), the problem is resolved by restarting the pump by the TC. For cases of chokes due to encrustation of older pipes, PUB would advise the household to replace these pipes. In most cases, the problem is resolved within the day.",2,847,2015-05-11-T-053-S-00847
