2015-07-14-T-001,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari,asked the Minister for National Development whether he can provide an update on the plans to assist the elderly and physically challenged who require direct lift access but whose HDB blocks are deemed unsuitable for the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) on the grounds of economic and/or technical viability.,1,1,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00001
2015-07-14-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the measures to help residents who do not benefit from LUP or who do not have a lift on their floor; (b) how many of such units have approached HDB for assistance to allow them to purchase another unit or move into new flats for lift access; (c) whether the Ministry provides special consideration for such cases as many may need lifts for mobility reasons and in their old age have difficulty getting new loans from HDB or have already taken two concessionary loans; (d) how many residential units are currently still not able to benefit from having a lift on their floor as the block does not qualify for LUP; and (e) what proportion of these units is due to technical infeasibility and what proportion is due to insufficient units to meet the maximum share cap for the project.,1,2,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00002
2015-07-14-T-001,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the outcome of the trial involving two new lift solutions to provide direct lift access to flats not eligible for the LUP; and (b) whether HDB has found the lift solutions suitable to be implemented for flats not eligible for LUP.,1,3,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00003
2015-07-14-T-001,Lee Yi Shyan,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Lee Yi Shyan) (for the Minister for National Development),"Mdm Speaker, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 1 to 3 together?",1,4,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00004
2015-07-14-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,5,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00005
2015-07-14-T-001,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Thank you. While we try to offer LUP to as many HDB blocks as possible, there are some blocks where the LUP is not feasible due to technical constraints or prohibitively high cost. Through the adoption of new technologies and innovative solutions, HDB has reduced the number of such blocks to about 200. We continue to explore ways so that even more households can benefit.",1,6,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00006
2015-07-14-T-001,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"For example, HDB is piloting two new solutions – the Pneumatic Vacuum Elevator (PVE) and the Vertical Platform Lift (VPL). The PVE has been turned on for public trial last month, while the VPL is currently being evaluated. HDB is testing the new lift solutions to ensure that they are safe and technically reliable before rolling them out. Surveys will also be conducted to gather feedback from users of the PVE and VPL and the results will help us determine if they are suitable for wider implementation.",2,7,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00007
2015-07-14-T-001,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Residents who wish to move to a unit with direct lift access can sell their existing flat and either buy a resale flat or a new subsidised flat if they meet eligibility conditions. Meanwhile, Singaporean residents who are in urgent need of direct lift access due to medical conditions or disability may approach HDB for housing and financing assistance. HDB assesses each request on a case-by-case basis to see how best we can render help.",3,8,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00008
2015-07-14-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for his reply to my Parliamentary Question (PQ). In my experience so far, as the Senior Minister of State had mentioned, HDB does look at each case on a case-by-case basis. The experience of some of these residents is that they want to move out but they cannot; and even through appeals, they cannot get through because most of them are immobile and aged. Therefore, if they want to buy a better flat, it is very difficult to get a loan. Sometimes, they have already taken two concessionary loans. And if they want to downgrade, they seem to have a lot of difficulties in doing so. Many of them have not been successful in such appeals, although the Senior Minister of State mentioned that HDB does look at these on an individual basis. Will the HDB consider giving even more special consideration for such families, especially those who are aged and hardly mobile?",1,9,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00009
2015-07-14-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Second question is this  specifically to the number of LUP flats, there are about 200 left, as I understand it. HDB has done about 98% of flats through the LUP; there are just 2% of flats left. Many residents I meet ask, ""There is just 2% left. Why does HDB not consider removing that cap? There are many flats out there that are technically feasible for LUP, but just that they cannot meet the cost cap."" Given that there are just so few left, why does HDB not consider removing the cost cap?",2,10,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00010
2015-07-14-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),One more question – I am glad to hear that the pilot trials are underway. The question is  would the pilots resolve the cost cap issues and what is the likelihood?,3,11,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00011
2015-07-14-T-001,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. Our assistance rendered to households facing medical conditions and mobility issues is very targeted and specific. So, I would encourage the Member to refer those cases to us to see how best we can help them. If they are willing to be open to flats with lift access in other locations, I am sure we can find alternatives for them.",1,12,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00012
2015-07-14-T-001,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"The 200 blocks or so that are left in the LUP that cannot be done up, as I have said, it is either because of cost reasons or because of technical constraints. For cost reasons, the range is very wide. It can be as high as $200,000 per benefiting unit. In cases like this, if you build a conventional new lift, it serves only two or maybe four units. So, the cost is very high. We have to consider whether that is the best use of our resources. For $200,000, you can build a brand new 3-room flat. Also, if the residents were to have a share, the burden on the residents will also be very high.",2,13,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00013
2015-07-14-T-001,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"As for our pilot trials, the vacuum and platform lifts are low-cost alternatives. The vacuum lift is one that works on differential air pressure. But such lifts will have limitations in terms of how tall a building they can serve. Typically, it is a two- to three-storey building. For flats that have such problems – low-rise flats, very few benefiting units – technically, if the space and so on can accommodate, this might be the solution. We are doing the trial now. We have to see how the public will respond to the trial. The downside, though, is that it is smaller and much slower, about one-fifth or one-quarter of the speed of a normal lift. People who use it would be wheelchair users who really need the access and do not have other alternatives.",3,14,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00014
2015-07-14-T-001,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"All in, we will continue to look for possible solutions, including what the Member has suggested, and try to reduce the number as best as we can.",4,15,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00015
2015-07-14-T-001,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. May I know if there is a timeframe for these trials to be completed and how soon can a conclusion be made so that it can be rolled out to units that can possibly implement them?,1,16,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00016
2015-07-14-T-001,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"The two trials that we talked about, one has been installed in a commercial building. I think it is about three-storey high. The other one – the platform lift – has been installed in a car park complex, which is also a three-storey-high building. The first one is already open to trial; we just started. A fair trial period would be at least six months to gauge the response. The longer we have it, the more we can also ascertain its reliability because it all depends on the traffic and how people use it and whether they can live up to the manufacturers' promise. The other platform lift is still under trial, to be commissioned soon.",1,17,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00017
2015-07-14-T-001,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"So, I think a reasonable period of six months to a year would be good, before we roll out to more estates for implementation.",2,18,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00018
2015-07-14-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Mdm Speaker. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State about the trials. We are trying to solve the issue of very few benefiting units, which cannot afford the cost, but why do we have these trials in commercial buildings or car parks where they are public areas and probably experience heavier usage? So, my question is whether the assessment would be equitable in an HDB housing setting.",1,19,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00019
2015-07-14-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Second, I hear that the cost would be something that will be more favourable. May I know with these two new systems, what is the minimum number of benefiting units that can justify the cost?",2,20,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00020
2015-07-14-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Lastly – among the 200 blocks in Singapore which do not have LUP, do they include blocks where most parts of the units have lifts but, due to segmentation, some units are not benefiting from those? I have a few in my area. Will these units be eligible and considered for this new LUP if these trials are successful?",3,21,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00021
2015-07-14-T-001,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"With regard to the last question, the 200-over blocks include those that are partially served by lifts to every floor now. Because of the block configuration and the way that they are designed – different heights and so on – for certain parts of the block, it is just not possible to have lift access, whereas a good part of the block already has lift access to every floor.",1,22,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00022
2015-07-14-T-001,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"As for the trials, based on our estimation, we can extend to a few dozen of such low-rise blocks. They are spread out nationwide. The various Members would know where they are. But we are still gathering experience. One of the reasons why we do it in a commercial area is because the usage is higher than residential ones. It would help us collect data faster, in terms of higher frequency of use.",2,23,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00023
2015-07-14-T-001,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"I have two such low-rise blocks. I would like to offer them for the trial. I hope this will be a real test of a real low-rise block. There are many of these throughout the island and I think adding on to the two that you have in the commercial block and the car park, I offer my two low-rise blocks for consideration.",1,24,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00024
2015-07-14-T-001,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"<span style=""color  rgb(51, 51, 51);"">  Mdm Speaker, I have heard the suggestion and I have taken note of it.</span>   Mdm Speaker, I have heard the suggestion and I have taken note of it.",1,25,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00025
2015-07-14-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Just a point of clarification. In the Senior Minister of State's replies, he has always mentioned low-rise blocks. The Member Mr Baey Yam Keng asked about high-rise segmented flats because out of the 200 flats that do not qualify for LUP. I have got 32 of such blocks in my estate. That is about 15% of the total national quota in one division. In that sense, I wish to clarify that the new solutions will apply to these high-rise segmented blocks as well. If so, I would also be happy to do some trials.",1,26,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00026
2015-07-14-T-001,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"<span style=""color  rgb(51, 51, 51);"">  </span>",1,27,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00027
2015-07-14-T-001,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"The two trials that we talked about are meant for low-rise blocks. We have to look for other kinds of solutions that will bring the lift service all the way to the 12th floor. So far, Members may recall that, initially, we had 1,000 blocks that were found to be difficult to have lift access. But through a combination of solutions, we managed to reduce them to about 200.",2,28,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00028
2015-07-14-T-001,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"What are these solutions? Some of them are, for instance, lifts that do not use a lot of headroom. So, we can bring the lift all the way to the 12th floor because that is the maximum it can go. Otherwise, you will sacrifice the top floor – they will go without lifts. The other solution is a bubble lift – in some of the Members' areas, there are bubble lifts. These lifts do away with lift shafts, reducing the need to have strong foundational work required to support the lift shafts. The other solution would be building a long bridge to the lift shafts. In other words, you cannot bring the lift shaft so close to the building; instead, you have to extend it out because the buildings have got uneven vertical facades. So, the solution was to build outwards and build access. We have to continue to explore such solutions. LUP has covered 98% of flats, as the Member has noticed. As in many things, the last 2% will be very challenging, very costly and also technically difficult. We will see how best we can continue to find solutions for this 2%.",3,29,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00029
2015-07-14-T-001,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,"My question is  I believe out of this 2%, it could be that, for some units, the cost could be slightly higher than those eligible under LUP. For that kind of scenario, will the Ministry consider still going ahead to offer to the residents, for them to put a vote to it, for them to consider if they still want it if they were to pay slightly more? They can look at the amount to see how much higher they have to pay. I do get this feedback on my house visits, where residents say, ""Show us the cost. It is for us to decide."" Will the Ministry consider that?",1,30,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00030
2015-07-14-T-001,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"<span style=""color  rgb(51, 51, 51);"">  Mdm Speaker, I have heard Mr Gan's suggestion. We will take this into consideration.</span>   Mdm Speaker, I have heard Mr Gan's suggestion. We will take this into consideration.",1,31,2015-07-14-T-001-S-00031
2015-07-14-T-002,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs whether the Ministry will consider allowing HDB flat or private apartment owners to have the flexibility of not allowing their rental tenants to use their home address on their NRICs so as to minimise the possibility of harassment as a result of legal or illegal moneylending activities.,1,32,2015-07-14-T-002-S-00032
2015-07-14-T-002,David Ong,Mr David Ong,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) in the last three years, what is the number of cases of identity card holders who contravene the National Registration Act of not updating their residential addresses within 28 days; and (b) what can the Ministry do to increase enforcement, awareness and compliance to curb abuses.",1,33,2015-07-14-T-002-S-00033

2015-07-14-T-002,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,35,2015-07-14-T-002-S-00035
2015-07-14-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Thank you. Madam, the National Registration Act requires NRIC holders to report any change in their place of residence to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) or Police within 28 days of the change. Any change will also be reflected on their NRICs. This applies to both property owners and rental tenants. Failure to do so is an offence and punishable by a fine or imprisonment, or both. Over the past three years, 61 persons were convicted for failure to report a change of their place of residence, an offence typically committed in furtherance of other criminal offences.",1,36,2015-07-14-T-002-S-00036
2015-07-14-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Updated address records are necessary for Government agencies to get in touch with individuals for various purposes, including the registration of voters by the Elections Department and contact tracing in a disease outbreak situation. This applies to owners as well as rental tenants.",2,37,2015-07-14-T-002-S-00037
2015-07-14-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Similarly, owners or rental tenants should use their current address for commercial transactions, including obtaining a credit facility. A person who uses an outdated rental address when he is no longer staying at the location will not be traceable and will cause inconvenience to current residents of that address. If a tenant dishonestly uses an outdated address to secure a licensed loan, he can be punishable under the Penal Code. Police will also act firmly against borrowers who obtain unlicensed loans with their outdated addresses. Under section 28C of the Moneylenders Act, such borrowers may face imprisonment for up to a year.",3,38,2015-07-14-T-002-S-00038
2015-07-14-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"To ensure that the change of address facility is not abused, including for criminal purposes, ICA requires the NRIC holder to show documentary proof that he is residing in the property before effecting the change.",4,39,2015-07-14-T-002-S-00039
2015-07-14-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,ICA works with HDB to inform property owners during property sale transactions of the need for timely update of addresses. This legal requirement is also made known on ICA's and HDB's websites and disseminated through ICA's numerous outreach exhibitions.,5,40,2015-07-14-T-002-S-00040

2015-07-14-T-002,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, I thank the Member for her question and I appreciate the intent behind her question. But as I have stated, the address on the NRIC, as reflected in the records, serves very important purposes, whether it is in terms of enforcement or contact tracing and for a variety of other reasons. So, we need addresses that are current and that allow our enforcement and other agencies to take appropriate steps, especially when there are specific exigencies. So, a PO Box address or an NOK address does not really serve that purpose. Therefore, I think it would be something quite difficult for us to consider, based on our current provisions and laws.",1,43,2015-07-14-T-002-S-00043

There have been calls to allow the use of these credits, for example, to participate in so-called privately organised events, such as marathons and cycling events and so on. There have also been some calls, for example, to allow the use of credits for people to spectate at sports events, for example, at the recently-concluded SEA Games.

I would suggest that some of these areas also would straddle our other areas of concern, for example, with the way our demographics are evolving, a lot more elderly in our society.

The former treats the less serious cases, while NAMS also treats the more severe pathological gamblers. In addition, there are other private and non-funded community and religious organisations that offer similar services as well.",1,126,2015-07-14-T-007-S-00126

2015-07-14-T-007,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Between 2012 and 2014, Thye Hua Kwan and NAMS saw a combined 2,700 cases. This is about 60% more, in absolute numbers, 1,000 cases more than that between 2009 and 2011. We have looked at the increase and it is, primarily, due to greater public education efforts, which we have stepped up significantly which have raised awareness on problem gambling and encouraged help-seeking behaviour. It is important for people to step forward both as individuals and for their families and loved ones to step forward to highlight those issues. We are encouraged that people are coming forward.",3,128,2015-07-14-T-007-S-00128
2015-07-14-T-007,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"The treatment plan for each problem gambler varies; it really depends on the severity of addiction. It usually involves a combination of counselling and different types of therapy, conducted on an individual or group basis. Psychiatric services may be extended for the more severe pathological gamblers. Financial and legal counselling services, where necessary, are also extended to help the problem gambler and his family cope. Recovering patients are encouraged to join support groups for longer term support.",4,129,2015-07-14-T-007-S-00129
2015-07-14-T-007,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Tackling the complex issue of problem gambling requires the combined efforts of personal responsibility, family involvement, community involvement and, certainly, Government support. The family is often in the best position to detect signs of problem gambling in their loved ones, encourage them to seek help and also support them during treatment. Studies have shown that treatment works best if the problem gambler is accompanied by family members. The community also plays an important part in helping affected families access relevant information, resources and services. For example, more Family Service Centres have stepped up efforts to train their counsellors and social workers to provide the first line of counselling and assistance when families present problem gambling issues.",5,130,2015-07-14-T-007-S-00130

The IMF, with the advantage it has from its preferred creditor status, has, in turn, always repaid its own creditors. Neither has the IMF ever had to use members' capital funds in the IMF to cover losses.

2015-07-14-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, I thank the Member for the question. As I have mentioned just now, the direct impact is limited. If you look at the direct impact of the Greek crisis on the banking system in Europe – so, if we look at the first round impact within Europe itself – even that alone is also not that significant because European banks' exposures to Greece have come down significantly since the height of the crisis. The exposure was about 1.3% of the aggregate balance sheets in September 2009 and it has since come down to 0.3% as at end of 2014. In addition, the European Central Bank and the European Union are likely to take steps necessary to safeguard the Eurozone financial system.",1,154,2015-07-14-T-008-S-00154

Under the Fire Safety (Petroleum and Flammable Materials) Regulations, the import, transport and storage of substances which are highly flammable and beyond certain threshold quantities require SCDF licences. The holders of such SCDF licences are required to impose stringent safety measures with regard to the handling of such substances. However, this does not cover less combustible substances in powder form, such as corn flour.",1,175,2015-07-14-T-011-S-00175
2015-07-14-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Police will assess all relevant factors, including public safety, before issuing Police permits or public entertainment licences for events. If necessary, the Police may impose conditions to prohibit hazardous activities. The event may also be disallowed entirely if it is deemed to pose a threat to public safety. Events involving temporary structures, such as stages, will also require an SCDF permit. This will be issued only if sufficient fire safety measures are in place.",2,176,2015-07-14-T-011-S-00176

A person served with such a notice will have to take steps to abate the fire hazard, such as ceasing the use of flammable materials. Should information be received by Police that a particular event may pose a threat to public safety, the Police will use all measures provided for in the law, including the seizure of items or stopping of the event, to prevent the commission of an offence.",3,177,2015-07-14-T-011-S-00177

The agencies will assess the hazards posed by the materials intended for use at the event, before granting the necessary approvals. Restrictions or additional safety measures may also be imposed to manage safety risks. This may include replacing combustible powder with non-combustible materials, such as water mist, limiting the powder dispersal zone, disallowing sources of ignition within a certain radius, or prohibiting the discharge of powder at mass congregation areas, such as the end point of the run.",4,178,2015-07-14-T-011-S-00178

Firstly, I would like to express my condolences to the family members of the victims who were injured in the Taiwan colour party disaster recently. I want to ask the Minister a few supplementary questions. First, what are the lessons learnt from the colour party incident in Taiwan that are taken into consideration in the regulations governing such similar events in Singapore? How many applications had MHA received pertaining to the use of coloured powder during public events in the past one year? And did MHA reject any of these applications or had MHA imposed additional conditions, as learnt from the recent incident in Taiwan?",1,179,2015-07-14-T-011-S-00179
2015-07-14-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, Police permits had previously been issued for colour-run events in 2013 and 2014 and Police permits have also been issued for annual Rang De Holi events since 2012. Rang De Holi events are to celebrate spring and involve the use of coloured powder. Whether coloured powder would be permitted in future events would depend on the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and SCDF's assessment of the safety risks posed by such activities.",1,180,2015-07-14-T-011-S-00180
2015-07-14-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In terms of the lessons learnt, I think, clearly, one key point is whether adequate precautionary measures have been put in place when such events are organised. As I have explained earlier, in general, there is a range of measures between the Police and the SCDF that can be put in place to ensure public safety and security for such events through the permits and licences that are issued. Beyond that, arising from this recent episode that occurred in Taiwan, the Police and SCDF are looking in a more detailed manner into the incident, its causative factors and, therefore, what lessons we can draw from that and impose appropriate additional conditionality if such events are to continue in Singapore.",2,181,2015-07-14-T-011-S-00181
2015-07-14-T-011,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"One supplementary question. I was wondering, based on events such as this, whether there is a consideration to maybe have a separate category, as the Minister mentioned earlier about partially or not truly combustible materials, so that you can look into potential sources of combustible hazards.",1,182,2015-07-14-T-011-S-00182
2015-07-14-T-011,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, I thank the Member for his suggestion and I appreciate why he raises this. But I do want to point out that, in a sense, almost anything that is potentially combustible can pose a danger. It just depends on the level of concentration. Therefore, if we were to go about listing them, I think it will be a very long list. So, I think we have to go on a risk-based approach to this. Clearly, the highly combustible substances are very tightly regulated. Beyond that, those substances which are of relatively low combustible property, I think we should let the authorities look at this, especially the SCDF, and make the assessment. It may pertain to how it is used or additional restrictions on thresholds, in terms of how much quantities are brought into a particular event or an activity. So, let the SCDF and SPF make their assessment and, if there is a need for further finetuning of our regulations, we will do so.

2015-07-14-T-020,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"(In English)  Mdm Speaker, please allow me to continue in English. My next area of concern is with regard to the appointment of private trustees by institutional creditors. Are there checks and balances in place to ensure that the appointed private trustees carry out their job efficiently and fairly, especially given the fact that since bankruptcy cases can be very long-drawn? I believe that our efforts in improving the efficiency of the discharge process and in relieving the burden placed on our OA may be counter-productive if private trustees do not carry out their duties properly. This would, in turn, hinder the bankrupt's motivation and capability to break free of his status. As much as we want to encourage bankrupts to strive to repay their dues and enforce punitive action on those that do not, we need to ensure that the administrative system is fully capable of supporting this endeavour.",10,271,2015-07-14-T-020-S-00271

While public education on financial management are available through channels, such as MoneySENSE, are there any plans by the Government to have better public outreach to educate potential borrowers on the risks of taking unnecessary credits?

2015-07-14-T-020,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill. In a nutshell, the main aim of the Bill is to introduce a fixed timeframe of seven or nine years for bankrupts to be discharged even if they have not met their target contribution. The trade-off is that the bankrupt will have his name permanently on a public register. This Bill reminds me of a point I raised some years back.",1,276,2015-07-14-T-020-S-00276
2015-07-14-T-020,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"After the Asian Financial Crisis, many businessmen were declared bankrupt with enormous debts, some amounting to tens of millions of dollars. One would intuitively think that a bankrupt with a small debt would find it easier to get himself discharged than one with a large debt. But things did not always work out that way. Some bankrupts with large debts were able to secure a discharge because, as the Courts have rightly and logically pointed out, there was no purpose keeping them bankrupt because it would be impossible for them to ever fully discharge their debts. On the other hand, those with smaller debts could, over time, pay off their debts and, therefore, found it difficult to be discharged until their debts were fully paid off. That did not seem to be correct.",2,277,2015-07-14-T-020-S-00277
2015-07-14-T-020,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Under the Bill, bankrupts can now look forward to a fixed point of discharge, even if they do not repay the target sum. This is more equitable, so everyone is treated the same. But as the rule may encourage bankrupts to drag their feet and wait out the time period, the Bill provides that those who do not fully discharge their debts will have their names permanently retained on a register that the public and financial institutions can access. This strikes a sensible balance. It treats all bankruptcies equally regardless of the value of the debt and allows their discharge. It also incentivises a bankrupt to pay off his debts, which is also fair to his creditors.",3,278,2015-07-14-T-020-S-00278
2015-07-14-T-020,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The road out of bankruptcy is not always a road. Nonetheless, I would suggest that the OA be given a wider discretion to remove a bankrupt's name from the public register in appropriate cases, even though the target contribution has not been fully paid. There may be instances where a person was made bankrupt not because of any financial irresponsibility or culpability, but in cases where he is not to be blamed – large medical bills or because he guaranteed a relative's debts. The OA's wider discretion would allow our new scheme to apply in a compassionate and flexible way where the circumstances warrant it.",4,279,2015-07-14-T-020-S-00279
2015-07-14-T-020,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Next, a point on the OA's power to vary the bankrupt's monthly contribution and target contribution. Under the Bill, the OA determines the bankrupt's monthly and target contribution after the administration date of the bankruptcy. With regard to variations after the initial determination, section 86D only specifies three circumstances in which the OA may issue a certificate reducing the bankrupt's monthly and target contributions. Reductions in all other circumstances, as well as any upward revisions, will fall to be handled by the Court upon the application of the OA.",5,280,2015-07-14-T-020-S-00280
2015-07-14-T-020,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"There should be no need for the OA to apply to Court to vary the contributions. After all, the OA makes the initial determination after taking into account a wide range of factors. Requiring the OA to seek a Court order makes the process cumbersome, adds to the Court's burden and increases costs. The Court already has the power to review the decisions of the OA where a bankrupt or his creditor is dissatisfied with the OA's decision. The OA should be given the power to make all variations and the Court should step in only where the bankrupt or a creditor challenges that decision.",6,281,2015-07-14-T-020-S-00281
2015-07-14-T-020,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Lastly, I would like to comment on the move to require institutional creditors to appoint private trustees when applying for bankruptcy proceedings. This is, in principle, a good idea. The OA's resources are limited and I have received feedback from residents that its officers are sometimes difficult to reach. The Bill seeks to lighten the burden on the Insolvency Office. Banks, finance companies and large businesses will be made to play a more active role in managing the bankrupt's affairs and they have the resources to do that.",7,282,2015-07-14-T-020-S-00282
2015-07-14-T-020,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The question then becomes one of impartiality and even-handedness. Since private trustees are appointed by the creditors, how will they ensure that they will act fairly? This is a matter of concern, since some 51% of bankruptcies involve financial institution creditors. I note that the OA is still responsible for overseeing and monitoring the private trustees. But given the OA's resources, how effective will that oversight be? Hence, I would like to ask the Minister  what assurance do we have that this new scheme will work fairly?",8,283,2015-07-14-T-020-S-00283

As mentioned in my speech yesterday, the OA acts as trustee in over 99% of bankruptcies. Out of the total number of bankruptcies, it is estimated that about 60% are brought by institutional creditors. With the requirement for institutional creditors to nominate private trustees, the number of cases handled by the OA would be reduced. Basically, the approach is that institutional creditors should bear the cost of administration, which will allow the OA to focus more on the smaller businesses and lenders who have lent to someone who goes into bankruptcy.",11,295,2015-07-14-T-020-S-00295

If the creditor is an institution, then it is likely to have calculated its risks, including the costs of bankruptcy. The basic question is whether the ordinary taxpayer should pay for the bankruptcy administration when the creditor is a big bank, or whether we should ask the bank to pay for the costs. Our view is that the bank should pay. The way it works in practice is that private trustees are likely to have provided estimates or ballpark figures of their fees to the bank beforehand.",14,298,2015-07-14-T-020-S-00298

2015-07-14-T-020,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Currently, the OA can issue a certificate of discharge only after three years. We have retained this. The seven-year period was introduced because reviews show that further realisations are minimal after seven years for most bankruptcies; and in recent years, most bankrupts were discharged about eight years after being made bankrupt. So, between three years and seven years, to strike a balance and to incentivise bankrupts to keep up with their monthly contributions, we decided that they should be eligible to be discharged in five years. That is approximately two months to calculate the Target Contribution, 52 monthly contributions and six months to process the discharge. That comes up to 60 months – or five years.",25,309,2015-07-14-T-020-S-00309
2015-07-14-T-020,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Ms Lim also asked about the number of repeat bankrupts and why they are subject to higher Target Contributions. Repeat bankrupts form under 4% of all bankrupts currently. So, it is really an exercise in balancing the interests of the people who have lent money and the interests of the bankrupt. If it is too easy to get out of bankruptcy, then there will be a moral hazard – and society as a whole loses. The loss will also be on small creditors who will be less able to do the risk analysis, compared with larger creditors. Credit flow as a whole will be impacted. If a person who has been a bankrupt gets discharged and then becomes a bankrupt again, it is fair that he be held to stricter standards. The higher Target Contribution emphasises this. Nevertheless, the framework provides them with a chance to make a fresh start.",26,310,2015-07-14-T-020-S-00310

2015-07-14-T-020,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thank you, Madam. I have one clarification for the Senior Minister of State. She mentioned that as far as the private trustees' fees are concerned, they do not factor into the calculation of the Target Contribution. At the same time, it is provided under the law that the debtor bears the primary responsibility of paying those fees. So, from where in the bankrupts' estate will these fees be paid out of?",1,313,2015-07-14-T-020-S-00313
2015-07-14-T-020,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"I believe we are talking about two separate issues. One, when I talked about setting the Target Contribution, when we look at the Target Contribution, you are really looking at the amounts that the debtor should repay. In calculating that, what is looked is at is the debtor's reasonable income or what he is likely to receive. So, the Target Contribution is set without reference to the private trustee's fees.",1,314,2015-07-14-T-020-S-00314
2015-07-14-T-020,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"I believe what Ms Lim is asking about is where do the private trustees' fees get recovered from. She is right that, ordinarily, they will come from the bankrupt's estate. So, if there is anything left over, obviously, it would have to go to the private trustee first. But in doing that, for small amounts, obviously, if the private trustee's fees are too large, then it is not going to be recoverable and that operates as a disincentive for creditors to go after bankrupts for smaller amounts. My answer was in the context of the question of what happens when you have a relatively smaller amount and whether the debtor will bear a heavy burden in fees.",2,315,2015-07-14-T-020-S-00315
2015-07-14-T-020,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, you can see that the way it is designed is intended to make the creditors sit down and think, ""Okay. This is how much the debt is. This is how much the debtor likely has in his estate. This is the amount of fees that the private trustees will have to be paid. If I appoint lawyers, there will be more fees as well. At the end of the day, is there anything left for me to recover?"" In that sense, it encourages, firstly, the creditor to be prudent in lending; secondly, to make a very careful decision before deciding to go after somebody in bankruptcy.",3,316,2015-07-14-T-020-S-00316

This is about this Government's efforts to acknowledge and recognise a leader of the Malay community, an outstanding Pioneer Generation member, our first Head of State and the first President of the Republic of Singapore, Encik Yusof Ishak.

He played hockey, cricket and many other sports. He served as a prefect and was co-editor of The Rafflesian. He was also the first student to have been commissioned as a Second Lieutenant of the Singapore School Cadet Corps.

After he was appointed, he worked very hard to meet people of different races and helped bring trust and confidence in the new Republic. He led Singapore through its most difficult early years, including the racial riots. According to an article in The Straits Times, when he passed away, ""people came out in their thousands"" to bid farewell to their President. ""For Encik Yusof Bin Ishak had always been a man of the people who throughout his public life and despite long periods of ill health had always put people above self."" Thousands of people ""stood in homage in neat disciplined lines, often six deep, quiet and solemn faces to pay their respect and watch the funeral procession.

It also aims to stimulate research and debate within scholarly circles, enhance public awareness of the region and facilitate the search for viable solutions to the varied problems confronting the region and also to serve as a centre for international, regional and local scholars and other researchers to do research on the region and to publish and publicise their findings.

This is timely for more reasons, as it is also our 50th year of Independence. So, we should do our best to honour our Pioneer leaders – the very leaders who laid the foundations for Singapore to grow and come this far. Encik Yusof's role in nation-building reflects the values of respecting elders that are embedded in our society and the Government's efforts to recognise our Pioneer Generation.

2015-07-14-T-022,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Encik Yusof excelled in many things he did, even before he came into public service. As Member Lim Biow Chuan mentioned, in school, he participated in all forms of sports. At Raffles Institution, he played hockey and cricket and took part in swimming, weight lifting, water-polo and boxing. In 1933, he became Singapore's lightweight champion in boxing. I never knew that! As the most outstanding cadet of the School Cadet Corps, he became the first student ever in Singapore to have been commissioned by the then Governor as a Second Lieutenant in the Cadet Corps. He was a school prefect and was co-editor of The Rafflesian. As a leading research centre and think-tank, ISEAS is at the forefront of research in the region, excelling on many fronts and in diverse fields – just like multitalented Encik Yusof",6,403,2015-07-14-T-022-S-00403
2015-07-14-T-022,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Encik Yusof was also a leading public intellectual during Singapore's pre-Independence and early Independence history. In 1932, he joined the staff Warta Malaya, the leading Malay newspaper of that time. His journalistic ability took him rapidly from the ranks to the top posts of Assistant Manager and Acting Editor within a short time. In 1938, he resigned from Warta Malaya and, with a few close friends, established the Utusan Melayu Press Ltd. In May 1939, the well-known Utusan Melayu came into being with Encik Yusof at the helm as its first Managing Director. He was subsequently elected President of the Press Club of Malaya. Encik Yusof was also appointed Chairman of the Public Service Commission in Singapore in 1959 and, in 1965, he became the Chancellor of the University of Singapore. The renaming of ISEAS is thus a fitting tribute to his contributions to advance the public intellect in Singapore and Malaysia.",7,404,2015-07-14-T-022-S-00404

He was conferred the First Class Order of the Darjah Kerabat (The Most Esteemed Royal Family Order of Brunei) by the Sultan of Brunei in 1960 and the Darjah Kebesaran Sri Maharajah Mangku Negara (SMN) by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia in 1963.

Instead of the current structure that provides for the President and various organisations to nominate representatives to the Board, clause 6 of the Bill proposes that the Minister be the sole person to nominate all the Board members. the Minister said that clause 6 was just ""an update"", but is that all that it is?

During the parliamentary debate in 1968 when the ISEAS Bill came up for Second Reading, then-Minister for Education Mr Ong Pang Boon told the House that it was intended that the research activities of ISEAS would increase Singapore's understanding of its neighbours and help us to play a more effective role in the region. He further emphasised that the Board was to represent a wide spectrum of interests – academic, professional, commercial, charitable and governmental. There thus appeared to be a conscious decision that ISEAS should not be seen by our neighbours as an arm of Government but as a research institute where the Government was but one of many stakeholders.",5,421,2015-07-14-T-022-S-00421

Indeed, Encik Yusof was a pre-eminent leader who played a crucial role in Singapore's difficult early years. He was a man with great foresight. When Encik Yusof first took on the role of Yang di-Pertuan Negara, the position carried with it little ready-made standing. As the Head of State of a young Singapore with little resources at its disposal and still uncertain of its place in the region, Encik Yusof had to imbue in the position the dignity and honour he believed was due to Singapore.",25,493,2015-07-14-T-022-S-00493

But Encik Yusof was someone with a vision to look beyond Singapore in her then prevailing state and be certain of what she could achieve, despite the limitations. He believed that there was little to stop Singapore from setting the pace of social change and economic development in the region. He envisioned that Singapore's struggle to find stability in diversity could one day be a beacon to other nations – evidence that a multi-racial society works and a source of inspiration to countries fighting against racial intolerance and religious bigotry.",26,494,2015-07-14-T-022-S-00494

2015-07-14-T-022,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Let me address the issues raised by Ms Sylvia Lim. Ms Lim was concerned about one clause about the appointment of the Board. Now, let me take you back in history. ISEAS, as the first research institute of its kind established in Singapore back in 1968, had various appointment authorities so that there was adequate representation from a range of interest groups and a range of people who could contribute.",2,502,2015-07-14-T-022-S-00502

For one, ISEAS, as I have said in my speech, established its network of relationships, established its scholarship and has a very wide network of people, experts, professionals, policymakers, of key decision-makers, both in Singapore and the region. So, ISEAS is now in a very different position than when it was first set up way back in 1968. And this was not by chance. This was by very conscious effort and hard work over these many years. And I hope that Ms Lim gives recognition to the effort that generations of researchers in ISEAS have given.",3,503,2015-07-14-T-022-S-00503
2015-07-14-T-022,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Second, Board size matters. Too big a Board does not function effectively. In fact, perhaps, I should indicate that when I was in MOE, as well as MTI and in MAS, I had, on various occasions, served on the Board of ISEAS, the East Asian Institute and the Institute of South Asian Studies. At the MAS, I was overseeing a major piece of work on the review of corporate governance of our companies and banks. I can assure you that if you are diligent in looking at how corporate governance works, there is almost a global consensus that Boards that are too big do not function effectively because the responsibilities get diluted and you may not necessarily get the right decision-makers.",4,504,2015-07-14-T-022-S-00504

Clauses 9 to 11 put in financial provisions on ISEAS. The financial provisions relate to the appointment of auditors and to the submission of financial statements. I hope that Ms Lim would agree with me that the proper audit of accounts and the timely submission of audited information are important.

I said that much has changed in the last 50 years. And I think in whatever we do, we need to update provisions in the law to keep up with the changes. I explained at length how, over the years, ISEAS had built up a very wide and deep network of relationships. What was done in the past where we needed various segments to support ISEAS' work, we now have many, many institutions and many, many groups who are in support of ISEAS' work.",1,522,2015-07-14-T-022-S-00522

And, indeed, I fully agree with Prof Tan Tai Yong that ISEAS has been doing well. But I hope that Ms Lim believes in this principle that having done something well, we can always do it better. We can always do it better. And what we are trying to do is to streamline the Board so that the Board can be more effective in discharging its duty. Does Ms Lim not agree that we should always look for improvements in everything we do, whether we are running Town Councils or whether we are running the Government?",2,523,2015-07-14-T-022-S-00523
2015-07-14-T-022,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Third, in terms of the sole appointment authority, she asked about why it then becomes a sole appointer. In fact, as I have said, MOE takes appointments of our Statutory Boards' Board members seriously. If not for that, we would not have so many people serving on our Board and contributing in so many different ways. And not just in MOE. In many of our Statutory Boards, as I have said, the Minister appoints the members of the Boards to the Statutory Boards.

I think, perhaps, Ms Lim underestimates the amount of work that many Statutory Boards undertake to engage their stakeholders. Every Ministry, every Statutory Board, has multiple stakeholders. Every institute in our Universities, every Polytechnic, ITE and so on, also has multiple stakeholders. Therefore, in that regard, ISEAS is no different from all the other Statutory Boards. Does the Institute of South Asian Studies not have multiple stakeholders? Does the East Asian Institute not have multiple stakeholders? Does the Institute of Strategic Studies not have multiple stakeholders? They all do. So, I hope that Ms Lim would not throw up a red herring.",4,525,2015-07-14-T-022-S-00525

I would like to ask the Minister, as a matter of principle, is it not a contradiction when the effort to rename it to Encik Yusof Ishak Institute – even though this is a good effort to honour a President – but at the same time, an effort is also made to change the powers of appointment from the President to the Minister?",2,532,2015-07-14-T-022-S-00532

In fact, I started by saying that the primary aim of this amendment is to rename the Institute in honour of Encik Yusof Ishak. At the same time, we really need to also update provisions. Updating of provisions in legislation is an ongoing effort and I believe that every Member of this House will recognise that we always have to keep up with changes and to make sure that even when things are running well, we continue to improve and do better.

One personal experience I can tell you is what constitutes a good Board. Perhaps, Members of the Workers' Party would like to share their experience on some of these Boards and if they can convince me that a big Board works effectively. Our experience has been that it needs a certain optimal size. Given the nature of the operations of ISEAS, we need an optimal Board size and we need to recognise that ISEAS has, over the many years, built up its relationship with many think-tanks, research centres, stakeholders in Singapore and so on and so forth. So, do not throw a red herring and then talk about this. What we are trying to do is also to improve governance so that we can take ISEAS even further.",2,534,2015-07-14-T-022-S-00534

I think it is a question of not so much of whether the Board is big or small, but a question of why you need the Minister to be the sole appointer. Can the Minister assure us that it is going to be as diversified as what it used to be? And why is there a need to have a sole appointer?

2015-07-14-T-034,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether Singapore's mean daily temperature may increase by as much as 4.6°C by the end of the century; and (b) what measures has Singapore taken to attempt to achieve international consensus on taking concrete steps to reduce the rate of global warming.,1,613,2015-07-14-T-034-S-00613
2015-07-14-T-034,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"The results from Phase 1 of our Second National Climate Change Study, which concluded in early 2015, projected mean temperatures across Singapore to increase by 1.4°C to 4.6°C by the end of the century depending on the level of future greenhouse gas emissions (see schematic below). Without mitigation actions, mean temperatures could increase to 32°C. These findings are consistent with the global projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)",1,614,2015-07-14-T-034-S-00614

2015-07-14-T-034,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"A global challenge, such as climate change, is best addressed on a multilateral basis. We, therefore, strongly support the multilateral negotiations taking place under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), where a new global agreement on climate change is set to be adopted at the 21st Session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention (COP-21) in December 2015 in Paris. Singapore is participating actively in the preparatory conferences and related events of the COP-21. We have consistently tried to play the role of a constructive bridge-builder and have been invited to facilitate numerous discussions at past climate conferences.",3,616,2015-07-14-T-034-S-00616
2015-07-14-T-034,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"This year, we are deeply committed to achieving a meaningful agreement in Paris. It is our foremost priority that the agreement be an inclusive one that enjoys universal participation by all countries, in light of each country's national circumstances and responsibilities. To achieve this, the international community must come together and demonstrate the political will to arrive at a consensus.",4,617,2015-07-14-T-034-S-00617
2015-07-14-T-034,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Singapore submitted its mitigation pledge, known as the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), on 3 July 2015, well in advance of the Paris Conference. We hope that our submission will encourage more countries, especially those in our region, to come forward with their pledges, too. This is important because these pledges, taken over successive cycles, will form the centrepiece of global mitigation efforts under the agreement. No single country can solve climate change alone – all countries have a part to play.",5,618,2015-07-14-T-034-S-00618
