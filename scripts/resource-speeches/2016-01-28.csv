2016-01-28-T-001,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,asked	 the Minister for Home Affairs in light of growing religious radicalisation of youths in the region (a) what plans are in place to further engage religious organisations in Singapore to look out for youths-at-risk; (b) whether informal religious groups are tracked for potential risks; and (c) whether there are controls over visits by radical overseas religious leaders to Singapore.,1,1,2016-01-28-T-001-S-00001
2016-01-28-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mdm Speaker, the threat that our young people can be radicalised based on religion is a serious one.",1,2,2016-01-28-T-001-S-00002
2016-01-28-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"The Government has been working with various community groups and organisations to deal with this issue. Amongst other things, we work with the Inter-Racial and Religious Harmony Circles (IRCCs). MCCY has been engaging the leaders of religious organisations as well as youth leaders in the community and our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). The approach and purpose are to sensitise them to the threat of radicalisation and the need to be vigilant. We will continue to work with community organisations, Self Help Groups (SHGs) like CDAC, Mendaki, Eurasian Association and SINDA, to increase the awareness of this issue amongst our youths.",2,3,2016-01-28-T-001-S-00003
2016-01-28-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Our local Muslim community and religious organisations have also put in considerable effort to counter the radical ideology of the jihadi terrorist groups like ISIS. They are also tailoring their messages and engagement platforms, including social media platforms, to better reach out to youths.",3,4,2016-01-28-T-001-S-00004
2016-01-28-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Besides engaging youths, we have to take other steps to reduce radical religious influences in Singapore. One example is the fact that we do not allow foreign religious preachers to come to Singapore if their teachings are intolerant of other religious faiths and practices. Their teachings are available on the Internet. Even if they do not say these things in Singapore, we cannot allow them to build up their following in Singapore because, fundamentally, those teachings will destroy our society.",4,5,2016-01-28-T-001-S-00005
2016-01-28-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mr Yam also asked whether informal religious groups are tracked for potential risks. Freedom of religion is guaranteed under our Constitution. But any religious group, whether registered or informal, that preaches values or promotes actions that are directly contrary to our social harmony and cohesion, or threaten our safety and security, will be treated as a security risk.",5,6,2016-01-28-T-001-S-00006
2016-01-28-T-001,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Minister for his comprehensive answer. I just have one supplementary question. With regard to control of visits by overseas religious leaders, is there a protocol or Standard Operating Procedure for the approval of the visit pass? In a recent incident involving a particular preacher, publicity had already gone out for his visit to Singapore before his visit was denied by the authorities.",1,7,2016-01-28-T-001-S-00007
2016-01-28-T-001,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The protocol is a very straightforward and transparent one. What are his teachings, what has he said whether in Singapore or outside of Singapore, and, if his teachings are contrary to our values, he will be denied. We cannot control the publicity that others may give. The Member did not mention a name but he is probably referring to a gentleman who, if we look up on the Internet, has said, for example, that it is absolutely wrong to wish Christians ""Merry Christmas"". It is contrary to the teachings of the Quran. He says other things. And, of course, he says it in much more powerful terms than the way I can put it to you.",1,8,2016-01-28-T-001-S-00008
2016-01-28-T-002,,Assoc,the Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs how is Singapore handling the different practices and ideologies in the name of Islam especially in the context of the emergence of groups such as Islam Nusantara.,1,9,2016-01-28-T-002-S-00009
2016-01-28-T-002,Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Prof Yaacob Ibrahim),"Madam, every major religion and religious community has some degree of diversity of thought and practices. So, too, for Islam and our Muslim community in Singapore.",1,10,2016-01-28-T-002-S-00010
2016-01-28-T-002,Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Prof Yaacob Ibrahim),"In 2004, MUIS launched the Singapore Muslim Identity (SMI) project to articulate the desired characteristics of Muslim religious life in Singapore's multiracial and multi-religious context. SMI recognises that the understanding and practice of Islam can and has always been diverse, so long as it remains rooted to a valid tradition. However, if the practices and ideologies of any group are found to be fundamentally errant, MUIS, through its Fatwa Committee, would issue a fatwa or a guidance to pronounce what it finds objectionable and provide guidance to the Muslim community. MUIS would engage such groups to counsel them.",2,11,2016-01-28-T-002-S-00011
2016-01-28-T-002,Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Prof Yaacob Ibrahim),"MUIS has instituted policies that seek to manage diversity, particularly in the regulation of religious activities in mosques. Through Friday sermons and religious classes, the Muslim public is encouraged to be civil and respectful when dealing with intra-faith differences. Through various initiatives organised by MUIS, mosques and Muslim organisations, different segments of the community come together and work on common projects and, in so doing, build community cohesion.",3,12,2016-01-28-T-002-S-00012
2016-01-28-T-002,Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Prof Yaacob Ibrahim),"What we must guard against are ideologies and practices that divide our community and which set our community against the rest of society. For instance, MUIS provides guidelines to ensure that mosques serve as safe and open spaces for all Muslims. We do not tolerate those who sow discord and create divisions between Singapore Muslims and other communities.",4,13,2016-01-28-T-002-S-00013
2016-01-28-T-002,Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Prof Yaacob Ibrahim),"Indeed, there is no place for exclusivist and extremist doctrines. Prominent among the efforts to safeguard our community against radicalisation is the Religious Rehabilitation Group (RRG). The RRG comprises local Islamic scholars who offer advice and counselling. The RRG also recently launched a resource centre and a hotline for members of the community to seek clarifications and advice on relevant queries.",5,14,2016-01-28-T-002-S-00014
2016-01-28-T-002,Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Prof Yaacob Ibrahim),"Now, more than ever, we need our community leaders and religious teachers to speak out against ideologies that create divisions within Islam and between Islam and the wider society. If they do not do so, their silence may be regarded as a tacit endorsement of such doctrines. Everyone in our community must work together to safeguard our way of life and the values that our community cherishes.",6,15,2016-01-28-T-002-S-00015
2016-01-28-T-002,,,"I thank the Minister for the response. Can I just find out if we are able to do more in terms of educational publicity, reaching out to some of the groups which may not be formal? Some of them may inadvertently not realise that they are being taught some of these variants of the religion.",1,16,2016-01-28-T-002-S-00016
2016-01-28-T-002,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Madam, we have put in place what we call the Asatizah Recognition Scheme (ARS) for our religious teachers. If my memory serves me right, over 1,600 teachers have registered. What we would like to encourage is for members of our community to refer to that list, which is available on the MUIS website, for them to find the appropriate religious teachers for their classes.",1,17,2016-01-28-T-002-S-00017
2016-01-28-T-002,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"We are not against informal groups as many find it convenient to organise these based on their needs and demands on their time. The most important thing is that they select the teachers from the ARS. If they can do that, it would be good.",2,18,2016-01-28-T-002-S-00018
2016-01-28-T-002,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Thus far, the list has been well-publicised and well-utilised. We can do more to increase the publicity. We will certainly study the ways in which we can enhance the usage of the list.",3,19,2016-01-28-T-002-S-00019
2016-01-28-T-003,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,asked	 the Minister for Defence (a) if he can provide an update on Singapore's deployment of support to the anti-ISIS coalition since the deployment of a liaison officer to the United States Central Command HQ in December 2014; (b) how effective has SAF's involvement been; (c) whether the annual deployment length has been reviewed; and (d) whether there is any likelihood of an expansion of Singapore's involvement in the coalition.,1,20,2016-01-28-T-003-S-00020
2016-01-28-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Mdm Speaker, I informed the House in November 2014 that the SAF would support the multinational coalition against the extremist threat posed by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS for short.",1,21,2016-01-28-T-003-S-00021
2016-01-28-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"I stated then the reasons for Singapore's participation in global efforts against terrorism. I would like to repeat what I said because I think there is resonance, given recent events in our region. I quote, ""Singapore must resolutely oppose the spread of terrorism in order to safeguard our security here. It is in Singapore's interest to support the multinational efforts against ISIS and its attempts to export terrorism to our region, whether by sending foreign terrorists to carry out terrorist operations or by radicalising regional elements who engage in violence in Iraq, Syria and, subsequently, their home countries. If this terrorism threat is allowed to grow and spread, innocent civilians here and elsewhere could be endangered and killed.""",2,22,2016-01-28-T-003-S-00022
2016-01-28-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"This was in 2014. Since then, there have been attacks in Paris, Istanbul and, most recently, Jakarta. The recent attacks in Jakarta and the arrests of 27 radicalised Bangladeshis in Singapore are unfortunate but stark examples that underscore this truth – as long as terrorist organisations can influence and induct others to their cause and do their bidding, no country is safe, not even countries which are located thousands of kilometres away. Terrorism, too, has globalised.",3,23,2016-01-28-T-003-S-00023
2016-01-28-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"An estimated 600 Southeast Asians have travelled to Iraq and Syria to take up arms with ISIS. In Malaysia, 129 people have been arrested to date for their suspected links to ISIS, including members of its own armed forces. Two Singaporean families have travelled to Syria to join ISIS since 2014 and we have detained five more Singaporeans last year for planning to join ISIS. The return waves of acolytes, trained, inspired, some with battle experience with arms and explosives, can wreak much destruction to our home countries.",4,24,2016-01-28-T-003-S-00024
2016-01-28-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"But more than the physical destruction, ISIS' ability to successfully propagate its misguided form of Islam is a threat to the fabric of our multiracial society. Therefore, Singapore, as a community, must stand in solidarity against the threat of terrorism.",5,25,2016-01-28-T-003-S-00025
2016-01-28-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"The Member has asked for updates on our contributions. Let me now provide these updates. Since December 2014, the SAF has deployed a liaison officer to the US Central Command Headquarters. We have also deployed an intelligence planner since January last year and an Imagery Analysis Team (IAT) since September 2015 to the Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) Headquarters in Kuwait. We also supported air-to-air refuelling operations with our KC-135R tanker from May to August last year. In the short period of three months, our tanker aircraft flew 52 sorties and refuelled 142 coalition aircraft. The IAT deployed by the SAF was the coalition's first imagery analysis capability based at the central Headquarters in Kuwait. And it has been useful because it provides the coalition with useful intelligence support – through looking at the images where they are able to identify terrorist infrastructure and facilities, even where terrorists gather to plan, as well as to avoid targeting civilian areas. The Member has asked whether we intend to expand our involvement. Let me inform the House that responding to requests, the SAF has agreed to deploy the IAT for another year, this year.",6,26,2016-01-28-T-003-S-00026
2016-01-28-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"The threat posed by terrorism is a long-term one and the campaign will not end quickly. By contributing to the international effort to tackle the threat at source, we are contributing directly to our own safety. And this is the reason why the SAF will continue its deployments throughout 2016.",7,27,2016-01-28-T-003-S-00027
2016-01-28-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"More countries have understood this and joined the coalition, including our closest neighbour, Malaysia, because they too recognise that unless the source of this radicalisation is disrupted, our citizens at home cannot be protected, even for Malaysia or Indonesia with majority Muslim populations.",8,28,2016-01-28-T-003-S-00028
2016-01-28-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"As the fight against ISIS evolves, we will continue to assess, on a regular basis, the relevance and effectiveness of our contributions and we will work with partners to see how Singapore can best contribute, moving forward, in ways that are within our means and capabilities.",9,29,2016-01-28-T-003-S-00029
2016-01-28-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I would like to ask the Minister, in view of the passing of the UN Security Council Resolution 2249 in the wake of the Paris attacks last year, which called on member states to take all necessary measures to prevent and suppress terrorist acts on territories under the control of ISIS, is MINDEF considering a different approach to increase Singapore's commitment and contributions to the anti-ISIS coalition?",1,30,2016-01-28-T-003-S-00030
2016-01-28-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mdm Speaker, not so much as a different approach. We recognise that threat levels have gone up, but potential threats, if you like, to various countries have also gone up. ISIS operatives, as they themselves declare, have become more coordinated. They said that they have established an arm outside Iraq and Syria and, as you have seen, in the attacks in Paris or even Jakarta, the ability to orchestrate and coordinate has gone up.",1,31,2016-01-28-T-003-S-00031
2016-01-28-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The threat levels, if you like, to places outside Iraq and Syria have gone up.",2,32,2016-01-28-T-003-S-00032
2016-01-28-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"And, as I have said in 2014, our basis to join the multinational coalition was to protect our Singaporeans here − because we recognise that terrorist attacks will happen. And, indeed, it has, as unfortunately as it is. So, I think it only strengthens our resolve that we have to help other countries attack the problem at source. As I have said, we will contribute in meaningful ways in niche areas and in ways that coalition partners feel that we can contribute.",3,33,2016-01-28-T-003-S-00033
2016-01-28-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"I will remind Members that we were 10 years in Afghanistan against Al-Qaeda and we contributed various elements. Sometimes, it was in hospitals in Oruzgan, sometimes it was sending them our Weapon Locating Radar because that particular base was receiving incoming rockets from rebel bases. And, so, we will find capabilities that we can contribute and, as I mentioned to Members, the Imagery Analysis Team – which was deployed in Afghanistan − others have found it very useful. I visited the headquarters in Oruzgan when our boys were deployed in Afghanistan. While I was there, they were showing me how they were doing renovations to expand the capacity for more of our imagery analysts there. They are thankful for our capabilities, how we are able to make sense of various information streams and then package them in a product that is useful to the coalition in terms of identifying areas in which members can use. I would say that that is external.",4,34,2016-01-28-T-003-S-00034
2016-01-28-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"But, internally, we are also reviewing our plans to make sure that there is better coordination with the Home Team and to make sure that the SAF is able to contribute to security at home.",5,35,2016-01-28-T-003-S-00035
2016-01-28-T-004,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,asked	 the Minister for Social and Family Development what has been the take-up rate of the Lasting Power of Attorney since its introduction and how can the application process be made more accessible for citizens to sign up for it.,1,36,2016-01-28-T-004-S-00036
2016-01-28-T-004,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),The Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) is a legal instrument which allows an individual to plan ahead and appoint a trusted person to make decisions for him should he lose mental capacity.,1,37,2016-01-28-T-004-S-00037
2016-01-28-T-004,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Since the Mental Capacity Act came into effect in March 2010, we have received more than 20,000 LPAs. The take-up rate has risen after we made it easier and more convenient to make an LPA in late 2014. In 2015 alone, we accepted about 8,360 LPAs, which is an increase of almost 160% from 2014.",2,38,2016-01-28-T-004-S-00038
2016-01-28-T-004,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Some of the changes made in late 2014 include simplification of the LPA Forms and reduction of legal terminology that are hard to understand. For Singapore Citizens, we waived the $50 application fee for the most common LPA form used. In addition, we secured the support of SingPost for a free postal service for the public to submit LPA applications via Business Reply Service envelopes. With this, the public no longer need to visit the Office of the Public Guardian to submit the forms.",3,39,2016-01-28-T-004-S-00039
2016-01-28-T-004,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"We very much would like to take the opportunity to encourage more Singaporeans to make an LPA. We also encourage the public to continue to give us feedback, so that we can continue to improve that process to make it a lot more user-friendly. We will continue to improve the process to make sure that the necessary safeguards are still in place.",4,40,2016-01-28-T-004-S-00040
2016-01-28-T-004,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Just a supplementary question for the Minister. I note the number, which is 20,000, who have applied. Certainly, I think the LPA is a useful instrument.",1,41,2016-01-28-T-004-S-00041
2016-01-28-T-004,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"I would like to ask the Minister whether the Ministry is satisfied with the current take-up. Because if you look at the pool that we are trying to target, I would say that every one of us should actually do an LPA. Put in that light, I think 20,000 is a very small number. I think there is a lot of work that needs to be done. I have done a dialogue on LPA with my residents and, from the questions that were asked, I think it is quite clear that many are not aware of it.",2,42,2016-01-28-T-004-S-00042
2016-01-28-T-004,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"On the process, I hear the Minister saying that the Ministry is trying to make it simpler, faster and more accessible. I urge for a lot more efforts to be put into this and, if possible, to also set specific targets, so that there is a clear game plan and, hopefully, a year from now, this 20,000 will be a much bigger number. I do think 20,000 is too small.",3,43,2016-01-28-T-004-S-00043
2016-01-28-T-004,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, I agree with Mr Seah that the numbers are not where we would like them to be, but it is growing. So, that is the encouraging thing. With ease of application, it is always a balance of making it easy and also safeguarding the interest of the individuals. Because we are very mindful as individuals apply for the LPA, we also need to make sure that due diligence is applied, so that there is no undue pressure, there is no external influence. This is something that we are also concerned about, with adults growing older, when mental capacities degenerate at some point and they become vulnerable.",1,44,2016-01-28-T-004-S-00044
2016-01-28-T-004,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We do urge every Member of this House to actively encourage and raise awareness. We will, on our part, also try to see what we can do to increase the publicity and to make sure it is as accessible as possible. Indeed, this is something that most, if not all of us, should seriously consider taking up.",2,45,2016-01-28-T-004-S-00045
2016-01-28-T-004,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"I do agree with the Minister and I would like to ask the Minister what would be the top three barriers to having a higher take-up rate for this very important instrument. What is being done to address these barriers, especially on how much more aggressive can we be? Could we be a bit more aggressive to help, especially those who are less educated and those who are less aware?",1,46,2016-01-28-T-004-S-00046
2016-01-28-T-004,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, we have not really analysed what are the various top factors but, from what I can gather, I would say that one of it would be inertia. This is something relatively new even though it has been introduced for a few years now. It is not something that is second nature to many of us. I am not sure many people are also necessarily fully aware. So, I think, publicity is one.",1,47,2016-01-28-T-004-S-00047
2016-01-28-T-004,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Secondly, even if you are aware of it, it is not something that is in our lexicon, something we know that our parents used to do and, therefore, we continue on the practice. It is something that we need to get past that stage.",2,48,2016-01-28-T-004-S-00048
2016-01-28-T-004,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"One of the other factors is I think a lot of people talk about Singaporeans being under-insured. We sometimes do not take up enough life insurance. I do not know whether it is because we are pan tang or whether we try not to think about the inevitable. But at some point, we will all degenerate as we grow older physically, mentally. So, this is something that we know is necessary. Intellectually, many of us grasp it, but I am not sure whether we, emotively, fully hoist it on board. It could also be that some think that by taking that step, are we also sort of acknowledging that we may at some stage reach that particular condition?",3,49,2016-01-28-T-004-S-00049
2016-01-28-T-004,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,It is a host of various reasons. What we need to do more of is publicity to make sure that the information gets out as far as possible and that is where we would ask everyone to chip in to make sure that the residents are aware.,4,50,2016-01-28-T-004-S-00050
2016-01-28-T-004,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Secondly, to make sure that it is easy. As I have said, we have to strike that balance. We are very mindful of that, to make sure that their individual well-being is catered for but, at the same time, to make the process easy. We are quite happy to improve the process. For example, see what steps can be taken, so that they do not even need to go down specifically to submit the form. So, for them to be able to mail it in, so on and so forth. These are steps that we will endeavour to try to make it more accessible.",5,51,2016-01-28-T-004-S-00051
2016-01-28-T-004,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"For the less educated, it is the same thing, it is about education and awareness, how to make it more easily understandable in terms of collaterals, but this is where it is better through the grassroots organisations. We should actively put out the message. We know that there are particular areas where there are older Singaporeans, lower income, perhaps, less educated. So, we may perhaps encourage more targeted efforts in those specific geographical areas.",6,52,2016-01-28-T-004-S-00052

2016-01-28-T-004,,,"Therefore, I am wondering whether the Ministry can consider doing something like what MOH is doing with MediShield Life, having a one-on-one counselling session kind of thing for those who are in that category and they have elderly with dementia and all that, where they can do that with maybe an outsourced partner, community partners or VWO. Because I think that is really quite helpful. We have got feedback that the MediShield one is really very good.",2,54,2016-01-28-T-004-S-00054
2016-01-28-T-004,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We would be happy to consider those options, as the Member pointed out, with MediShield Life and also even our Pioneer Generation ambassadors. For the whole ageing package, not just with the LPA, this is something that we have been talking a lot about. From MOH's and our perspective, as a whole nation, there is really quite a significant range of issues related to ageing. The volumes are going to be quite significant 10, 15 years from now.

2016-01-28-T-004,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I wanted to ask the Minister what is the average age of the individuals when they apply for LPA currently in our database. And as Assoc Prof Fatimah has suggested, when they reach a certain age, such information could be mailed to the individuals or all Singaporeans when they are at a particular age, so that they know how to apply.",1,57,2016-01-28-T-004-S-00057
2016-01-28-T-004,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Last of all, maybe the Minister can consider leveraging on the Pioneer Generation Office (PGO) when they reach out to the Pioneer Generation to advise them on the LPA as well.",2,58,2016-01-28-T-004-S-00058
2016-01-28-T-004,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, in terms of the age profile of the LPA applicants, just a quick breakdown. Those 21 to 34 years of age, we have about 3%; 35 to 55, about 28%; 56 to 70, 41%; 71 to 85, 24%; and above 85, about 4%. It is largely clustered around those who are, perhaps, post-50 and above, which is very natural when we begin to think of those issues. But we encourage more Singaporeans to consider doing this early because you never know when conditions may deteriorate.",1,59,2016-01-28-T-004-S-00059
2016-01-28-T-004,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"On the point about the PGO playing that role – that is something that is useful. In fact, the feedback from the public as well as from the Office, the Pioneer Generation ambassadors have been doing a great job in terms of engaging the elderly, as well as informing them of some of these key policies. This is something that we can consider. There are many things that are important. We also do not want to overly burden them with too many things but they are a ready resource base that we should draw on and this is something that we should work on.",2,60,2016-01-28-T-004-S-00060

2016-01-28-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"MSF will amend the Mental Capacity Act this year to allow professional donees and deputies to be appointed under such scenarios. For those who do not have anyone to apply for deputyship and are unable to afford private sector services, we have also established a panel of professionals, who could apply to the Court to be appointed as deputies for these individuals. There are currently 18 public-spirited professionals from the financial, healthcare, legal and social work sectors on this panel.",2,63,2016-01-28-T-005-S-00063
2016-01-28-T-005,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"As each deputyship case involves multiple steps, the pilot is still on-going. Nevertheless, the feedback that we have received has been positive about how the vulnerable individuals have benefited. Just to cite one example, how the assets of a particular individual without capacity were put to good use, so that she could enjoy better quality care at the nursing home. Transport arrangements were also made to enable her to continue participating in her weekly church activities which she enjoys. This is just one example of the many different things that can happen when we bring this on board.",3,64,2016-01-28-T-005-S-00064

When we compare this, there are probably 30,000 to 40,000 births each year. It looks like a very small number have taken this up. My question to the Minister is  why? Why do we think this is happening? Is it a case where the fathers who are eligible are not applying, or is it a case where the employers or organisations are not supportive?",1,71,2016-01-28-T-006-S-00071

2016-01-28-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"It is a very good question  why are the fathers not applying? We should ask the fathers why they are not doing so.

Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) is also operating a ward which is designed to have minimal distractions from the hospital environment. This is to provide better and more personalised care for dementia patients who may find the unfamiliar environment in a hospital disconcerting and stressful. St Luke's Hospital (SLH) and St Andrew's Community Hospital (SACH) have also introduced dementia-friendly wards which are designed to provide a more private and safer environment for dementia patients to move around, participate in group activities and interact with one another.

I just have two supplementary questions, if I may. Firstly, specifically in the context of the Jade Circle proposal and in the context of dementia patients requiring institutional care, would the Ministry consider creating, as a permanent subvention, a portable subsidy that is associated with dementia patients according to age or income or some other such criteria, as opposed to a subsidy that is associated with the institution?",1,96,2016-01-28-T-008-S-00096
2016-01-28-T-008,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"My second question is  would the Ministry consider initiating a process to develop an integrated national plan to cope with dementia, which will be an increasing problem in Singapore, along the lines of the Australian National Framework for Action on Dementia and the report of the Hong Kong Working Group on Dementia?",2,97,2016-01-28-T-008-S-00097

2016-01-28-T-008,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"First of all, let me say that MOH supports innovation on new models of care that will enhance care outcomes for the patients.

2016-01-28-T-008,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Due to the reduced ability of dementia patients to adapt to environmental stresses, smaller scale layouts which provide personal space and privacy would actually help the patients in terms of calming them and ensuring that they are not aggressive and there are no other negative social reactions. But single beds, which is Jade Circle's proposal, do have their downsides. For instance, there will be patients who would feel more isolated if they do not come out of their rooms. And there are issues with safety, surveillance, monitoring because of line of sight by the care staff and, particularly so for patients with functional deficits, leading to limited independence or because of behavioural and psychological problems.",3,100,2016-01-28-T-008-S-00100

Single rooms are not necessarily the magic pill to good quality dementia care.

Because of this, actually, we are still in discussion with Peacehaven Nursing Home and the funders to look at how the project can be adjusted so that it can proceed. Then, we can learn lessons from this model and see if we can apply it to the rest of the sector.",6,103,2016-01-28-T-008-S-00103

The subvention will be given to the different care models, depending on the projects, as well as, of course, the programmes.

In most cases of pulmonary tuberculosis in the initial stages, the symptoms are not very clear so, therefore, they are not treated as outpatient yet but they may end up being admitted to ICU or being managed for respiratory failure and pneumonia, for example. In the end, when the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis is made, her employer finds out that they are not able to claim because it is the diagnosis that has been made as pulmonary tuberculosis. Therefore, they end up with a rather big bill and yet they cannot claim from insurance. So, this is actually something, I hope, that the Ministry can review.",1,134,2016-01-28-T-011-S-00134

This helped to clear the demand backlog for first-timers. As a result, from 2013 to 2015, about nine in 10 first-timer families and seven in 10 second-timer families were successful in their applications for BTO flats in the non-mature estates.",1,151,2016-01-28-T-013-S-00151

Despite the tapering of flat supply, the application rate of first-timer families applying for 3-room or larger BTO flats in the non-mature estates has remained stable at about 1.6 times last year.

I understand when it was announced in September last year, it was for lifts built between 1987 and 1997, if I remember correctly, and it covered lifts mainly in Pasir Ris. And although they do cover some lifts in my ward, they do not cover all the lifts. So, can I just query what are the selection criteria?",1,160,2016-01-28-T-014-S-00160
2016-01-28-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, we have, in total, in our HDB estates about 23,500 lifts. More than 55% of them are already covered under the LUP. So, for the remaining lifts that are not covered under LUP, which are about 10,000, the oldest batch is the ones covered under the SLRP. So, this is the batch of lifts that were introduced in 1987 to 1997. They are the oldest batch of lifts that are not covered under LUP. These lifts are about 750 in number. They are located all over Singapore and we are specifically identifying them as that batch of lifts to be replaced because, as I said earlier, these are the lifts which are very old. They do not have the features that the newer lifts have, which include energy-efficient motors, vision panels and infra-red motion sensors. That is why they were identified for replacement under SLRP.",1,161,2016-01-28-T-014-S-00161
2016-01-28-T-014,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Just a follow-up to that question. I understand that they were the oldest lifts. Just to confirm with the Minister – so, for example, I have an estate, Jalan Damai, the estate was built at the same time but I do understand that when HDB purchased these lifts, they purchased different brands and so on and so forth. So, in the entire estate, the lifts are largely the same. They do not have those vision panels and so forth, but under SLRP, only certain lifts were selected. So, it seems a bit incongruous to me that some lifts are selected whereas some lifts are not when the HDB estate was built at the same time.",1,162,2016-01-28-T-014-S-00162
2016-01-28-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, as I mentioned, the lifts selected under the SLRP apply to the batch of lifts that was procured or put in place from 1987 to 1997. And so, that was the clear criterion that was used for the selection. Perhaps, within an estate, you may have lifts installed at different times. They may also be lifts which do not have vision panels but I think the key criterion is the time in which they were installed and we have selected this particular batch which was the batch during the period of 1987 to 1997.

2016-01-28-T-015,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Category E COEs, which can be used to register vehicles from any category, are intended to allow the vehicle mix to evolve as market demand changes. Currently, all vehicle categories contribute 10% of their quota to Category E. This rate has been gradually reduced from 25% over the last three years, with the most recent reduction to 10% taking effect in February 2015.",2,169,2016-01-28-T-015-S-00169
2016-01-28-T-015,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Motorcycles are in a separate COE category so that motorcycle buyers need not compete with car buyers for COEs. We have received suggestions in the past to split the motorcycle COE category. However, unlike for cars, the quota for motorcycles is small. Last quarter, for instance, the Category D COE quota was about 2,000. Dividing Category D into even smaller sub-categories may result in significant volatility in their COE prices. It was, in fact, for this very reason that the Government Parliamentary Committee that reviewed the COE system back in 1999 had recommended to merge the then-four car categories into the present two.",3,170,2016-01-28-T-015-S-00170

2016-01-28-T-016,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked  the Minister for Transport (a) what is the current traffic speed along the Central Expressway (CTE) between 6.00 pm and 7.00 pm; (b) what is the purpose of having an evening ERP along CTE; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider removing this evening ERP.,1,172,2016-01-28-T-016-S-00172
2016-01-28-T-016,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Madam, the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) policy helps to manage traffic congestion during peak hours and maintain optimal traffic speeds. Even with the evening ERP along the northbound Central Expressway (CTE), current traffic speeds are at the lower end of the targeted speed. In fact, speeds dropped below 45 km/h between 6.30 pm and 7.00 pm.",1,173,2016-01-28-T-016-S-00173
2016-01-28-T-016,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"If we remove the evening ERP, we will see even slower speeds and more traffic congestion.",2,174,2016-01-28-T-016-S-00174
2016-01-28-T-016,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"I thank the Minister for his answer. With the completion of the interchange, that means there is a new exit from CTE to Seletar West Link. Many of the residents use the exit there and, so, there is an alternative for them. The observation from the residents is that the speed along the CTE actually has eased because you have an additional interchange linking the three expressways. And that is why we are hoping for the monitoring of the speed again since the opening of the new interchange and see whether or not we can remove the evening ERP.",1,175,2016-01-28-T-016-S-00175
2016-01-28-T-016,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Mdm Speaker, I hope so, too. I live in the north. In fact, the Member used to be my Member of Parliament and a very good one. I always say, ""My favourite Member of Parliament – Er Dr Lee Bee Wah."" She was my Member of Parliament two general elections ago, but because of the boundary changes, she is no longer my Member of Parliament. I am happy to let her know that my neighbours continue to remember her fondly. And there is a reason for it – because she always conveys very strong feedback from the residents, like the case of CTE and ERP.",1,176,2016-01-28-T-016-S-00176
2016-01-28-T-016,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"As I use CTE often enough, whether speeds improve or deteriorate, I have first-hand knowledge. But for ERP fee setting at each quarterly adjustment, we rely on the speed data which machines generate. As I have said, those data have not yet justified a reduction. But we hope that maybe with, for example, the new interchange which the Member talked about, speeds may enter the targeted range in a very definitive way – then there will be scope for adjustments.",2,177,2016-01-28-T-016-S-00177
2016-01-28-T-016,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Mdm Speaker, you may know that I am a heart patient, I have a chronic heart disease. I had open heart surgery more than five years ago. Since then, I have to face my cardiologist regularly. In fact, I will be seeing him tomorrow. A few days before each consultation, I will have to do a fasting blood test. Each time, I hope that my bad cholesterol reading will be in the optimal range so that the doctor can remove the very high dosage of statin that he prescribes for me.",3,178,2016-01-28-T-016-S-00178

So, I am keeping my fingers crossed that, hopefully, the very aggressive dosage will not be raised further. Anti-cholesterol drug is the same thing as ERP.",5,180,2016-01-28-T-016-S-00180

Our crime level is low, compared to major cities, such as London, New York and Hong Kong.",1,182,2016-01-28-T-017-S-00182
2016-01-28-T-017,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"This low crime rate has been achieved with a lean Police Force. As at December 2015, there were about 9,400 regular Police Officers serving in the Singapore Police Force. This translates to about 170 Police Officers per 100,000 population, which is low, compared to other cities, such as London, New York and Hong Kong, which the Member had asked.",2,183,2016-01-28-T-017-S-00183

2016-01-28-T-017,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Yes, Madam. Thank you. May I ask the Senior Minister of State, based on the low ratio of Police Officers to population that Singapore has, whether MHA is of the view that we are still confident of keeping Singapore's crime rate low? The Senior Minister of State also mentioned it is low compared to three cities. Are we lower than the three cities?",1,185,2016-01-28-T-017-S-00185
2016-01-28-T-017,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The crime rate is considerably lower. In terms of whether we are able to maintain the current low crime rate, in spite of our lean Police Force, over the last five years, the crime rate has remained fairly constant, as has been the manning levels. It is a variety of considerations that lead to this – not only a well-trained, efficient Police Force that is in touch with the community but also good laws. Law and order are a product of good laws.",1,186,2016-01-28-T-017-S-00186
2016-01-28-T-017,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Nevertheless, I think the Member is quite right to point out that this manpower constraint is likely to persist. With smaller cohorts of young Singaporeans joining the workforce each year, it will be a challenge and there will be natural limits to how much larger the Force can grow. That is contrasted with a much larger workload – public expectations, more travellers, more infrastructure, higher demands on our SCDF and so on and so forth.",2,187,2016-01-28-T-017-S-00187
2016-01-28-T-017,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"There are many strategies that we will adopt in order to tackle this challenge. For example, we will enhance our recruitment terms to retain, recruit and advance our officers.",3,188,2016-01-28-T-017-S-00188
2016-01-28-T-017,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We will also review our operations and revisit them so that we can do things better. One example would be the number of SCDF calls that are made each day. It is going up at a rate of about 5% each year. It is not feasible to keep growing the SCDF and the number of its ambulances and paramedics. So, we need to do better, we need to use data analytics to have a tiered and differentiated response. This is an example of doing things better.",4,189,2016-01-28-T-017-S-00189
2016-01-28-T-017,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Thirdly, we will improve our officers' capabilities, so that each officer can do more. I spoke of the fast response car yesterday, with more technology built in it to allow officers to respond faster and better. We spoke yesterday also of technology to allow us to do more with less. The Central Narcotics Bureau, for example, has hair analysis, compared to urine analysis for lower risk drug offenders. Hair analyses are able to detect drug consumption over a longer period of time. This allows us to recall these offenders less often to the station and allows us to redeploy these officers to other duties.",5,190,2016-01-28-T-017-S-00190
2016-01-28-T-017,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Lastly, of course, we will strengthen community partnership, which is one of the things I spoke about at length yesterday. Technology now allows members of the public to provide evidence through videos, to allow people who are trained in first-aid, AED and CPR to respond via the SCDF myResponder App to people who are in distress and know where the AEDs are located. All these will help us to do more with a lean Force.",6,191,2016-01-28-T-017-S-00191

This initiative was kick-started in Yishun Chong Pang area to raise awareness of the growing number of persons with dementia. This is perhaps a tribute to our ageing population. It involves the Neighbourhood Police Centre and 80 Citizens-on-Patrol residents trained to detect, respond and assist persons with dementia whom they may meet during patrols. The initiative also organised education talks on dementia and conducted training sessions to over 6,000 people and businesses.",21,226,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00226

2016-01-28-T-020,Ng Chee Meng,The Acting Minister for Education (Schools) and Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"Therefore, a strong Singapore Heartbeat is formed by deep bonds of kinship among our people and the pride of simply being Singaporean. These come from shared experiences of studying in the same school, playing together, living in the same community and, for our men, having served National Service together.

When they had arrived at her destination, at her flat, he left his car by the road so that he could personally wheel her all the way up to her high-rise flat, to her very doorstep. I applaud his act of kindness, going out of his way to help, at a certain level of personal sacrifice and personal inconvenience.

But sometimes, such acts can go unnoticed amongst us and that is why, sometimes, people get cynical about the Singapore Heartbeat.

Then, they would upload videos or stories online. It could be simple things like someone giving up their seat on the MRT or someone helping a ""popo"" to reach the groceries on the top shelf in a supermarket.

The President's Address was a rallying call to all Singaporeans to stand together in solidarity as we embark on the new chapter of nation-building. The realities of today's world merit a word of caution for the path ahead and the President, in his Address, said that we cannot expect an easy journey.

Values guide us when we make our decisions for this country and, as each day unfolds with its multifaceted challenges, the expressions of these values will develop. Today, I would like to add a further perspective to these expressions. In this regard, I believe there is another value that should prevail as we chart our way into the next half century, that is, the sense of responsibility – both on the part of the Government as well as on the part of the Singapore citizen. I would like to demonstrate the importance of this in two areas  (a) caring for the vulnerable and disadvantaged in our community, and (b) diversity of views and discourse.",6,280,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00280

2016-01-28-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Over the years, the Government has made major shifts in social policy. The community and the state took on greater responsibility for individuals and families who needed social support. This was welcomed and provided a reprieve to many who struggled to keep afloat in this ever-changing world. However, the implementation of this provision of support is fraught with rules and dictates certain expectations of the recipients. For example, when one makes an application for financial assistance, checks are made on the income and contributions of his or her children or other family members.

We should, in such instances, exercise discretion and provide the necessary support.",8,282,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00282
2016-01-28-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Another aspect of this I would like to highlight is that the support for the individual or family is often only available till they are able to find employment and meet the means test.

2016-01-28-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"The early withdrawal of subsidies and assistance can easily bring a family back into financial difficulty, particularly when the family has had little opportunity to build up a reserve for the rainy day. We should look into how our social support networks and the community networks can continue to provide support and look out for these families. We should not leave them at the starting block of the track, but be there till they are able to sustain themselves.",10,284,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00284

I think we can all agree that diversity can be a strength, if it can be synergised and used for the good of the people. However, it is also a potential divisive factor that can tear our social fabric. So, how do we make it our strength and not cause our fall?",17,291,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00291

I laud the Government's efforts in creating platforms and engaging various segments of the community, including the young. It is definitely important to engage the youth on matters that are important to them, especially since they would inherit the nation and should have a say in how the society develops.

The Muslim community has expressed concern over the increasing Islamophobia and the observation that some Muslims are growing somewhat more distant from the rest of the Singaporean community. There is a need to have very frank conversations about real issues facing the community. These conversations may possibly be difficult but this is an effort that should be put in together by all in the community, not just the Singaporean Muslims. And I believe that the leadership has a role in encouraging these discussions.",21,295,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00295
2016-01-28-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"The reality is that some of these conversations are already happening on the online platform. In certain instances, such discussions appear to be rather toxic. So, we should manage and encourage further respectful discussions. Our efforts in encouraging racial and religious harmony can no longer be at a superficial level of attending each other's cultural events. We should allow for space to talk about our identities, our religious practices, such as the burning of incense paper, the wearing of the tudung, the playing of music during Thaipusam, for example. And there should be open dialogues as such conversations allow for better understanding of each other's concerns.",22,296,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00296
2016-01-28-T-020,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Yes, we need to preserve the sanctity of the harmonious co-existence of various races and religions. Our forefathers had learnt to live together despite their differences and had managed to achieve a state of peaceful equilibrium. This is something we should cherish. But we should also continue to build on the bonds we have. There is a need for faith in the maturity of the Singapore people and a realisation that the preservation of our individual identities or practice of our respective religions does not necessarily mean that our common spaces are being encroached upon or that we are distancing ourselves from each other. Perhaps, there is a need to redefine the common space. Perhaps, there are new norms that Singaporeans can agree upon. We must allow for such discussions to flourish and work towards achieving consensus. Mdm Speaker, allow me to continue my speech in Malay.",23,297,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00297

It was an extraordinary year and one thing that stood out for me was that we were all reminded of how exceptional we are as a little red dot and how the responsibility of ensuring another 50 great years for Singapore now falls squarely on our shoulders.

I whole-heartedly agree that these are critical and we must get them right. In fact, I believe these five aims are interdependent and, for me, the most critical of these aims would be the need to foster a caring society, one in which our people feel meaningfully engaged and are actively involved. Ultimately, no matter how robust our economy, how strong our society or how advanced our technology may be, a strong nation has to draw strength from its people.",3,363,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00363

2016-01-28-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"First, on our elderly. We must care for our elderly, make sure that their needs are catered for, so that they need not live in anxiety and fear post-retirement, or worse, gloomily count down to the last day of their lives. But more than that, we must enable our elderly, so that life post-retirement is still exciting and promising. We all aspire to lead a good life and a good life cannot be judged by the number of years lived. It has to be based on qualitative measures, such as health, a sense of self-efficacy and self-esteem.",5,365,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00365
2016-01-28-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"At home, shrinking family sizes and increasing numbers of singles will limit the scope of home care for our elderly. One way to deal with this would be to have the elderly institutionalised in a nursing or an elderly home. But this is far from ideal because, given our rapidly ageing population, there is insufficient space to build enough nursing or elderly homes. Moreover, this does not align well with our vision of ""ageing in place"". Therefore, we must continue to invest in technological research and expedite the implementation of tested solutions that can enable our elderly to live independently at home. As we move towards a ""Smart Nation"", this has to be given priority.",6,366,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00366
2016-01-28-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"At work, our elderly should be encouraged to work for as long as they can and want to. Firstly, staying employed helps to keep our bodies and minds active. Secondly, staying employed helps to preserve our sense of self-efficacy and self-esteem. Of course, the additional ""pocket money"" from the income earned is welcomed. Thirdly, as we have an ageing population, the average age of our workforce is expected to rise. Hence, it is not just a social responsibility to enable our elderly to stay and, indeed, to thrive in their jobs, but there is economic imperative as well, given the tight labour market. Our systems, our working environments and, especially our attitudes, have to change in preparation for this eventuality. Age discrimination at work, especially at the point of recruitment, must be stemmed out. There is also a need for a more concerted and stronger push for jobs to be redesigned to become more elderly-friendly.",7,367,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00367
2016-01-28-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"At the community level, we need to continue our efforts to build a strong social network of support, as it helps to keep out loneliness and complement familial support. Such a network requires not only the participation of Government agencies and voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs), but neighbours can have a role to play as well. Neighbours can help to keep an eye on an elderly, notice any irregularity and call for help immediately. Neighbours can help to, for instance, bring an elderly to his/her medical appointment at the polyclinic nearby, explain schemes that are available for the elderly to benefit from, or encourage and assist the elderly to participate in community programmes and stay active.",8,368,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00368
2016-01-28-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Within the community, we should not only consider the elderly as being simply the recipients of care. They can also be enabled to contribute meaningfully as well. At present, I am very heartened and encouraged to witness how our seniors in MacPherson have been actively serving our community. For instance, many are involved in the Pioneer Generation (PG) Ambassador programme, in which it involves them helping to explain to fellow Pioneers what the package entails and even help them to seek help with problems not covered by the package. The PG Ambassadors receive good training and support and they feel empowered and proud to be able to help others. Hence, we must continue to promote senior volunteerism and find ways to empower our elderly, as they are hidden gems in our communities.

2016-01-28-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"First, care for the elderly. This means to enable them to live in ease and comfort in their golden years. We should look after the elderly, satisfy their basic needs and preserve their dignity. Besides basic needs, such as food and clothing, we must also make sure they age in place. Although we are building more nursing homes to meet the needs of an ageing society, most elderly prefer to spend their last days in their own home, not a nursing home or a home for the elderly. In addition, there is a rising trend of elderly living alone, so we should help them – indeed, for ourselves in future, too – redesign their homes. We should use technology and actively research and implement assistive technologies, so that the elderly who live alone or have disabilities can lead a safer and more independent life. By doing this, we can achieve our ideal of ""ageing in place"".",14,374,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00374
2016-01-28-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Beyond that, we should continue to engage and organise the community, encourage residents to work with the Government and VWOs to strengthen our social support network and maintain the community spirit of neighbours looking after one another.",15,375,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00375
2016-01-28-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Second, respect the elderly. This means to respect the seniors and not to look down on them. We should encourage and support those who still want to work to do so, or support them to fulfil their unfulfilled dreams. This is because work can help them to stay active physically and mentally and maintain confidence in themselves. Moreover, extra pocket money is welcomed. However, when working in my constituency, I would have seniors sharing their woes with me every now and then about how difficult it is to get a job as they grew old. Therefore, we need to put in more effort in improving our national system, work environment design and attitude towards the elderly. As the saying goes, ""An old horse knows its ways"". It means that the elderly are very experienced. Hence, we must respect them and provide them with opportunities. At least, we should not deny them the opportunity of taking that first step. Can an ""old horse"" not continue to gallop?",16,376,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00376
2016-01-28-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Third, cherish the elderly. It means to appreciate and treasure our seniors. The elderly, especially those who have retired, are our precious resource. They have the time and experience and are able to continue to contribute to the country and the community. In MacPherson, we have many seniors who are passionate about charity and volunteering in the community. They often help out at community events and look after vulnerable neighbours. Sometimes, they can even mobilise the aunties and uncles in the community to help. Sometimes, they will voluntarily offer to solve problems for their neighbours. If they are unable to do so, they will accompany troubled neighbours to come and see me. So, let us not lose these gems of ours!",17,377,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00377

Hence, we must continue to support families in Singapore so that Singapore will continue to be strong. Often, I receive pleas from young parents seeking help with childcare as they have to work. They feel stressed having to balance the needs of their families and careers, sometimes, at the expense of each other. Young mothers also lament to me about how they are trying to heed the Government's call to have children, how they are trying to fulfil their duty to the nation but it is just very difficult to do so when they cannot get the support they need. So, why should young families be subjected to such a trade-off? Can we not better enable them to raise their young whilst not having to compromise on their aspirational pursuits?",18,378,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00378

In the course of my constituency work, I have met many housewives who are experienced and willing to care for neighbours' children and whose children have grown up. They love children and, of course, a little pocket money would not hurt. At the same time, I have also just recently come across a young couple with two-year-old triplets who are in desperate need of support. The couple need to work, their parents have yet to retire and they could not find a reliable maid.

Hence, while the PHG helps to offset part of a resale flat's price premium over a subsidised one, it is still not enough to make a resale flat within the affordability range to them. As such, could we seriously consider increasing the quota of flats set aside under MCPS per BTO development?",24,384,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00384
2016-01-28-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Thirdly, we need to continue to entrench the belief that mothers can continue to contribute and value-add in the workplace and society. We need employers and colleagues to be understanding to mothers who go on maternity or childcare leave. Once, a young mother wrote to me to share her woes about her employer who would make scathing remarks when she took maternity leave. Her employer approved of the leave anyway because it was mandated, but were the remarks necessary?",25,385,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00385
2016-01-28-T-020,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"We need to enable more flexi-work arrangements so that mothers can still contribute fully even as they take childcare leave. We need fair appraisal systems that focus on the quality of work done and that do not mark down mothers simply because they are out of action for a few months. Such behaviours – mean remarks and unfair appraisal systems – are manifestations of an underlying prejudice that mothers are liabilities at work, thereby negating the value that they can offer professionally and to our society. We should work to improve the situation in Singapore so that women can thrive in both motherhood and career.",26,386,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00386

At this juncture, I would like to highlight that active citizenry runs through almost all the points that I have made.

A truly caring society is not one in which the caring is only done by the Government or a selected group of people.

From the time I served as a grassroots leader, which would have been about 11 years ago, I have witnessed how many Singaporeans are prepared to sacrifice their personal time, space and resources to help others. I am constantly touched by their concern for the less fortunate or more vulnerable and, even more so, when those who needed help in the first place are also helping others. Such care and concern for our fellow men and women build trust, strengthen our community and keep us together. It inspires us to do better, to think about how our actions affect the others around us. It makes life worth living.",28,388,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00388

But what I found staggering was the Malaysian government's response. Instead of seeking to bridge the divide, they decided to designate a ""bumiputera-only"" mall in response; that opened in December 2015. In fact, it came with free six months' rental to Malay entrepreneurs. Can we imagine for a moment that taking place in Singapore? But why has this happened just across our shores?",17,408,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00408
2016-01-28-T-020,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),"As I have mentioned, politics drive social norms and shape behaviour. The origins of the recent racial tensions in Malaysia can, in some ways, be traced to the racial stratification that has been deeply entrenched in the Malaysian political system for many years, for decades. Political parties were formed along racial lines. The Barisan Nasional coalition is made up of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) and Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB) and the Chinese-based Malaysia Chinese Association (MCA), as well as the Indian-based Malaysian Indian Congress. Can we imagine any of these taking place in Singapore?

2016-01-28-T-020,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),"The GRC system was implemented in 1988 precisely to prevent politics in Singapore from being polarised along racial lines. Aside from guaranteeing minority representation in Parliament, the requirement that at least one candidate of each GRC belongs to a minority community means that candidates and their political parties cannot campaign on racial lines. These objectives remain relevant, if not more relevant, today. I, therefore, support the continuation of the GRC scheme and I should add that this scheme is by no means a political tool to marginalise the prospects of success for Opposition candidates in an election. In fact, having taken Aljunied GRC on two previous occasions, I am surprised we still see the Workers' Party continuing to make such an argument.",21,412,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00412

I think this makes for better options and choices for the electorate and the Workers' Party surely cannot complain about smaller GRCs! The question of economies of scale in the running of a Town Council can, I think, be easily overcomed by having more than one GRC make up a town, which is currently not the case.",22,413,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00413

In order to achieve that, it is, therefore, necessary for him to act with a mandate and moral authority and that is why he is elected and not appointed.

Why? Why should we feel apologetic about imposing the very most stringent conditions and criteria on a person who is to be carrying out heavy constitutional burdens to safeguard your reserves and mine? Only the very best people should be the Head of State, not an inexperienced or under-qualified one and certainly not a populist one.",28,419,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00419

But, second and, perhaps more fundamentally, I hope the Constitution Commission can look into this, that we look beyond just the numbers. Just because a candidate has been a CEO or a CFO of a company with $x million of paid-up capital or turnover does not necessarily make that person the right person or, indeed, a suitable or appropriate person to become the Elected President.",30,421,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00421
2016-01-28-T-020,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),"In my view, there is every reason to impose far more stringent qualifying criteria because this is not a popular contest. It is serious business making sure that the constitutional duties are properly discharged. If the Elected President fails as the guardian, Singapore fails.

Mr Low Thia Khiang said earlier good politics is not shaped or monopolised by the ruling party – alternative voices, dissenting opinions should be heard. That is precisely what the NCMP scheme, as now currently revised, seeks to achieve. It will be enhanced, it will be enlarged, it will be made more robust and it will give the Opposition an expanded voice in Parliament.",35,426,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00426

The privilege to run a Town Council and to manage a constituency is one that can only be bestowed by the electorate of that constituency. It is a mandate from the people. And if, in elections, the electorate does not choose the Workers' Party to run their Town Council, perhaps because they feel that the Workers' Party is not qualified to do so – that choice has to be respected.",37,428,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00428

Hence, in cases where the Opposition candidate has tried but failed to win the mandate of the people, then, in those cases, the best losers are, nonetheless, offered a seat in Parliament – now with all the parliamentary privileges of an elected Member. Clearly, the NCMP Scheme has brought a more diverse range of views into Parliament and we heard that in the last Parliament.",39,430,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00430

Far from navel-gazing, as Mr Low has said, I see in these steps the hallmark of strong political will, great foresight and a determination to build for the future, not for this term, not for the next term even, but for the future.

But it takes two hands to clap and good politics also means that Singaporeans, too, must remain engaged with the Government. Singaporeans, too, must continue to be proactive in active citizenry and play a part in shaping our country's destiny.

I am not sure whether I heard Mr Tong correctly, but was he trying to imply that the Workers' Party is arguing for NCMPs to be on equal standing with elected Members? Because from what I understood from what Mr Low said, basically, he was making the point that they are not the same.

You have the opportunity to grow your roots in your own constituency, whether you are an elected Member or an NCMP.

I urge all to take a closer look. The CSP provides subsidies to employers who hire mature PMEs 40 years and above for jobs paying $4,000 and above. Whether in peacetime or in the event of a downturn, the CSP not just helps PMEs land a job through direct wage subsidy to their employers, it ensures all PMEs affected have a job, a monthly salary, for the longer term.",32,517,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00517

Employers are proactively seeking out resources to hire previously-disadvantaged groups of people. The number of enquiries in this regard has risen by about twice from the year before. This is very encouraging, as it is a clear indication that outreach exercises have been helpful and more companies are developing into conducive workplaces on their own accord.",30,555,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00555

The institution of the Elected Presidency is a key safeguard against loose fiscal policy. I agree that we need to review it to make it a stronger safeguard, as said by the Prime Minister. The NCMP scheme is another unique feature that makes us special and has strengthened our political system. Since it started in 1984, with an upper limit of six NCMPs, this was increased to nine in 2010 and Prime Minister Lee said that he would like to raise the number to 12. The intention to increase the NCMP numbers entrenches the importance of the NCMP scheme; at the same time, it recognises the contributions of past NCMPs. The political parties of the best-performing losing Opposition candidates that have accepted the NCMP nomination have benefited from the system. So, instead of calling names, let us all embrace the NCMP scheme as a unique feature of Singapore's political system.",16,589,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00589

As the train network becomes more extensive, many are willing to take the train, which is comfortable and convenient, but they are hampered by the connectivity from their homes to the train station. For residents staying within 800 metres of a train station, most abled people are willing to walk to the station. Beyond that, residents typically ask for feeder bus services. Unfortunately, the authorities often cite resource constraints and cannot meet the residents' demand for more feeder services. I am sympathetic towards this.",29,602,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00602
2016-01-28-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"If resource is, indeed, a constraint, perhaps LTA could consider boldly reorganising bus routes, especially long distance cross-island routes. For example, bus service 51 plies from Hougang Bus Interchange to Jurong East Interchange, covering close to 38 kilometres and the average traveling time is about two hours and 42 minutes. In contrast, a train ride from Hougang to Jurong East takes only 53 minutes, that is, a saving of almost two hours.

For example, many residents at Ayer Rajah rely on service 51 to bring them to Jurong East MRT Station. How reliable can service 51 be when it has to travel about 30 kilometres before reaching Ayer Rajah? No wonder our fellow Parliamentarian, Ms Foo Mee Har, has been complaining about the reliability of service 51 when it serves as a pseudo feeder service for her Ayer Rajah residents.",31,604,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00604

That is 14 long trunk services for 40 new feeder services. Does it not sound attractive?

But beyond the money, what Airbnb travellers relish most is the novel experience of staying in an affordable and unique local space which could be someone's home and seeing the ""authentic"" side of a country.

Uber cars also need not go through the stringent safety checks, as compared to existing players, thereby compromising the safety of commuters. To regulate, we must.

More than 80% of Singaporeans live in HDB flats and many Singaporeans are proud to be owners of their HDB flats. Many foreigners are envious that Singaporeans can own their own flats and hope to learn from our experience in public housing. Several new public housing schemes introduced during the term of the previous Government were well-received by Singaporeans. These good policies stabilised prices and assured Singaporeans.,36,678,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00678

I felt that the strong demand was, to a certain extent, a panic reaction to the rising property prices. This is similar to stock market reactions  when the stock market is hot, investors will chase after the market; once the bear market emerges, investors become hesitant and stay on the sidelines. To a certain degree, this also reflects the state of the property market today. Those who need to sell their existing private property or HDB flats now, find that there are not many buyers. This is in stark contrast to the flurry of activities seen previously. Many who want to sell their properties now face the dilemma of reducing prices to sell their house, or face the pressure of falling prices.",37,679,2016-01-28-T-020-S-00679

2016-01-28-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"How could one bring about a more even spread of cars? One solution would be analogous to our current policies in the housing market. Citizens looking to buy a second property pay an additional 7% stamp duty, which increases to 10% for the third or subsequent property. Could we not consider here an Additional Buyer's Car Duty (ABCD), which could be set as a percentage of the prevailing COE price, for those who wish to buy a second, third or fourth car?",9,745,2016-01-28-T-022-S-00745
2016-01-28-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Perhaps, a simple mechanism would be to step up the multiple of the price for each COE. Property investors also face tighter restrictions on mortgages – so, similar rules might be applied in the car loans market. The idea is to use these mechanisms to price some second car buyers out of the COE market, thereby lowering the price and improving affordability for first-car households. There should not be a significant revenue impact as some households will pay for the privilege of buying more than one car.",10,746,2016-01-28-T-022-S-00746

2016-01-28-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Even if enforcement is not perfect and some households do manage to avoid paying more for their subsequent cars, that should not deter us from forging ahead with this policy if we agree that the outcome of greater distribution of car ownership is a desirable one. After all, Singapore's success is built on a history of tough policy decisions, so the difficulty of enforcement cannot be a show-stopper for us. And while this issue has been raised before, perhaps now is the time for us to act on it, given the challenges brought about by growing public perceptions of income inequality.",12,748,2016-01-28-T-022-S-00748
2016-01-28-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"The second area I would like to discuss today is the question of whether we are paying a ""fair"" price for our cars. Our goal here today is not to pander to popular perception of ""profiteering"" by car dealers – I recognise that costs are high and a business needs to turn in a profit. Rather, my argument is that there is still room to improve transparency in car pricing.",13,749,2016-01-28-T-022-S-00749
2016-01-28-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Can we encourage or even mandate car dealers to explicitly show a breakdown of the cost of a car and show how much gross profit that they are making? This actually benefits both parties. If you read the online forums, there are often angry posts claiming that dealers make ""obscene"" profits of $50,000-$100,000 per vehicle, but this could reflect the fact that the public has imperfect information and, hence, miss out on important cost elements in their calculation.",14,750,2016-01-28-T-022-S-00750
2016-01-28-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Note that we are asking for information on gross, not net profits – that is, how much of the price of the car goes to pay for the cost of goods sold, including OMV, taxes, GST and other outgoings, excluding the dealer's rental and other costs. This greater clarity will help consumers make better decisions and, hopefully, spur dealers to offer better deals as well!",15,751,2016-01-28-T-022-S-00751
2016-01-28-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"The final area I want to explore is what kind of vehicles we should have in Singapore. From a sustainability and pollution viewpoint, we need to explore alternatives to petrol cars. Diesel had shown some promise, but the recent scandal at Volkswagon has cast some doubt on the level of pollution that diesel engines cause. I feel that this is an area that requires further study by the relevant authorities and, perhaps, stricter checks are warranted on the emission standards of diesel engines until we have conclusive evidence that such engines do not pose health or environmental problems for the general public at large.",16,752,2016-01-28-T-022-S-00752
2016-01-28-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Another alternative to petrol combustion engines is electric vehicles. Many experts see EVs as a key part of a low carbon future and rapid advances in technology have made them affordable and pleasurable to drive. EV adoption is accelerating globally – the leader is Norway, where, due to strong incentives, around 30% of new cars registered are now electric.",17,753,2016-01-28-T-022-S-00753
2016-01-28-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"In many ways, Singapore is an ideal market for electric vehicles. Our average driving distance is around 50 kilometres, far under the range limitation for existing models – and these range limits are expected to continue to increase with each generation of new cars.",18,754,2016-01-28-T-022-S-00754
2016-01-28-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Given our current tariff structure on petrol, drivers have an economic incentive to switch to EVs as they could generate significant savings on fuel each year. By some estimates, the combination of fuel savings, tax savings via the Carbon Emission-based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS) and expected lower maintenance costs already make it economical to own an EV, relative to more traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.",19,755,2016-01-28-T-022-S-00755
2016-01-28-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Given that EVs are still an emerging technology, there is even an opportunity for Singapore to capture a slice of the market if we position ourselves as a hub for EVs. New players and business models are emerging in the electric and autonomous vehicle space that could give Singapore an entry into the high-value added segments of the new automotive industry. This could create high-value knowledge economy jobs in segments, such as battery and charging technology research.",20,756,2016-01-28-T-022-S-00756
2016-01-28-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"From a Government or public infrastructure perspective, Singapore is uniquely positioned to avoid the biggest obstacle to kickstarting EV adoption, which is the need to build a dense public charging network. This is because home charging would be sufficient for us. In large countries, the concern is running out of power before you complete your journey, especially for long inter-city routes. In Singapore, only a small fraction of users would be concerned about running out of power before they arrive home to charge. For those drivers, there are already charge points in most commercial buildings which could serve as emergency top-ups, if needed, providing additional security for users.",21,757,2016-01-28-T-022-S-00757
2016-01-28-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"However, if we look at the current state of the market, excluding vehicles participating in Government trials, new reports suggest that there are only around 100 commercially sold EVs. In many developed markets, EV penetration is around 3%-5% of new cars. So, in the Singapore context, we would expect 600-1,000 EVs to be sold per year. Our low figure likely reflects a chicken-and-egg problem. There is no demand for EVs, therefore, there is no need to supply them and fewer models are available.",22,758,2016-01-28-T-022-S-00758
2016-01-28-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"One major contributor to this situation is that more than 90% of Singaporeans live in high-rise homes and, hence, currently, do not have the right to install the required charge points in their common carparks, be they HDB or condominiums. Hence, they could not get an EV even if they wanted to. In response to the resulting low demand, many dealers have not brought in EV models and, hence, consumer awareness remains low.",23,759,2016-01-28-T-022-S-00759
2016-01-28-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Given the increasing pressure to reduce carbon emissions, should we be putting greater focus on EVs? LTA estimates that the typical EV produces around 85 grams of CO2 per km because our electricity comes from natural gas. A typical combustion engine vehicle produces around 120-150 grams of CO2 per km. Given that the average car drives around 17,000 km a year, this translates into annual savings of around 800-1,000 kg of CO2 per vehicle per year. From the Government's perspective, this is a rare carbon emissions reduction policy where the abatement cost would be voluntarily borne by the consumers who choose to buy the EVs, rather than being paid for by the Government.",24,760,2016-01-28-T-022-S-00760
2016-01-28-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"If we believe that this is a step in the right direction, then we need to look at how to make it easier for environmentally-conscious car buyers to buy a new car and install a charge point. HDB and BCA can take the lead for mandating access for installation and car dealers can include charge point installation in the price of the car, with financing provided if necessary. International benchmarks suggest that the cost of installing such chargers should be around $3,000, as they do not need to be the fancy, expensive, fast or rapid charging type – slow charging overnight would be sufficient for us.",25,761,2016-01-28-T-022-S-00761
2016-01-28-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"While most carparks do not have designated individual lots, we could institute a scheme where, similar to handicapped access lots, certain lots within the carparks are earmarked for electric vehicles only. This number can increase over time, in tandem with the number of vehicles, so there is no need to build ahead of demand and the costs will be borne by the car buyers as part of their purchase price.",26,762,2016-01-28-T-022-S-00762
2016-01-28-T-022,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"With this policy in place, public interest and commercial incentives should encourage car dealers to bring in their latest EV models and, hence, create a buzz and momentum among potential car buyers. It would not be unreasonable to expect the typical 3%-5% of new car sales typically observed internationallly, although my hunch is that we would see a higher end of the scale, given the driving patterns and fuel costs here in Singapore. This will in no way interfere with our journey towards a car-lite society, but just helps to make it a greener one for our future generations.",27,763,2016-01-28-T-022-S-00763

CNB engages schools and educational institutions regularly to conduct anti-drug events and roadshows to inform students on the harms of drug abuse. We have increased our use of social media to reach out to youths. A study done by the Task Force on Youths and Drugs in 2015 showed that many young people held the view that cannabis is a soft drug and that the harms and addictiveness of cannabis were less serious than tobacco.

We urge the public to do its part by remaining vigilant and taking appropriate precautions to prevent mosquito breeding.",9,804,2016-01-28-T-030-S-00804

2016-01-28-T-031,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The individual investments of GIC and Temasek are the responsibility of their respective management teams, while the Government monitors the performance of their overall portfolio.

This is an important governance principle that we seek to maintain.",1,806,2016-01-28-T-031-S-00806
2016-01-28-T-031,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,The investment activities of GIC and Temasek are oriented towards generating long-term returns on a sustainable basis.

2016-01-28-T-031,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,Temasek has stated3 that it fully supports zero-burning policies for land clearance and would urge palm oil companies and plantation owners to do the same. GIC has also informed the Government that the palm oil companies in Indonesia that GIC invests in have confirmed that they observe zero-burning policies for their plantations. GIC's investment teams engage actively with the companies' management and highlight that such responsible actions are important for maintaining the long-term value of the companies.,3,808,2016-01-28-T-031-S-00808
