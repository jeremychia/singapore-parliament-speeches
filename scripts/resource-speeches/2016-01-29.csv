2016-01-29-T-001,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"After the keys are handed over, a one-year Defects Liability Period (DLP) will kick in. During this period, the contractor will be obliged to rectify any other defects that are detected. During the DLP, a Building Service Centre (BSC) is set up in every new precinct to attend to feedback from residents promptly. The BSC will operate for a year on site so that residents have sufficient time to submit their feedback. All feedback to the BSC are monitored closely to ensure defects are rectified in a timely manner and to an acceptable quality standard.",12,13,2016-01-29-T-001-S-00013
2016-01-29-T-001,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"The rectification works will be inspected and certified by HDB's supervising consultant before a joint inspection with the owners is arranged to hand over the unit. For cases where owners are not fully satisfied with the rectification works, they can approach HDB, who will look into very case and take all reasonable efforts to address the owner's concerns. HDB will get the contractor to rectify the defects in accordance with acceptable industry norms.",13,14,2016-01-29-T-001-S-00014
2016-01-29-T-001,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"An objective assessment of the quality of HDB flats is the BCA's Construction Quality Assessment System (CONQUAS) score. This is the industry standard to measure the quality of building projects. Over the years, the quality of BTO flats has improved from a score of 79 in 2003 to 89 in 2014. This is comparable to that of private developments. This reflects HDB's push to secure high quality and workmanship standards for its flats.",14,15,2016-01-29-T-001-S-00015
2016-01-29-T-001,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"While the situation has improved, HDB is continually looking at ways to do better. It will continue to seek improvement in its design, choice of material and construction to improve the quality of its flats.",15,16,2016-01-29-T-001-S-00016
2016-01-29-T-001,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. I would like to ask would the Ministry consider making public on HDB website for each BTO project the nature of complaints and the progress and schedule of rectification works so that it becomes transparent. When this happens, such information not just helps educate the owners on industry norms and standards, but would also better manage expectations.",1,17,2016-01-29-T-001-S-00017
2016-01-29-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for her suggestion. The CONQUAS score reflects three components  architectural merit, which is what the Member is concerned about, quality of finish and the build quality; as well as two other components, such as structure and M&E. CONQUAS score for each development, each BTO already reflects the standard, albeit in a numerical nature.",1,18,2016-01-29-T-001-S-00018
2016-01-29-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Each BSC will typically receive one-third of the residents approaching them for various issues  complaints, defects as well as requests for information. About 25% of them relate, for example, to water flow. This is because there are water management and flow requirements at the input. The remainder relate to a variety of issues that reflect build quality and other areas. Many of these can be solved and HDB's BSC staff continue to work on this.",2,19,2016-01-29-T-001-S-00019
2016-01-29-T-001,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the clarification. Can I just check and clarify what recourse does a resident have if the defects were reported within the DLP period, but rectified not to the satisfaction of the resident and the defects continue to persist? Will HDB then consider extending DLP?",1,20,2016-01-29-T-001-S-00020
2016-01-29-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Madam, each case will turn on the facts. For specific cases, let us have a look at them. HDB will do what is appropriate and right in the circumstances.",1,21,2016-01-29-T-001-S-00021
2016-01-29-T-001,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Madam, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State what can the owners do if the contractors or the BSC are reluctant or are dragging their feet in responding to the defect complaints, knowing very well that time is not on the side of the new owners because they have a short window within which they must move in? They know that if they can drag further, the likelihood is that the owners will just accept the defects. So, what can the new owners do? How can we help them?",1,22,2016-01-29-T-001-S-00022
2016-01-29-T-001,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Secondly, my sense on the ground is that in some of the projects that I have encountered, there are really quite a number of defects. The HDB officers are just not able to cope with them. Manpower resource is a problem and they may not be empowered to do some of the things to rectify certain defects. It always comes upon the contractor. The contractor will again try to use the default response and push back and say, ""No, it could be due to some other things"". How do we help the new owners so that they have a positive experience moving into the new flats?",2,23,2016-01-29-T-001-S-00023
2016-01-29-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Madam, HDB sets a 14-day period as a standard for contractors to rectify defects that are reported. Of course, if the defect needs more work, on exceptional basis, these would take more time. Based on the statistics that we have, some 95% of these defects reported through BSCs are rectified within 14 days. Some take longer.",1,24,2016-01-29-T-001-S-00024
2016-01-29-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"If the Member or his residents are aware of these incidences where they feel that the contractors are dragging their feet, alert the BSC and HDB, and he can alert us.",2,25,2016-01-29-T-001-S-00025
2016-01-29-T-001,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As for the capacity of HDB branch offices and BSCs to cope with the number of issues that are raised, let us know which areas are of concern. We will look to enhancing them. Already, HDB has increased the number of staffing at BSCs to deal with the issues that are surfaced by residents.",3,26,2016-01-29-T-001-S-00026
2016-01-29-T-002,,Assoc,the Minister for National Development (a) how does the current number of heavy vehicle parking lots measure up with the current number of such vehicles and the demand for these lots; and (b) whether there are plans to review the location and availability of such lots.,1,27,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00027
2016-01-29-T-002,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (for the Minister for National Development) (Mr Desmond Lee),"Madam, currently, there are 34,400 heavy vehicles in Singapore and about 44,170 heavy vehicle parking lots island-wide. There are more lots than there are heavy vehicles. Seventy six percent of the lots are provided by the private sector, with the rest by URA and HDB.",1,28,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00028
2016-01-29-T-002,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (for the Minister for National Development) (Mr Desmond Lee),"We recognise that there is demand for more public heavy vehicle parks near housing estates as drivers prefer to park near where they live. However, there are practical difficulties to provide more heavy vehicle parking lots in residential estates. First, these estates are highly built up; second, land is needed for housing and other community uses residents need; and third, we also receive feedback of residents' concerns on noise and above all, safety arising from heavy vehicular traffic in or near residential areas.",2,29,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00029
2016-01-29-T-002,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (for the Minister for National Development) (Mr Desmond Lee),"Ultimately, it is the responsibility of business owners to have parking solutions for the vehicles they own and also to work out with their drivers appropriate transport options to commute to work, especially for those who have to drive during the wee hours.",3,30,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00030
2016-01-29-T-002,,,I thank the Senior Minister of State for the response. There are quite a few occasions where I have come across drivers who actually have to sleep in the vehicles because they really cannot find a heavy vehicle parking lot and they have to park by the roadside somewhere and they are worried about summonses.,1,31,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00031
2016-01-29-T-002,,,"I was wondering whether the Ministry can do some kind of review. We understand the disamenities that can arise from heavy vehicles parking close to residential areas, but perhaps a review targeted to specific areas would be useful as well.",2,32,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00032
2016-01-29-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Madam, perhaps to set the Member's concerns in the context of the nature of this issue, let me start out by saying that LTA currently requires every heavy vehicle to secure an overnight heavy vehicle parking lot at an LTA-approved vehicle parking area. And the Vehicle Parking Certificate (VPC), to that effect, needs to be produced before  one, a heavy vehicle is registered; two, before road tax is renewed; and three, before the ownership of the heavy vehicle is transferred.",1,33,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00033
2016-01-29-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Technically, every single heavy vehicle that runs on the road in Singapore already has a designated lot and a VPC. Otherwise, they cannot be driving. The drivers that the Member referred to, there are already designated lots for their vehicles, by way of the VPC.",2,34,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00034
2016-01-29-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"I said earlier that numerically, there are more lots than there are vehicles. The problem that the Member articulated in context is largely one of localised mismatch of supply and demand. There are a variety of instances, but let me draw to the House's attention, three situations that we can encounter.",3,35,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00035
2016-01-29-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The first situation is business owners want to park their vehicles after the working shift, near to their business premises. It is a factor of production; they went to keep it nearby for servicing, maintenance, security and so on. But they cannot find lots, because the parking in that area is heavily subscribed.",4,36,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00036
2016-01-29-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The second situation is a bit more interesting. Business owners have a VPC for their vehicle, that means they have a certificate and a lot, but they are not permitted to park in the lot for which they bought the VPC. Sometimes, we find that it is because the private operators of that particular parking lot is misusing the space, for example, using it to store goods, equipment for his own vehicles. So, it is a phantom lot. It is a VPC on paper; the business owner buys it, can renew road tax and all, but for all purposes and intents, the business owner does not have a lot and the driver bears the brunt of it.",5,37,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00037
2016-01-29-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The third situation is probably the one that Members see the most. The vehicle owner has secured the VPC but the driver prefers instead to park as close to home as possible, often, in and around HDB residential estates. But there are not enough of such lots and there is a waiting queue. I said earlier in my reply that these lots are scarce. They are located in heavily built-up areas. There is demand for land and there is a lot of security and safety concerns. In these situations, the drivers have difficulty getting to and from the lot in which the owner has gotten. The owner just gets a lot but leaves it to the driver to sort out his own commute. If it is ending work at 11.00 pm, midnight or starting work at 2.00 am to 3.00 am, for some drivers, that can be a challenge. It is largely because the company, the employer does not provide for that commute.",6,38,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00038
2016-01-29-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We will look to address the three big scenarios in a number of ways. For the first situation, we plan to inject more heavy parking lots in industrial estates where business owners have a lot of demand. For example, URA and JTC will continue to mandate the building of heavy vehicle parks in heavy industrial developments. The Member may like to know that since two years ago, since 2014, successful tenderers of selected Government Land Sale sites for industrial development have been required to build and to co-locate a multi-storey heavy vehicle park with their industrial development because it then supplements the spaces in that area.",7,39,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00039
2016-01-29-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For new industrial estates and whenever older industrial estates are being re-developed, both HDB and JTC will inject more heavy vehicle parking. This will be particularly useful for HDB industrial estates being redeveloped because they are not that far from some of our HDB estates.",8,40,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00040
2016-01-29-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For the second situation, the phantom lots, it is an issue of enforcement. The drivers who are faced with this ought to make a report so that the proper action can be taken.",9,41,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00041
2016-01-29-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For the third situation, and this is the one we are most sympathetic about, when employers get a lot and it is far from the driver's home and the company does not provide or does not wish to provide a service to bring the driver to work. We are looking at how best, through a number of levers, to get companies and businesses to meet the transport and commuting needs of their drivers. For public heavy vehicle parks that are at the fringes of residential estates, URA is looking at putting bicycle racks to enable the drivers to cycle home, if they wish to.",10,42,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00042
2016-01-29-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,There are a number of areas that we need to look at and it is not an issue that is one dimensional.,11,43,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00043
2016-01-29-T-002,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Mdm Speaker, I just wanted to ask the Senior Minister of State whether the Ministry of National Development (MND) will consider other options. I raised this during the Committee of Supply (COS) last year, which is about using other car park places available at night. For example, sports stadiums. If you go to a sports stadium, the car parks at night are totally empty because there is nobody in the stadium. Can we not think about converting such places to become parking lots for heavy vehicles on a temporary basis?",1,44,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00044
2016-01-29-T-002,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Essentially, we are talking about more efficient use of land. Whenever we talk about heavy vehicle car park lots, most of the time in the day, they are empty. So, we are keeping them empty in the day, only to be used at night. Can we not think of a way where we have lots of car park spaces that are for commercial or sports use and they are available at night, and we allow the heavy vehicle drivers to park there.",2,45,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00045
2016-01-29-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"I thank the Member for his suggestion, which we have noted from various previous COS sessions. A whole variety of out-of-the-box solutions is certainly being looked at all the time. The idea about parking space at stadiums, at schools for school buses, all these are things we look at. We need to be mindful, of course, about the concerns that are raised about safety. If the car park is near or within residential estates, then, that poses concerns that residents will raise.",1,46,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00046
2016-01-29-T-002,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"What about working with industry associations or unions? Individual companies arranging transport for one person may be difficult, but as an association or union, perhaps, they can cobble up enough companies and drivers to run a transport service circuit to address this location mismatch.",1,47,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00047
2016-01-29-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"About 92% of all heavy vehicles are owned by companies with the remainder being owned by individuals, maybe they are sole proprietors or otherwise. So, 92% owned by businesses large and small and even medium size. Apart from working with businesses, we will also look at associations to see how they can come in and play a part. I thank the Member for his suggestion.",1,48,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00048
2016-01-29-T-002,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Currently, there is a situation where the company buys the VPC for a location in Changi but the driver stays in Jurong. Another company may have bought the VPC in Jurong but the driver stays in Changi. Can we not have a matching system where they can just swop the VPC? Because currently, on its own, the company would not have the resources and the network to realise that there is an opposite match.",1,49,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00049
2016-01-29-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"This is about coordination at the broader level. From the company's point of view, if they know the driver lives in Jurong, they should try to look for a heavy vehicle park that is not that far away. As I said, there are about 30,000-plus vehicles and 40,000-plus lots. Businesses can play a part and they can have a conversation with their drivers to get a better sense of what their needs are. There are many levels where people can play a part.",1,50,2016-01-29-T-002-S-00050
2016-01-29-T-003,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked	 the Minister for Transport (a) whether any of the MRT's components or systems are operating past the manufacturer's recommended end-of-life date and/or end-of-life operating cycle; (b) if so, what is the planned approach to replacing these components or systems; and (c) what measures does the Ministry plan to take to ensure a systematically timely replacement of MRT parts and systems.",1,51,2016-01-29-T-003-S-00051
2016-01-29-T-003,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Mdm Speaker, the recommended lifespan of train components and systems is taken into account when decisions have to be made as regard their replacement. In practice, many components are replaced before their expiry, for safety and reliability reasons. This is because how long they will actually last depends on many other factors, such as how often they are used, how they are treated and maintained, as well as the operating environment.",1,52,2016-01-29-T-003-S-00052
2016-01-29-T-003,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"It is the responsibility of the train operators to make this detailed assessment and replace deteriorated components earlier than their end of life if necessary, to maintain the safety, reliability and performance of the system. This is especially so for critical components and those with safety implications. This expectation of the operators is set out in the Rapid Transit Systems Act, the Licence Agreement with the operators and the Code of Practice on Maintenance, amongst others.",2,53,2016-01-29-T-003-S-00053
2016-01-29-T-003,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"To further ensure timely replacement and upgrades, LTA has been working with the operators to install condition-monitoring tools – tools that can continuously monitor the condition of the components that they are interested in – as well as sensors, when they become available in the market. They also jointly monitor and analyse data and trends to try to anticipate any asset deterioration so as to eliminate such risks. LTA will continue to work with the operators to further tighten the maintenance and replacement regime. This is a top priority for us.",3,54,2016-01-29-T-003-S-00054
2016-01-29-T-003,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),I thank the Minister for providing the answer to my question. I have a few supplementary questions. The first is a clarification  I am not sure I heard the Minister correctly as to whether he has answered the first part of my question on whether any of the MRT's components or systems are operating past the manufacturers' recommended end-of-life date and end-of-line operating cycle.,1,55,2016-01-29-T-003-S-00055
2016-01-29-T-003,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"My next supplementary question  if a certain part has already expired according to the manufacturer's recommendation, but for some reason SMRT has still decided that they are in working condition, what will be the margin of tolerance that the Minister feels may be acceptable? Would it be six months to a year or more?",2,56,2016-01-29-T-003-S-00056
2016-01-29-T-003,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"My next supplementary question  would the Ministry consider requiring the transport operator to have a proper rail asset renewal schedule for the expired or soon-to-be expiring parts, even if the parts do not seem to be breaking down yet, so that we can stay on top of the curve as far as system performance is concerned?",3,57,2016-01-29-T-003-S-00057
2016-01-29-T-003,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"My next supplementary question  would the Ministry consider publishing input KPIs to measure parts replacement and maintenance works, setting targets and benchmarks against other MRT systems to track not just that the inspections are done regularly but also indicators like the ratio of engineers to the length of tracks and proportion of parts past their end-of-line dates?",4,58,2016-01-29-T-003-S-00058
2016-01-29-T-003,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"My last supplementary question  under the new contracting model, who pays for and is responsible for triggering parts replacement. Is it LTA or SMRT? If there is a change from the current situation, when will this take place, given that negotiations between LTA and SMRT have dragged on for two years or so?",5,59,2016-01-29-T-003-S-00059
2016-01-29-T-003,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"I thank the Member for the questions. It is quite a number of questions, but actually my reply has contained the essence of what I wanted to say. Trains are a very complicated system, much more complicated than, say, cars that most people are familiar with.",1,60,2016-01-29-T-003-S-00060
2016-01-29-T-003,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Madam, I hope the Member was in this House when my GRC colleague, Minister Ong Ye Kung, gave his speech, which I thought was an excellent speech. He talked about evolution and the way going forward. He said we should have ""faster legs, bigger hearts and wiser minds"", and in particular, the point about wiser minds. His point was that when things are simpler, it is possible to distill it into one figure or one rule, and then, we just go ""law by law"". But when the situation becomes more complicated, then you would require judgement, which requires hands-on experience and with time, you will develop judgement because you cannot just simply go ""law by law"".",2,61,2016-01-29-T-003-S-00061
2016-01-29-T-003,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"So, if we applied it to preventive maintenance, cars, especially new cars during their first five years, it is simple. Anyone who buys a car knows that the dealer will give him a book  first 5,000 kilometres, send the car into a workshop; the next 10,000 kilometres, do this; the following 10,000 kilometres, do that.",3,62,2016-01-29-T-003-S-00062
2016-01-29-T-003,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"When it becomes more complicated, like a train, which requires interactions between many components, systems and parts, it is no longer so straightforward. That is why I said that a manufacturer's recommendation is just a reference, a guide. Specifically, when do you replace it? That must take into account various other factors which are included in my reply.",4,63,2016-01-29-T-003-S-00063
2016-01-29-T-003,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"In fact, we have gone beyond this. It is just no longer a case of ""Well, just replace those parts because manufacturers say year x"". We are now often in situations where parts are replaced, not because they are going to reach or about to expire, but because of obsolescence. Just this morning, I read an industry article talking about German trains. The knowledgeable analyst made a comment that because trains took many years to manufacture and trains nowadays contain a lot of electronic components, and, dramatising a little, he said that there are occasions when as soon as a new train is delivered to the operator, some of the components are already in obsolescence, to the extent that the supplier of the components may no longer maintain them.",5,64,2016-01-29-T-003-S-00064
2016-01-29-T-003,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The report talked about the development in Germany where they have an engineering firm who decided to set up a factory to take care of these obsolescent components where no more suppliers want to deal with them. In layman terms, you know that some of the early-generation PCs are still functional but nobody maintains them anymore. In that case, the operators do have some problems.",6,65,2016-01-29-T-003-S-00065
2016-01-29-T-003,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"In short, sometimes, we have to replace before the expiry date, even though they are still functioning, because of obsolescence and sometimes, better, more reliable and easier to maintain parts are now available. That is the situation we are working in.",7,66,2016-01-29-T-003-S-00066
2016-01-29-T-003,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"On asset replacement and who does it, that depends on ownership. If I own the assets, then, I take charge and I decide on when I should replace them. But you must have a reason if you want to vary or adopt a particular approach, to decide if you want to keep it for a longer or shorter time. There must be valid engineering reasons for doing so and that has to be captured and explained if you are confronted by the regulator.",8,67,2016-01-29-T-003-S-00067
2016-01-29-T-003,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The Member asked can we publish KPIs for every component  when are you going to replace this, and so on and so forth? I suppose you can. But, Madam, as you probably know, I have been spending a lot of my time visiting depots because I wanted to talk to the people on the ground and also see their working life.",9,68,2016-01-29-T-003-S-00068
2016-01-29-T-003,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The first time I visited one depot, I was curious to look at their warehouse where they stocked all the spare parts. It was a huge place. They have to make use of automated warehousing with computerised forklifts to move the stock. I asked, ""How many items?"" It is a five-digit figure. Tens of thousands of components, which just shows how complex a train system is. So, if you publish for each item and track when you are going to replace this, and so on, I think it would be such a mass of data that I do not think it conveys much useful information.",10,69,2016-01-29-T-003-S-00069
2016-01-29-T-003,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The bottom line is this. Rail reliability is an engineering problem. Let us let our engineers solve it the engineers' way. As users, commuters, commentators and some armchair critics, you can just look at it from the outcome point of view; say to yourself, ""When I need a train, is it there?"" Yes, we are not quite where we want it to be, but we are making improvements. This is a top priority for myself, for my Ministry. Members could just look at me; look at my hair! I think it is mess of duckweed, multiple colours! I promised my wife last night that I will make time to go and dye it before Chinese New Year.",11,70,2016-01-29-T-003-S-00070
2016-01-29-T-003,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Just to conclude the story. Yesterday, I talked about my cholesterol. This morning, when I went to see the cardiologist, I expected it. He upped my dosage again. Over lunch just now, I was chatting with some colleagues and they asked, ""Well, what has changed in the last few months?"" They asked if I had changed my lifestyle or diet. I said, ""No, nothing"". But I can think of one change, which is I changed my job. So, maybe that is the reason. I believe I have answered the questions, Madam.",12,71,2016-01-29-T-003-S-00071

I believe his name is Kyle. His parents had posted a photograph of him after the incident on social media. Some of us would have seen the photograph. Kyle suffered nasty bruises around his mouth. His lips were swollen. His teeth loosened. As a result of that, he could not eat or sleep very well. It has been about three weeks since the incident.

2016-01-29-T-004,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"Indeed, although such cycling is allowed, cyclists must always remember that they have a duty of care not to endanger others through inconsiderate, reckless or irresponsible behaviour. In this incident, as is the case for other accidents, the Police will investigate and, if the cyclists are found to have been errant, the Police will take appropriate action against them. At the same time, LTA is stepping up enforcement efforts, it is developing a National Cyclist Education Programme with the Singapore Road Safety Council. It is clear that we do not just need enforcement. We need more education in order to further promote safe and considerate cycling.",3,75,2016-01-29-T-004-S-00075

2016-01-29-T-004,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),Would the Ministry consider mandating the use of licensed plates on bicycles to enhance accountability in the unfortunate event of accidents and also to protect cyclists from cases of mistaken identity?,2,78,2016-01-29-T-004-S-00078
2016-01-29-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Madam, I thank the Member for his supplementary question. It is a pertinent question, whether licensing will help. And one can imagine the benefits of doing so. With licensing, you could maintain a register and, in the event there is an accident, presumably we can trace who might have caused it. But it really depends on whether the register is regularly updated and whether the information which it contains is accurate.",1,79,2016-01-29-T-004-S-00079
2016-01-29-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Years ago, I was living and working in China, and I remember buying a bicycle. It was a pink one. My memory is fading but I can remember having to give my name, address and, of course, I had to pay a fee. And then I was given a small little plate to affix to my pink bike. So, there was a register that said who had purchased this bike. When I finished my posting and was packing to go home, this bicycle just would not fit. So, I gave it away and, if you ask me whom I gave it to, I honestly cannot remember. Quite frankly, whoever was maintaining that register is not any wiser.",2,80,2016-01-29-T-004-S-00080

2016-01-29-T-004,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Mdm Speaker, the Senior Minister of State has said something about education for safe and considerate cycling. Can I ask the Senior Minister of State whether the Ministry of Transport (MOT) would think about introducing speed limits for cycling at parks or park connectors?",1,84,2016-01-29-T-004-S-00084
2016-01-29-T-004,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),Just to share that I was doing a jog at Gardens by the Bay East and I had cyclists zipping by at high speed as if they were on a racing track. I thought it was very dangerous because there were also young children running along the park connectors. It may be a Ministry of National Development (MND) issue because we should not really design park connectors with too-wide bicycle paths that allow bicycles to speed.,2,85,2016-01-29-T-004-S-00085

As at October 2015, for pre-schoolers aged six years and below, who have developmental problems, the median wait time for an appointment for an initial assessment by a doctor at KKH and NUH is between seven and 17 days. For children of schooling age, the corresponding median waiting time for an appointment at KKH, NUH and IMH is between six and 19 days.

2016-01-29-T-006,Lam Pin Min,The Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Health),"Researching this would be highly challenging as any results would be based on observational studies only which would not be able to show a definite cause-and-effect relationship. Hence, it would be difficult to ascertain the direct long-term health effects due to the episodic exposure to haze as there could be many contributing factors to the long-term health outcome we are measuring. For example, it would be difficult to determine that intermittent exposure to haze 20 years ago would have caused the chronic obstructive airways disease in a person, since it could also have been caused by other factors such as smoking, previous lung infection, or existing lung diseases.",2,99,2016-01-29-T-006-S-00099

These studies showed that continuous, long-term exposure to air pollutants over several years may result in lung function abnormalities in children and subsequently, in adulthood. This could lead to greater susceptibility to the effects of ageing, infection and other pollutants, such as tobacco and smoke in adults.",3,100,2016-01-29-T-006-S-00100

The short-term health impact of haze is well documented for children and adults alike. Short-term exposure to high levels of haze particles may cause irritation of the eyes, throat and nose. Such irritation usually resolves on its own.

For example, to ensure swift response to critical cases where time is of the essence, SCDF deploys Fire Bikers in addition to emergency ambulances. Equipped with Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) and other medical equipment, these Fire Bikers have been effective in ensuring that cardiac arrest patients receive prompt medical attention before the arrival of the emergency ambulance. In the case of industrial accidents or road traffic accidents, fire fighting vehicles may arrive earlier than an ambulance.

2016-01-29-T-012,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Madam, fares should be based on the actual distance covered by commuters.

2016-01-29-T-012,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Before Downtown Line 2 (DTL2), commuters travelling from Bukit Panjang to Newton or Bugis would have had to use the North-South East-West (NSEW) Lines. With DTL2, a faster route is now available. Logically, PTC should then use this DTL2 routing to compute the fares. Unfortunately, while this would mean lower fares for adult commuters, it would result in higher fares for two other groups of commuters  the seniors and the disabled.",2,147,2016-01-29-T-012-S-00147
2016-01-29-T-012,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Fares from Bukit Panjang to Newton or Bugis for these two vulnerable groups are currently $0.88 based on the NSEW Lines routing. Had PTC used the DTL2 routing, our seniors and disabled would have had to pay a higher fare of $0.92. This is because of the way their concessionary fares are calculated and capped, coupled with the fact that higher fares are charged for travel on completely underground MRT lines like DTL2 where the stations are all air-conditioned, which incurs higher operating costs.",3,148,2016-01-29-T-012-S-00148

2016-01-29-T-012,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"With DTL2, with so many stations, it is quite easy to work out different permutations, how many possible journeys can be generated – something like 11,000 possible journeys. Actually, 99% of the journeys will be based on the distance approach to calculating fares. Therefore, commuters using 99% of such journeys will get to enjoy faster time and cheaper fares.",5,150,2016-01-29-T-012-S-00150
2016-01-29-T-012,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"For example, for an adult commuter travelling between Farrer Park and Newton, their fares have come down from $1.09 to $0.93. This is a saving of 15%. DTL2 has saved them both time and cost. However, for a few station pairs, such as Bukit Panjang-Newton and Bukit Panjang-Bugis, PTC has used the old NSEW Line routing to compute the fares so as to ensure that no commuters need to pay higher fares as a result of DTL2. This directly benefits our seniors and disabled, while the fares for all other commuters do not increase. In fact, by adopting this method, it benefits the seniors largely living near Bukit Panjang station. At first, I thought it was in Mayor Teo Ho Pin's constituency but it has turned out to be Mr Liang's constituency.",6,151,2016-01-29-T-012-S-00151
2016-01-29-T-012,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"This method of computation by PTC therefore benefits the seniors and the disabled living in Mr Liang's constituency, without causing any additional cost to all the other commuters. In fact, the other commuters also benefit because of time-saving.

And similarly, we have got Technology Adoption Programme (TAP) where they modularise technology like radio-frequency identification (RFID) and others so that SMEs which are not really capable or keen at this stage to engage in a very deep research, but want simple modular technology that they can plug in to, or that can be plugged into their systems.

We also heard calls for a more fulfilling pace of life, where we can pursue other aspirations outside of work. There was also interest among many to forge a stronger sense of a national identity and these are all important, and have guided the Government's work in the last few years.

For instance, one participant had the idea of building public gyms for people with special needs. Another suggested having retro disco parties for the elderly in the void decks of housing blocks.

Not everyone can be on the show. But there is a role for the audience to play in deciding who gets to go, who gets to stay and who finally wins the contest. Hence, we should not sit passively to watch the Singapore Story unfold. Take part in one of the SGfuture sessions, or get involved in other forums that exist.

The run-away successes of Kickstarter, Uber and AirBnB for instance are not solely because of the technology or the products they offer. They manage to effectively match demand with supply and vice versa. Their apps bring people together for a mutually-beneficial outcome and their apps make it easy for people to see what is out there, seize it and achieve a better outcome for themselves.

During these informal sessions, my residents raise questions as well as give feedback on improvements for the constituency. We also talk about ways to manage issues, from noisy neighbours to national topics like whether there should be free parking at national parks, which the Senior Minister of State talked about just now.

I run about twice a week. Regularly, I would post an open invitation on social media, for anyone to join me in my runs. These sessions, which I call ""Run with BYK"", allow me to meet more people. As we jog around places like Marina Bay or Tampines EcoGreen, we chat and learn more about one another. These groups are not large; in fact, often, there are just about two, at most six people. But what makes it different is that it is also very conducive to hear from one another because every new person I speak with is a new opportunity to learn about them, to gather feedback and to look at how we can improve the way we do things in Singapore.",16,192,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00192

And ""Run with BYK"" is all the more meaningful too now that I am with MCCY, where together with Sport Singapore, we are promoting better living through sport. During each small group run, we enjoy our conversations as well as the beautiful sights and green spaces of Singapore along the way. So, if you are keen, you can look out for the next run through hashtag #runwithBYK. Well, this is my personal exercise regime which I do anyway. I am just opening it up for others to join me.

In Singapore, funding of the arts is a partnership between the state, corporates and individuals, which reflects the spirit of shared responsibility and co-creation that I talked about earlier on. This approach acknowledges the role that the Government plays in supporting the development of the arts sector. Over the last three years, with the Arts and Culture Strategic Review, we have not only seen increased funding but also more arts groups and talents in the arts community are benefiting from this funding. This is because the Government sees the importance of the arts and culture in meeting the aspirations of the people and in building a sense of national identity.",21,197,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00197

So, I would like to ask the hon Member does he agree with that view; and if not, why not?",3,221,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00221

2016-01-29-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"But also, there was a change in substance of the content of the works that were first submitted for application and the eventual product that was produced by the artist. So, there was a difference in what was submitted earlier. There was also some of this to and fro that happened. Among the many applications and support that NAC has given to the many arts groups and artists in Singapore, these are a minute minority of cases which the group has pointed out.",2,223,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00223
2016-01-29-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"As I said in my speech, in MCCY and NAC, our role is to advocate the arts. We will stand on the side of the artists in their pursuit of artistic excellence.

2016-01-29-T-015,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Much of the attention surrounding the President's speech at the Opening of Parliament concerns the upcoming changes of the political system. The President's speech intermitted that an inclusive Singapore is a clear objective of the Government. I will speak on one aspect of the political system that I believe can play a very significant role to improve both politics and policies in Singapore and that is through Parliament and the institutions it offers.",1,226,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00226

2016-01-29-T-015,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To this end, Select Committees that meet regularly when Parliament is not session are fundamental pillars of many parliamentary democracies. The Erskine May on parliamentary procedures, the signature reference book used by parliaments in the Commonwealth, including Singapore, notes that Select Committees ""have over recent years become the principal mechanism by which the House discharges its responsibility for the scrutiny of Government policy and actions"". It goes on to say ""the Select Committee members have been able to acquire significant levels of expertise in the specific areas for which that committee is responsible. This, together, with the resources available to them have reinforced the authority of their reports"".",3,228,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00228
2016-01-29-T-015,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, Select Committees are also an important means by which Members of Parliament build a public record, communicate with other Members of Parliament, civil servants, activists and the general public. It is my view that the processes afforded to Select Committees are helpful because the testimony of witnesses, who could be private sector individuals, civil servants or implementing agents on the ground, would lead to greater information sharing and the acquisition of greater knowledge on specific policies by all Singaporeans, not just parliamentarians.",4,229,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00229
2016-01-29-T-015,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In addition, an appreciation of the trade-offs in a more complex Singapore and a more complex international environment beyond SG51 would, in my own estimation, significantly mature our political discourse, level up knowledge and serve to unify our people. It would also encourage Singaporeans not just to look at an issue more deeply, but to understand why what may be a solution to some, has to be balanced with other demands, all of which must confront the question of financing, a question that a small country with no natural resources can ill avoid. The depth of knowledge of policies and their trade-offs enabled by Select Committee hearings and reports can also be a strong insurance against the danger of retail politics and political aspirants who irresponsibly make policies in the hopes of winning votes.",5,230,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00230

This plan sought to address the main causes of low productivity in the UK. The Select Committee sought to determine whether the government's policies were likely to achieve their desired results. Ordinary citizens were able to submit their evidence to the committee through the UK parliamentary website. There was also the prospect of giving oral evidence at hearings that are open to members of the public and companies.",7,232,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00232

These include the development of elderly care services, retirement schemes, studies into free kindergarten education, animal welfare and cruelty to animals and even hawker policy.",9,234,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00234

However, there is a number of issues that would clearly keep the Government and the Opposition occupied in the years to come.",10,235,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00235
2016-01-29-T-015,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In view of the longer experience and size of the UK, they host an extensive A to Z of Select Committees.

2016-01-29-T-015,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"First, there is a prospect of a Singapore where the number of elderly Singaporeans is expected to double in the next decade. It will have an attendant impact not just on our healthcare system, but on families too with more children having to take time off to look after their parents to see that they age well and gracefully. An Active Ageing Select Committee would be helpful in this regard to understand what gaps need to be plugged, in addition to where the deficiencies continue to exist in the system, the reasons for their existence and how they can be overcome.",12,237,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00237
2016-01-29-T-015,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Second, there is a difficult population policy issue for which the Government has announced a mid-course review to take place around 2020. The Population Select Committee could potentially start hearings on this issue early, allowing Singaporeans to understand the decisions taken thus far and outline what other policies need to dovetail closely with our population strategies. It could also flesh out the different perspectives of Singaporeans with regard to trade-offs between the dwindling Singaporean Core and the economic strategies required for Singapore not just to survive, but to thrive in the next lap.",13,238,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00238
2016-01-29-T-015,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, this House can endeavour to establish just one Select Committee in the immediate term, as a pilot Select Committee, and that is a SkillsFuture Select Committee. In his speech, the President clearly emphasised the importance of SkillsFuture to the economy, how important it is for SkillsFuture to be a success and how it must to be a national movement. There are many dimensions to SkillsFuture  PMETs, career guidance, sectoral manpower plans, Earn and Learn credits, individual learning portfolios, amongst others, across the age spectrum.",14,239,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00239
2016-01-29-T-015,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Then, there is the issue of productivity. As I noted in my Budget Debate speech last year, the National Productivity Council has now come under the purview of SkillsFuture. For many advanced economies including Singapore, improving productivity is a serious matter. Even in Singapore, we have not achieved the productivity aims set in the Economic Strategies Committee Report 2020 of 2%-3% each year, and our numbers continue to look weak.",15,240,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00240
2016-01-29-T-015,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"As productivity and the acquisition of new skills are closely linked, a SkillsFuture Select Committee of Parliament comprising Members of Parliament from all parties would be in a good position to pursue and consider improvements and innovations to the Government strategies. This would ensure that SkillsFuture would work well on the ground, and examine how it could do more and to account for the taxpayer dollar that is eventually expended on it.",16,241,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00241
2016-01-29-T-015,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The presence of Select Committee Members from all parties would not just be symbolic. In fact, it will be in step not just with the wishes of many voters, but it would mirror the inclusive Singapore the President spoke about and the Singapore we all desire. More importantly, it would operationalise what the President meant when he said, ""Individual aspirations may defer, but we have to work together to create a common future"".",17,242,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00242
2016-01-29-T-015,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In conclusion, Mdm Speaker, the tremendous scope of Parliament and specifically Select Committees to make our politics more accountable and better accessible to all Singaporeans should not be underestimated. This proposal to establish a SkillsFuture Select Committee can be read in two ways. The more cynical view is that Select Committees could be used to secure information not in the public domain on Government processes and decision-making, and to embarrass the Government. But there is another long-term perspective to be considered. And that is the in-depth granularity offered by Select Committees on vital issues affecting Singaporeans which would contribute significantly to create a culture of mastery and excellence; and for Singaporeans to take a deep interest in policies and to understand the trade-offs surrounding policymaking.",18,243,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00243

I believe that employers must play a big role for a strong Singapore Core to be successful. It will require employers to be willing to make a deliberate bet on building a Singapore Core. Because with the rapid changes in the workforce, regardless of whether you are a large or a small organisation, it is difficult for your talent to keep up to reskill and upskill fast enough that there would not be skills gaps.

And I am not talking about just the graduating workforce. We have a very, very precious workforce called the middle-age or the mature PMEs. They have a wealth of experience. Go watch this programme that I talked about, ""The Intern"" and you will know what I mean. When you bring that diversity of talent together, both young and old, you will see the impact that will bring. Therefore, I do encourage all of us to go forward to build that Singapore Core.",29,274,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00274
2016-01-29-T-015,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"If I can quote President Tan in his speech, ""To remain special, we must first resolve to move ahead together"". In order to future-ready and build a strong Singapore Core in our workforce, I implore all of us to work together.",30,275,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00275
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to address this House in this new term. Incidentally, I have made a mental note to watch ""The Intern"" this weekend. Thank you to Member Jessica Tan.",1,276,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00276
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I rise in support of the Motion. Madam, please allow me to begin my speech in Malay.",2,277,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00277
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech on Pg xx.] Singapore's ability to thrive and survive as a prosperous nation with a plural society depended upon several fundamental principles, which did not come about by accident. It is an ongoing effort that includes good and credible governance that corresponds with current and future needs.",3,278,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00278
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Nonetheless, the situation will not remain static. Just look at the ever-changing global situation, whether in terms of the economy, politics, social and security, it will affect and impact us greatly. The harmony in society is one of the most valuable assets that we must look after.",4,279,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00279
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Hence, I truly welcome the review of Singapore's political system in order to secure the future of the nation for the long term. The changes proposed take various aspects into consideration, among others, ensuring good policymaking through good politics.",5,280,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00280
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The Elected Presidency, for instance, it is appropriate that the qualification criteria is reviewed because many changes have taken place, including the administration of the state institution, while the size of national reserves have also changed since the system of Elected President was introduced.",6,281,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00281
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"We have to be responsible in ensuring stability, because when a leadership change occurs in the Government, we will need sufficient safeguards to ensure that any government, regardless of which party it is, will act responsibly when making key appointments and in the protection of reserves.",7,282,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00282
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The role of the President has undergone many changes, not only as the Head of State who represents Singapore's interests, but also as the guardian of the national reserves. We must use this review process to further highlight the actual role of the Elected President, and the people need to recognise and understand the President's functions and powers, that is, the President's role is not imbued with political power, and he does not play a role in developing policy initiatives. Many people are still unclear, including some candidates, about the actual role of the Elected President and they may even confuse the voters.",8,283,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00283
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I welcome the move to form a commission to analyse the qualification criteria for Presidential candidates because it is important that we get male or female candidates of a high calibre and who are suitable and can represent us inside and outside the country. The proposed changes will further strengthen the institution of the Elected President that is already robust. However, a review needs to be done to make this institution more relevant and able to constantly meet future needs.",9,284,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00284
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I would like to now touch on an important area regarding the changes proposed in the Prime Minister's speech, that is, the interests of minorities which have always been the concern of the PAP Government.",10,285,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00285
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I am sure that the Malay community welcomes the considerations made to provide for a minority candidate for the office of the Elected President. Although it is too early for us to understand how this will be implemented, nonetheless, in terms of concept and principle, it is something that is gladly welcomed by the minorities. It will certainly fulfil the aspirations of the Malay/Muslim community, who have longed for a Malay President. Singapore had not had a Malay President since the late Encik Yusof Ishak in 1970, which is over 45 years ago.",11,286,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00286
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"We still remember the vast contributions of Encik Yusof Ishak, the people's President. It has been a source of great pride for the Malay/Muslim community.",12,287,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00287
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"If the community is proud to have had President Yusof Ishak performing that role – he represented all races outstandingly – surely, there will always be a Malay of a suitable calibre and can fulfil the qualifying criteria. But it will be unfortunate if our qualified Malays do not have this opportunity just because of the voting pattern.",13,288,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00288
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Another important issue is how the provision is implemented. It must be done by ensuring that there are no perceptions that this is an affirmative action; and it must ensure that the candidate is presented on the basis of merit, and can fulfil the qualifying criteria. Ultimately, what is important is that we must ensure diversity, without compromising the issue of merit and without affecting the quality of candidates.",14,289,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00289
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),Our meritocracy system has worked well. We can see more of our Malays in key positions and there have been no questions on their abilities or qualifications.,15,290,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00290
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The GRC system is a concept that looks after and protects the interests of minorities in the landscape of a plural society in Singapore. As we plan for more Single Member Constituencies, the Government must also ensure that minority representation continues to be safeguarded.",16,291,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00291
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"As a community, the Malays support this concept and this can even help us contribute more at the constituency and national levels. The increase in the number of Non-Constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) also allows more Opposition representation in Parliament, which will ensure more diverse views and opinions, and may also give more opportunities for Malay opposition candidates to enter Parliament through this scheme.",17,292,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00292
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Hence, I support the intent of these changes, in terms of providing diversity in this House and also because the Government is trying to fulfil the aspirations of the younger generation, who desires diversity in the Parliament of Singapore.",18,293,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00293
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"(In English)  Mdm Speaker, as President Tony Tan mentioned in his Address at the Opening session of Parliament, we need to keep our politics and our governance updated. In this regard, Prime Minister's speech on Wednesday was a timely reminder of how our political system had evolved since Independence and why we need to continue to evolve our political system to prepare Singapore for the future, from the NCMP and GRC schemes to the Elected Presidency.",19,294,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00294
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The NCMP and Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) schemes both came about as a response to have more diverse views in Parliament – one partisan and the other one not. The Elected Presidency came about 25 years ago as a custodian and a checking mechanism to protect Singapore's national reserves and the integrity of the civil service. In doing so, the President would help to deliver long-term stability for Singapore.",20,295,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00295
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"As we have seen in the last Presidential Election in 2011, this function of the President can no longer be taken for granted. To be a stabilising force, the President has to be above party politics and play a stabilising role for Singapore, even if there was a change in the ruling party. Since the last election for the President, there are concerns that the election process was seemingly politicised and threatened to divide a nation, rather than stabilise it. And I agree with the Prime Minister that the process and the elected position remains objective and non-political, supported by a capable and wise Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA).",21,296,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00296
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The revision of the qualifying criteria by the Constitutional Commission is timely – it was 25 years ago since they were drawn in 1990 – as the complexity of safeguarding our state institutions and reserves has gone up in magnitude since then. For instance, in 1990, the Temasek Net Portfolio Value was S$10 billion. As of March last year, this amount has grown by more than 25 times to S$266 billion.",22,297,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00297
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"So, it is important that we find men or even women of calibre, of excellent standing who can represent us here and on the international stage. However, the weightage in qualifying criteria cannot just be heavily weighted on one's ability to manage high-value companies or based on the limited number of key public sector appointments. It is an important criterion as a proxy to one's ability to fulfil the role of Presidency, but we must also ensure that this does not reduce the number of potential candidates, especially those from the private sector.",23,298,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00298
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Given the proposal to have the CPA's advice to the President to be given greater weight, it is therefore, just as important that the selection process and the merits of the selection of the CPA be made more transparent to the public. Also, if they had provided advice contrary to the President and a vote needed from Parliament, there must also be greater transparency on why this is so.",24,299,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00299
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"But, we also want Presidents who can represent the diversity of Singapore's society, especially when we want to project the accurate image of Singapore's meritocracy and multi-culturalism to the rest of the world. The announcement by Prime Minister is thus welcomed by the minority races as it will go a long way in strengthening multi-culturalism in Singapore.",25,300,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00300
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"In the early years, our nominated presidential system ensured we had minorities like Mr Yusof Ishak and Mr Benjamin Sheares. We were also fortunate to have Mr SR Nathan as an Elected President but his term came at a time when elections were uncontested.",26,301,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00301
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Given the current climate and competitive nature of the last Presidential Election, I wonder when another minority can be expected to be elected to the office in the years to come. In fact, we have not had a Malay President in Singapore since Mr Ishak, in 1970, almost 46 years ago.",27,302,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00302
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Here, I also note the concerns from the ground as to whether the intervention to ensure a minority President is elected then becomes a form of affirmative action and against the principles of a free election of the President. Personally, I do not believe that we should revert to the old system of the appointed President.",28,303,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00303
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"But as a guiding principle, any mechanism that is chosen, the minority candidate must first and foremost, meet the qualifying criteria of any Presidential candidate, so that the merit of his or her abilities and character will not come under question.",29,304,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00304
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"But perhaps, one proposal to catalyse a minority in the office of the Head of State is to consider the concept of a Vice President, where President and Vice President candidates are elected as a team and either one should be a minority. This may set the path for a minority Vice President to build his credentials and stand in good stead for the Presidency in subsequent elections in the event that we are unable to elect a minority President in the role directly.",30,305,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00305
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"While we keep a view on ensuring diversity, what is important, ultimately, is that merit is not compromised and that the quality of the representation is not compromised. We must find men and women of good standing to safeguard the nation's and people's interests.",31,306,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00306
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"On Prime Minister's announcement on tweaks to the NCMP scheme, I am supportive, in order to promote greater diversity in Parliament in terms of voices. Many I spoke to were surprised that after winning a strong mandate from the people of Singapore last year, the PAP Government could have easily kept the status quo, ensuring that Singaporeans can afford to continue to vote a PAP Government and yet have diversity in Parliament through the existing NCMP scheme.",32,307,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00307
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"But yet, it has opened the competition wider by expanding the NCMP scheme by as much as 25% in the spirit of having greater debate in Parliament. To the outside world, this may sound a bit strange as the PAP is seemingly diluting its hold in Parliament.",33,308,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00308
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"But I support this move, to increase the number of NCMPs and allow them equal voting rights with constituency Members of Parliament, to assure Singaporeans and Singapore that the Government respects the need for diversity, though it was not what the electorate expressed through the results of the last General Election.",34,309,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00309
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Given the increased voting privileges to the NCMP, I would like to point out that the position is one that has been given more respect and dignity and not turned down so easily for replacement. Parties cannot also assume that just because one of its candidates turned down the offer of being an NCMP, that it is their entitlement to offer it to anyone of their other candidates.",35,310,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00310
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"As a constituency Member of Parliament, if elected, you are expected to serve the five-year term. Any Opposition candidate who stands for elections knows the system. Once you stand for elections, you must then be ready to serve if you are called upon as an NCMP. You cannot just have a myopic view of being ""a duckweed in a pond that cannot sink roots"" and not give the NCMP position any dignity and ""suka-suka"" swap candidates. This is a privilege enshrined in the Constitution.",36,311,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00311
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"We do not want political parties playing the system to provide parliamentary exposure to whoever they like. If we want to take the NCMP system seriously, we should treat it like any seat left vacant by a constituency Member of Parliament moving forward, any seat that is left vacant should only be considered for replacement should there be a by-election before the next General Elections.",37,312,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00312
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Madam, moving on to my next topic, the challenges confronting Singapore becoming more complex. Increasingly, the Government will have to grapple with heightened terrorist activities and the rise of ISIS in Southeast Asia, as well as the possibility of Islamophobia and increased religious tensions.",38,313,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00313
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"All of these also mean that there is a new normal in governance and society in Singapore. That is, the increase of religiosity and issues concerning religion and how the Government will manage this going forward. There are many such examples in recent times. Like dealing with the sensitivities in the City Harvest case or the changes made to the rules for Thaipusam. Or even addressing issues on radicalisation or extremism and learning how we need to deal with the hijab. All of these things are fast becoming a norm and the Government has to understand and work out how it should manage this ""new normal"".",39,314,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00314
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"For one, the Government may need to review how it engages all the different racial and religious groups. For example, today, the Government uses a hub-and-spoke model, where it is at the epicentre governing the different groups. In doing so, sometimes, the Government gets caught in between and, thus, has to calibrate its intervention and relationships.",40,315,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00315
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),This model should change into a roundtable where each group is an equal partner and a stakeholder to the social harmony and stability. Such a model will also foster collaboration between the different groups and have more ground-up initiatives without the Government always having to play the role of catalyst.,41,316,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00316
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Such a roundtable will also not just mean involving the leadership of all faiths but also to engage them at their congregation level and that will help to gather their views on tough questions affecting the community. This not only helps to promote greater understanding, it also allows us to reach a new calibration, that is, what we are each prepared to accommodate as Singaporeans in our respective common spaces. Otherwise, the Government may be behind on where this ""new normal"" of acceptance is.",42,317,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00317
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Religious leaders may also try to second guess the Government in what it is prepared to accept. So, this roundtable multi-way dialogue should become an important feature of Singapore's future. In building this new construct, let us also not forget the atheists as I have also received feedback on whether they have a say and if policymakers understand their perspectives, too.",43,318,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00318
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Hence, social cohesion today becomes more difficult as you try to figure out friend from foe. And I fear most when this manifests, where opportunities and progression become more limited due to fear in our workplaces, schools and social environment. We must thus safeguard against intolerance.",44,319,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00319
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"However, our policies and how we manage increased religiosity must also take into account the ""new normal"". So, Muslims here are not consciously distancing themselves from the mainstream. In fact, the majority of Muslims I spoke to recently do not take any issue in respecting other people's religions and practices as well, or in greeting them during their religious holidays. So, how the Government handles issues concerning Muslims and inter-faith must evolve, including the use of hijabs in civilian spaces. I understand the limitations of the uniformed services and schools, but the trends have also changed.",45,320,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00320
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"If you look the consumer groups today, hijab wear is big online. Even global brands, such as Dolce & Gabbana and H&M, which are mainstream brands, have shifted to embrace hijab fashion as the mainstream. So, I just picked up a few. I think you would probably have seen them, quite common, with many of the young ladies. Maybe, Madam, you also want to consider this. This is H&M, by the way. This is Dolce & Gabbana, by the way, with nice handbags and nice shoes. So, they are quite mainstream today. That is the ""new normal"", it is not just about religion but, really, how it has come to mainstream as a fashion statement and how people dress.",46,321,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00321
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I agree that any threat from any religion that may threaten our social cohesion among the religious and race groups must be curtailed. We cannot accept intolerance. And for the Muslim community, the Muslim identity in Singapore must also be strengthened, due to the many interpretations and influences given our open borders and the age of the Internet. Given this ""new normal"", it may now be a good time to recalibrate and also sense where each of the other faiths are with all these difficult issues.",47,322,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00322
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I would ask the Government to establish a task force, made up of members of diverse religious and racial groups, to study and recommend appropriate mechanisms to strengthen this inter-racial and inter-religious fabric, as well as discuss areas where we need to recalibrate our policies to accommodate new developments or requirements of different faiths, areas that other respective faiths are also prepared to accept. Simple things even, like altars, altar fixtures outside your HDB flats, for example. Today, these fixtures are illegal when these are installed at public spaces. How do we manage this? We look at some of our policies.",48,323,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00323
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"While religion and faith cannot be ignored in our policies to maintain religious harmony, to preserve our secular nature of politics, we also need to be vigilant that we do not go the way of other countries by having religious-based politics.",49,324,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00324
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"For instance, during the last General Elections, campaigning by certain candidates took a religious tone and I was surprised that the Elections Department did not intervene or come out with a warning sooner. This is probably because it did not lead to any open conflict, which the Parliamentary Election rules specify as a premise for intervention.",50,325,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00325
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"But when candidates start to campaign along religious lines, what does this indicate about our political landscape? It has been seen in many countries that religion and state can be hard to separate and once we go down that path, away from the open and secular spaces that we have built after decades of Independence, there may be a point of no return. So, we have to be careful.",51,326,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00326
2016-01-29-T-015,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Madam, our way forward, our social fabric is as important, if not even more important, than the hard economic policies that we are proud of. With wise, calibrated and relevant political reform, and with the Government reviewing terms to manage the ""new normal"" in handling religious harmony, our social fabric will be strengthened.

Throughout this week, his words have come up repeatedly in Members' speeches. In this time, one word of Mr Lee kept sounding in my head. You could say that was his favourite word. And the word was ""So""? When I worked for Mr Lee; this is now more than 15 years ago. He liked to ask, ""So?"" Say, I would report some facts to him. He would say, ""So?"" I would talk about the implications of those facts and he would say again, ""So?"" And it would go on like that until we got to, ""So, what does this mean for Singapore and Singaporeans?

We must create value, by being a place where good ideas for the world can be realised; where people can come together to create value, to make an impact.

We did not have enough water? We created the water technology to overcome this. We are ageing? We will find a way to make that a source of new life in our society.

2016-01-29-T-015,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Last year, I attended ""Youth Celebrate!"". Seeing how children from different backgrounds worked hard and performed together, I was very much moved. In 50 years, these children would only be in their 50s or 60s. This reminds us that SG100 is not so far away. What we do now will determine whether our children will have opportunities to showcase their talents and realise their dreams, just as we now have. We owe the success we enjoy today to the hard work and sacrifice of our Pioneers who continually sought to create value. It is now our responsibility to continue this mission, to create value together, share value with every Singaporean and build a better future that belongs to us all.",54,386,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00386
2016-01-29-T-015,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"(In English)  I believe Singapore can succeed in our journey to SG100. We can create value for the world, and for ourselves, if we rely on our people, remain outward looking and possess the guts and gumption that our Pioneers had, to adapt and turn constraints into strengths.",55,387,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00387
2016-01-29-T-015,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"To share value, we must preserve our sense of togetherness, see value in every individual and help them flourish.

2016-01-29-T-015,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"When we look at the sum of all that has brought us to where we are today, the changes and challenges we face today and our hopes for our shared future, this is the ""so what"", we must keep creating value for the world and for ourselves. And we must share the value we create in a fair and inclusive way.",57,389,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00389
2016-01-29-T-015,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Which brings me to ""what for?"" I learnt to ask and to answer, ""so what?"" from Mr Lee. But I also learnt the ""what for?"" from him. Mr Lee was always focused on outcomes and purpose. What are we doing all this for?",58,390,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00390
2016-01-29-T-015,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"The ""so what"" changes all the time. With every new circumstance, every new challenge, we need to examine anew, so what does this mean? So, what do we do? But the ""what for"" is evergreen, be it 1965, 2015 or 2065. The ""what for"" is this  to build a Singapore where every Singaporean can reach our dreams.",59,391,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00391
2016-01-29-T-015,Heng Swee Keat,The Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"A Singapore where every Singaporean can reach our dreams is a Singapore where our people are fully aware of, but are not one bit afraid of, our challenges. It is a Singapore where our people can reach high in our lives no matter what background we come from and where our people can hold our heads high no matter where in the world we go. It is a Singapore where our people never fear, never give up, never leave anyone behind.",60,392,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00392

Now, all of us, together, need to put words into action, turn our aspirations into reality. As representatives elected by the people, we share a collective responsibility to bring Singaporeans together, listen with humility and find the best solutions for Singapore. As we start towards SG100, as we weather the challenges ahead and forge our future together, I encourage every Member of this House  always ask, ""So what?"", and always remember, ""What for.""

New Members made their maiden speeches, and returning Members brought to the debate their vision for Singapore based on the political experiences they have accumulated so far.

I hope to be able to do justice to all fellow Members and thank you, Madam, for allowing me to round up the debate.",2,396,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00396
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Madam, during his Address, the President highlighted five key aims that the Government hopes to fulfil. I propose to categorise the speeches that we have heard into these five areas.",3,397,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00397
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"First, building a safe and secure Singapore. Given the current geo-political climate, it is no surprise that many Members echoed the President's reminder of the importance of safeguarding our sovereignty. Mr Vikram Nair highlighted how the threat of terrorism, especially from non-state actors like ISIS, is real.",4,398,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00398
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Just in the last few months alone, Jakarta, Paris, Istanbul and Beirut were hit by terrorism. The recent arrest of 27 radicalised individuals right here in Singapore is a sobering reminder of this new reality.",5,399,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00399
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),Terrorism is no longer fought using conventional means. Dr Mohamad Maliki accurately noted that the far reach of social media has allowed radical ideologies supporting terrorism to invade the thoughts of our people. Mr Png Eng Huat noted that self-radicalisation is almost impossible to prevent. This makes the threat of terrorism even more insidious than other more conventional threats.,6,400,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00400
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"However, a ""safe and secure"" Singapore does not just refer to safeguarding Singapore and Singaporeans from physical harm; but should also encompass creating a strong and united Singapore that is able to overcome adversity should a threat materialise.",7,401,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00401
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"As Mr Amrin Amin rightly pointed out, in order to achieve this, ""legislation, policies and even weapons alone are not enough"". We need to win hearts and minds of all Singaporeans, and when the time comes, we have to stand as one united people. This was echoed by Ms Joan Pereira.",8,402,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00402
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"And as both Mr Ng Chee Meng and Dr Janil Puthcheary shared, our National Anthem, Majulah Singapura, is itself a source and symbol of unity and strength, to re-energise us to soar to even greater heights as a nation.",9,403,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00403

2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Second, economy. Calls to renew and restructure our economy were heard from several Members of the House. Big developing economies are showing signs of distress as Mr Sitoh Yih Pin pointed out.",11,405,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00405
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"But in order to overcome this period of economic uncertainty, we cannot afford to be stagnant; it is imperative that we adapt and face the threats of the new economy head on, as highlighted by Mr Desmond Choo and Mr Yee Chia Hsing. And this is a challenge that I am confident Singapore is ready to face, because Singaporeans have proven time and time again, that we have the will, not only the will, but the acumen to overcome obstacles put in our way.",12,406,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00406
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The formation of the Committee on the Future Economy, helmed by our Finance Minister, Mr Heng Swee Keat whom we just listened to, shows the Government's emphasis in developing economic strategies that will position Singapore well for the future. This also emphasises the need for a whole-of-Government and whole-of-Singapore effort to renew our economy, points emphasised by Mr Heng in this House just moments ago.",13,407,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00407
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"With the SkillsFuture initiative, we should be ready for a future economy where workers are empowered to re-skill, up-skill, allowing us to develop a strong Singaporean Core in the workplace, issues raised by Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar, Ms Foo Mee Har and Mr Heng Chee How. Mr Pritam Singh himself has suggested applying SkillsFuture ideology in Parliament.",14,408,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00408
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Another key component to overcoming this economic uncertainty is for the tripartite partners to innovate and reinvent our economic landscape. We must not be afraid to adopt new policies and ideas and to discard or reinvent outdated ones. Perhaps as Mr Zainal Sapari suggested, the tripartite partners can champion new approaches to improve productivity in our economy by reinventing business processes and rethinking creative use of robots and machines in the workplace. As Mr Patrick Tay stated, we should not forget to care for our Singapore PMEs in the process.",15,409,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00409
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"At the same time, as new technologies develop and we continue to restructure our economy, there will be a need for us to optimise our workforce for the future. Some industries will need more manpower, some require manpower in new skills, others may need to shed manpower through automation. This was highlighted by Mr Melvin Yong, Mr Cedric Foo, Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Ms Jessica Tan. But as Minister Yaacob Ibrahim noted, all these efforts will only succeed if Singaporeans step forward with a desire to learn and equip themselves with new skills, and if companies actively support and invest in developing their workforce. This might even mean Singaporeans taking on a different role like that of a freelancer, as Mr Ang Hin Kee shared.",16,410,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00410
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"There were also calls to continue supporting SMEs and entrepreneurs to inculcate a vibrant start-up ecosystem in Singapore. Dr Koh Poh Koon, Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mr Leon Perera pointed that SMEs and startups, especially those with high growth potential, are an important source of innovation in our economy. They will help to rejuvenate our business landscape and therefore should be supported. As Mr Liang Eng Hwa highlighted, we need to continue staying open and plug into the global network so that we can give our local entrepreneurs and local innovators access to more opportunities and enhance our chances of succeeding as a value creating economy.",17,411,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00411
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Essentially, Madam, we need to overcome challenges innovatively. If I may borrow the analogy that Mr Alex Yam used on the first day of the debate, we all know that Singapore's economy stars have not always aligned. Drawing from Mr Yam's own words, ""On paper, Singapore was never meant to be the successful economically. A country with no land or natural resources. But as a nation, we stand here today as a testament to the importance of hard work, carefully forward planning and team spirit."" I think we can all align to such thinking. And as an aside, Madam and Members, at present for Mr Yam, his stars have all aligned again. He became a father for the second time, to a second baby, on the second day of this debate. Two-two-two!

2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Not to be outdone, Mr Louis Ng has passionately volunteered to keep this going and had declared yesterday in this House that he will help to increase our TFR by having at least one more baby soon. Good luck!",19,413,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00413
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Next, fostering a more caring and compassionate society in Singapore. This is a topic that is very close to my heart and, if I may say so, Madam, your heart, too. So, it was heartening to hear many Members of this House highlight the importance of creating a more compassionate society in Singapore. For our seniors, innovative ideas like co-locating senior care centres at community clubs and planning for active ageing hubs in new HDB developments as well as the planning for multi-generational neighbourhoods were mooted by Dr Amy Khor and Miss Cheng Li Hui respectively. And more than just having community spaces and activities to keep our seniors active, there is also a need for us to encourage engaged lifestyles to keep our elderly engaged, happy and mobile. We need to build a strong social network for them, as were importantly raised by Ms Tin Pei Ling and Dr Chia Shi-Lu. A key component of a caring and compassionate Singapore is the role active citizenry takes and the growth of an altruistic spirit.",20,414,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00414
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mr Louis Ng shared his daring vision to set up ACRES and spoke with passion to help us ensure our policies relating to animals are humane. They too share this home with us. Ultimately, bolder steps need to be taken to entrench this value of care into our system, as Ms Denise Phua stated. This compassion should even extend to ensuring that people have access to justice, as Ms Indranee Rajah explained. As Members of this House, an important role that we play is to give a voice to the voiceless, and those who are marginalised in society. If we do not include their voices in law making, who will?",21,415,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00415
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"And as Ms Sun Xueling, Mr Dennis Tan and Mr Muhd Faisal Manap shared, we must care for the less well-off, the less fortunate. Ms Low Yen Ling reminded us that the values of our pledge should be upheld for all of society, a theme echoed by Mr Darryl David.",22,416,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00416
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The creation of a Coordinating Minister for Economic and Social policies, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman, reflects the Government's emphasis on aligning our social policies with those of our economic policies, for our economic policies must meet our social needs. This helps us in our vision that no Singaporean is left behind. A vision shared by Mr Chong Kee Hiong, Mr David Ong and Ms Rahayu Mahzam.",23,417,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00417
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Next, transforming our urban landscape. As highlighted by several Members including Dr Teo Ho Pin, Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Mr Ang Wei Neng and Mr Ong Teng Koon, this transformation should involve building better and more affordable public housing, creating more green spaces within our communities, embarking in long-term infrastructural plans to support a changing population, and harnessing technology and its potential benefits. To achieve this transformation, we need to put in foundations now, so that our children and our grandchildren will be able to benefit when these plans come to fruition in the future. As clearly put by Mr Henry Kwek, we should prepare our citizens so that they can go beyond Singapore, but let us build a home so that they would want to stay.",24,418,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00418
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"On the fifth theme, there has been strong support by fellow Members for the call by the President to engage and partner Singaporeans. The Government's emphasis on active citizenship engagement saw Our Singapore Conversation in 2012. Moving forward, the President has highlighted two national platforms, namely the SGfuture dialogues and the Committee on the Future Economy. That will be used to engage Singaporeans on creating a common future together. The keen value of these face-to-face interactions was brought to bear by Mr Baey Yam Keng. As Dr Tan Wu Meng highlighted, we each have a role to play – Government, politics, citizens – all together. No part operating in silo. This was echoed by Miss Cheryl Chan who noted that, as Singaporeans, we can and should aspire to be part of nation building. In shaping the future of our economy, as Mr Seah Kian Peng shared, we must embrace what it means to be Singaporean. Our future, and that of our children and grandchildren, lie in our hands as a community, society, a multi-racial nation. As Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef pointed out, the only upper limit for our future is the one that we set in our own mindsets.",25,419,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00419
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Together we must strive to improve ourselves as a nation, and to quote Mr Ong Ye Kung, ""to develop faster legs, stronger hearts, wiser minds"". I trust Mr Ong has all three.",26,420,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00420
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"There has been a call to renew or resolve to march towards our common destiny. And as Mr Chee Hong Tat passionately proclaimed, ""We are the descendants of lion-hearted Pioneers who built this country. Stay united, work hard and embrace the pioneering spirit of our forefathers.""",27,421,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00421
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The vehicle to which these five aims will be delivered is a decisive, stable and reliable Government, one that is effective and leads by example, and that introduces well-crafted and effective initiatives. Ms Sylvia Lim had rightly stated that Singaporeans want a strong Government, she went on to say with checks and balances. In my view, an increase in the seats of NCMPs to 12 and equipping them with constitutional voting rights, provide assurance of more voices in Parliament, more diverse views and, consequently, a greater need to persuade, placed on the Government's shoulders. I should say as with any checks or balance or insurance, as Mr Low Thia Khiang calls it, much depends on the quality and credibility of such insurance. But I believe Ms Sylvia Lim's premise remains that Singaporeans have a desire for a strong Government and that Singaporeans must feel they can make a difference.",28,422,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00422
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Over the past five years, we have heard various views about the need for the renewal of the political institutions and for political change. Many Members, like Mr Edwin Tong, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Zaqy Mohamad just recently spoke passionately about how they envision our political landscape moving forward and how policies should be tweaked for better and more effective results.",29,423,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00423
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The Prime Minister outlined how the Government will be making the necessary refinements to the current system to make our political system more robust and responsive to the changing political landscape. To many of these proposals, I am in agreement, but one caveat. I would like to say that any change needs to be closely accompanied by a deliberate retention of the existing culture of mentorship and the passing down of experiences. That should not change.",30,424,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00424
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Let me share why it is important. Starting politics at a young age, I had to learn humbly and fast, and more than anything, it taught me the importance and value of mentorship. Therefore, while we tweaked and refined the system, let us not throw out the continuity of mentorship, especially in the ecosystem of politics. The value of mentorship from more experienced Ministers, Members, senior leaders, the imparting of values, and the training of reflex actions to make important decisions in crisis situations must never be sidelined. This is especially important for a young nation who is storing up its own precedence of experiences to learn from and to rely on in future.",31,425,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00425
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I hope there will continue to be a long path for senior leaders to impart lessons on how to tackle difficult situations and most importantly, values even after they leave day-to-day leadership roles. In the same way, it is valuable for a young nation like Singapore, such mentorship and teaching is valuable to younger office-bearers and elected Members of Parliament alike.",32,426,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00426
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Madam, please allow me to share real examples  Emeritus Senior Minister Goh. He led Singapore as our Prime Minister and still continues to serve his constituency and our nation as a Member of Parliament with loyalty. To have him as an elected Member, still imparting lessons, is a treasure. Even more encouraging was watching news clips of Emeritus Senior Minister Goh walking under the blazing hot sun from home to home in areas within his constituency like Frankel Estate, where he encouraged Singaporeans to consider carefully their vote and what it would mean for Singapore. It encouraged me and I am sure many of us here, to dedicate ourselves to the constituencies we serve.",33,427,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00427
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Similarly, Mr Lim Swee Say and Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, my senior in Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, impressed the importance of constituency work, being resolutely focused on residents and ensuring changes are made in Parliament if one believes hard enough in the causes one holds. Mentorship is very important. Without it, we will be adrift at sea.",34,428,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00428
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Another example  President S R Nathan continued to mentor well into his 80s and still does. I remembered I accompanied Mr Nathan on a state visit to Istanbul. It was quite a long flight. So, Singapore Airlines dimmed the cabin lights after the meal was cleared. During the flight, I remembered going through in my mind the briefs MFA had issued us on Singapore's purpose and objectives for the trip. And all of the sudden, I found Mr Nathan seating on my seat's arm rest in the plane. He had walked over from his seat. I stood up immediately and anticipating he would ask me questions on the briefs. He did not. Instead, he spoke with me about Singapore, ""Never let our guard down, stay driven, stay focused"". He then talked with sincerity and insight about the Singapore-Eurasian community and asked after it. He was mentoring there, at 33,000 feet, when the rest of the cabin was asleep.",35,429,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00429
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"He left a deep impression on me.

2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The value of mentorship is in ensuring that values continue. These can only be passed down by human beings. Not an SOP, not an Instruction Manual. Mr S Dhanabalan himself, an exceptional person, recounted the value, talked of the value of being mentored by Mr Lee Kuan Yew in his eulogy at Minister Mentor's funeral. The returning Members, both PAP and Opposition, would remember what Minister Mentor said to all of us after cutting his 90th birthday cake, just there, in the Members' Room. ""Keep it clean. Keep it honest,"" was what Minister Mentor said.",37,431,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00431
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),How much richer we are as a nation that we have men with deep reservoirs of personal experience who are able to impart life lessons and leadership long after they step down from day-to-day leadership positions. This must continue.,38,432,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00432
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I was in the region on travel recently. A trusted friend many years my senior said Singapore had got it right. Former leaders helped. They do not ambush. In 2012, when the Minister Mentor was accepting less public engagements, I wrote him a note expressing thanks for his mentorship. He wrote back within a day; the letter stated ""I'm glad you found our conversations over the years of value. When meeting people, you need EQ. You need IQ because the margin of error for Singapore is very small."" The need to ensure continuity of mentorship.",39,433,2016-01-29-T-015-S-00433
2016-01-29-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Madam, one final example on this point. The Prime Minister has regular lunches with two or three Members of Parliament at a time. Sometimes, we have no idea what we will be quizzed about. It is always a healthy lunch which almost always ends with fresh fruits. Like the meal, the discussion is healthy.

She had only just entered Parliament then but brought with her a passion for matters she felt strongly about.",1,464,2016-01-29-T-016-S-00464

When the election results were announced, I was happy to note that she qualified for an NCMP position and the residents of Punggol East could benefit from the voice of someone who had worked with them for more than two and a half years. But this was short-lived as Ms Lee declared soon afterwards that she would not be taking up the NCMP position.",2,465,2016-01-29-T-016-S-00465
2016-01-29-T-016,Charles Chong,Mr Charles Chong (Punggol East),"Mdm Speaker, the NCMP scheme has been part of our political landscape since 1984, more than half the time that Singapore has been an independent nation. The Prime Minister, on Wednesday, had given a detailed explanation of the purpose of the NCMP scheme and indicated his intention to increase the number of Opposition Members in this House and to give NCMPs voting rights equal to constituency Members of Parliament. This was really not for the benefit of the PAP but for the Opposition. So, I am a bit puzzled by Mr Low Thia Khiang's claim that the NCMP scheme is for the benefit of the PAP to provide them with sparring partners. If this was so, then why do we get Workers' Party's candidates accepting the position in the first place for the benefit of the PAP?",3,466,2016-01-29-T-016-S-00466

On the other hand, members of the Workers' Party, who have previously been NCMPs, have spoken positively of their experience. But we are not here to debate the inconsistencies in the Workers' Party's position or what their internal politics are.

This means, in this case, respecting the results of voting in Punggol East SMC, which saw sufficient numbers of voters in my constituency giving Ms Lee Li Lian a mandate to enter Parliament, a privilege which she has, regretfully, declined to accept and one which the Workers' Party now seeks to transfer to another candidate who did not qualify on the basis of the GE results.",7,470,2016-01-29-T-016-S-00470

On the contrary, it was a benefit to all residents in Joo Chiat SMC. He is an example of an NCMP who sought to grow his roots in the constituency that he had contested in and I certainly do not consider him to be anything like duckweed, without roots; or a vase only for show.

No candidates should have this attitude that they will serve the voters only if they are elected. The WP has failed to do so and I am very disappointed.",13,494,2016-01-29-T-016-S-00494

Just like my Parliamentary colleague, Mr Charles Chong, has mentioned  if any elected Member of Parliament cannot fulfil his duty for some reasons, the seat cannot be transferred. If it is an SMC, then according to our Constitution, the seat must be filled through by-election to elect another Member. Back then, Ms Lee Li Lian was elected into Parliament through a by-election. To be fair, the NCMP seat should also not be transferable.",15,496,2016-01-29-T-016-S-00496

But now, we already have a total of eight Opposition Members. If Ms Lee Li Lian did not decline this seat, there would have been nine Opposition Members. In the future, there will be at least 12 Opposition Members. Furthermore, an NCMP will have the same voting rights as an elected Member, which means that they will be able to influence national policies. Hence, the legitimacy and the appointment of the NCMP will become more important. I hope that the Government can review the relevant legislation to make sure that the NCMP seat will maintain its legitimacy.",16,497,2016-01-29-T-016-S-00497

The system ensures that, regardless of the election results, in constituencies where the vote shares are very close, the Opposition parties will have the chance to represent their voters in Parliament. Therefore, only the losers who garnered the highest vote share can be qualified as an NCMP. This scheme should not become something like a proportional representation, to allow the party with the second highest vote share to have a certain quota to nominate their candidates.",17,498,2016-01-29-T-016-S-00498

In 2009, she said the scheme is ""overall supportable"" because it gives ""greater recognition to the desire of voters who cast votes for Opposition candidates in significant numbers which would otherwise be shut out in a pure first-past-the-post system"". And the next sentence is even more important.

Many in this House who have spoken in the last few days, including Mr Leon Perera on Tuesday, said that it was a privilege to participate in the debate in this House.

2016-01-29-T-016,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"If you want to work the system to say that you wish the minority voters to be represented by MPs, then let us make it equal for all MPs and it should be elected by a proportionate representation system, not our system. NCMP is basically the ""best loser"". It is a very different concept from proportionate representation of party lists. So, I think let us not try to change the concept and tell people that this is the same. They are different.",5,612,2016-01-29-T-016-S-00612

It is exactly because Ms Lee did not and would not take lightly the voters of Punggol East, that she decided having been their elected MP for over two years, their rejection means she has no legitimacy to be in Parliament. This is the way of respecting the wishes of the voters.",6,613,2016-01-29-T-016-S-00613

So, I do not really understand what the fuss is about. It is not a political manoeuvre because it is provided for under the law that says if an NCMP like Ms Lee Li Lian has not taken up the seat, Parliament can decide to fill the vacancy under the law, and hence I moved the Motion to allow Parliament to decide.",7,614,2016-01-29-T-016-S-00614

Let us not be hypocrites to say that, ""Look, they are the same"". They are different. I know because I have been an elected MP. And I see through how the PAP works. Of course, the rejection is explained as ""we do not allow political parties to use common areas "". You use the People's Association (PA), you use Advisers. Come on. Let us be honest about it.",10,617,2016-01-29-T-016-S-00617

2016-01-29-T-016,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Next, the difference between NCMP and Constituency MP is this  as a constituency MP, you conduct Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS), you represent the residents, you write to the Ministries. From the response of the letter, you will know what is the policy and what is the implementation of the policy. There are gaps. You follow up through the case.

You can do surveys and thereby, you can air your views in this House, but you will not know exactly the problem and the policy gaps, because you do not get those kinds of cases.

So magnanimous? To get more Opposition representation in Parliament? Mr Leon Perera has given a very good answer. Yes, you want Singaporeans to believe that there is no need to vote for Opposition.

I am not saying that it is not useful. It can be useful, but fundamentally, this is not what Parliament is for, because Parliament is not a forum to talk shop, or just air views, or spar with Ministers to show that you are a smart guy.",16,623,2016-01-29-T-016-S-00623
2016-01-29-T-016,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,Parliament is not an academic conference. A Parliament of a functional democracy must give Opposition MPs real power to check and to contest with the Ruling party of the day to hold the Government accountable.,17,624,2016-01-29-T-016-S-00624

2016-01-29-T-018,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Madam, the Workers' Party remains, in principle, opposed to the NCMP scheme. I have explained earlier, we are a responsible and rational party; we work within the system. It is the same  we oppose GRC, but we contested in GRCs. There is no contradiction. Make no mistake about that. And that is the spirit of the Workers' Party in wanting to work the system by respecting the law.",2,633,2016-01-29-T-018-S-00633
2016-01-29-T-018,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Madam, essentially, Parliament is representative of the people. MPs secure a mandate from the people to make decisions on their behalf in Parliament, thus, representation is the foundation of Parliament. Any politician who aspires to enter Parliament must seek and obtain the mandate from the people to represent them so as to seek and effect positive change for the people, not just talk.",3,634,2016-01-29-T-018-S-00634
2016-01-29-T-018,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"You can air your views, you can debate here, but is there change? Is there a new direction set? I think that is what matters most.

2016-01-29-T-018,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Therefore, the NCMP scheme is a distraction from the fundamental meaning of Parliament. The NCMP scheme has the potential to anaesthetise Opposition politicians from the consciousness that political conviction is what brings him or her into politics. Opposition politicians may delude themselves that they are checking the Government when they are, in fact, merely participating in the discussion forum with no real power to effect change.",5,636,2016-01-29-T-018-S-00636
2016-01-29-T-018,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"The NCMP scheme can also inadvertently attract candidates with a different motive and intent to participate in the Elections basically to seek personal fame and glory.

2016-01-29-T-018,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Madam, on the other hand, we also recognise that Parliament is a forum to discuss issues affecting the lives of Singaporeans and the future of our nation. We recognise that having one more NCMP will contribute to the debate and possibly, better policy outcomes. Hence, it is also meaningful for well-intended individuals who aspire to represent the will of the people to be NCMPs who contribute to the process.

2016-01-29-T-018,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mdm Speaker, I am glad that Mr Low Thia Khiang has made a distinction between the party list and the NCMP scheme. Indeed, I fully agree with Mr Low that the NCMP scheme is not a party list scheme.",1,641,2016-01-29-T-018-S-00641
2016-01-29-T-018,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Second, I would like to clarify with Mr Low. He has mentioned many things that an NCMP cannot do. But why not think about the many things an NCMP can do for this House and for this country?",2,642,2016-01-29-T-018-S-00642

2016-01-29-T-018,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"And finally, Mr Low, you said you have raised many dangers. Indeed, we agree with you there are many changes to the NCMP scheme including people coming in for the wrong reasons, people deluding themselves to showcase. If these are clear, present dangers, why do you allow your party Members to take up this scheme? It must be because on balance, you have found this scheme to be useful perhaps not just to yourself but hopefully to the wider Singapore as you have suggested; that they can contribute something even if they are not taking care of a constituency.",5,645,2016-01-29-T-018-S-00645

But the NCMP scheme itself is not a scheme which we will support as what we explained many times, that the scheme itself is not going to serve us well. I have just explained earlier on why. I am not convinced that this is going to be a scheme that will be able to allow genuine, serious Opposition parties to develop.",1,649,2016-01-29-T-018-S-00649

The amount that creditors can recover from winding up an insolvent company depends on the amount of assets the company has for distribution. Employees' salaries are paid out of the liquidation proceeds in priority to other unsecured claims, after deducting the liquidator's costs and expenses of winding up. Employees are thus paid as preferential creditors, second only to the liquidator's costs and expenses. This follows the practice in other jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.",1,705,2016-01-29-T-027-S-00705
