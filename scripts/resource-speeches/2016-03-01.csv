2016-03-01-T-001,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,asked	 the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the Ministry could have timeously addressed the extensive speculation on social media surrounding the case of the 14-year-old boy who was found dead after being interviewed by the Police; and (b) whether there will be a thorough review of Police procedures on the interview of vulnerable suspects.,1,4,2016-03-01-T-001-S-00004

2016-03-01-T-003,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,asked	 the Minister for National Development (a) what is the current process for a small business to get an alternative site from HDB or JTC to continue their business if their shop/office is destroyed by fire; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider expediting the process so that the affected businesses can make a quick recovery to resume their business.,1,14,2016-03-01-T-003-S-00014
2016-03-01-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"Madam, both HDB and JTC have measures to assist tenants whose premises have been affected by fire, so that their business operations can resume as quickly as possible.",1,15,2016-03-01-T-003-S-00015
2016-03-01-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"For example, in the case of factory units, HDB will take over the affected premises and carry out architectural and structural repair works. HDB will also grant rent remission to the tenants of the affected units from the date of fire until the date the units are reinstated and handed back to the tenants to resume business operations.",2,16,2016-03-01-T-003-S-00016
2016-03-01-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"During the period of rectification works, if the tenant needs alternative units to continue their operations, HDB can allocate available vacant factory units, known as transitional units, to the tenant for temporary occupation. Similarly, JTC will assist by looking for alternative factory units while the affected premises are being repaired. In addition, they provide rental remission on a case-by-case basis.",3,17,2016-03-01-T-003-S-00017
2016-03-01-T-003,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),I thank the Senior Minister of State for the answer. I have a supplementary question on transitional units. May I know how many such units are there available or is there a rough estimation on how many will be available?,1,18,2016-03-01-T-003-S-00018
2016-03-01-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Madam, the numbers fluctuate, depending on whether they have been taken up. There is no fixed figure at any one time.",1,19,2016-03-01-T-003-S-00019
2016-03-01-T-004,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,asked	 the Minister for National Development (a) what are the plans for HDB commercial shops that have their 30-year lease expiring in a few years; and (b) what are the long-term plans for towns with these commercial shops not partaking in the Revitalisation of Shops (ROS) scheme.,1,20,2016-03-01-T-004-S-00020
2016-03-01-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Madam, similar to other leasehold properties, the shops which had been sold by HDB on 30-year lease will be returned to the lessor, in this case, HDB, upon the expiry of the lease. Where possible and if in line with future planning intentions, HDB can consider allowing lessees to rent the shops after the lease expires.",1,21,2016-03-01-T-004-S-00021
2016-03-01-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"HDB shops are an integral part of public housing estates and are provided to meet residents' needs. The Revitalisation of Shops or ROS scheme has been designed specifically for HDB shops, to help enhance their vibrancy and improve their competitiveness. Under this scheme, the Local Merchants' Associations have the opportunity to lead and drive the revitalisation of their respective shop clusters, with funding support from the Town Council and HDB. To-date, 50% of HDB Town Centres and Neighbourhood Centres have benefited from the ROS scheme.",2,22,2016-03-01-T-004-S-00022
2016-03-01-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Besides the ROS scheme, HDB has other programmes to rejuvenate older towns and estates, like the Remaking Our Heartland (ROH) programme, which provides enhancements for the entire town.",3,23,2016-03-01-T-004-S-00023
2016-03-01-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),MND and HDB have also been reviewing the ROS scheme with the aim of encouraging more retailers to upgrade their shops and business operations. The outcome of the review will be announced in due course.,4,24,2016-03-01-T-004-S-00024
2016-03-01-T-004,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Minister for his answers. I have three supplementary questions. First, for those where the tenure is already up, how long will the lease be for the renewal? Second, what are the criteria under MND for the mix of those on sale and of the lease of the shops? Last, would MND consider the transfer of ownership between one generation and the other, if we want to have some businesses thrive over generations?",1,25,2016-03-01-T-004-S-00025
2016-03-01-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, can I ask the Member to ask the second question again?",1,26,2016-03-01-T-004-S-00026
2016-03-01-T-004,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"The second question is what are the criteria being used to determine the ratio in each of the HDB heartland, between those shops on sale and those for lease.",1,27,2016-03-01-T-004-S-00027
2016-03-01-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, on the first question on tenure, that will vary from shop to shop and by the individual circumstance. So, I cannot give a definite answer but HDB will look at each case on a case-by-case basis.",1,28,2016-03-01-T-004-S-00028
2016-03-01-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the mix between sale and lease, HDB does not sell any more shops. There was a certain point in time when these were put out on a ""sold"" basis to encourage ownership, but this is not the case today. Currently, all the shops are put up on a rental basis.",2,29,2016-03-01-T-004-S-00029
2016-03-01-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On transfer of business from generation to generation, I presume Miss Chan is referring to sold shops and whether those can be transferred from one generation to the next. If it is within the tenure of the lease, HDB will consider it. So, if it is within the period where it is owned by that person and he wants to pass it on to the children, that could be considered. If it goes beyond that particular tenure, then that is a separate matter which would have to be considered separately.",3,30,2016-03-01-T-004-S-00030
2016-03-01-T-005,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak,asked	 the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) how many vehicles have been booked during the past three years for leaving the engine of their stationary vehicles running; (b) what is the duration allowed before the vehicle owner can be penalised; and (c) what is the Ministry doing to raise awareness of this rule to vehicle owners.,1,31,2016-03-01-T-005-S-00031
2016-03-01-T-005,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Under the Environmental Protection and Management (Vehicular Emissions) Regulations, it is an offence to leave the engine of a motor vehicle running when it is stationary for reasons other than traffic conditions. Leaving the engine running when the vehicle is stationary, results in fuel wastage and unnecessary environmental pollution.",1,32,2016-03-01-T-005-S-00032
2016-03-01-T-005,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"While there is no grace period allowed for the idling of vehicle engine in the Regulations, NEA officers will exercise judgement on the ground before errant motorists are booked. Over the past three years, NEA has booked more than 12,000 motorists for idling their vehicles.",2,33,2016-03-01-T-005-S-00033
2016-03-01-T-005,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"As part of its outreach programmes, NEA works closely with stakeholders such as the authorised vehicle inspection centres, private and public transport operators and schools to disseminate educational pamphlets and decals so as to raise awareness of the regulation and forewarn motorists not to leave their vehicle engines idling. To promote greater awareness, NEA has also installed anti-vehicle idling signage at places where vehicles frequently congregate, such as carparks, loading/unloading bays and along the roadside near schools.",3,34,2016-03-01-T-005-S-00034
2016-03-01-T-005,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),Everyone has a part to play in safeguarding our environment and public health. Members of the public who spot idling vehicles are encouraged to report them to NEA via their hotline or the myENV app.,4,35,2016-03-01-T-005-S-00035
2016-03-01-T-005,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister for his answer. I am a little surprised to hear that 12,000 had been booked in the last three years. I would like the Minister to confirm that again. In a similar Parliamentary Question (PQ) three years ago, the average number of advisory notes issued was 320 per year. That figure was given in 2012. Twelve drivers were booked for offences. But now, the Minister has just replied that 12,000 had been booked. Why the big jump from 12 to 12,000? If the numbers are correct, is there a concern that there are more and more offenders now?",1,36,2016-03-01-T-005-S-00036
2016-03-01-T-005,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Indeed, it is an area of concern. The numbers have increased largely because we have enforced more and there have been more complaints from the public. It is useful also for people who drive to know that, today, modern technology does not require you to warm up your engine before you drive. Sometimes, there is this misperception that you have to continue keeping your engine warm so that you can get better fuel efficiency or make the engine last longer.",1,37,2016-03-01-T-005-S-00037
2016-03-01-T-005,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In reality today, vehicle manufacturers we have consulted say that engines warm up faster to reach the optimal temperature when the vehicle is driven at moderate speeds upon starting. So, that is the new technology. It is what we have today.",2,38,2016-03-01-T-005-S-00038
2016-03-01-T-005,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"So, I hope people will move away from the old habits. With old engines, yes, they need to be warmed up before the vehicles move. But we need new habits, because engines today do not have to warm up.",3,39,2016-03-01-T-005-S-00039
2016-03-01-T-005,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak,"Can I ask the Minister what was the quantum of the fine given to these 12,000 offenders? Should we revise the fines, if the deterrence measures still do not work?",1,40,2016-03-01-T-005-S-00040
2016-03-01-T-005,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Under Regulation 21 of the Environmental Protection and Management Regulations, it is an offence for any driver to leave the engine of a motor vehicle idling when the vehicle is stationary for reasons other than traffic conditions, or the working of on-board machinery for some ancillary purposes. The offence carries the following Court penalty  a maximum fine of $2,000 for the first offence, a maximum fine of $5,000 for the second and subsequent offence. There are provisions under the regulations to compound the offence and the quantum of the compound fine is currently fixed at $70. We will look at whether we need to review this for the future.",1,41,2016-03-01-T-005-S-00041
2016-03-01-T-006,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),Question No 13.,1,42,2016-03-01-T-006-S-00042
2016-03-01-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),"In 2015, the National Environment Agency (NEA) received some 2,800 reports of high-rise littering. High-rise littering is an anti-social act and offence that can pose a threat to public health and safety. NEA has been working with the Town Councils and grassroots organisations to remind residents of the dangers of high-rise littering. In addition to the reports received by NEA, SPF's records showed that in 2015, two persons were arrested for throwing killer litter which resulted in hurt. SPF did not receive any reports of death from killer litter in 2015.",1,43,2016-03-01-T-006-S-00043
2016-03-01-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),"Due to the nature of the offence, high-rise litterbugs are traditionally difficult to apprehend. When feedback on high-rise littering is received, outreach and education efforts to caution residents against high-rise littering will be conducted by my Ministry, the Town Councils and grassroots organisations, and in most cases the situation will improve after these efforts. However, in cases of persistent high-rise littering, NEA will deploy surveillance cameras once a suitable deployment site has been identified.",2,44,2016-03-01-T-006-S-00044
2016-03-01-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),"NEA has stepped up the deployment of these cameras over the years and has conducted close to 3,000 deployments since August 2012. Last year, NEA took more than 800 enforcement actions against high-rise litterbugs, an 80-fold increase compared to 2011, when the surveillance cameras had not been introduced yet. Offenders who were prosecuted in Court received fines ranging from $700 to $5,600.",3,45,2016-03-01-T-006-S-00045
2016-03-01-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),"NEA will continue to tackle high-rise littering by deploying surveillance cameras and secure the conviction of high-rise litterbugs. While the effective conviction of high-rise litterbugs will serve as a deterrent to would-be offenders, I would like to urge every member of the public to play his part to cultivate social graciousness, good habits and a sense of shared responsibility for the cleanliness and safety of our neighbourhoods.",4,46,2016-03-01-T-006-S-00046
2016-03-01-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Senior Minister of State for the answer. I would like to ask  for recalcitrant high-rise litterbugs, would the Ministry consider imposing a certain limit whereby if they have exceeded a number of times where they were caught for high-rise littering, that tougher measures beyond just fines will be imposed on them? For example, in very extreme cases, perhaps, confiscation of their flats. I believe there are some cases, where the litterbugs have been really recalcitrant despite many, many fines already imposed on the persons. Will the Ministry consider such a measure?",1,47,2016-03-01-T-006-S-00047
2016-03-01-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Also, one of the issues is that high-rise litterbugs continue to offend on a daily basis, thinking they can get away with it. Will the Ministry consider revealing the identity of litterbugs who may be caught on camera so that the grassroots or agencies can then follow up with these persons and to try and persuade the persons to not litter in the future?",2,48,2016-03-01-T-006-S-00048
2016-03-01-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"I want to thank the Member for her suggestions as well as her questions. Firstly, for recalcitrant high-rise litterbugs, to consider if we should cap the limit for the fine imposed. First of all, for high-rise litterbugs, the fine is not compounded. They have to attend Court and the Court will decide on the fines to be imposed. But certainly, this is something that we can follow up on.",1,49,2016-03-01-T-006-S-00049
2016-03-01-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Regarding the acquisition of a property, we need to carefully consider this. In most instances, in fact, since we started the implementation of surveillance cameras, as I have noted earlier, we have been able to effectively enforce on a significant number of litterbugs. Last year, for instance, more than 800 enforcement actions were taken and we hope that this will be a deterrence. Before we even deploy surveillance cameras, we undertake education and outreach efforts, including house-to-house visits. In most cases, the littering would stop or improve. Therefore, implementing the surveillance cameras acts as a deterrence.",2,50,2016-03-01-T-006-S-00050
2016-03-01-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Having said that, for recalcitrant offenders, we also have to look at the facts of each case. In cases where it may be due to mental issues, we work closely with the grassroots, as well as with the family members, to see what assistance can be rendered, as well as to implement measures to prevent this littering from happening, for instance, even installing wire mesh across the grills of the windows to prevent the littering offence. We need to look at each case separately and be mindful that some of these may be due to specific issues.",3,51,2016-03-01-T-006-S-00051
2016-03-01-T-006,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State how many surveillance cameras does NEA have and how long do they take to deploy surveillance cameras. The reason I ask is that there are many near-miss cases. Residents show me their clothes that were burnt by cigarette butts. But whenever I asked for action, NEA officers would merely set up ambush and then they would give me the update that they did not catch anyone. So, I have the impression that NEA does not have sufficient surveillance cameras and it takes a long time for them to deploy the cameras.",1,52,2016-03-01-T-006-S-00052
2016-03-01-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"In response to the rising number of high-rise littering feedback, we have done a number of things. Firstly, of course, we have stepped up our outreach and education efforts. Secondly, we have increased the number of camera deployments since the adoption of this method to catch persistent high-rise litterbugs in 2012.",1,53,2016-03-01-T-006-S-00053
2016-03-01-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We have increased the number of camera deployments by more than four times to close to 3,000 over the last three years.

We will continue to monitor the situation on the ground to see if we need to deploy more cameras.",2,54,2016-03-01-T-006-S-00054
2016-03-01-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"But let me assure the Member that we will deploy a surveillance camera when it is assessed that there is a need to do so when our outreach and education efforts do not resolve the problem, notwithstanding the fact that resources are ultimately finite and, like everybody else, we do experience resource constraints. But having said that, if there is a need and it is feasible to deploy the camera, we will do so.",3,55,2016-03-01-T-006-S-00055
2016-03-01-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"With regard to the time required to deploy a camera, normally, upon confirmation of the need to deploy a camera, we can install it as soon as four days from the date of confirmation. We need the time to do a detailed site assessment to determine the feasibility of the installation of the camera, as well as to further study where is the best position or the vantage point to deploy the camera to increase the success rate of catching the high-rise littering act, whilst safeguarding the privacy of residents around.",4,56,2016-03-01-T-006-S-00056
2016-03-01-T-006,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for her answers and I concur with my Parliamentary colleagues that this is a big concern.

2016-03-01-T-006,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"First, of the camera deployments, what proportion of deployments has led to identifiable perpetrators being successfully convicted or warned? Second, would the Ministry continue upgrading the camera technology so that there can be better night-vision image acquisition as well as higher resolution images? Third, I also second Ms Tin Pei Ling's suggestion that offenders could be named and shamed, similar to how litterbugs were dealt with some years ago.",2,58,2016-03-01-T-006-S-00058
2016-03-01-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We agree with Members that high-rise littering is an anti-social act and it is something that we must not condone and will not tolerate as it poses a threat to public health and safety. At the end of the day, I think all of us need to play our part to cultivate social graciousness, good habits, as well as a sense of shared responsibility. Deploying more and more cameras really is not sustainable and it is also not desirable. But having said that, we take every high-rise littering feedback seriously and, where there is a need to deploy the camera, we will do so.",1,59,2016-03-01-T-006-S-00059
2016-03-01-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Regarding the success rate of the cameras in identifying perpetrators, on the whole, based on the number of camera deployments, it is about one-third. The reason is that, very often, when we put up a camera, it may actually deter the litterbug from littering if he is aware that there is a camera focused on him or the unit. In some instances, it could also be because of intelligence or understanding of the ground, the camera could be focused at the wrong column of flat units, or on the wrong column and then we will have to redeploy it.",2,60,2016-03-01-T-006-S-00060

2016-03-01-T-007,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Mdm Speaker, there were about 6,500 oil spill incidents in the last five years. Most were minor spills that did not lead to significant traffic disruptions. Only 13 were serious cases that required the roads to be resurfaced, resulting in severe traffic jams. This year, four major oil spills have occurred on Singapore roads. There is no clear commonality in the profile of the drivers involved. Both local and foreign drivers and vehicles were involved.",1,66,2016-03-01-T-007-S-00066
2016-03-01-T-007,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Most oil spills are caused by accidents or breakdowns. To reduce accidents, the Traffic Police (TP) will continue to educate and engage the public through its various campaigns and enforce against reckless driving. On its part, LTA mandates regular vehicular inspections to ensure that vehicles are kept in good shape, so as to minimise breakdowns on the roads.",2,67,2016-03-01-T-007-S-00067
2016-03-01-T-007,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"In recent years, LTA has claimed from the involved parties, amounts ranging from about $5,000 to $200,000 for the cost of repairs to damaged roads. LTA is looking into imposing deterrent penalties.",3,68,2016-03-01-T-007-S-00068
2016-03-01-T-007,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. Would the Senior Minister of State consider providing clear notification to motorists and not merely state that there is an obstacle or an accident on the road because, with knowledge of the severity of the accident and timely notice, motorists would then have the option to take a route away from the incident?",1,69,2016-03-01-T-007-S-00069
2016-03-01-T-007,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"I thank the Member for the question. EMAS signs on the expressways and arterial roads currently show only the key information related to traffic incidents, such as the root causes and the magnitude. As oil spills are not root causes and are, in fact, often caused by root causes like vehicular breakdowns or accidents, they are not reflected in the EMAS.",1,70,2016-03-01-T-007-S-00070
2016-03-01-T-007,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Nevertheless, LTA will review how EMAS displays can be enhanced to convey more information about major incidents which may be useful to motorists.

Relying on the experiences of IRAS investigators and advanced analytics, IRAS has investigated or audited about 71,000 claims, or around 30% of the PIC Cash Payout claims made from Years of Assessment 2011 to 2015. One thousand five hundred of these claims investigated or audited required clawback. As for the amount of cash payout clawed back, for Years of Assessment 2011 to 2014, IRAS has clawed back $11 million, of which, $8 million has been recovered to date.",3,75,2016-03-01-T-008-S-00075

2016-03-01-T-008,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),The Government takes a serious stance on PIC abuse.

2016-03-01-T-008,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, three supplementary questions for the Senior Minister of State. I am sorry, the figures were too much for me to remember, but I wonder if the Senior Minister of State could clarify, out of the applications made for cash payouts, how many percent of the claims were rejected before payout and how many needed to be clawed back after payout? If the Senior Minister of State could give us a sense of that distinction.",1,78,2016-03-01-T-008-S-00078
2016-03-01-T-008,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Secondly, I wonder if the Ministry, in hindsight, thinks that it perhaps had been too lax in its approval procedures since now we are faced with having to claw back after payout, and whether IRAS would review the approval process to tighten this up.",2,79,2016-03-01-T-008-S-00079
2016-03-01-T-008,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thirdly, I understand that IRAS has prosecuted some people in Court for PIC fraud and there are also some cases pending prosecution as well. From the IRAS website, the cases that were reported as prosecuted appeared to involve the grant recipients. We understand that, of course, many of the grant recipients relied on consultants who provided them, as it seems, dubious advice. So, I would like the Ministry to clarify are there cases actually involving consultants that have been prosecuted or are being prosecuted, and, if so, how many of them.",3,80,2016-03-01-T-008-S-00080
2016-03-01-T-008,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"If I may address the Member's questions in turn, I think what the Member is really seeking is to have an idea, the sense of the claims which are actually rejected before payout and after payout.",1,81,2016-03-01-T-008-S-00081
2016-03-01-T-008,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"As I had mentioned earlier, around 71,000 have been investigated or audited. After they have been investigated or audited and rejected upfront, it is about 43,000. There are a number of investigated and audited cases that led to actual clawback. That is about 1,470 or if we round it up, 1,500. That is the first part of the question.",2,82,2016-03-01-T-008-S-00082
2016-03-01-T-008,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The other question the Member had asked was whether we should review the approval process. That is something that we constantly look at to see how we can improve it. But there is also the other aspect, which is where people deliberately attempt to abuse the system. And that is, in fact, the reason why we do these audits. We want to make sure that even though on the face of it, it looks like they have done the application properly, you have got to look behind it. That is why IRAS investigates and does audits. As I have said earlier, we will have no hesitation in prosecuting those that are found to be abusing the system.",3,83,2016-03-01-T-008-S-00083
2016-03-01-T-008,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The Member also asked about whether prosecutions included consultants. I am afraid I do not have that information with me at the moment, but that can be checked.",4,84,2016-03-01-T-008-S-00084
2016-03-01-T-008,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Mdm Speaker, one final clarification for the Senior Minister of State. Based on the figures she cited earlier, the 71,000 being investigated, after we deduct the 43,000 where the claims were rejected prior to payout, and the 1,470 where they were clawed back after payout, does this mean that there were more than 26,000 cases where payout has been made, but clawback has not been achieved, as yet?",1,85,2016-03-01-T-008-S-00085
2016-03-01-T-008,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"I think the Member took the 71,000, minus off the 43,000, minus off 1,500, and that gives a figure of approximately 25,000. These are still under investigation or audit. So, they are in the process of being looked at. I am not able at this stage to say whether they are rejected upfront or whether they are clawed back because they are still being looked at.",1,86,2016-03-01-T-008-S-00086

2016-03-01-T-009,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari,asked	 the Minister for Finance (a) whether there are guidelines given to Ministries or Statutory Boards to ensure (i) clauses in Government tender specifications for service contracts are fair to service providers and (ii) liquidated damages commensurate with the non-delivery of service; (b) whether there are avenues for service providers to flag out unfair or one-sided clauses in tender specifications; (c) whether there is training given to Government procurement officers to ensure fair contracts; and (d) whether an audit can be conducted on Government tender contracts to ensure fair clauses.,1,88,2016-03-01-T-009-S-00088
2016-03-01-T-009,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"Madam, Government agencies are expected to conduct procurements in a fair and reasonable manner. To guide agencies, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) provides templates on the contractual terms and conditions for common types of buys which agencies make. Agencies can choose to use these templates or adapt them accordingly to cater to their specific unique needs. From time to time, these templates are reviewed, taking into account feedback that we receive and any appropriate industrial norms. For example, following industry feedback, our IT procurement contract terms were amended so that when the original equipment manufacturer's vendor defaults, the replacement vendor is compensated at prevailing fair market value instead of having to accept the previous vendor's rates.",1,89,2016-03-01-T-009-S-00089
2016-03-01-T-009,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"We have clear guidelines to agencies that liquidated damages should not exceed actual damages/losses suffered in the event of a breach. There are also contracts which do not impose liquidated damages. Whatever the case, Government agencies are advised to work closely with their contractors to resolve issues early. As far as possible, agencies and contractors are not to let problems escalate to the point where contractual non-fulfilment is reached.",2,90,2016-03-01-T-009-S-00090
2016-03-01-T-009,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"There are training modules that guide officers on how to write the tender specifications or the scope of work expected of the tenderer. However, it is not possible for training to cover every scenario on what is fair or unfair, or every type of purchase that Government agencies make. The Government buys a wide variety of goods and services, and each industry has differing practices and norms. What is considered the norm and reasonable in one industry may not be so in another. For example, in the creative design industry, the industry norm allows up to three rounds of consolidated changes after the design concept has been signed off. But this does not apply to architecture design of buildings. Given the differences across industries and situation in which a procurement is made, any audit on whether the tender specifications are fair would have to take into account the context and the circumstances when the particular procurement is called.",3,91,2016-03-01-T-009-S-00091

What one would have to rely on are the general principles of contracts. There is obviously bargaining power; that is one of the things that you take into account. But when a contract is particularly unfair and crosses a particular line, then, in some cases, in the Courts, the Courts will strike it down. We do have the Unfair Contract Terms Act. If it contravenes the Unfair Contract Terms Act, then, obviously, certain things will not be enforced. That is a matter of general law and that has developed over time.

Generally, 80 hours are allocated for CCE lessons at the pre-University levels across two to three years of which 40 hours are for CCE lessons and 40 hours are for school-designed CCE. It is not what just you learn from the textbooks, it is also about applying it in the school environment, whether it is cleaning and respecting teachers and so on.

If values and character-based development are so important in one's education, can MOE then take these into account in crucial milestone decisions, such as entry into schools of choice of the students, or especially for the high-stake examinations, or in decisions such as the awarding of scholarships, and also entry into Institutions of Higher Learning (IHLs)? Is there any way by which MOE can strengthen the alignment between the importance of this aspect of education with all the other crucial decisions in our education system?",1,137,2016-03-01-T-011-S-00137

One example is schools have been giving out school awards for good character. Some of these awards are familiar to many Members in this House. They range from individual awards at the class level, at the school level with badges or certificates given, and even group awards, such as the ""Most Responsible Class"".",2,139,2016-03-01-T-011-S-00139

If you talk to the IHL principals and faculty members, over the last four years, they do take note of students. Everything being equal, they will look at the students who have been given those kind of awards, like the ECHA, because it would mean that this is a socially responsible Singaporean who would be able to contribute to the school and the society in the future.",3,140,2016-03-01-T-011-S-00140

If the number of molestation cases worsens or shows a worsening trend, would the Government consider experimenting with women-only carriages, which I think is a scheme that has met with some success in other countries?",1,170,2016-03-01-T-013-S-00170
2016-03-01-T-013,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"There are currently no plans to have women-only carriages. I do not think we have reached that stage.

2016-03-01-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked	 the Minister for Health (a) what are the current projections in the rate of change in doctor-to-population and nurse-to-population ratios over the next five years; (b) what targets are in place to improve the doctor-to-population and nurse-to-population ratios over the next five years; (c) how does the Ministry intend to meet these targets; and (d) what are the fallback options should the Ministry be unable to meet these targets.,1,173,2016-03-01-T-014-S-00173
2016-03-01-T-014,Chee Hong Tat,The Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Health),"Mdm Speaker, at the last Parliament Sitting in January, I informed Mr Leon Perera that Singapore's doctor-to-population ratio in 2014 was 21 doctors per 10,000 population, compared to 18 in Hong Kong and Taiwan. For nurses, we have 69 nurses per 10,000 population compared to 66 in Hong Kong and 60 in Taiwan. I also explained that these ratios could only offer a broad comparison and we need to be mindful about differences in healthcare demand, clinical practices and operating environments. A higher staffing ratio does not necessarily equate better quality healthcare or better health outcomes.",1,174,2016-03-01-T-014-S-00174
2016-03-01-T-014,Chee Hong Tat,The Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Health),"MOH has been expanding the capacity of our healthcare and aged care services in Singapore under the Healthcare 2020 Masterplan. We are on track to growing the healthcare workforce by 20,000 between 2011 and 2020. So, our staffing ratios will go up. In addition, the Government has introduced policy measures like Pioneer Generation Package and MediShield Life to improve healthcare affordability and give Singaporeans greater peace of mind.",2,175,2016-03-01-T-014-S-00175
2016-03-01-T-014,Chee Hong Tat,The Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Health),"Looking beyond 2020, Singapore will face an increase in projected healthcare demand and also a smaller local workforce due to our ageing population. To keep our healthcare system sustainable, we must step up efforts to help Singaporeans to stay healthy and enable our seniors to age well. MOH is also working in close collaboration with healthcare institutions, unions and community partners to develop new care models and improve productivity, so that we can continue to provide high quality of care for Singaporeans and a good working environment for our healthcare workers. We are adopting this tripartite partnership approach to attract and train more Singaporeans to join the healthcare sector, improve productivity in our healthcare institutions and enable our healthcare workers to continue working till a later age.",3,176,2016-03-01-T-014-S-00176
2016-03-01-T-014,Chee Hong Tat,The Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Health),"As I explained at the last Sitting, another important area is for all of us to show appreciation and support for our healthcare workers. This will go a long way to motivate our healthcare workers to continue putting in their best efforts to serve with care and commitment.",4,177,2016-03-01-T-014-S-00177
2016-03-01-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Madam, I thank the Minister of State for his helpful reply. I have a few supplementary questions. In regard to the assurance from the Minister of State that our staffing numbers will improve in future, which is a welcomed assurance, my question would be  does he feel that the doctor-to-population and nurse-to-population ratios right now are not really where they should be? And if so, what are the mitigation measures that the Ministry is considering to deal with that current situation? That is the first question.",1,178,2016-03-01-T-014-S-00178
2016-03-01-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The second question is  would the Ministry consider evaluating the feasibility to set a target for doctor-to-population and nurse-to-population ratios? The reason I ask that question is because I think that, looking at where Singapore stands versus other OECD countries, we are quite close to Hong Kong and Taiwan. But there is a considerable body of expert opinion that there is a doctor and nurse shortage in Hong Kong and Taiwan. There are various reports, for example, the Brookings Institution, Taiwan National Institute of Health, Hong Kong University, Hong Kong Hospital Authority and so on, which have acknowledged that there is a situation of doctor and nurse shortage in those countries. So, it concerns me that we are closer to those countries on the OECD spectrum. Would the Ministry consider setting a target or an ideal zone that we want to move towards in future?",2,179,2016-03-01-T-014-S-00179
2016-03-01-T-014,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Mdm Speaker, the assurance that I have given earlier about the staffing ratios going up is not a new assurance. This is something that the Ministry of Health (MOH) had previously already provided. The figures are in the public domain. We will be increasing the number of healthcare workers between 2011 and 2020. This is not something that is because of what is happening now and, therefore, we are hiring more workers. It is in recognition that our population is ageing and we expect healthcare demand to go up. So, we are building more hospitals and hiring more healthcare workers not only to take care of the current situation but in preparation for what is going to come in the future.",1,180,2016-03-01-T-014-S-00180
2016-03-01-T-014,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"This is something which the Government does in all areas, not just in healthcare. We always plan ahead, we always anticipate, we build ahead of demand and we deal with the situation before the problem emerges. This is something which we will continue to do.",2,181,2016-03-01-T-014-S-00181
2016-03-01-T-014,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"It is important for us to look beyond the numbers and I need to re-emphasise this point to Mr Perera, that we should not be overly fixated on one particular number, the staffing ratio, because it only represents one dimension of quality healthcare.",3,182,2016-03-01-T-014-S-00182
2016-03-01-T-014,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Perera mentioned that some of the OECD countries have higher ratios than Singapore. But if you also check their health outcomes, they do not necessarily have better health outcomes than Singapore. So, if we look at the issue from only a single dimension, we may end up with the wrong conclusions. Higher staffing ratios do not necessarily mean better health outcomes.",4,183,2016-03-01-T-014-S-00183
2016-03-01-T-014,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"It is important for us to bear in mind that there are many different aspects of what constitute good health outcomes  the efforts to encourage Singaporeans to stay healthy, how we run our healthcare institutions, improving productivity, how we review our processes and how we transform our care model.",5,184,2016-03-01-T-014-S-00184
2016-03-01-T-014,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"I thank the Minister of State for his answers. One thing that many patients and, indeed, many of my residents tell me is that the care relationship in healthcare is very much local  local language, local culture, understanding local nuances for local medical practice. Would the Minister of State be able to share what measures MOH is looking at to help maintain a strong Singaporean Core in our healthcare system?",1,185,2016-03-01-T-014-S-00185
2016-03-01-T-014,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Mdm Speaker, I thank Dr Tan for his question.

We do this in a number of ways.",1,186,2016-03-01-T-014-S-00186
2016-03-01-T-014,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"First, it is to make sure that we have a good working environment for our healthcare workers, and this includes not just our younger workers but also our older workers. So, part of the effort that we have been working on and we will continue to do, is to work closely with the hospitals, the healthcare institutions and also our unions to look at how we can improve the work environment to allow our healthcare workers to work till a later age.",2,187,2016-03-01-T-014-S-00187
2016-03-01-T-014,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"We are also looking at supporting mid-career professionals who are interested to become healthcare workers.

And upon completing their training, they will receive a career transition bonus.",3,188,2016-03-01-T-014-S-00188
2016-03-01-T-014,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"We are also looking at how we can increase the pool of healthcare workers by bringing back Singaporeans who are studying overseas.

2016-03-01-T-014,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"Madam, I am happy to note that the Minister of State has said that MOH, and even the whole of Government, is always building ahead to prepare for demand. Perhaps the Minister of State would like to give us some examples as to how MOH has been building ahead in terms of hospitals, in terms of step-down care facilities, in terms of healthcare workers, so that residents or patients can be better served. Would he give us some examples or some statistics to prove what he said, that MOH is always building ahead of demand?",1,191,2016-03-01-T-014-S-00191
2016-03-01-T-014,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Mdm Speaker, if Mr Low is interested to know more about the statistics, I am happy to provide these statistics to him. But just to assure Mr Low, we do look at the future demand. As I had said, the ageing population is one of these trends that we need to prepare for. We are building more hospitals. Recently, we opened Ng Teng Fong Hospital in the west; in the north, we added Yishun Community Hospital; and there will be new hospitals coming up subsequently in Sengkang and in Woodlands.",1,192,2016-03-01-T-014-S-00192
2016-03-01-T-014,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"So, we do plan ahead and build ahead, and there are definitely areas which we will continue to work not just from within Government but in close partnership with the community.

It is good to know all that is being done to increase the local core of the healthcare system here. I have a question, and that is to ask whether MOH would consider working with MOE perhaps, to allow for more discretionary admission into tertiary programmes, like nursing programmes, for example, and explore possibilities for more bursaries, more scholarships, to entice and enhance more Singaporean students to take up nursing in these institutions as a career and also to develop a career path for such students.

Last year, NEA issued more than 26,000 tickets to littering offenders, 32% more than previous years and the highest in six years. We have also taken a tougher stance towards littering by imposing stiffer penalties for recalcitrant offenders. In addition, we are expending significant resources to keep public areas clean – as much as $120 million each year is spent on cleaning public areas with some hotspots cleaned every two hours.",5,228,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00228

Indeed, it is not even related to the number of waste bins we provide for the convenience of the public. Members who have been to Japan would agree that the level of public cleanliness there is much higher than Singapore. The public areas in Japan are cleaner not because there is a large army of cleaners, but because of the Japanese people's habits and social norms. Indeed, in many public places, bins are scarce in Japan. This is something that we can strive to emulate, by creating a culture of community ownership so that everyone takes responsibility in maintaining high standards of public cleanliness and hygiene and treat public places like their own homes.",6,229,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00229

As part of the Keep Singapore Clean movement, the Public Hygiene Council partnered residents, schools, businesses and community groups to turn our community spaces into ""Bright Spots"". These are essentially shared spaces adopted by stakeholders who take ownership of the area's cleanliness and hygiene conditions and lead by example to promote good social norms. Since the launch of NEA's Community Volunteer (CV) programme in 2013, NEA's CV programme has been successful in attracting more than 340 passionate individuals from various non-Government organisations to step forward as CVs to help us educate others about public cleanliness and nudge those observed littering to bin their litter instead.

Last year, my Ministry announced during the Committee of Supply debate that we will expand the CV programme so as to allow members of the public to take greater ownership of the environment. Specifically, we will allow individuals to join the expanded CV programme without having to be affiliated to a recognised environmental group and empower them to engage offenders for a wider range of offences beyond littering. This will broaden the pool who can be tapped on to join the programme. In addition, we will allow CVs to have the option of participating in advocacy, outreach and educational activities. Through the expanded CV programme, we hope to see more CVs taking ownership of the cleanliness and hygiene conditions of existing Bright Spots numbering more than 520 and lead by example to promote good social norms.",8,231,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00231

Undoubtedly, without volunteers, many projects and plans would not be able to achieve the desired results. The volunteers are a unique group of people who are always on the ground, doing their part for the community without much fanfare. Most importantly, they are a positive influence on the people around them to volunteer for the good of the community.",1,240,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00240
2016-03-01-T-018,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"I am delighted to note that the amendment to the existing NEA Act is looking towards expanding the Community Volunteer scheme. This has been a good scheme to encourage responsibility and ownership for the environment. However, under the existing scheme, only members of selected environmental-related societies or councils could be appointed as Community Volunteers (CVs). To my understanding, the number of these groups currently stands at four. In Singapore, we have at least 44 registered environmental-related NGOs. Singaporeans are a more civic-minded lot and I believe there is a lot of potential in the CV scheme. Certainly, I pledge my full support to expand the CV scheme so that individuals too can be appointed as CVs.",2,241,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00241

I am glad that every month there are about 100 to 200 residents, students, nurses from Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Lions members, as well as residents beyond Nee Soon South, those who care about environment, come and join us.

These are just a few memorable ones out of the many national and localised campaigns held in countries across the global map. In Singapore, we have our very own Keep Singapore Clean campaign.

Education, coupled with efficient and effective enforcement, is the way forward. That is why I am very happy to hear the Education Minister announce last week that school students will do the daily cleaning and it will be implemented in all schools by the end of 2016. Certainly, this is a very good start. I hope that, eventually, it will be progressed, like what is happening in Japan and Taiwan, where every student not just clean their own classroom, they clean the school compound, they wash the toilets, they sort out the litter and they do not have cleaners in the schools.",6,245,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00245

This is consistent with a survey by NEA in 2010 which found that one third of Singaporeans would litter, if they thought they could get away with it.",2,276,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00276

I am sure we have seen a fair share of neighbour disputes in our own constituencies involving alleged mosquito breeding, potted plants, cooking smell, cat feeding and so on.

The potential for such community conflicts to escalate beyond control in this instance cannot be ruled out. This Bill will create confusion by adding another layer of enforcement action undertaken by appointed volunteer auxiliary officers, who are not deemed as agents of the agency in addition to the mandated duties executed by officers of NEA, Town Council and so on.

Is NEA losing the battle with litterbugs and dengue? If it is about manpower, will the agency consider hiring retirees and part-timers on contract basis to assist? I do understand that for some policies to be effective, education and enforcement must go hand in hand.

Only in 1% of the time did the volunteers have to act like pseudo police officers.

Where and when will volunteer auxiliary officers stop their policing of the community? Today is littering in the neighbourhood; tomorrow is proper recycling in the blue bins downstairs; the day after tomorrow is kids playing football in the void deck; and the next day, what neighbours do in their corridors, even inside their own homes, in the name of dengue eradication.

It has worked well. There is no evidence that we are experiencing a littering or spitting or illegal smoking emergency. In a 2009 Sociological Study on littering, commissioned by NEA, which I participated in as one of the three sociologists overseeing the study, the study shows only 1.2% of people surveyed admitted to littering most of the time; 62.6% reported that they never littered and the rest said they littered sometimes and know that it is wrong to do so. The overwhelming majority of litterers just need reminding on the social norms.

These figures I believe are the tip of the iceberg and there are clearly more people who have littered but did not get caught. Again, increased enforcement might help in nabbing more offenders but we need to fundamentally understand why they are littering and make sure we address the root of the problem. We need to remember, as reported by Channel NewsAsia recently, that the survey by NEA in 2010 showed that a third of Singaporeans would litter if they think they can get away with it.

So, the researchers decided to focus their efforts on reducing this problem. They realised that large-scale events on anti-littering are not as effective as small community efforts targeted at hotspots of littering. The population at those large-scale events might not necessarily include that target group of people utilising the bus stops. The engendering message is better received by putting in more effort on-site. By using attention-grabbing posters, they were able to counter people's lack of sensitivity to the generic ""do not litter"" signs.

2016-03-01-T-018,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Another example of successful anti-littering campaign that Er Dr Lee Bee Wah mentioned earlier is the ""Don't Mess with Texas – Real Texas Don't Litter"" campaign in the USA. In 1987, $2 million in tax revenue went to litter-picking and that cost was escalating 15-20% every year. After performing extensive research, they identified who the heavy litterers were. They are a pick-up driver, male, between 18 and 34 years old, who likes sports and country music, has an anti-authority disposition and is not motivated by appeals to civic duty. They were indifferent to the typical messaging about the environment and the cost of cleaning. So, Texas decided to focus on these heavy litterers by appealing to their macho-ness. They realised they could succeed by associating littering with as being unmanly. Resources were pumped into getting popular country singers and athletes to do TV, radio advertisements and highway billboards to influence these litterers. As a result, Texas was able to cut their litter on their highway by 72% in the first six years of their campaign. In terms of spending, they saved a total of US$4.13 million by 1997.",9,323,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00323

2016-03-01-T-018,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Madam, I strongly believe that our vision of a clean city is possible but we need to focus not just on enforcement but do extensive research and run creative projects at the community level to ensure that people play an active role in this vision and people have a sense of ownership of our living space.",13,327,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00327
2016-03-01-T-018,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Madam, let me also add that, as someone who has worked in the NGO sector for the past 15 years, this empowerment of volunteers is something that would be welcomed, especially by the animal welfare groups. In fact, it is something that they are calling for and have called for the past few years. This call is also for the community to play a part rather than the Government do everything. This Bill is a positive step forward and, Madam, I support the Bill.",14,328,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00328

Some are not in total support of the Bill. Allow me to respond to the points raised by them and for those that I cannot, I will do it during the clarification time.",1,330,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00330
2016-03-01-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,I would like to thank Mr Gan and Mr Png for asking whether the Community Volunteer (CV) programme is meant to save NEA's resources. It is not. The expanded CV programme is to allow more members of the public to participate and take greater ownership in the care of the environment. It is not to supplement NEA's enforcement headcount. It would not help NEA save resources.,2,331,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00331
2016-03-01-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As I have mentioned just now, the primary role of the CV is to educate environmental offenders so that they are responsible for binning their trash. That would be our primary goal where littering is concerned. We want to help them perform this role effectively and therefore we need to train our CVs; we need to give them certain powers so that they can perform their duties as volunteers as effectively as possible. Today, CVs do have to provide NEA with the details of offenders for enforcement.",3,332,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00332
2016-03-01-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The experience of our volunteers under the existing CV programme found that the majority of litterbugs will comply when approached to pick up their litter without any need for further enforcement action. So, it is already working. Indeed, when we need to enforce, the numbers are very small. Such engagement and education have been effective so far and we will carry on this mode of deployment.",4,333,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00333
2016-03-01-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The amended Bill will allow the CV programme to be expanded to allow individuals to join the programme, not just organisations. For a start, what we want to do is to scope it to make sure that when we get newly recruited CVs, we will get them to adopt Bright Spots and then work with the local community to adopt and clean and improve the cleanliness and hygiene of the area through advocacy, outreach and educational activities. That is how they would start; it is not about teaching them to enforce, getting them to enforce, getting them to issue summons and so forth.",5,334,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00334
2016-03-01-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As the CVs mature in their volunteering journey, the more experienced ones may even organise their own environmental activities and include enforcement patrols beyond Bright Spots, but this will take time.",6,335,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00335
2016-03-01-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah also mentioned the idea of empowering civilians with enforcement powers. This is certainly not unique to Singapore; it has been done in many countries. Indeed, in Singapore, Mr Pritam would also know that we have volunteer Police with enforcement powers. So far, they have carried out their duties very well; they are as good as our policemen; they are dressed like our policemen; they carry out police duties; they do not abuse their powers. Why is that so? Because, to the volunteers, it is important for them to uphold their duties, also as Singaporeans, in the intent of the act of the law.",7,336,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00336
2016-03-01-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"But, unlike the Police Community Support Officers in the UK cited by Er Dr Lee, our CVs are not paid. I know the new version of Police Community Support Officers will also not be paid and that is a great change in the way they are doing things. Our CVs, so far, are those who are passionate about the environment and are willing to step forward to take ownership of the environment. So, volunteering must come from the heart.",8,337,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00337
2016-03-01-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I agree though with the Members that good volunteers do not come on their own; we need to manage them, we need to affirm their contribution to the cause. Therefore, training and monitoring will all be part of what we do with the volunteers. It is not just giving them a badge, giving them the powers to do whatever they want and then they start issuing tickets to their neighbours and friends. That is just an imagination of what could go wrong, but I do not believe Singaporeans would do that kind of thing.",9,338,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00338
2016-03-01-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We will make a lot of efforts to recognise our CVs. We will show them up in our media, feature them, the good things that they have been doing, For example, in the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint 2015, we have been highlighting the contributions of our CVs. But we must explore more ways to make sure that their work is affirmed, valued and recognised by our community.",10,339,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00339
2016-03-01-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Er Dr Lee and Mr Gan also mentioned that there should be stringent screening criteria. Indeed, we will do that. We must ensure that we choose suitable individuals who have the right public spirit, good communication skills, as Assoc Prof Daniel Goh has mentioned, to ensure that the work they do is not the same work that our enforcement officers do, just to enforce. They must be able to engage, to communicate and ensure that at the end of the day, they do this because together they can ensure everyone love the environment deeply.",11,340,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00340
2016-03-01-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Prior to joining the CV programme, we will properly screen and interview each individual to assess his interest and maturity towards environmental activities. We will monitor what they do; if they have the propensity to issue summons almost every hour, certainly this is not the right kind of person that we should be deploying. In addition, all CVs must be Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents and at least 18 years old.",12,341,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00341
2016-03-01-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Er Dr Lee and Mr Gan have also mentioned about equipping body-worn cameras to protect our CVs. NEA has been progressively equipping our officers with body-worn cameras since 2015. These have helped to prevent abuse by offenders, protect our officers from allegations of unprofessional conduct, as well as remind our officers to abide by our operational protocol.",13,342,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00342
2016-03-01-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Let me mention again that the main role of the CV is to educate offenders, and the feedback received from our current CVs reflect that majority of the offenders are indeed cooperative; they are our fellow Singaporeans and not criminals. They may have done something wrong, maybe in a momentary lapse of judgement, they may have littered. When someone, a fellow citizen, comes and tells them, ""please bin the litter"", majority of them will pick it up and do exactly what they have been told.",14,343,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00343
2016-03-01-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Notwithstanding this, our CVs will be considered as public servants for the purposes of the Penal Code and exercising the power of enforcement and will be protected under the Protection from Harassment Act from any indecent, threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour or words when they are executing their duties, as I mentioned just now.",15,344,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00344

I agree that the cleaning profession is tough and our cleaners face an uphill task in cleaning after us every day. We must have that respect for our cleaners and inculcate a sense of responsibility towards the environment and we, indeed, must begin this from young.",16,345,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00345

We are working with MOE to ensure that by end-2016, daily cleaning by students would be introduced in all our schools, from primary schools to junior colleges. This is one of the things that we are doing in addition to enlarging the space for people to volunteer and encourage people to keep the environment clean because it is their environment and it is their space.",17,346,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00346
2016-03-01-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mdm Speaker, Mr Pritam has asked some questions which I will try to respond to now. What criteria will new organisations need to fulfil? This Act is not about organisations anymore; it is about individuals. We will enrol individuals who want to participate in this scheme. We will interview and screen them and deploy them in groups at Bright Spots so that they can own the space and it may not be where they live. If there are places where we do not have enough volunteers, we will deploy them there, initially paired together with NEA officers to teach them the ropes and over time make their presence felt by the public, so that they too, are a familiar face amongst the community living there and not just a mere face of enforcement out there to make good or issue tickets to people who have committed offences.",18,347,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00347
2016-03-01-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Indeed, volunteers, if not managed, may abuse their powers, if not trained, if not supervised, may commit such offences.

2016-03-01-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Can these powers be conferred to the CEO of NEA? I say yes.

Then, we will divulge every incident that may be in question and be accountable for the act that we have done.",20,349,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00349

If I heard him correctly, the Minister was suggesting that the scheme is really an expansion of the existing volunteer scheme and, therefore, the volunteers that come on-board will essentially be pursuing the same approach which they have done for the past three years, which is educative and to compel people to essentially stop doing what they are doing and, in the vast majority of cases, they will not be summoning. If that is the case, is it necessary to have the Act allow volunteers to be extended enforcement powers?",1,353,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00353

They tell us that, apart from just being volunteers being deployed, being good citizens, it will be useful, in fact, it would be effective, if they do have those powers.

2016-03-01-T-018,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Just to follow up with the Minister. So, in the case of summoning, for example, potential law breakers, would there be an NEA officer accompanying the volunteer?

When we deploy the volunteers, especially when they are new, we will deploy them in groups, in bright spots, not everywhere, not anywhere, not anytime, to make sure they are focusing on a particular area that they are trying to own and be part of it. Over time, after being observed and observing the NEA officers, on assessment of the supervisors, people who are experienced, who assess that, yes, this group of people can be left on their own, over time, we will let them do it on their own.",1,357,2016-03-01-T-018-S-00357

This particular flexibility in which any or all of the powers can be given to any individual volunteer means that there is incredible flexibility on the part of the Chief Executive without clear criteria, without a clear regime, on what kind of powers can be accorded to an individual and on what circumstances?

2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"On 25 January 2016, a Police report was made. An 11-year-old girl said that she had been molested. Amongst other things, Police retrieved the relevant CCTV footages. A boy in school uniform was identified as the suspect. The boy was later identified as Benjamin Lim. He lived in Yishun. On that day, 25 January 2016, while he was coming home from school, it appears that he made a detour. He went to another block in the neighbourhood, before going home. He seemed to have followed the 11-year-old girl. The two appear not to have met before. He went into a lift at her block, at the ground floor. He followed her in.

Five officers went  three from the Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC) and two from Division.

There were other officers at their respective workstations. Benjamin was not handcuffed at any time. He requested to be given some time to collect his thoughts about the incident. His written statement was taken at a quarter past 12, after he said he was ready.",2,405,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00405
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Benjamin was cooperative throughout. He was offered food and drinks after the interview and he declined that. After the interview, he was placed in a Temporary Holding Room which was secured. This was pending his mother taking him back. He was alone in that room. Police then recorded a statement from the mother who was at the station.",3,406,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00406
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Benjamin was then released on bail. He left the Police station with his mother and sister. Time spent by Benjamin in the Police station was about three and a half hours which included the time Police spent taking a statement from the mother. That was the last contact between the Police and Benjamin.,4,407,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00407
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"What happened after Benjamin and his mother left the Police station? Based on investigations, the following is what we know. They went home. Benjamin had lunch. He played games on his phone. Sometime later, his mother told Benjamin that he would not be going to the school camp that was to start the next day. That was after a telephone conversation between the mother and a school counsellor. The Minister of Education will provide more details on that conversation. At about 4.20 pm, Benjamin was found dead at the foot of his block. These are the facts.",5,408,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00408
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Now, let us ask a question  if Benjamin had not taken his own life, what would have happened in this case? Let me give Members some statistics, which will show what usually happens.",6,409,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00409
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Over the last five years, from 2011 to 2015, a total of 7,196 young persons have assisted Police in investigations. Of these, 70%, that is, seven out of 10 were either warned or placed in a Guidance Programme or had no further action taken against them. About 15% were charged. Another 15% of the cases are under consideration.",7,410,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00410
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Charges are usually only brought against young persons when there are aggravating factors, such as when the offence is of a serious nature like rioting, or if the young person is a repeat offender, or has breached the terms of a conditional warning, for example, by failing to complete the necessary Guidance Programme.",8,411,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00411
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As the statistics show, the Police's approach to young persons is, wherever possible, to try and avoid criminalising the conduct. It is better to give young people a second chance and help in their rehabilitation. It is likely that on the evidence available to us, Benjamin would have received no more than a warning. He is unlikely to have been charged in Court. Police would have taken into account his age, the fact that this is the first time and while all molests are taken seriously, the nature of the specific molest in any case has to be considered.",9,412,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00412
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The nature of the alleged molest in this particular case can be characterised as being less serious in a range. That is based on CCTV footages. I would, however, caution that the statistics I have given and the relatively tolerant approach that the Police take towards young persons should not be seen as a licence for young persons to commit offences on the basis that seven out of 10 will not be charged.",10,413,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00413
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Let me now deal with the second of my four points. The Police Protocol for dealing with young persons. Police adopt an expedited process for young persons  to interview them and release them as quickly as possible to their parents. In this case, Benjamin was released to his mother within four hours of being brought to the station. Where suitable, a young person will be placed on a programme to help him. An example is the Guidance Programme. The focus is on diversionary supervision and counselling. Young persons will usually be students. The Police guidelines are for the school to be kept updated on the progress of the case. That will allow the school to monitor and support the student.",11,414,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00414
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Do we need to amend the Protocol for interviewing young persons? I have asked my Ministry to review the Protocol. One suggestion that has been made is to video-record interviews of all minors. We have announced last year that we are studying the matter of video recording. We will make further announcements when we have worked through the legal and other issues.,12,415,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00415
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Another suggestion that has been made is that we extend the Appropriate Adult Scheme to all young persons being interviewed. We have the Appropriate Adult Scheme to provide assistance to suspects who have mental and intellectual disabilities. The role of the Appropriate Adult is to assist these persons to communicate more effectively with the Police. Police have said in their statement of 1 February that they will consider this point during the review.,13,416,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00416
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Association of Criminal Lawyers of Singapore (ACLS) has contacted us and offered to give us their views. We will engage them and get their views. But I will caution against rushing to conclusions at this stage. If there is something we can do better, we will do so. In the review, the following three broad points will be taken into account, in addition to other factors. Those three points are  one, what happened in this case; two, the types of young persons who get picked up; and three, how can we reduce systemic risk.",14,417,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00417
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Let me deal with the three points. First, the experience in this case. Are there any specific indications in this case that the processes need to be changed? I have set out the facts that we know, facts which we believe are accurate. There is nothing so far on the evidence to suggest that Benjamin was mistreated by the Police. I have set out how the investigation was done. At this stage, we cannot say that the interview was the specific reason for the suicide. Suicide often involves a very complex set of factors. One has to look at the facts carefully, consult experts to try and get an assessment as to what happened.",15,418,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00418
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Police will also consult psychologists and other relevant experts. Some people have asked  why did we need to take him out of the school? Could we not have waited until Benjamin got home?,16,419,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00419
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mdm Speaker, we need to be clear about how we expect Police to investigate cases in general. Let me explain. When Police went to the school, they did not know who he was or his history. An accused person unknown to the Police could well have engaged in other molest, and until then, maybe no one had reported. If the Police wait, and he molests someone else in the meantime, then the question would be  why did the Police not move in faster?",17,420,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00420
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"When an incident happens, as a general rule, I am sure we want the Police to move in quickly. Every year, we pick up more than 1,300 young persons – students and also others. What do Members think the public's attitudes will be if it was the victim of the molest who had committed suicide? Police would be expected to have moved quickly. This will become clearer when I deal with my next point  the types of young persons we pick up.",18,421,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00421
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Young people get picked up for a wide range of offences, from rioting, sexual assault, physical assault to even murder. Some, obviously, involved in very serious offences. Police need to move quickly, arrest, investigate, before the others, including other gang members, destroy evidence.",19,422,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00422
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Should we make distinctions based on the types of offences involved? What about gang riots? What about deliberate arson or Unlicensed Money Lending cases? What about those which are more security related; say, a 14-year-old, who was radicalised and wants to go out and kill?",20,423,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00423
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Internal Security Department (ISD) has interviewed some in that age group. And to prove the point, two weeks ago, we stopped a 15-year-old radicalised boy from Indonesia. He had wanted to go and fight in the Middle East. So, let us take this seriously.",21,424,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00424
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Let me now turn to the third point. We must reduce systemic risk where possible. We cannot assume that all Police officers will always follow protocols. There will be some who will be tempted to take shortcuts. We have to ensure that we have a system that minimises the risks. I say minimise, because there is no system in the world that I know of which eliminates the risks completely. This factor of needing to minimise the risk will be taken into account when we review the Protocol.",22,425,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00425
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In this context, Police will look at past experience, the thousands of young persons who have been investigated. Members can see that there are many aspects to this issue, many questions which need to be carefully considered. The current Protocol had considered these, but we will review again. This is not a situation where we should have knee-jerk reactions or come to hasty conclusions. Any of our children could have been in Benjamin's position and any of our daughters could have been in that 11-year-old girl's position. We will approach the review of the processes with that perspective.",23,426,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00426
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mdm Speaker, let me add another point. My Ministry has the responsibility for the Protocol that is in place. And ultimately, responsibility is with me, as the Minister. It is not with individual Police officers. Their responsibility is to act according to the Protocol in place. In this case, on the facts that have been given to me, I believe that they have carried out their duties faithfully and properly in accordance with the rules and the Protocols. If there are questions about the Protocols, I will answer, as I am doing now. If there are issues with the Protocol, the responsibility is mine. Let us not attack the Police officers who cannot defend themselves. They are doing their job every day in difficult circumstances.",24,427,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00427
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Madam, now let me turn to the deliberate falsehoods that have been put out to tar the Police unfairly. This is the third of my four major points.",25,428,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00428
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"There have been a number of inaccurate statements that have been put out. We say ""inaccurate"", based on the facts the Police have. Some of the inaccurate statements are as follows  (a) that the Police were not in plain clothes when they went to the school to identify Benjamin, effectively alleging that the Police were lying to Singaporeans when they put out their statement of 1 February; (b) allegations that Benjamin was interviewed and intimidated by five Police officers; (c) that he must have been coerced to make an admission to an offence that he did not commit; and (d) some have even suggested that the girl might not have been molested and might have made a false Police report.",26,429,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00429
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"A number of these falsehoods have been put out by The Online Citizen (TOC). It has gone on a planned, orchestrated campaign, using falsehoods and has published about 20 articles or so, as part of its campaign. One example of the falsehoods, as I had said earlier, Police have said on 1 February that they went down in plain clothes, yet TOC published an article on 5 February saying that Police wore attire stating the word ""Police"". The suggestion is that the Police were lying to Singaporeans.",27,430,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00430
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"They supposedly relied on a posting by a lady, Mary Anne Pereira. She had stated that her son saw Police officers in Polo T-shirts with the word ""Police"". Police checked with Ms Pereira. She says she had gotten it wrong. She got her dates mixed up. She is wrong because the Police went to the school in plain clothes on 26 January. She has taken down her post.",28,431,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00431
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"People make many statements online. They can be mistaken. That is why there is a Court process to establish the truth. The overall narrative and impression conveyed by the various TOC articles are  (a) Police were lying; (b) Police intimidated the boy; and (c) Police put pressure on him to confess to a crime that he did not commit, allegations, implications which are false, practically leading people to conclude that Benjamin committed suicide as a result.",29,432,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00432

But we should not allow deliberate, dishonest attacks. I have asked my Ministry to study how the Police and other institutions can respond in future to such falsehoods.",1,435,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00435
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Others have also commented on this matter. Many of them are honest, reasonable people, who have genuine questions. But as I read the commentaries, it seems that many based themselves on a misperception of the facts which I had referred to earlier. That brings me to my fourth major point  why has my Ministry not commented substantially, particularly to correct these inaccuracies, until now?",2,436,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00436
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mdm Speaker, I told my Ministry, earlier on, that we should refrain from commenting too much, or in detail, on this matter. I decided that for two reasons  (a) out respect for the family, to give them some space and time to grieve; and (b) there will be a Coroner's Inquiry (CI). That is the right forum for the relevant facts to be dealt with. I think Members will know when I keep quiet, usually there is a good reason; a good legal reason.",3,437,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00437
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Let me touch on both reasons. A family has lost a 14-year-old boy. They issued a statement, an open letter, signed by Benjamin's father. That statement contradicted some of the things Police had said on 1 February and made some additional points which the Police disagreed with. The family also suggested that Benjamin had been coerced into admitting to the molest. The Police could have immediately rebutted the family's statement. The Police could have set out their version, like what I have set out today. The Police could have released the CCTV footages, which would show, quite objectively, what happened inside the lift. They could have referred to the open plan office; they could have referred to him making a detour from school to home and going into the lift with the girl. They could have shown that he went up; the incident took place; he then got out and ran back down.",4,438,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00438
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But is that the right thing to do? To have a public trial by media, at this stage; rebut the family in public and add to the family's grief? The answer, in good sense, is clearly no. We can understand that the family, in their grief, may genuinely believe some things, and, perhaps, even assert them in public. But we chose not to respond. These matters can be dealt with at the Coroner's Inquiry. And even at this stage, I have decided that we should not release the CCTV footages of what happened in the lift, out of respect for Benjamin's memory and to help the young girl as well.",5,439,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00439
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Police have also continued to engage the family. When Police spoke with Benjamin's family last week, his father told us that the family felt pressured by the public and media attention. Photographers and reporters have been loitering around their house. He asked for privacy and explained that he would like his family to be kept out of the spotlight. He asked that we inform the media of this and tell the media that the family did not want their identity, names, pictures published. The family even asked for the entire Coroner's Inquiry proceedings to be held in private.",6,440,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00440
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Attorney General's Chamber (AGC) will give their request careful consideration. Ultimately, it will be up to the Court to decide. Yesterday, the father spoke with a Police officer. He repeated those requests. Now, let me deal with the second reason why we did not comment in detail, until today.",7,441,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00441
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The CI will, to the extent possible, try to establish the cause of Benjamin's death and the facts. All Coroner's Inquiries in Singapore are held in public, unless the Court decides that some part of it should be in private. For example in this case, it can be argued that the identity of the 11-year-old girl should not be revealed. She is a young victim who has been deeply traumatised, and it could be argued that the CCTV footage of what happened within the lift should be viewed in private as well, for the sake of Benjamin's memory and for the young girl. Once the Coroner announces his findings, both facts and conclusions, then people can offer their criticisms, viewpoints, comments on what the Police did, what my Ministry did, or did not do. That is the official version of the facts, after people are cross-examined on the stand.",8,442,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00442
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sub judice principles set out what can and cannot be said when a Court hearing or Inquiry is pending. The various pronouncements, suggestions, statements which imply and allege that five officers interviewed him, that the Police pressured and intimidated Benjamin into wrongly admitting to guilt and that these must have been amongst the reasons why he committed suicide; all these allegations possibly infringe the principles of sub judice, apart from being highly improper at this stage, prior to the Coroner's Inquiry. The Coroner decides on the scope of the Inquiry based on the Coroner's Act. Some of these issues may be raised at, or become relevant, at the Inquiry.",9,443,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00443
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Police came out publicly on 1 February – six days after the incident, five days after they went to the school – to say there would be a Coroner's Inquiry once Police investigations into the death were completed. They made it public. And Police said in their statement that all relevant facts would be presented, and where the family would be able to raise all questions that they may have. This is Singapore. There is no such thing as a cover-up. Yet, some, like TOC, continued making accusations, insinuations, speculating on the facts, well after that.",10,444,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00444
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As I have said, it is understandable when the family said some things. But TOC and its ilk should not engage in this, prior to the Coroner's Inquiry. TOC also used some other tactics. They tried to get the Police to comment on allegations relating to this case and further assert that since the Police and the Ministry were not responding, therefore, the Police must be guilty of the various allegations, assertions that have been made. The Police, out of respect for the Coroner's Inquiry process, were right in not responding.",11,445,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00445
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"It is surprising that even a lawyer, Mr Thio Shen Yi, has made some comments which should never have been made. He has said five Police officers spoke to Benjamin. That is false. He has said that five officers took Benjamin to the Police station, that is also false; and that Police should have behaved in a less intimidating way. He seems to make the assertion of intimidation, based on his other statements which are themselves false. His statements practically imply that Benjamin killed himself because of police intimidation.",12,446,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00446
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Thio has a duty to be fair to the Police officers. He need only to have referred to the Police statement of 1 February to know that many of the assertions he is making are untrue. And without knowing anything about Benjamin, his mental make-up, his family background, one cannot reach such conclusions that he was intimidated and that is why he took his life.",13,447,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00447

2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"People sometimes take their lives when they reach a point of hopelessness; they give up on life. What were the possible reasons Benjamin gave up on his life? This may involve having to look at, one, his mental state before the incident – depends on a variety of factors, surrounding circumstances and the time period could stretch some way back, even years. One has to also consider what were the stressors in Benjamin's life before the incident. What led him to engage in this incident? If the behaviour was not normal, what was going on in his mind? Two, you look at the events on the day, including his conduct during the incident and the interview. And, three, the events after the interview, including his various interactions. So, there were many aspects to look at and it would not be accurate at all at this stage to fix on any one particular point and say with certainty that that was the reason why the suicide took place.",15,449,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00449

On early access to counsel, there are reasonable arguments both ways. Our position on early access to counsel has been made clear previously. We had arrived at this position after thoroughly considering the matter and taking into account all the relevant factors. I am prepared to explain again our reasons and thinking behind this position in due course at a more appropriate time. Today, I would like to keep discussions to this case.",16,450,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00450

Assertions which go to the integrity of the Police Force have been repeated several times, including untrue factual assertions, and Members have filed many Parliamentary Questions (PQs). In these circumstances, not everyone will know why the Government has not responded and people may misunderstand if the Government did not respond. Thus, I decided, with some regret, and considerable reservation, and after consulting the AGC, that we will have to set out the facts and discuss the matter.",17,451,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00451
2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Amongst other things, public confidence in the Police Force must be maintained. The law is as follows. The rules of sub judice generally preclude discussions which may prejudice proceedings, but public officials like myself can make statements if they believe it to be necessary in the public interest, even if there is a hearing pending. I have myself commented on some occasions in the past, when a case is pending. When I have done so, I had carefully considered the legal position and kept within the principles of sub judice.",18,452,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00452

2016-03-01-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As we go forward, from time to time, there will be other incidents in the future. The incidents will raise legitimate public queries. We must have a clear proper framework to deal with them, such that when an incident happens, first the facts have to be established. We must avoid jumping to conclusions. We must also avoid attacking institutions and individuals based on those hasty conclusions. We must allow the facts to be established first. This is Singapore. There are proper processes for all facts to come out.",20,454,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00454

There can be a full, open discussion, once the hearings are over. Even prior to the hearings, there can be legitimate discussions on general principles and approaches but it has to be done with some care. We will relook at the law to see how we can try and achieve this better.",21,455,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00455

I think Members will agree that the facts that I have set out should ideally be first dealt with at a proper inquiry and people must have the ability to test those facts, and police officers may have to be cross-examined. The Judge will make the finding and then we can discuss. We should not get into this mode.",22,456,2016-03-01-T-019-S-00456

Schools will always treat the interests and well-being of their students as a key priority. Some members of the public have suggested that the schools' duty of care extends to shielding students from the Police and not releasing them to the Police without their parents' consent. This sounds plausible, but it is not so straightforward. The Police carry out an important public function to uphold the law and keep Singapore safe and secure.

I would like to ask the Minister for Home Affairs who indicated earlier that seven out of 10 of the youths who are involved in Police investigations eventually go away with warnings or are just put under the Guidance Programmes. The Minister also indicated that, every year, more than 1,300 youths are picked up for various offences. Can the Minister elaborate on the impact of youth crime on public safety and the challenges in dealing with youth crimes?",1,498,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00498

Although not common, we have had murder; we have had physical assault; we have had young people being picked up for gang riotings. If my memory serves me right, about maybe over 500 were picked up for rioting in the last five years, rioting involving serious gang activities. We have young people involved in unlicensed moneylending activities, particularly arson. I think almost all Members would have come across that and how your residents fear for their safety. So, it presents a wide range of challenges.",1,499,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00499

That is why we send a very large number − again, if my memory serves me right − about 600 per year to Guidance Programmes where, in return for not proceeding with a charge, they have to undergo a six-month Guidance Programme, about 20-over sessions where they are taken through the need to understand the nature of the act involved, including the criminality, the impact on the community, how to manage themselves better in their social interactions. This is a programme that, in a way, of course, involves the AGC and MSF. The recidivism rate is only about 11%. That means 89% go on to lead crime-free lives.",2,500,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00500
2016-03-01-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"That is the fundamental Police approach − not criminalise, move them on to a crime-free life but, at the same time, when the incident happens, we have to move. A few years ago, we had a case of a 13-year-old boy raping his domestic helper. You have to act.",3,501,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00501
2016-03-01-T-020,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to seek a clarification from the Minister for Home Affairs. Was the Police of the view that the offence, as founded upon the facts that the Minister has set out, was sufficiently grave and urgent that it could not and did not schedule for a later interview with the boy and his parents?",1,502,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00502
2016-03-01-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I thank the Member for the request for clarification. But I have gone into this in my Statement and suggested that we approach it with the facts known to the Police at that point in time. When they went down to the school on 26 January, they did not know who the boy was. They did not know what his antecedents were. Some may have been reported; some may not have been reported. If he had committed another molest, Members would be asking me, ""Why did you not go down faster?""",1,503,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00503
2016-03-01-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As a matter of principle, I think all Members will agree with me that when an offence has been committed, you want the Police to move as quickly as possible. But we have the right Protocol on how a visit to a school should be handled. So, the Police went in plain clothes. There is a Protocol worked out with MOE. You saw what happened here. The boy was brought to the Principal's office; he was interviewed in the presence of the educators and then, he was brought back to the Police station in an unmarked car. So, as little possibility of publicity as possible. But move, we must. Unless as a society, we say that regardless of what happens, we should never go to the school. I do not think Members will think that is a right approach.",2,504,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00504
2016-03-01-T-020,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I thank both the Ministers for their Statements which reflect the solemn nature of this incident. My question or clarification is in relation to the Police Protocol  was there a need for five officers to go down to the school? I appreciate that three of the five were from the NPC, but was there a need for three NPC officers?",1,505,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00505
2016-03-01-T-020,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I asked this clarification because I believe that the fundamental rationale for intervention where a youth offender is concerned is rehabilitation, to rehabilitate the youth. And importantly, in order to rehabilitate, one has to rehabilitate in his or her own peer group. For that purpose, it was the school or one of the peer groups was the school. Therefore, was there a need to come to school in such numbers, and in order then for him to return to school to give him the best chance at rehabilitation? So, it is a question on Protocol and it is a question on Protocol going forward.",2,506,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00506
2016-03-01-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I thank Mr de Souza. I think the question is not so much focused on why five. Because I agree with Mr de Souza that the focus should be on rehabilitation and the impact on the boy. Therefore, you focus on how many spoke with him. One officer spoke with him. The three officers who went down from NPC were the bridges between the Police and the school. When they go down, the school is familiar with these officers. They are able to know who to go to, who to speak with. There are regular interactions between the NPC and that school, not just that school, but schools in the neighbourhood and the communities. They are the bridges. They open the doors, they speak with the Principals, they speak with the teachers and they say, ""This matter needs to be investigated, our officers from division are here"". They smoothen the path. They were not present when the boy was interviewed. In fact, only one of the officers from the division was present. They went in unmarked cars in plain clothes. So, let us focus on what happened with the boy. He was interviewed by one officer.",1,507,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00507
2016-03-01-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I am not saying that one is always the right number. I think the point is, he must be interviewed in a way that is conducive for a fair, neutral approach to obtain the facts and to obtain the truth. I think that must be the fundamental aim. How you approach it is something that ground officers should be given the discretion to decide on a case-by-case basis. I am not going to go into it and say, ""It should have been five or it should have been three or it should have been four"". I think those are ground decisions that we should leave to the officers. But we should look at it and we will certainly look at this case. What did the boy see? He saw one officer at first and then three brought him back, one left the car so there were only two which is the minimum number that you will need in a car. And then he was interviewed by one officer in the division. So, you look at those facts.",2,508,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00508
2016-03-01-T-020,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Minister for Home Affairs for his explanation so far. I have two questions. One of them both Ministers can jointly answer. The first question is, will the Minister set the time frame or give a rough estimation as to when the Ministry hopes the reviews regarding the interview and handling of minors in Police custody will likely be completed.",1,509,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00509
2016-03-01-T-020,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"The second question is addressed to both Ministries; or both Ministers can jointly consider answering this  let us say in a scenario where the Principal or the Police has already informed the parent of a pupil who is under investigation that the Police have come to the school, will MOE or indeed MHA consider allowing a suitable member of the staff to accompany the pupil, the minor, to the Police station until at least the parents turn up, or until the pupil is released from the Police station? I am not talking about the situation where the pupil is under interview, not at that stage. But what I am talking about is basically a member of the staff or allowing the parents to be at the Police Station but not during the interview so that, at the very least, there is some handing over between the school and the parents.",2,510,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00510
2016-03-01-T-020,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Madam, shall I ask my other two questions to the Minister for Education later? Or should I ask them now?",3,511,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00511
2016-03-01-T-020,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,You can ask them later.,1,512,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00512

2016-03-01-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I thank the Member for his two questions. On the first point as to when the review would be completed, I have told my officials that we should start the work but we should hold back on any decisions until after the Coroner's Inquiry. Let the Coroner's Inquiry go through, let there be a finding, we will take reference from that. The second thing that we need to do and that is why I do not want to rush into it, is also maybe consult the stakeholders. I do not really want to start consulting stakeholders before the Coroner's Inquiry.",1,514,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00514
2016-03-01-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, we will review it and that will really cover the Member's second point because in a sense, the Member's point is, can there be an adult accompanying the young person from school until he gets to the Police station? I think we will have to review those as part and parcel of this process. I have said earlier in my Statement that we will consider the suggestion of the Appropriate Adult scheme but I also pointed out the many considerations and why it is not so straightforward and some of the people involved would not be considered vulnerable either. I gave you a range of cases and I gave you three major reasons why one should take a pause before rushing to conclusions. So, those things have to be considered.",2,515,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00515
2016-03-01-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I want to assure Members and Mr Tan on one thing. The reason why I gave you the statistics about 70% flowing through as it were without a charge, some of them after investigations are not guilty, but some of them would, in Police's view be people who have committed an offence. But why is it that seven out of 10 are not charged? It is, therefore, not a Police versus a young person situation. The Police look at it as a stakeholder in a community to try and make sure the young person gets rehabilitated. That is why we place a lot of emphasis on the Guidance Programme.",3,516,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00516
2016-03-01-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We are very pleased with the results of the Guidance Programme at 89% success rate; but 11% recidivism. That means you have really moved the young person from one path to another path. As Mr Tan would know from practice, many of those who turn up in prison in their early 20s would often have had minor infractions in their teens. The experience of criminality is a very strong indicator of subsequent life of crime. A life wasted. So, for us, the way we want to approach it is, lives saved.",4,517,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00517
2016-03-01-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, we will look at all suggestions to see how our process can be made better. But I do want to emphasise this, on the facts today, I cannot say that it was the processes that led to this tragic result. I have given you the facts that we have got to consider, but that does not mean that we sit back and say we do nothing. We will review and we will consider the point.",5,518,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00518
2016-03-01-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Madam, I think I have answered the questions on behalf of the Acting Minister for Education.",6,519,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00519
2016-03-01-T-020,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"I thank the Minister for Home Affairs for his Statement. Losing a child is every parent's worst nightmare and every parent wants their sons and daughters to be safe. Yesterday, website",1,520,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00520
2016-03-01-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"First of all, the suggestion that this case would have died down long ago is ridiculous because there is going to be a Coroner's Inquiry. That is what normally happens when there is an unnatural death and an announcement was made on the 1 February, as I said, that is six days after the Police started investigating; on the sixth day. So, that is just absurd. But I am not saying that the father is saying absurd things; I do not want to assume that what I see in TOC is what the father says. But any such suggestion would be absurd.",1,521,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00521
2016-03-01-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"What I can say is what the father said to us. On 24 February last week, he had told us in the presence of a number of officers that the family would prefer to keep the Coroner's Inquiry private. They felt pressurised by the media. They would appreciate if Police could inform the media not to publish the family's pictures or names, and I elaborated upon that in my Statement.",2,522,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00522
2016-03-01-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Lim, the father, confirmed that yesterday with the Police. He told us yesterday that the family's earlier set of requests remained. He continued with the request that the media not harass him, that the family's privacy be respected and that the Coroner's Inquiry be held in private. That was yesterday, the same day the Member referred to this article coming out. Many possible explanations; I have not sought to ask why. Is it the case that the father is saying different things to different people? Or is it the case that, as usual, you cannot believe what you read on TOC? I do not know. Or could there be some other explanation? Your guess is as good as mine.",3,523,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00523
2016-03-01-T-020,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"I would like to express my condolences to the family of Benjamin Lim. I also thank the Ministers for taking this case seriously to issue the Statements. My question is about the Appropriate Adult scheme. Notwithstanding the fact that it could be an imperfect scheme, I would like to ask the Minister to consider extending the scope of this current scheme. Currently, it covers persons with mental and intellectual disability only. In regimes like in the United Kingdom, the scope covers young people who are less than 18 years of age and also vulnerable adults who might have mental wellness issues or even dementia or other learning disabilities. So, I would like to ask the Minister to consider this.",1,524,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00524
2016-03-01-T-020,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"The second question is  the current Appropriate Adult scheme in Singapore is manned by volunteers and run by charities. I think the scheme is important enough for the state to allocate some resources to ensure that at least people who are trained, not just trained for a short while only, people who are professionals, can operate the scheme on a sustainable basis. This is for Minister's consideration, please.",2,525,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00525
2016-03-01-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I assume on the second question, what the Member is really asking is whether we will pay for it. Yes, that is something that we would look at. I cannot give a guarantee on that but we will certainly look at.",1,526,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00526
2016-03-01-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"On the first point, I have already said that both in my Statement and in answer to Dr Tan's question, that the review would cover this particular aspect as whether an Appropriate Adult should be present when young persons are interviewed. But I have taken some considerable pains to point out why it is not a straightforward issue and what are possible issues that might arise.",2,527,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00527
2016-03-01-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We have to balance between the need to move quickly, investigate, particularly when it is a serious crime, a terrorism-related issue, and balance that against the need for the young person to have some support. I have mentioned the systemic risk could be minimised as well.

Can the Minister elaborate on his assessment of TOC's motivations, conduct and coverage of this tragic event?",1,529,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00529
2016-03-01-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"It is quite clear from my Statement what I thought of the coverage. I think it is a calculated, cynical attempt to tar the Police using falsehoods. And I have said what should happen hereafter is not something I should be commenting on today.",1,530,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00530
2016-03-01-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Madam, as a parent of two teenagers, I deeply empathise with the families of both the deceased and the victim. For the Minister for Home Affairs, I understand the urgency the Police had in interviewing the deceased, but could the Police not have waited another half an hour or one hour until Benjamin's father or mother came to the Police station or the school before starting to interview him? Like what the Minister mentioned earlier, this is his first offence. He did not have any prior record, and as a 14-year-old whom I still regard as a child, he must have felt quite frightened to be there being interviewed by the Police without a significant adult present.",1,531,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00531
2016-03-01-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"The other question  there are many speculations, accusations and unverified accounts on social media sites. In future, will the Ministry be more responsive and open to sharing more information in both print and online news media so as to make verifications or to dispel the accusations that are floating around?",2,532,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00532
2016-03-01-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I think the first question essentially raises the question whether we should have an Appropriate Adult present. What I have said is we had considered a lot of that very carefully previously and I have explained in my Statement the considerations. And I have said that we will review. We will do a review. We will look at the findings in the Coroner's Inquiry. We will consult stakeholders and we will decide. I have explained why we should not have knee-jerk reactions. I think I should express, as the Minister for Education has expressed, our condolences to Benjamin's family. And equally, we share the grief of the family of the 11-year-old girl because they are also grief-stricken. I think they all have the same feelings. As I said in my Statement, either child could have been a child of any of us. We got to approach it with that perspective.",1,533,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00533
2016-03-01-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"At the same time, whether the Police should wait for the parents or somebody else to accompany, whether there should be someone else present, I think these are the same type of questions that Ms Denise Phua and Mr Dennis Tan have raised and which I myself have raised in my Statement. We will review it.",2,534,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00534
2016-03-01-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"On the second point as to whether we will release more information, I have spent quite a bit of time explaining why in this case we actually decided not to go into the facts. I think it would be unseemly for this matter to get to a stage where there are series of allegations and counter allegations, and statements and counter statements with the families, the commentators, the Police – you will have a ""free for all"". That is precisely what legal proceedings are destined to avoid. We will have a proper process for finding out the facts. Otherwise, who is to say my truth is superior to your truth? I think we were right, we were observing the law but others were not so careful. In fact, they were cavalier and which has then required us to come out today and clarify.",3,535,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00535
2016-03-01-T-020,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"I thank the two Ministers for their statements and condolences to both families. On the same track as what Member Intan has asked with regard to online reports, I think we cannot ignore the fact that the online media play a very important part in communication. In situations like that where it is very emotive and sensitive, while I totally understand the stance of handling the information very carefully and the sensitivity of sharing the information, is there a way that information, at least some information can be shared with online news sites in a way that would help, at least, not continue to fire these emotions in respect of the families? I know it is a very hard balance. The other thing is also, should online websites obtain and verify information of this nature before they post such articles?",1,536,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00536
2016-03-01-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I thank Ms Tan for that. But that sort of reverses the onus. It is not for them to make the allegations and then for us to respond. The law is the same on reporting before a pending hearing or inquiry; whether it is a physical world or online world, the law of contempt is the same. Everyone should observe it. Just because you are online does not mean that you get a free pass and you can say what you like.",1,537,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00537
2016-03-01-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, we start with what is the law. As I said, you can raise some general issues; you can raise the issue of policy, whether in the media, physical media, print media, broadcast media or online media. What you cannot do is to make allegations of fact when those facts could be the subject matter of dispute or have to be found in an inquiry or would necessarily be part of what an inquiry would have to decide. It is even egregious when they are a bunch of lies.",2,538,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00538

The mere presence of an MOE staff at the Police station before the parents arrive will give much assurance to the student while he is under Police custody.",1,541,2016-03-01-T-020-S-00541

2016-03-01-T-020,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"And, specifically, for this particular case, did the school interview friends? I suppose in schools, cyber bullying is one aspect; other aspects are rumours and other things that go round in social media or on Whatsapp or social media platforms.

2016-03-01-T-020,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"When the school takes the student back, the balance between confidentiality and rehabilitation is a very delicate one. The counsellors, some are trained with the National Institute of Education (NIE) and some of them are even ex-teachers. They would be able to contextualise their approaches to counselling according to the needs of the students, depending on the severity of the case, how emotionally impacted the student may be.

Is there such a regime in place? If not, will the current review process consider putting in place such a regime, whereby that kind of help can be given to young persons who are being investigated?

2016-03-01-T-022,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"First of all, I shall speak on indoor farming, which is a growing form of urban farming where crops are grown in a highly controlled environment, protected from the elements. In indoor farming, environmental factors such as the exposure to light, water, humidity and the temperature are carefully calibrated to create an optimal environment for crops to grow.",4,583,2016-03-01-T-022-S-00583
2016-03-01-T-022,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"In 2013, Panasonic Factory Solutions Asia Pacific opened a major indoor vegetable farm in Singapore in one of its factory buildings which illustrates these techniques. Panasonic started with 10 types of vegetables in its 248-square-metres facility. By March 2017, Panasonic aims to increase the number of crop varieties to 30 and aims to supply 5% of local vegetable production, up from the 0.015% in July 2014. This is not an insignificant target given that all local farms currently produce only 8% of all the vegetables consumed in Singapore. While Panasonic's crops are currently grown in a soil-based environment as opposed to soilless methods that have been gaining popularity, the company is looking into R&D to boost yield, including vertical farming which utilises vertically stacked racks for space optimisation.",5,584,2016-03-01-T-022-S-00584

However, only $0.69 million of the $63 million has been disbursed in the year since the launch of the APF. According to a Government statement in October 2015, this $0.69 million, or less, had been shared among 20 local farms owned by 17 companies.

2016-03-01-T-022,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"I believe that there is much more that can be done to encourage local firms to excel in this field. We should recall that indoor vertical farming is a high-tech, knowledge-intensive activity that requires the integration of many different types of expertise. Singapore, as a developed country with limited land and high population density, offers a good test bed. If economic development agencies adopted a proactive approach of grooming local Singapore-based SMEs to develop leading-edge technology and know-how in indoor farming, Singapore could be producing an even higher share of our consumption needs and developing an exportable sector that could contribute to our economy.",10,589,2016-03-01-T-022-S-00589

2016-03-01-T-022,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The benefits of underground vertical farming are, essentially, three-fold. Firstly, food security. Underground indoor farming promises to protect our food supply from catastrophic events, security threats, crop disease and so on. As for affordability, new technologies have enabled higher crop yields for indoor farming. Sky Greens, for example, has been able to produce at least 10 times more yield per unit of land area versus conventional methods. The world's biggest indoor farm in Japan has claimed to be 100 times more productive than traditional farms.",15,594,2016-03-01-T-022-S-00594

2016-03-01-T-022,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Secondly, sustainability. The amount of water used in indoor vertical farming has been found to be substantially lower due to the layout of the racks and the implementation of water recycling features built into the system. The underground farm in London uses 70% less water than traditional farming. Indoor farming also reduces shrinkage, which is loss of crops during transportation. The much-shorter journey from the farm to the marketplace also means that the crops remain fresh for longer periods after they reach our shelves.",17,596,2016-03-01-T-022-S-00596
2016-03-01-T-022,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The third benefit is developing expertise and IP for our economy. Singapore is well-positioned to become a global leader in the field of underground urban agriculture. Our local enterprises can be nurtured to not only operate indoor farms effectively in Singapore for the benefit of Singapore and Singaporeans, but also to cultivate expertise in designing, installing, implementing and managing such facilities in similar high-density urban environments around the world. That could be an exportation sector for our economy.",18,597,2016-03-01-T-022-S-00597

Moreover, the cost-effectiveness of technologies such as solar PV technology is continuing to improve rapidly. The cost of solar panels has come down by a factor of five in the past six years and is expected to halve in the next 20 years.

2016-03-01-T-022,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Firstly, more can be done to exhaust opportunities for rooftop solar panel deployment. In this regard, we are fortunate that most housing in Singapore is public housing, which facilitates the achievement of this goal. In October 2014, HDB began awarding the zero-dollar solar leasing tender, meaning that the full costs of solar PV systems are borne by the PV developers. In June 2015, HDB called the first consolidated tender under the SolarNova programme for 220 megawatt peak, which is a small fraction of the estimated six megawatt peak of solar capacity that is potentially available, according to estimates in Singapore. This initiative was leading to the installation of solar panels at some 5,500 HDB blocks. We can be more aggressive here and set a goal to install solar panels on every HDB building roof by 2025.",26,605,2016-03-01-T-022-S-00605
2016-03-01-T-022,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Secondly, more should be done to study and exploit opportunities in unorthodox solar panel deployment, such as on water bodies. PUB has been looking into building solar panels on the Tengeh reservoir and Choa Chu Kang waterworks. One that is being built in the UK – that is, water-borne solar panel deployment – is reported to cost about £3.5 million or about S$7 million, and will generate around three megawatt. The UK deployment covers an area about half the size of Bedok Reservoir, which is one of our smaller reservoirs. Solar panel deployments across all our reservoirs and also some available parts of our territorial waters outside of established sea lanes, could contribute significantly to energy production. Japan has floating solar panels in Hyogo prefecture and is now working on building the world's biggest floating solar farm in Chiba prefecture by 2018.",27,606,2016-03-01-T-022-S-00606

2016-03-01-T-022,Low Yen Ling,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Today's uncertain global economy holds challenges that require us to be flexible yet steadfast, nimble and adept, and far-sighted in our approach. Since the early days of our nation, the Government has made it a top priority to grow our economy and create good jobs for Singaporeans. We have to keep this dynamic DNA of being adriot, always looking for opportunities and having a can-do spirit even in the face of difficulties. That was how new ideas and possibilities were born and painstakingly nurtured into industries, and became reality.",2,614,2016-03-01-T-022-S-00614
2016-03-01-T-022,Low Yen Ling,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"We have to stay nimble and adapt to this changing global environment while meeting the needs of Singapore. With this approach, Singapore successfully grew through various phases of economic transformation.",3,615,2016-03-01-T-022-S-00615
2016-03-01-T-022,Low Yen Ling,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"For example, we moved from the labour-intensive manufacturing era of the 1960s, into skills and capital-intensive industries by developing the Electronics, Chemicals and Precision Engineering clusters during the 1970s and 1980s. By the 1990s and 2000s, we had made a strong push into knowledge and innovation-intensive activities. If Members recall, our first five-year National Science and Technology plan was put in place in 1991. More recently, the Research Innovation Enterprise 2020 Plan (RIE2020), recently announced by the Prime Minister, is the sixth science and technology plan for Singapore.",4,616,2016-03-01-T-022-S-00616
2016-03-01-T-022,Low Yen Ling,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Today, we have a competitive manufacturing base with key clusters in Chemicals, Precision Engineering, Biomedical Manufacturing, Electronics and Transport Engineering. Last year, manufacturing accounted for 20% of our economy and employed more than 500,000 workers. So, manufacturing remains a key pillar for Singapore and opportunities continue to be found.",5,617,2016-03-01-T-022-S-00617
2016-03-01-T-022,Low Yen Ling,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Having said that, we are not standing still but moving forward into new and exciting areas of manufacturing.

To this end, $3.3 billion has been set aside for the Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering domain under RIE2020.",9,621,2016-03-01-T-022-S-00621
2016-03-01-T-022,Low Yen Ling,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"As the nature of manufacturing continues to evolve, companies are incorporating more manufacturing-related services into their business models. For example, aerospace original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are moving beyond manufacturing to provide total support packages (TSPs), where the sale of aircraft or aircraft systems is bundled with a full range of support services such as engine maintenance and field support services. This is an important trend and it presents opportunities for Singapore and our companies to anchor more high-value manufacturing-related services such as R&D, engineering, logistics and maintenance. These activities, in turn, will add to the vibrancy of our manufacturing ecosystem and further strengthen our innovative capabilities.",10,622,2016-03-01-T-022-S-00622
2016-03-01-T-022,Low Yen Ling,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"To stay relevant and competitive, we are constantly on the look-out for new areas and opportunities to grow and evolve our economy. One of the ideas is to grow the concept of Singapore as a ""living lab"", where companies co-develop, test-bed and export new solutions that not only address our country's domestic needs but also generate economic outcomes.",11,623,2016-03-01-T-022-S-00623
2016-03-01-T-022,Low Yen Ling,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"An example, also mentioned earlier by Mr Perera, is our nation's water success. Our motivation to be self-reliant and develop water treatment technologies, such as desalination and water reclamation, has spurred the development of a vibrant water industry. There are now about 180 water companies and 26 private research centres in Singapore. Opportunities like these can still be captured, if we keep our can-do spirit, inventiveness and relentless pursuit of innovation.",12,624,2016-03-01-T-022-S-00624
2016-03-01-T-022,Low Yen Ling,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"For example, we have the chance to turn the challenges of an ageing population into creative energy and solutions in healthcare. Changi General Hospital's Centre for Healthcare Assistive and Robotics Technology (CHART) is exploring how to provide accessible, affordable and high quality healthcare even as the workforce and population ages. To this end, it has set up a collaborative platform for healthcare professionals to work closely with academia, industry and research institutions to develop impactful healthcare solutions using robotics and assistive technologies.

I understand that P&G's independent innovation research centre located in Singapore Polytechnic is focused on creating product design and development for consumers aged 50 and above in Asia. This project is called the ""Live Well Collaborative"". Its work is relevant to rising baby boomer Singaporeans whose sophisticated tastes could well spurn a new elderly industry, not just in Singapore but the region.",15,627,2016-03-01-T-022-S-00627
2016-03-01-T-022,Low Yen Ling,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Turning our attention to clean and solar energy, Singapore is a sunny place and we can make that work harder for us. There are ample opportunities to tap solar energy and spread the sunshine into new areas of growth.",16,628,2016-03-01-T-022-S-00628
2016-03-01-T-022,Low Yen Ling,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"In fact, Government-lead demand is helping to grow the nascent solar industry. For example, SolarNova is a Government-led programme, spearheaded by the EDB, which encourages Government agencies to come together to harness solar energy for their electricity needs. It is really taking a whole-of-Government approach to create sophisticated demand. With HDB acting as the Government's central procurement agency for solar panels, agencies with slightly smaller demand can then benefit from economies of scale and enjoy solar energy at a lower cost. At the same time, by aggregating and catalysing solar demand in Singapore, we seek to spur the growth of our solar industry. The increasing adoption of solar energy will also generate and attract innovation around smart grids and energy management.",17,629,2016-03-01-T-022-S-00629

2016-03-01-T-022,Low Yen Ling,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"There was some suggestion about the use of underground space and so on. This needs to be studied. As Members know, developing underground space has a cost issue, it could be expensive. We do need to understand what are the trade-offs and the cost-benefit analysis. So, more studies need to be done to ascertain the best use of underground space.",20,632,2016-03-01-T-022-S-00632

2016-03-01-T-022,Low Yen Ling,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling),"Even as we nurture new sectors, we are mindful of Singaporeans with new skillsets to benefit from future job opportunities. With SkillsFuture, Singaporeans have the chance of embracing lifelong learning as a way of life so as to stay relevant in today's fast-changing world. To achieve this vision, we need the support of all Singaporeans, education and training providers, and employers. For example, firms that move into new industries play a very important role because they are early adopters. They play an important role not only in the job creation, but in the learning they can facilitate through internships and professional attachments, as well as the partnerships they form with our schools, Institutes of Higher Learning and Research Institutions for these nascent sectors.",22,634,2016-03-01-T-022-S-00634

2016-03-01-T-029,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,The sale of residential land parcels near MRT stations provides new homes which offer residents convenient access to public transport.,1,670,2016-03-01-T-029-S-00670
2016-03-01-T-029,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As there can be high traffic volume around major MRT stations arising from the pick-up and drop-off of passengers by private vehicles and public buses, Government agencies ensure that the road network can support any additional traffic generated by residents of future developments nearby.",2,671,2016-03-01-T-029-S-00671
2016-03-01-T-029,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"If there is a series of land parcels located around an MRT station available for development, these land parcels will be progressively released for sale and development so that the increase in traffic volume can be managed over a period of time.",3,672,2016-03-01-T-029-S-00672
2016-03-01-T-029,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In addition, before a land parcel is offered for sale, Government agencies will impose requirements on the future developer to prevent potential traffic problems. For example, a developer may be required to carry out road widening and improvement works. There may also be strict requirements on the location of entrance and exit points to the development to prevent any disruption to traffic circulation along the main roads.",4,673,2016-03-01-T-029-S-00673
2016-03-01-T-030,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there has been any public consultations, educational sessions and/or distribution of information sheets for residents within estates selected for the Silver Zone project prior to the commencement of road works; (b) if there were, how extensive has the consultation process been and, if there was not, what are the reasons for not doing so; and (c) whether the Ministry has received any adverse feedback since the implementation of the Silver Zone project and, if so, how does the Ministry intend to address those issues.",1,674,2016-03-01-T-030-S-00674
2016-03-01-T-030,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"LTA engages residents extensively through brochures, posters, local newsletters and at local events before commencing on the construction of a Silver Zone.",1,675,2016-03-01-T-030-S-00675
2016-03-01-T-030,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"As with most infrastructure projects, we receive some noise and dust related feedback during construction. Some motorists are concerned about the impact of Silver Zones on traffic. But the vast majority of residents appreciate that Silver Zones are beneficial to vulnerable pedestrians such as the elderly and physically disabled, and are very supportive.",2,676,2016-03-01-T-030-S-00676
2016-03-01-T-031,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the avenues of compensation for injuries caused by cyclists; and (b) whether the Ministry has plans to regulate cyclists and, if so, how does it intend to do so.",1,677,2016-03-01-T-031-S-00677
2016-03-01-T-031,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Those injured by cyclists can seek compensation from the cyclists through civil action in Court or private settlement, similar to victims of motoring accidents.",1,678,2016-03-01-T-031-S-00678
2016-03-01-T-031,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"There are regulations in place for cyclists today, for example, cyclists are not allowed on footpaths. The Active Mobility Advisory Panel chaired by Parliamentary Secretary Assoc Prof Faishal Ibrahim is reviewing these regulations and is also looking to introduce a code of conduct. We understand that the panel will be submitting its recommendations to the Ministry soon.",2,679,2016-03-01-T-031-S-00679

2016-03-01-T-032,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Government pensioners, like all Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, have been covered under MediShield Life from 1 November 2015. Government pensioners will continue to enjoy all their existing medical benefits and will not pay higher out-of-pocket for their medical expenses than if MediShield Life had not been introduced.",1,681,2016-03-01-T-032-S-00681
2016-03-01-T-032,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In addition, Government pensioners can use MediShield Life to help pay for the co-payment portion of their bills, if any. Some pensioners with larger bills may pay even lower out-of-pocket expenses with MediShield Life.",2,682,2016-03-01-T-032-S-00682
2016-03-01-T-032,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Government is paying the MediShield Life premiums in full for pensioners and their dependants on the Fixed Amount on Ward (FAW) and Co-payment on Ward (CPW) schemes. Pensioners on the Comprehensive Co-payment Scheme (CCS) and Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient (MSO) scheme receive higher Medisave contributions from the Government. They can use this to help pay for their own and their dependants' premiums. The Public Service Division has written to all eligible Government pensioners in 2015 to inform them of this arrangement, conducted various engagement sessions with pensioners and is maintaining a hotline to clarify any queries.",3,683,2016-03-01-T-032-S-00683

2016-03-01-T-033,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"There is currently a substantial supply of about 2,300 landed housing units in the pipeline, the bulk of which remains unsold. Hence, we do not have any plans to provide land for new landed housing developments in the near term.",1,685,2016-03-01-T-033-S-00685
2016-03-01-T-033,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As the unsold inventory is cleared, we will consider releasing more land for new landed housing developments, to better meet the needs of Singaporeans who prefer to live in landed homes.",2,686,2016-03-01-T-033-S-00686
2016-03-01-T-034,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak,asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many cyclists have been booked for errant or dangerous cycling offences in the past two years; (b) how many complaints have been lodged against errant cyclists in the past year; and (c) how many participants have undergone the Safe Cycling Clinic for Youth since its launch in 2014.,1,687,2016-03-01-T-034-S-00687
2016-03-01-T-034,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Government agencies received about 600 and 800 complaints of errant cyclists in 2014 and 2015 respectively. They issued about 1,300 summons in 2014 and a similar number in 2015.",1,688,2016-03-01-T-034-S-00688
2016-03-01-T-034,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Since its launch in 2014, the Safe Cycling Clinic for Youth has trained about 150 secondary school students. It is part of a larger suite of programmes to educate the public on safe cycling. For instance, LTA, in collaboration with Government and non-Government bodies, has conducted workshops to educate cyclists on safety at community events and neighbourhood touchpoints.",2,689,2016-03-01-T-034-S-00689
2016-03-01-T-035,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for Transport for each year from 2010 to 2015, what is the number of prosecutions for illegal use of electric bicycles.",1,690,2016-03-01-T-035-S-00690

2016-03-01-T-036,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the information gathered from the Electric Vehicle (EV) phase 1 test-bed has provided sufficient data to review our existing policies and infrastructure plans to support greater EV adoption in Singapore; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider rolling out a series of support measures for the adoption of EV.,1,693,2016-03-01-T-036-S-00693
2016-03-01-T-036,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,The first phase of the electric vehicle test-bed was held from June 2011 to December 2013 to understand the technicalities of deploying electric vehicles in Singapore. The second phase will test fleet-based operations. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Economic Development Board had issued a Request for Information (RFI) in December 2014 to invite proposals for a nationwide electric vehicle car-sharing programme. The proposals are in the final stages of evaluation. LTA is also studying the feasibility of using electric vehicles for taxi services. These fleet-based trials will help Government agencies determine the optimal charging infrastructure required to support more widespread use of electric vehicles and the costs involved.,1,694,2016-03-01-T-036-S-00694
2016-03-01-T-037,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) how many legal actions have been brought by CASE against errant vendors and/or retailers in 2005 to 2015 and what proportion resulted in the Courts taking action against these vendors/retailers.,1,695,2016-03-01-T-037-S-00695
2016-03-01-T-037,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"From 2005 to 2015, the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) filed six injunction applications in the Courts against recalcitrant errant suppliers. All six applications resulted in the Courts issuing injunction orders on the suppliers restraining them from carrying out the specified unfair practices, such as making untrue statements to consumers about the availability or origin of the goods which the supplier was selling.",1,696,2016-03-01-T-037-S-00696
2016-03-01-T-037,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Injunctions are the last resort in a spectrum of actions that can be taken against errant retailers under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act. Before filing an injunction application in the Courts, CASE may facilitate mediation between suppliers and consumers to reach mutually agreed outcomes.",2,697,2016-03-01-T-037-S-00697
2016-03-01-T-037,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"CASE may also propose that suppliers enter into voluntary compliance agreements (VCAs) to stop the specified unfair practices and compensate consumers. In most cases, errant retailers cease the unfair practices after mediation and/or entering into a VCA. In such instances, CASE does not need to file for injunctions against them. Over the same period, from 2005 to 2015, CASE facilitated about 1,700 mediation cases and entered into 17 VCAs.",3,698,2016-03-01-T-037-S-00698

2016-03-01-T-038,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"HDB approved over 200,000 applications for an HDB Loan Eligibility letter between 2012 and 2015. Of these, about one in five (or 40,000) appealed for a larger housing loan. Generally, appellants asked for a larger loan to widen their flat choices, without specifying a loan quantum.",1,700,2016-03-01-T-038-S-00700
2016-03-01-T-038,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Over one in three of such appeals were successful. HDB was unable to accede to the rest of the appeals as the applicants were unable to provide evidence of their ability to service the larger loan. As a flat purchase is a long-term financial commitment, it would not be prudent for potential home-buyers to take on additional financial burdens that they are unable to sustain.",2,701,2016-03-01-T-038-S-00701
2016-03-01-T-039,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will permit local fish farmers and scientists to experiment and sell genetically modified fish locally.,1,702,2016-03-01-T-039-S-00702
2016-03-01-T-039,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Parties that wish to conduct research on genetically modified (GM) animals, including fish, must first obtain the approval of the Genetic Modification Advisory Committee (GMAC). The GMAC is a national committee, comprising representatives from Government agencies, research bodies and other supporting organisations overseeing the research and development, production, use, handling and release of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) in Singapore. In deciding whether to allow the proposal to proceed, GMAC will consider whether appropriate measures are in place for the safe containment, handling and transport of the GM animals, in accordance with the Singapore Biosafety Guidelines for Research on GMOs. This is to keep research safe and ensure public and environmental safety.",1,703,2016-03-01-T-039-S-00703
2016-03-01-T-039,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Should any party wish to sell GM fish in Singapore for human consumption, they must first seek approval from the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA). AVA will assess the food safety of the fish in consultation with GMAC, and with reference to the food safety guidelines for GM foods, established by United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation and World Health Organization.",2,704,2016-03-01-T-039-S-00704
