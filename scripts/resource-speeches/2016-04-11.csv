2016-04-11-T-002,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mdm Chairman, I beg to move, ""That the total sum to be allotted for head M of the Estimates be reduced by $100.""",1,4,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00004
2016-04-11-T-002,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"As the largest buyer of goods and services in the market, the Government has significant market influence to shape enterprise behaviour and through its procurement practices incentivise businesses to draw on their research and innovative capabilities in coming up with solutions to public sector problems.",2,5,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00005
2016-04-11-T-002,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),There is scope to enhance our procurement practices towards promoting innovation among our SMEs while at the same time delivering value for money for the public sector.,3,6,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00006
2016-04-11-T-002,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"As a start, the public sector could earmark a portion of the public sector tenders specifically to promote and encourage innovations and creativity. I suggest that the Government establish a new ""buy innovation"" procurement framework where innovative solutions are being sought for public sector problems. This could be a new category of tenders carved out for projects where the public sector agencies intend to co-create solutions with SMEs.",4,7,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00007
2016-04-11-T-002,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In such tenders, the procurement of innovations is better achieved by specifying the public sector problems to be solved rather than by prescribing the solution and the work to be done, which is the usual approach.",5,8,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00008
2016-04-11-T-002,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mdm Chair, at the public service level, our procurement rules and instruction manuals may also need to be reviewed and updated to cater for a more entrepreneurial and innovative society to come. We need to allow for sufficient discretions at the operating level for bite-size public sector projects to be awarded to small businesses who may be early movers or who are proactive in coming up with innovative solutions that the public agencies are looking for. Subjecting every proposal to an open tender would be the surest way to kill off initiative and creativity among the small businesses, and some could be start-ups.",6,9,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00009
2016-04-11-T-002,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Understandably, there is a need to devise new and alternative governance safeguards other than just making every tenderer compete on prices in the name of transparency and fairness.",7,10,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00010
2016-04-11-T-002,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),Getting the best price tender may not necessary bring out the most creative and innovative solution which serve the long-term needs of the public sector. The cumulative solution may not be a more sustainable solution.,8,11,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00011
2016-04-11-T-002,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In the private sector, awarding contracts on the basis of ideas and innovation by large companies to small firms are already prevalent. Many developed countries' public sectors do have tailored made procurement practices too that promote innovations and co-creations.",9,12,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00012
2016-04-11-T-002,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"We can take a leaf from UK. To help SMEs develop innovative solutions to public sector challenges, the UK government established the Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) specifically to help small companies compete for government projects. The SBRI help connect small businesses to government departments who have public sector problems and assist small businesses come up with innovative solutions and ideas. This scheme even helps with bridge finance and in cases of new invention, to safeguard the intellectual property.",10,13,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00013
2016-04-11-T-002,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In Singapore, we do have a similar scheme known as Public-Private Co-Innovation Partnership (CI Partnership), which is the platform for the Government department and local companies to co-develop innovative solutions to meet Government's needs.",11,14,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00014
2016-04-11-T-002,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"However, upon deeper study into details in the CI Partnership website, it seems that this scheme has turned dormant. Despite being a $450-million scheme, only 28 projects were put up since 2011 with no mentions of any take up. One of the criteria mentioned that during the commercialisation phase, the agency may need to call for an open tender to procure the innovative product or service.",12,15,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00015
2016-04-11-T-002,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mdm Chair, this is a good initiative notwithstanding the poor take-up rate. It is probably ahead of its time. But now with greater emphasis about working closely with businesses and to foster innovation, the Government should give this scheme another boost and fine tune the criteria and KPIs to be more innovation-friendly.",13,16,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00016
2016-04-11-T-002,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Given the call in the Budget Statement for the Government to better partner the industry and innovators, can the Minister share how the Government intends to co-create solutions with the businesses and public? What can the Government do to help smaller firms better access Government procurement opportunities and to build track record for their overseas expansion?",14,17,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00017
2016-04-11-T-002,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Cumbersome procurement processes and irrelevant qualifying criteria such as how big is the company and years in operations have deterred many SMEs, especially the start-ups, from supplying solutions to the Government where innovative and creative procurement is concerned.",15,18,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00018
2016-04-11-T-002,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),We should introduce greater flexibilities in the way the government sector procures goods and services including looking at non-traditional safeguards to ensure value for money.,16,19,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00019
2016-04-11-T-002,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Developing more SME-friendly procurement process will allow SMEs the opportunities to harness their creativity and capabilities, yet results in higher competition on ideas and solutions, leading to better value for money for the public sector agencies. This is win-win for the Government and businesses.",17,20,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00020
2016-04-11-T-002,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"Madam, I would like to call on the Government to look into encouraging the increased use of price-adjustment clauses or escalation clauses in government procurement. These clauses provide that should some key costs in government contracts rise significantly form the time of tender to the time of performance or over a long period of performance, then the contract price will escalate in accordance with some pre-agreed formula, typically with reference to an index. This would protect the contractor from having to assume the risk of sharp increases in key costs. This will also benefit the Government in that their contractors will be under less pressure to over-budget when they bid for a contract and build into their bids their estimates for future cost increases.",1,21,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00021
2016-04-11-T-002,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"Escalation clauses need not be used only to protect the contractors when the costs go up. They can also be used to favour the Government when key costs drop, say commodity or oil prices. They can provide that in such cases, the contract price to be paid by the Government will decrease accordingly.",2,22,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00022
2016-04-11-T-002,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"In this way, escalation clauses remove some financial risks for government contractors and may enable or allow SMEs to punch above their weight in more public tenders. To me, this would be in keeping with the spirit of this year's Budget, in the various forms of financing and tax incentives proposed to support the scale-ups of our SMEs.",3,23,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00023
2016-04-11-T-002,,The Chairman,"Mr Yee Chia Hsing, not here. Miss Cheryl Chan, you have two cuts. Take them together, please.",1,24,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00024
2016-04-11-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"Thank you, Mdm Chair, on the first cut, after 50 years of good progress, it is timely for us as a nation to reflect and begin charting new directions together to scale new heights for the next 50 years and more.",1,25,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00025
2016-04-11-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"As the Minister for Finance calls for better partnership with the industry and our people, what areas can we look at to co-create solutions?",2,26,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00026
2016-04-11-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"Here are some areas that may be worth considering. Let us start from the ideation process. With many sectors in the broad-base industry, each sector has its unique characteristics and needs. To enhance and find areas of synergy, it is pertinent for the different sectors to provide insights and champion ideas that they believe would put our industries on better footing at the global stage.",3,27,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00027
2016-04-11-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),The Ministry should provide platforms for such collective ideas to take shape. Each sector to allow natural champions in leading their own industry to define the framework and seek support on areas of assistance required to differentiate themselves as a business or as a Singapore brand.,4,28,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00028
2016-04-11-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"For community leaders, we need flexibility in defining guidelines and during its implementation to encourage co-ownership and innovation with local adaptation of ground-up initiatives to suit their needs. This is a culture that we seek to foster with both our industries and our people. Reduce top-down directive that is in return strengthened by our social recognition of what we define together as a community.",5,29,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00029
2016-04-11-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"Next, to create enhanced support with a planned roadmap for these outfits. Take an example, our social enterprises that have emerged over the years. Many have embarked on the path due to their passion and believe to support specific causes.",6,30,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00030
2016-04-11-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"However, many have closed over time with inability to sustain due to funding or other reasons. The Government should consider having the public sector outsource some of their functions in support of these organisations. This way it allows the enterprises to harness resources and leverage capabilities to sustain or learn best practices.",7,31,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00031
2016-04-11-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"Lastly, in all solutions initiated, it is critical to have a close-loop to improve the feedback channel and fine tune system instead of adding more features continuously which invariably result in some complexity and redundancies.",8,32,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00032
2016-04-11-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"On the second cut, as the world transforms, so must we to keep pace and remain relevant with the global environment. Digitalisation being one of the ways forward as there is known benefits.",9,33,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00033
2016-04-11-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"I would like to ask the Ministry, as we introduce more of such programmes, how can we ensure all Singaporeans, including seniors and those without prior knowledge, will not be left out of the journey? And also a clarification if the Ministry has done anything to advance the use of e-payment.",10,34,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00034
2016-04-11-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"Before we move full swing to introduce services, there are a few aspects that are necessary to be deliberated. First, sufficient efforts must be made for different groups of participants, be they the businesses, citizens, VWOs and so on, in understanding the significance and tangible benefits of such implementation rather than viewing the process as yet another target.",11,35,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00035
2016-04-11-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"The initial process may be long but these efforts are necessary, without which, any momentum in the transformation would be painfully slow and likely achieve lower success rate. It may also cost us more since additional resources has to be injected at later stage because the process is more of a ""push"" than a ""pull"" process.",12,36,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00036
2016-04-11-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),Assurance is also necessary that the push for such electronic service delivery within Government agencies does not result in lesser clarity of ownership on the issues or become a revolving door.,13,37,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00037
2016-04-11-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"Second, how does digitalisation change our behaviour towards the auditing, security and data protection processes in organisations? As it stands, many organisations already have different forms of operating systems and databases that they use to handle the operational tasks. However, the regular audit process still requires massive amount of manual backend paper work, filing and keeping of records in order for all these audits to take place.",14,38,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00038
2016-04-11-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"The question remains if the methods of handling audits are contradictory to the digitalisation efforts, while they remain necessary and critical check of any organisation.",15,39,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00039
2016-04-11-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"Third, the resistance to change will set in when users contemplate that they have to input similar data repetitively into different Government agencies. So, I would encourage that the Government creates a unified base system structure where existing data can be shared across the different agencies. Time and cost on both parties would be alleviated when fewer processes are reinvented and streamlined.",16,40,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00040
2016-04-11-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"And of course, the most critical link is the need for inclusiveness when systems and processes are designed because the ability of the different groups to adapt will vary in society. As we progress, we must not forget there are those who lack resources to keep pace.",17,41,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00041
2016-04-11-T-002,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Mdm Chair, more than 200,000 people is estimated to be providing regular care to family and friends in Singapore. This number is expected to rise as the number of elderly more than double by 2030.",1,42,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00042
2016-04-11-T-002,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"A Duke-NUS Medical School survey found that fewer than 5% of care-givers interviewed used individual support services such as home nursing and respite care programmes. Care-givers are becoming a vulnerable group themselves while they care for their vulnerable loved ones. They face emotional stress, lack of social support and immediate and long-term financial burdens. This is worst for specialised care-givers who have to care for loved ones with specific illnesses, for example, care-givers for elderly with dementia, care-givers of people with mental illness and parents of children with special needs.",2,43,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00043
2016-04-11-T-002,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"I understand that some of these specialised care-givers will qualify for tax reliefs such as Handicapped Parent Relief or the Grandparent Care-giver Relief. However, tax reliefs are only meaningful for working Singaporeans with large enough incomes as to pay taxes. Many specialised care-givers either cannot work or work part-time due to the nature of the specialised care-giving.",3,44,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00044
2016-04-11-T-002,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"I also understand that some Government subsidies are available at the point of service, for example, for Singapore Programme for Integrated Care for the Elderly (SPICE) and also the Foreign Domestic Worker grant. However, there are also specialised care-givers who feel that taking care of the dependents personally is the best care that they can give them.",4,45,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00045
2016-04-11-T-002,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"I ask that the Minister consider giving means-tested refundable tax credits for specialised care-givers, meaning that some of these care-givers who do not work or work part-time would get the cash refund, a portion of which would go into their CPF. This will lessen their financial burdens, improve their retirement adequacy, give them flexibility to use Government aid and empower them to seek individual support services for a better quality of life for themselves and their loved ones.",5,46,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00046
2016-04-11-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),"Mdm Chair, income re-distribution and social transfers have played an increasing role in our fiscal system for some years now. This year has not been any different.",1,47,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00047
2016-04-11-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),We are a country with limited resources and we cannot afford to be like some of the countries in the western world who spend a large proportion of their national budgets and GDP on welfare schemes.,2,48,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00048
2016-04-11-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),It is therefore necessary for us to strike a right balance in how we allocate our resources for these schemes that we put in place. There are a few basic issues here.,3,49,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00049
2016-04-11-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),"The first, is the philosophy that the less privileged should receive more. There cannot be any real disagreement there.",4,50,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00050
2016-04-11-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),"The second issue, however, is much harder – how do we determine who the less privileged are, and should there be a scale to distinguish between them and hence, how much assistance they receive? This issue undergirds the importance of means testing, which is the basis on which our resources for transfers are allocated.",5,51,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00051
2016-04-11-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),"Now, over the years, Singapore has enacted a wide range of welfare schemes that seek to benefit many low-income families and they are targeted to the vulnerable groups. These include system schemes such as Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS), the ComCare, the Silver Support Scheme, the Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) for education bursaries, and so on.",6,52,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00052
2016-04-11-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),"Currently, a majority of these schemes assess eligibility based on three broad key factors and these are  household income, per capita income and home annual value. For example, in healthcare, the MediShield Life scheme, which provides medical coverage for all Singaporeans and PRs, tiers its premium subsidies solely based on home annual value and monthly household income.",7,53,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00053
2016-04-11-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),"The Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) adopts the same criteria. The Medisave Top-Up scheme also looks at the home annual value. The PSEA which is the entitlement for all post-Secondary school education students, likewise, does the same, as does the CDAC top-up. I would suggest, Mdm Chair, that the factors which go into the means testing criteria be reviewed.",8,54,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00054
2016-04-11-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),"For instance, the emphasis on annual value is perhaps something of a misnomer in the context of means testing. As a result of this, a number of people who need assistance could well fall through the cracks. And let me elaborate a little on this point.",9,55,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00055
2016-04-11-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),"There are families who live in private estates, but who may have little or no regular income to get by on. Many of them are likely to be elderly; they have inherited their homes or acquired it many years ago and have lived in this home all their lives. They may live in a property which has good annual value, but they are cash poor. But we tell them that because of their home annual value, they will fail to qualify for many of the social schemes which they might need. To this group of people, annual value is indeed something of a misnomer.",10,56,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00056
2016-04-11-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),"It is really no answer to tell these people that they should sell their home, their property, relocate, and live off the remaining proceeds of the sale. We would only be dislocating many of them from their homes; the environment they have grown comfortable with and this would directly – in my view – undermine efforts at fostering the social fabric within our communities we have strived so hard to build.",11,57,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00057
2016-04-11-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),"Another quibble I have with the present system is that the means test merely uses the home address on the NRIC. It does not matter to the means tester whether the individual owns the property or not, whether he or she is renting or not, or could even be only temporarily living there at the goodwill of a friend or a family member. The moment there is a private residential address, the means test criteria looks immediately at the annual value, regardless.",12,58,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00058
2016-04-11-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),"But is this right? Because these factors, such as whether they actually own it or are just living there temporarily while they find their own feet and gain financial independence, do matter, and they might tell us a very different story of the financial sufficiency of the individual concerned.",13,59,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00059
2016-04-11-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),"Finally, whilst income per capita is a useful gauge of a family's financial status, it fails to take into account other tiers of factors, such as factors which may significantly affect a family's cost of living. For example, dependents who are elderly, suffer from serious illnesses which need medical care or who have special needs in their families.",14,60,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00060
2016-04-11-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),"I therefore believe, Madam, that we need to look at refining the criteria for some of our social transfer schemes. Whilst current measures do provide a decent gauge of a household's or individuals' financial needs, I think more granulation needs to be undertaken.",15,61,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00061
2016-04-11-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),Could the Minister therefore consider a revision of the means testing criteria to incorporate a matrix of factors with the following in mind?,16,62,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00062
2016-04-11-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),"First, to consider home ownership rather than just home residency.",17,63,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00063
2016-04-11-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),"Second, to go beyond mere household type, in particular, for the Silver Support Scheme. It has already been mentioned in this House that the current criteria need to be revised because indicators such as household type alone is not reflective of income and wealth, and I agree. Additionally, these factors need to take into account needs-based wants, such as the existence of permanent and also severe illnesses, which are factors that are, more often than not, present amongst our elderly.",18,64,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00064
2016-04-11-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),"Third, to have a deeper inquiry into income status and also consider special cases where, despite having a good annual income or a good per capita income, the family unit could be facing significant financial strains.",19,65,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00065
2016-04-11-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),"Fourth, to consider the annual income over a longer span of time, say, three to five years, rather than just the preceding year.",20,66,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00066

I have encountered business owners who complained of their grant applications being rejected multiple times due to submission of inadequate information. Sometimes, outputs are intangible and the applicant is unsure of how to put these into measurable amounts. These could lead to significant losses when the applications fail to get approved in time for the deadline of that particular financial year. Sometimes, businesses who cannot cope with the necessary administrative work will have to hire someone to handle the administrative work and that adds to significant compliance costs.",2,70,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00070

More outreach and handholding must be done to ensure that SMEs practise voluntary compliance. SMEs should run through their business model with an appropriate professional, trained in legal matters to aid them in understanding and planning for regulatory and compliance requirements.

Options to extend contracts are a common practice internationally and in the private sector. The benefit of an option to extend is that it enables a longer term relationship with the supplier if the supplier has provided good quality service and demonstrates the ability to continue to do so. The extension also means continued employment of the suppliers' employees. It could operate unfairly, however, if the extension does not allow for any increase in contract price in subsequent years to take into account wage increments.

Are there any Government's programmes or functions of the Government which are affected because of the later than usual COS?",1,191,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00191
2016-04-11-T-002,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mdm Chairman, the Government's financial year is from 1 April of the year to 31 March of the following year. So, in this case, as Parliament opened at the beginning of the calendar year in January, we had a very heavy parliamentary schedule, and so, the Government's Budget was presented on 24 March 2016, taking into account the President's Address and the debate on the proposed policies as well as programmes of the Government in January. The Supply Bill 2016, can therefore only be passed by Parliament and enacted after the start of our financial year, and under the Order Paper, Parliament is currently scheduled to vote on the Bill after the end of COS on 14 April 2016. Once passed, the Bill would be submitted to the President for assent before it can be enacted as the Supply Law. So, I think, really, Mr Liang's question pertains to that period after the end of the preceding financial year on 31 March to the time the Supply Bill is passed and how we are funded for that period.",1,192,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00192

This has been done before, in 2002 when, likewise, the new Parliament opened on 25 March 2002 and Budget day was on 3 May 2002, thus pushing back the Parliamentary calendar and requiring interim funding under Article 148B (4) of the Constitution.",3,194,2016-04-11-T-002-S-00194

Perhaps, the Government could consider making public the projects that are commissioned under the PSB framework, from Mediacorp as well as from the independent production companies including details like durations and production budgets.

For example, the formation of smaller class sizes – I know we talked about class sizes in the COS debate when the Minister for Education spoke. I do not want to go into this now, but suffice to say that coming from the ground, it does make a difference when you teach subjects like design, to have smaller class sizes – admission based more on aptitude, passion and interest than aggregate at the various entry points; and the recruitment of design lecturers from the pool of design practitioners based on skill sets and experience, rather than educational and academic qualifications.",8,441,2016-04-11-T-003-S-00441

Over the years, our vernacular channels have contributed significantly to the development of bilingualism here. They allow Singaporeans to stay connected to our language, culture and communities.

Organisations and educational institutions will also be invited to take part in the pledging to get their staff and students to read. I am happy to announce that DBS, Temasek Polytechnic, UniSIM and the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME) are four organisations which have already given us their support to be part of this campaign.

The SGFuture sessions that NLB has organised so far – one in English and the other in Mandarin – have given us many good ideas on how to encourage more to read, such as books-on-the-go, ""gamifying"" reading, and having Reading Ambassadors for Mother Tongue languages. Some of these ideas are already being taken up by NLB. We will have another two SGFuture sessions coming up soon, in Malay and Tamil, and I look forward to hearing even more ideas from the public so that we can co-create solutions together.

I agree with him that there is great potential for the community to play an active part. Since 2011, the ""Singapore Memory Project"" has been a good platform for Singaporeans to share their memories and stories of Singapore. This has helped in understanding who we are and where we came from, and this will help to strengthen our national identity.

How many elderly Singaporeans are affected by the cessation of these services, and how many of them are on prepaid plans?",1,545,2016-04-11-T-003-S-00545
2016-04-11-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Secondly, for those on prepaid plans, they would likely see a rise in their bills when they re-contract as 2G services are the cheapest, and they would have no choice but to get on 3G or 4G plan when they re-contract. Would the Ministry consider a voucher or rebate scheme in conjunction with the telcos to assist these elderly Singaporeans?",2,546,2016-04-11-T-003-S-00546

The overall number is likely to be low. The total number of 2G users is less than 200,000. By some estimates, the number of elderly is probably less than a third of that. But it is actually hard to be sure because when the registrant is not always the user. It is small. I would like to reassure the Member that the agency is now working to reach out to these customers, the consumers, the operators to help the migration.",1,547,2016-04-11-T-003-S-00547

We do want to find a way to ensure that these elderly stay in touch. This is an important part of the connectivity. My understanding is that the customer has a 2G service and retains their plan, even if the device comes with a 3G SIM card, their current plan will continue. I need to go and look into this specific question that the Member has brought up, and I will do so.",2,548,2016-04-11-T-003-S-00548

With regards to PSB's content, with 40% being actually farmed out by Mediacorp to independent production companies, would the Ministry think about actually making the contract as well as the projects and the amounts public so that there is more transparency between the independent production community and the platforms? And the second question is, given what is happening in Iskandar and the rise of Pinewood Studios, how are we trying to encourage companies within the Mediapolis to step up and fare better with the competition?",1,550,2016-04-11-T-003-S-00550
2016-04-11-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Mdm Chair, I thank the Member for his questions. On the first question, indeed, a significant proportion – up to 40% of PSB through MediaCorp – can be outsourced and MediaCorp has been doing that to support local media companies. The process in which they do that is that they would call for proposals, and in addition to what Mediacorp does, we also have a contestable funding that we do separate of Mediacorp that could go to a range of different companies as well.",1,551,2016-04-11-T-003-S-00551

Whether there is Iskandar or not, I think we do need to build up capabilities, strengthen the production of local content, strengthen capabilities and develop effective channels because the competition is not just physically next door. It can come from as far as from Northeast Asia, across the Pacific from America.

2016-04-11-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Mdm Chair, I thank Mr Png for his questions. The use of dialect videos for Pioneer Generation Package has, indeed, been an effective communication tool. This has been used as part of the overall communication strategy in addition to the broadcast media, in addition to, very importantly, face-to-face interaction between our Pioneer Generation Ambassadors and the pioneers. That is what we want to try and do, which is to use a range of different channels and platforms and to customise the messages in a way which is simple to understand, is able to connect and use these platforms and these effective communication messages to reach out to different target audiences, whether it is the elderly, whether it is working adults, whether it is the young.

2016-04-11-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Next, I noticed that when it comes to Government public communications, the translation for materials and publicity for the Malay and Tamil languages always come later. So, I would assume that in doing translation, there would be separate teams and probably have different capacities. So, do we have a capacity issue that some of these translations for the Malay and Tamil language materials come much later and whether the Government has sufficient talent and resources to upkeep the standards of Malay and Tamil translations for Government materials?",2,558,2016-04-11-T-003-S-00558
2016-04-11-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Mdm Chair, I thank Mr Zaqy Mohamad for his questions. The first question on PSB, as I mentioned in my speech and also in my response to Mr Ganesh Rajaram, PSB is used to support our media industry, both Mediacorp as well as other local media companies. And we want to do this because in the end it is about being able to produce good quality Singapore content, and to be able to tell the Singapore story and to engage our audiences. This can be done by Mediacorp but it can also be done by other players, whether it is directly through the contestable funding or through Mediacorp.",1,559,2016-04-11-T-003-S-00559
2016-04-11-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"One important point I want to stress is this. Mediacorp plays a very critical role as our national broadcaster. While we do want to support the independent producers and we want to grow many of these local media companies, create good jobs for Singaporeans, I think it is also important that while we do that, we must provide the necessary support and resources to help Mediacorp to succeed because, as a national broadcaster, there are certain important roles that they play to shape the Singapore identity, spread Singapore values, heritage and culture. We should work not as zero sum game but how we can strengthen Mediacorp and strengthen the local media industry together.",2,560,2016-04-11-T-003-S-00560
2016-04-11-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"As to Mr Zaqy Mohamad's second point about translation, I think this is a challenge for all languages. It is an area which we are trying to build up. We do need more resources and capabilities in all three languages − Chinese, Malay and Tamil. And, in fact, our friends from the media will sometimes tell us that when we send out information, it is very often done in English and for the Chinese papers, the Malay papers, the Tamil papers, they have to spend quite a lot of time to do the translation. Within the Government, this is an area which we are trying to build up and we do want to, whether it is through scholarships or through other schemes, reach out to more young Singaporeans and get them to have an interest in translation.",3,561,2016-04-11-T-003-S-00561
2016-04-11-T-003,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"I am quite realistic. Translation is a specialised niche area. It is difficult for us to have large numbers but we do not need large numbers.

The young people themselves need to have some opportunity to expose themselves to what happens outside of our own market. That means that the companies that are operating either in the region or internationally need to be located here to provide these opportunities. So, there are multiple things that we need to do but it comes down to connecting the businesses here with opportunities in the region, connecting the people here with businesses that operate outside of Singapore and educating them as they develop their business, as they develop their start-ups think about the internationalisation strategy very, very early on in the process.

While we cleared cemeteries and backfilled mudflats to create living space over the years and build new towns, the question is, how much more and where? Eventually, we will reach a point of saturation. SERS we can do selectively but at greater cost. I, therefore, ask the Ministry to look to the far horizon, identify future sites early – be they greenfield sites, reclaimed sites, SERS sites – inform early, consult early, discuss widely, and plan prudently.

Some of these applicants might have run into financial difficulties or have personal problems which result in them having to sell their flats. A number of these applicants could have been co-owners for their parents' flats because their parents could not afford or run into difficulties servicing their mortgages. Later, when these applicants get married, they would be considered second timers, and by the time they wanted to upgrade or downgrade, they would be considered third-timers. Would the Ministry consider allowing them to do so, subject to the restriction that they can only sell the flat back to HDB?",5,626,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00626

It is especially difficult for second-timer families that are not eligible for the more generous first-timer grants and concessionary loans under HDB.

The key objective is to try to ease the woes of residents who have total strangers parking their vehicles, including large commercial vehicles, just outside their own homes.

2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"When I came to MND last year, many people told me I was going to a hot seat and wished me good luck. Indeed, housing has always been a hot-button issue, and as I was preparing for this COS, which is my first COS for MND, I went back to the Hansard to look at the records of previous years' debates. So, I did some extra homework. And indeed, from the start of our housing programme, going back to 1960s, there has been lively debate on the MND Budget and on housing issues. It is no different this year, if you look at the number of cuts we received.",2,720,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00720
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"But in fact, sentiments on housing have improved considerably after 2011. We ramped up BTO supply and cleared the first-timer backlog. We made new flats more affordable and we have managed a soft landing in the property market and HDB resale prices.",3,721,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00721
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Here, I would like to acknowledge the work of the MND team, especially the HDB officials who have worked very hard to ramp up our building programme over the past few years. And I also want to recognise all who have partnered us in this effort – our consultants, contractors, construction workers, as well as the many members of public who participated in our focus groups to give us feedback and helped shape our policies.",4,722,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00722
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"I think this demonstrates the importance of partnerships in the work we do. It applies not just to public housing and HDB, but also to the rest of our MND work, including our other statutory boards – AVA, BCA, CEA, NParks and URA.",5,723,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00723
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"There is a common thread across all that we do in MND, about building a better home in partnership with Singaporeans, and for all Singaporeans. As Mr Alex Yam said, it ultimately is about building communities, and it is our people who shape our sense of community and our sense of home. That is why over the past years, we have stepped up our engagement with Singaporeans to ""inform early, consult early, discuss widely"", as suggested by Mr Yam. We did this with our ""Our Singapore Conversation"" in 2013, continued with engagements on public housing over the past two years. We started our SGFuture dialogues this year to shape our next phase of development.",6,724,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00724
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Today, I will share some of the key priorities we have identified for MND based on these engagements. First, we will strengthen our home ownership programme to meet the needs of Singaporeans, especially the more vulnerable groups. Second, we will transform our urban landscape to invest in new infrastructure for our future economy and to build a future city that we can be proud of. Third, we will create a quality living environment for all to enjoy and make Singapore a more car-lite and people-friendly city.",7,725,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00725
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),Let me elaborate on each of these in turn.,8,726,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00726
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Firstly, in terms of strengthening our home ownership programme. This has always been the hallmark of our public housing system and we must and will continue to strengthen this key pillar of our social compact. Our focus is to help young couples own their first flat. Our pledge to young Singaporean couples is that we will always keep new BTO prices stable and affordable for them. That is why we enhanced our housing grants last year, and since then, many more homebuyers have benefited. One such couple is Mr See Cheng Long and his fiancÃ©e Miss Felicia Poh. They booked a 3-room flat in Bukit Batok in the BTO exercise last November. They were eligible for $60,000 in housing grants. And so they were able to buy the flat for less than $140,000.",9,727,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00727
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),This meant that the mortgage loan was completely paid for or will be completely paid for using their CPF. There is no need for any cash outlay and so they end up having more savings. I hope this gives them confidence to plan for the next step – to get married and hopefully to start a family soon.,10,728,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00728
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Our housing subsidies are rightly focused on the lower and middle-income households, but we have not neglected those in the higher income groups as well. Last year, we increased the income ceiling to enable more households at the higher-end to buy a subsidised flat.",11,729,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00729
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Mr Gan Thiam Poh suggested that we do away with the income ceiling altogether. I appreciate his intent to allow all Singaporeans to buy a HDB flat and that is something we would like to do as well. We want to move in this direction and that is why the income ceiling has been progressively moved up over time. But we have to calibrate these moves. Firstly, there are fiscal constraints to manage and secondly, having just made a move last year, we will need time for the increased new demand to flow through the system without adversely affecting the interest of the rest who are already in the queue.",12,730,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00730
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"At the same time, I want to assure Mr Gan that we will continue to take steps to ensure that Executive Condominiums (ECs) remain affordable. We already do so through various measures and that is why ECs today, are more affordable than comparable private properties. Indeed, if you look back over the past few quarters, EC prices have remained relatively stable. We will continue to monitor and take necessary action if needed.",13,731,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00731
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Besides housing grants, we have also shortened the queues considerably for first-timers. One measure of this is the application rate of first-timer families for new BTO flats in non-mature estates. It is an indicator which we monitor very carefully. This has remained stable at about 1.6 last year.",14,732,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00732
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"In practical terms, in practice, it means that most will be able to select their new BTO flat within their first or second application, and definitely on their third try. I understand Members have shared concerns about newlywed couples who have repeatedly applied for an HDB flat without success. I have heard similar experiences during my Meet-the-People sessions. In fact, one couple told me at MPS that they had applied more than five times! So, I asked for their details. I went back to HDB and asked for a check. I found out that they were, in fact, interested in flats near the city centre and so all their applications were for flats in mature estates around the city centre; for example, in Ang Mo Kio and Toa Payoh.",15,733,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00733
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"I have already announced that HDB will offer more flats in mature estates this year, for example, we have new projects in Bidadari and Tampines North. But there is a physical limit to how much more we can build in these already developed areas.",16,734,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00734
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"I would encourage first-timer couples to consider applying for flats in non-mature estates. As I have mentioned earlier, if you look at the application rate, there is a very high chance of them getting it within their first and second try, and definitely within their third try. And the flats there, in these estates are also more affordable. While waiting for the flats to be completed, they can consider renting a flat under the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS).",17,735,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00735
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"I recognise that some want a flat more urgently, or would prefer specific locations for good and practical reasons, for example, to live near their parents. In the current market, they can consider buying a resale flat. Resale prices have moderated and they are more affordable now. For example, you can compare HDB resale prices against household income.",18,736,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00736
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"At one time, prices were rising faster than income. But this is no longer the case. Between the last property market trough in 2009 and 2015, HDB resale prices increased by 35% but median household income increased by a higher 44%. So, housing affordability has improved and there are many attractive options available in the resale market.",19,737,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00737
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"In addition, we introduced the Proximity Housing Grant (PHG) which helps families who wish to live near or with their parents or married child to buy a resale flat. This means that a young couple can enjoy up to $90,000 in housing grants to buy their first home from the resale market – $30,000 in the CPF Housing Grant, up to $40,000 in Additional CPF Housing Grant, and $20,000 in the Proximity Housing Grant.",20,738,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00738
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),Miss Cheryl Chan asked if we can do more to help young married couples to get their flats early and live nearer to parents. I share her desire to do so and we will continue to study ways to help them further.,21,739,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00739
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We have also managed to reduce the queue for second-timer families and they too can benefit from the Proximity Grant. Here, I would like to share the experience of one couple, Mdm Nur Liza binte Roslan and Mr Yulandi bin Abu Bakar. They bought their first flat which was a 4-room flat at Taman Jurong from HDB. As their family grew, Mdm Nur Liza wanted to move out and move closer to her parents who are living in Bukit Batok, so that they can help look after the children. They looked at several housing options and eventually, they managed to find a 4-room resale flat in Bukit Batok on the same floor, just down the corridor from her parents' place. And so, with the Proximity Grant, they were able to buy the resale flat for about $324,000. This is in fact comparable to what they would have had to pay for a new 4-room flat from HDB as second-timers. In fact, they are better off by going to the resale market. The amount they pay is about the same as BTO after grant. They get a flat closer to parents and they get to move in earlier as well.",22,740,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00740
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"So for both first-timers and second-timers, the softening of the property market and the introduction of the new Proximity Grant and enhancements of all the various grant that we have had, means that there are many more attractive options to consider for purchasing a home.",23,741,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00741
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Likewise, there are also more housing options for singles. In 2013, we made a significant policy shift to allow first-timer singles to buy a new 2-room flat from HDB. Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked about this and I would like to assure her that we have launched more 2-room flats to meet this new demand from singles. We also increased the quota for singles from 30% to 50% last year. As a result, the BTO application rate among singles has been steadily improving. It started out very high, over 30 when we made the move in 2013. It came down to 8.5 last year, and it was 7.7 in the most recent BTO exercise.",24,742,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00742
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"I intend to bring down this application rate further. It will take time, but we will make it happen. The move to open new flats to singles is a significant one and has met with a strong demand surge. We will need some time to clear the bulk of this demand, but we will bring down the application rate.",25,743,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00743
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"In considering their home options, home buyers will have to do their homework, and they should evaluate carefully the different factors before making the purchase. Mr Chong Kee Hiong mentioned one concern about the lease of existing flats. He is right that like all leasehold properties, the value of an HDB flat will decline as leases run down. Flat buyers and home buyers have to take this into account in their financial planning. But for now, a large majority of flats have more than 60 years of lease remaining. They continue to be highly liveable, and the neighbourhoods will benefit from upgrading from time to time. There is still value in our resale flats. We will continue to find ways to help our elderly Singaporeans monetise the value of their flats in an orderly fashion and we will also publicise the schemes for doing so, as Members like Mr Alex Yam, Mr Faisal Manap and Mr Chen Show Mao have highlighted. The Minister of State Koh Poh Koon will elaborate on this later in his speech.",26,744,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00744
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"At the same time, whether buying a new BTO flat or a resale flat, there is a need to be financially prudent. We have homes for every budget – 3-room flat can vary from $180,000 for a BTO in Bukit Batok to $368,000 for a resale flat in Queenstown. My message to home buyers is this  we will do whatever we can to support you in your home ownership goals. But please choose a home that meets your needs and is within your means. I understand the desire to buy a large flat or one with a central location, but this should not come at the expense of a huge debt burden overwhelming the entire family.",27,745,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00745
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Having cleared the backlog for first-timers and made progress for singles and second-timers, we are now getting more requests for new flats to accommodate other buyer groups. For example, Mr Gan Thiam Poh suggested giving Singaporeans the chance to buy a third BTO flat. Now, I understand why people would like to buy a new flat from HDB. That is why we are allowing them to do so twice. We also have short-lease 2-room Flexi flats for seniors to buy a third flat from HDB. But I do not think we can go beyond that.",28,746,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00746
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"To allow a ""third bite of the housing cherry"" for all is not sustainable. And we have to be realistic. Our land is limited; our financial resources are finite. We must therefore prioritise among various home buyers. It is easy to give in to the demands and accommodate all the immediate requests and build as much as we can today and not think about tomorrow. But this would not be a responsible thing to do. We must consider the impact of our actions today on the next generation. We must always be mindful of the implications of over-building and consider how a glut of flats will have a negative impact on the value of homes for all Singaporeans",29,747,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00747
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"So we need to strike that balance and that balance includes looking at resale and new flats. This year, we are building 18,000 new flats. This is more than the previous year, and we have done so to accommodate the increased demand from recent policy changes. But we cannot continue at this rate perpetually. We intend to gradually taper down our building programme to achieve a more sustainable level over the medium term.",30,748,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00748
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Likewise, we are monitoring the property market very closely. Several Members spoke about this and called for a lifting of the cooling measures. Mr Christopher de Souza mentioned this earlier in the Budget debate. Mr Alex Yam and Mr Chong Kee Hiong suggested this earlier as well.",31,749,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00749
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Madam, our cooling measures have been effective in stabilising the property market. But it is too early to declare victory and unwind the measures. Any relaxation of the measures now may risk a premature market rebound and I am sure that is an outcome we all want to avoid. Nevertheless, we recognise that the property market is affected by the broader economy and global events. We are also very mindful that the property market in turn can have broader impact on other sectors of the economy. We are keeping a close watch and will be prepared to respond where needed.",32,750,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00750

2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Besides providing rental flats, we want to do more to help second-timers in public rental buy a home. For many of them, second-timer families in the rental flats, they are no longer eligible for housing grants; they are probably unable to get a bank loan and so they will face greater difficulties in moving out of their rental situation to have a home of their own. That is why we are introducing the Fresh Start Housing Scheme, and it is aimed at parents with school-going children, so that their children can grow up in a stable home environment.",35,753,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00753
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Let me share the key features of the scheme. First, the families who qualify will be able to buy a new 2-room flexi flat. The flat will come with shorter leases, ranging from 45 to 65 years, to keep the price affordable. It will also come with a longer Minimum Occupation Period (MOP), I think Mr Gan also suggested this just now. The longer MOP will be 20 years to ensure a stable home for the children.",36,754,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00754

They can use their CPF for the downpayment, and also for the mortgage payments.",37,755,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00755
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Third, we will help them with a Fresh Start Housing Grant of up to $35,000. The amount of grant will be pro-rated according to the lease of the flat they buy. Together, I believe these measures provide significant help for second-timer families in rental flats to own their own home again.",38,756,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00756
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"The scheme is not just about buying a new flat, but also about integrating financial assistance with personal responsibility and social support. To qualify for the scheme and receive the full grant, families will have to show commitment to remain in stable employment, manage their finances well, and ensure their children are attending school regularly. These are conditions that we have worked out through our consultations and they were also highlighted by several Members, including Mr Alex Yam earlier. In line with the efforts they make, the grant will correspondingly be disbursed in tranches over time  $20,000 will be given out when they collect their keys and the remainder will be disbursed annually over the next five years.",39,757,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00757

I am very mindful that these conditions should not be onerous. But at the same time, we are making a major move for these families by giving them another grant so I think it is fair that they must be able to show a certain level of commitment towards homeownership.

If along the way, some families encounter difficulties, the social agencies will be there to help them. We will consider their individual circumstances and the effort that they are making to meet the conditions. In doing so, we will not rely on just a single matrix or single criterion because we will exercise judgement and discretion and will look at it case by case.

But the key is this  they can now pay for this largely through their CPF. If you look at the illustration, the bulk of it will now be paid through CPF and their cash outlay is $10 a month. Ultimately, this will be their flat. It is not a rental flat. They will own this place. It is a comparable amount that they have to pay overall, but a large part of it is paid through CPF now, they would be able to own their own flat eventually.",1,762,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00762

2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Not all of them may choose to take up the scheme. It will depend on their individual finances and circumstances. The numbers may not be very big, but I believe the scheme can and will have a meaningful impact on the families that we are reaching out to.

We did it through systematic implementation over many terms of Government.",4,765,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00765
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Now, we must consider how we want to build our future city over the next 50 years. In some ways, it will be a more difficult journey because we are starting from a higher base with more biting resource constraints. The competition is also becoming more intense. We are in a new era of city competition. There are more than 400 cities in the world each with at least a million people. Among them are many emerging world cities, all vying for talent and investments. There is intense competition. We are starting from a higher base, but we cannot afford to stand still. We should take comfort that we are moving from a position of strength. Despite our limitation of size, we are far from saturation. There are still many possibilities for urban development and transformation.",5,766,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00766
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Members will know that we are consolidating our port at Tuas and this would free up more land for redevelopment at the Greater Southern waterfront. How much land will it free up? That parcel there is about three times the size of Marina Bay. I am not saying that we are going to build three Marina Bays there, but it is to give a context that it is three times the size of Marina Bay.",6,767,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00767
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We are expanding Changi Air Hub with a new Terminal 5 and relocating Paya Lebar over at Changi. Again, this will free up 800 ha of prime land for mixed-use development. What does that mean? Again, in comparison, that is equivalent to half a Jurong Industrial estate, one Ang Mo Kio Town and two Tampines Regional Centres. I am not saying we are going to do that. But this is the perspective of what kind of scale we have, and the mix of uses can vary because we have to plan and think through what plans we want to do with this land that is freed up.",7,768,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00768
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Over the next 10-20 years, we will be building up several regional nodes. We have the second CBD at Jurong Lake District which will also be the site for the high speed rail terminus to KL. We have a new Creative Cluster at Punggol, together with the new SIT campus. We have a new Northern Growth corridor at Woodlands and Sembawang, with many opportunities to transform the waterfront for new jobs and homes.",8,769,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00769

2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But development plans that are based on assumptions may not always pan out or the assumptions may not always pan out, or they may take time to be staged. It is easy to criticise our civil servants for ""poor town planning"", as Mr Dennis Tan said earlier in the Budget debate. But I think that is not being fair to them and the work that they do. At the end of the day, what is important is the ability to continually update our urban plans to keep pace with the needs of society. That is the approach we take in our HDB estates.",12,773,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00773
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For existing towns, we are continually upgrading and rejuvenating them through various upgrading programmes. Senior Minister of State Desmond Lee will elaborate on them later. For new housing areas, we learn from our past experience and we are developing HDB estates and towns with distinctive character. We pay attention to the history and heritage of the place, we provide for beautiful greenery, beautiful blue spaces, and neighbourhood amenities. And you can see these in all our new projects, be it in Bidadari, Punggol or Tampines North.",13,774,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00774
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Soon, we will be opening up a new HDB town called Tengah. That is next to the Jurong Innovation District. You have seen the slides and the video that Mr Heng Swee Keat showed on the Jurong Innovation District. Tengah will be just next to it. It is an area surrounded by greenery. We will plan this as a ""Forest Town"". It will be integrated with nature and also the nearby Jurong Innovation District. I am not going to do an extended sales pitch here in Parliament. You can see a picture of what Tengah can be. This is just one picture [A slide was shown to hon Members]. I have seen many more plans, pictures and visualisations of what our planners are doing. I think it will be a very exciting place to live, work and play. HDB will release more details in due course.",14,775,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00775
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Finally, a key priority for us is to make Singapore a more car-lite and people-friendly city. Cities are centres of economic activity, but they are first and foremost places where people meet, interact and connect with one another. That is even more important for us in Singapore, where we only have one city, which is our country and our home. As we transform our city, we must make this place more sustainable, more beautiful, and more invigorating to the human spirit.",15,776,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00776

2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I am also glad that Mr Saktiandi Supaat shared the example of the Novena Health City. I think this is one area which we have planned for a comprehensive coverage of underground pedestrian links, street-level walkways and elevated link-bridges. It is a good example of what we are striving to achieve. Indeed, we have similar plans for other areas too – in the CBD, in Jurong Lake District and in all our regional centres.",18,779,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00779
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"To further bolster these efforts, LTA and URA will be introducing a new requirement for developers. This new requirement will make sure that developers incorporate the needs of pedestrians and cyclists upfront in their development plans. For example, developers will have to review the locations of the vehicular access points to minimise conflict with pedestrians and cyclists, taking into account key pedestrian and cyclist access routes, and the location of bicycle parking facilities. This is especially critical for developments with high footfall like our schools, shopping malls, office buildings and business parks. Through these requirements, we will ensure that our built environment is more conducive for pedestrians and cyclists",19,780,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00780
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Besides new developments, I agree with Mr Ang Wei Neng that we need to do more for greater connectivity in existing buildings. In fact, I am not sure if Mr Ang heard this earlier, because we had a debate when Dr Tan Wu Meng moved an adjournment motion on this. I had shared earlier in the House that we are studying and reviewing legislation to allow us to mandate existing developments to receive new elevated and underground links. Once this is in place, we plan to get more pedestrian connections along Orchard Road and other areas as well.",20,781,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00781
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"What do we hope to achieve with all of these changes? How can be we a better, more attractive city for walking and cycling? Let me paint a picture of what we can see in the future. First, within every HDB estate, we will have more dedicated paths for active mobility, be it walking, jogging, cycling or the use of other personal mobility devices. This will enhance our first-mile/last-mile connectivity to MRT stations. Our newer housing areas, such as Bidadari, Punggol and Tampines North, are already designed with these paths. For existing towns, we will progressively improve the infrastructure through our upgrading programmes.",21,782,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00782
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Here is one example in Bedok Town, which I will show on the slide, where a comprehensive cycling and walking network of approximately 14 km will be completed next year. This will allow better connectivity to MRT stations, major employment areas, parks, schools as well as the Neighbourhood Centres. Intra-HDB towns, new ones, we will do it upfront; existing ones, we will do so through upgrading progressively. We will have a very well connected route of dedicated walking, cycling paths within each HDB town.",22,783,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00783
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Next, we will also have active mobility routes that connect our residential towns to our city centre. This will enable people to get to their workplaces without having to drive. For a start, we are looking at towns that are within a 30-minute cycling distance to the city; so we have identified six possible routes to the city, as shown in the map [A slide was shown to hon Members].",23,784,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00784
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"These cover connections from towns and estates in various regions  from the east such as Geylang and Marine Parade; northeast such as Hougang and Macpherson, and the west such as Queenstown and Bukit Merah. These routes are largely already in place today. These are not new routes because they are largely in place today through our Park Connectors. If you actually travel through one of these routes or take a cycling ride through one of these routes, you will realise that they are not fully seamless, and there are some gaps along the way. We intend to plug these gaps, so that the routes can be seamless and they can better connect our HDB towns to the city centre.",24,785,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00785
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I give an example of the Bishan to City route which runs along the Kallang River. Today, if you take that route, as a cyclist or jogger, you will have to traverse several pedestrian overhead bridges and underpasses, and the biggest obstacle is that you have to cross the PIE. So, it is very difficult if you want to cycle down that route to the city. You have to dismount, go up the pedestrian overhead bridge, underpass, and then you have to find some way to get round the PIE.",25,786,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00786
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"URA has initiated a consultancy study to look at possible solutions to bridge these gaps. So, this is just one possibility of how something can be done to bridge the gap. [A slide was shown to hon Members] This is across Serangoon Road, a potential bridge that you can cycle through Serangoon Road. So, if we are able to smoothen out these different kinks in the route, say, with potential links like this, then residents staying in Bishan, Bidadari, Toa Payoh would have a more direct and seamless travelling experience, whether it is through walking, cycling or any other personal mobility device, from their HDB towns to the city centre. This is an example, conceptually, of what we are looking at, how we can enhance connections from HDB towns to the city centre.",26,787,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00787
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,We will also look at active mobility routes within the city centre itself. And here we can have potential for wider pedestrian sidewalks and dedicated cycling and walking paths as well. These will connect to the major office developments. Some of these pathways in Marina Bay have already been implemented and we will continue to do more in other parts of the CBD.,27,788,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00788

2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The infrastructure is important, but we must certainly go beyond infrastructure planning to embrace a car-lite mindset.

MOT will be sharing more about this in its COS later.",29,790,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00790
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We also need strategies to better manage the use of cars. One way is to facilitate more car sharing schemes. It can be through electric vehicles, as suggested by Mr Ong Teng Koon. Our agencies are studying this, as well as the charging infrastructure that may be needed to facilitate the take-up of such electric vehicles.",30,791,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00791
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Car park charges are another important lever that we can use. I know Mr Lim Biow Chuan has called for more free parking in car parks. But free parking is not really free. Free parking is a subsidy to the motorists that is paid for by non-motorists. It is not really free parking. It is a subsidy to motorists. In fact, our car park charges are generally lower than most other major cities. Perhaps, we should not be thinking about lowering car park charges or making them free, but we may even have to look at raising car park charges if we want to move in the direction of a car-lite city.",31,792,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00792
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But the specific concerns raised by Mr Lim is, I think, about the availability of lots which are being used up for commercial vehicles today, or it is really about how we can provide for more lots for commercial vehicles in residential areas, so that they will not have to park next to his residents' homes. We have to look at that more specifically and find other ways to address this issue.",32,793,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00793
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, I recognise that it will take time to bring about this mindset shift towards a car-lite Singapore. That is why we have started by pedestrianising our vehicular roads, where possible, to create car-free zones, be it on weekends or even on a permanent basis.

We have it at the Civic District and the CBD area and there has been a tremendous response to this. We are also expanding car-free zones to streets all over Singapore. Currently, if you look at our city centre, there are 18 streets which are closed for pedestrians to use on a regular basis, such as during weekends. These are marked out in the map, in addition to our Car-free zones on Sunday.",34,795,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00795
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"With more support from the community, we can do more in other areas as well. In fact, recently, additional roads have been closed for car-free events – Jalan Pisang, Keong Saik and Armenian Street. We want to do more, not just in the city but also beyond the city, so that we can have more pedestrianised and car-free zones in our HDB estates as well.",35,796,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00796
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"How do we decide which roads to close or which streets to activate? It is not done centrally by URA. It is really based on ground-up feedback and proposals. For example, I visited Kampong Glam recently on one of the car-free weekends, trying to revisit my childhood with the kids skipping. I think I can still keep up with the kids because if you look at the picture, I am the one who is jumping amongst the highest. [Laughter]",36,797,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00797

It is a completely ground-up initiative by the stakeholders there, the business owners. They decided to do it and URA supported them. The feedback has been very positive. The business owners reported an increase in sales due to higher footfall and the public also enjoyed the bustling street life.",37,798,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00798

We will assist them to streamline regulatory approvals from Government agencies and we will provide seed funding to get the ideas implemented on the ground. I hope that in time, a network of like-minded volunteers and civic partners will grow through this programme. This will help us catalyse a broader movement to get Singaporeans involved in shaping our streets and public spaces.

Taking ownership of the spaces we live in is what makes a house a home. So, as we take our first step towards SG100, let us make this a journey of closer partnerships. Let us work together to build a better home with our families and a better community with our neighbours and fellow Singaporeans.

2016-04-11-T-004,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"One, review the terms and conditions of all land sales and qualifying certificate for developers. The land sales' terms and conditions such as project completion period, extension premium scheme, use of Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction (PPVC) method, and the need to sell all dwelling units in a housing development within two years from TOP have increased development risks and construction costs correspondingly.",5,877,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00877

2016-04-11-T-004,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"One major bugbear of LUP can be found at Block 314, Hougang Ave 5.

With the landing valve of the dry riser sticking out substantially, the clear width of the entrance of the lift landing was further reduced at about the shoulder height level. Taken as a whole, the lift landing bridge at Block 314 does not comply with SCDF's requirements as the entrance does not have the 1.2 metre clear width.",5,889,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00889
2016-04-11-T-004,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"I thank the HDB team for trimming the cement base and re­orientating the landing valve of the dry riser to widen the width of the lift landing entrance at Block 314, but the fact remains that such measures were needed goes to show that some LUP designs need to go beyond just meeting statutory requirements.",6,890,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00890
2016-04-11-T-004,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"In the case at Block 314, the new lift landing bridge meets the requirement but it is located right next to a dry riser and a resident's flat. Affected residents can no longer leave their gates open or leave their shoes outside their doorway as that will also cause obstruction at the entrance of the lift landing. These residents do not even have any space left to put a simple shoe rack any more.",7,891,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00891

Is there any room for HDB to make good the bad designs as residents have to live with the consequences, day in day out?

2016-04-11-T-004,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"Thank you, Sir. The Aljunied-Hougang Town Council currently manages 1,760 lifts in HDB estates, out of which 470 are new lifts installed under the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) being turned on from 2012 onwards. Based on the figures gathered for lift breakdown in FY15/16, there were 3,683 breakdowns in total or 7.84 breakdowns per lift on average.",1,895,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00895
2016-04-11-T-004,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),This is a relatively high breakdown rate considering these new lifts are barely three years old. I am not sure whether this happens only in Aljunied-Hougang Town or across the board. I would like to urge MND to take a look at the quality of the LUP lifts.,2,896,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00896
2016-04-11-T-004,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"Next, with the growth in the numbers of lifts contributed by the LUP, the expenditure on lift maintenance for each year is also rising. In the case of Aljunied-Hougang TC, the latest revision in maintenance contracts by the original lift manufacturers will result in a cost increase of between 4.08% and 8.52%. The projected upward revision in maintenance rates beyond 2017 is even higher, estimated to be between 8.66% and 10.72%.",3,897,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00897
2016-04-11-T-004,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"I believe that moving forward, lift maintenance will be a heavy financial burden on all the Town Councils. Hence, I request MND to consider providing a special grant for lift maintenance.",4,898,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00898
2016-04-11-T-004,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"Finally, new lifts are designed by different lift manufacturers with their unique features and parts, especially the motherboard.

2016-04-11-T-004,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"I suggest HDB considers a standardised lift design for HDB estates to require manufacturers to produce lifts based on a standard design and make the standardised lift parts, so that both electronic and mechanical parts will be readily available.

Since 1997, we have heard about the idea of pneumatic conveyance systems for waste disposal in our HDB estates, brought up in this House by the then Minister for Environment, Mr Yeo Cheow Tong.

2016-04-11-T-004,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"I would like to seek an update on this, as pneumatic waste conveyance systems would be a huge productivity improvement over having to manually empty individual bulk bin inside each bin chute every day. Such a system can afford all Town Councils not only in better productivity but also savings in manpower costs. It is environmentally sustainable and gets rid of the problem of foul smells during refuse collection.",8,902,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00902
2016-04-11-T-004,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"In June 2015, HDB said it would test-bed this pneumatic system in Yuhua.

Can the Ministry comment on how feasible it will be to roll out the system to other HDB estates, especially the older ones?",9,903,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00903
2016-04-11-T-004,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"It appears that upcoming HDB projects at Tampines North, Bidadari and Punggol Northshore will also have the same system.

However, concerns persist and I would like to reflect my residents' sentiments in this House. For instance, if the ceiling at the lower floor unit faces a leak or has signs of leakage such as distinct watermark or a blotted patch, no repair works would be done to the damaged ceiling. Only the source of the leak located at the upper floor would be rectified but upon the completion of the repair works, both flat owners, the upper floor as well as the lower floor, will each be billed 25% of the total repair cost. This is not fair to the lower floor home owners.",2,906,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00906
2016-04-11-T-004,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"As a Member who represents a mature estate, I have regularly received feedback on the wear and tear to the ceiling in the unit. In fact, a resident who is staying in the lower floor unit said to me that in order to make repairs to her unit, she had to fork out additional costs. She is of the view that the repair of this damaged ceilings and its consequent repair costs should be included in the GRA scheme as the damage of their unit's ceiling should be the joint responsibility of both owners in accordance to the spirit of this particular policy.",3,907,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00907
2016-04-11-T-004,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,I am in agreement with her on this. The present policy has good intention but we must be careful not to allow one set of family feeling short-changed and left out.,4,908,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00908

2016-04-11-T-004,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"The exact source of the hot spring remains unknown. Hot springs are formed when under groundwater enters the earth's crust as deep as 3 kilometres underground, and get heated up to high temperatures by the hot rock masses. The high pressure causes the hot boiling water to seep upwards through cracks, thereby forcing itself out of ground into a spring. At this point, the temperature of the water drops to about 70 degrees.",2,910,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00910
2016-04-11-T-004,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"There is an interesting history to our hot spring. In 1909, Seah Eng Keong, the son of pioneer Seah Liang Seah, had discovered hot springs in his pineapple estate and channelled the springs altogether so they could be concentrated in one area. A well was built along the spring and became popular with the villagers. The village was then known as Kampong Ayer Panas, means ""Village of Hot Water"".",3,911,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00911

2016-04-11-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Firstly, the current ROS requires 100% support from the neighbourhood shops for the upgrading to proceed, not a single less. Although we have Merchant Associations to bring the heartland shops together, not all act in unison. Very often, there will be one or two shops that are less cooperative, especially for shop owners who lease the shops to other tenants. They are basically investors who are more concerned about rental income than neighbourhood upgrading. As a result, the upgrading programme cannot proceed because of them. Thus, I hope the Minister can take into consideration the interest of the majority of the shop owners and patrons, and adopt the model for Home Improvement Programme on the use of polling. Perhaps we can consider amending the law, so that merchant associations only need to obtain support from 75% of shop owners for the upgrading to proceed.",4,932,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00932
2016-04-11-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Secondly, wages and construction costs have gone up in recent years, and the cost of upgrading has increased in tandem. However, government grants for upgrading have remain the same. As a result, the ROS has become increasingly unattractive. Since the Government is committed to helping revitalise neighbourhood shops, I hope the Minister can help merchant associations by doubling the grant to S$20,000 per shop.",5,933,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00933
2016-04-11-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"In response to my plea last year in Parliament, MND agreed to set up a new Revitalise Heartland Shops Committee, chaired by then SMS Mr Lee Yi Shyan, to review and refine the Revitalisation of Shops (ROS) scheme. I was invited to join the committee and had several meetings with shop owners, grassroots organisations and HDB. We have received a lot of valuable feedback but there was no conclusive decision. So I hope the Minister can give our shop owners a reply in Parliament today. Thank you.",6,934,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00934
2016-04-11-T-004,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong,"Chairman, many of our private estates are at least 30 years old with many elderly residents. The Estate Upgrading Programme (EUP) is necessary to prevent many of the shared public areas from degenerating into safety and health hazards. I would like to request for upgrading works to be sped up.",1,935,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00935
2016-04-11-T-004,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong,Fences or railings to separate pavements from open drains will be helpful to prevent falls into the drains. Old walk paths and open drains may be pitted and become breeding grounds for mosquitoes after rain. New widened footpaths with ramps will be welcomed by wheelchair or stroller users. Public playgrounds and exercise areas may need renovation so that they remain safe for users.,2,936,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00936
2016-04-11-T-004,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong,"In the event that EUP could not be sped up, the waiting time for upgrade for these old estates could take several years. Can areas that need urgent repairs for safety reasons such as covering up of open drains to create wider footpaths be sped up under a special fund or programme? Thank you.",3,937,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00937
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Sir, in the course of my presentation, may I have your permission to show some slides?",1,938,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00938

2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Sir, I will focus on three areas. First, working with the community to rejuvenate and transform our heartlands; second, enhancing greenery in our City in a Garden; and third, partnering the construction industry to transform the way we build our city.",1,940,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00940
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Let me start with the first. Minister Lawrence Wong earlier described how newer HDB towns, such as Bidadari, Tampines North and Tengah, will be better designed. At the same time, we have been Remaking Our Heartland, under a programme started in 2007 with that name, to rejuvenate and transform our older estates.",2,941,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00941
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"At Dawson Estate in Queenstown, one of our oldest HDB towns, new public housing is set within a park environment. But heritage elements of old Dawson are being preserved. For example, the former wet market at Block 38 Commonwealth Avenue has been conserved and will be refurbished to house retail shops.",3,942,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00942
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Over in Yishun, residents can look forward to a new integrated development comprising  shops, an air-conditioned bus interchange, a community club and town plaza, all of which will add greater buzz to the town centre.",4,943,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00943
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In Bedok, with the Outdoor Play Corridor, residents and park users will be able to cycle seamlessly from East Coast Park, through the Bedok Town Centre, all the way to the Bedok Reservoir by next year.",5,944,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00944
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"If you have been to Jurong East recently, you would have seen the transformation of the Jurong Gateway area, with the opening of commercial malls next to the MRT station; and two hospitals, Ng Teng Fong Hospital and Jurong Community Hospital. The Jurong Lake Gardens West, part of our third National Gardens, will also be completed in two years' time.",6,945,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00945
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Miss Cheryl Chan suggested that agencies involve local communities more during town design, especially for mature towns. We fully recognise this. Last year, we shared our plans to rejuvenate Woodlands, Pasir Ris and Toa Payoh under the Remaking Our Heartland 3 programme.",7,946,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00946
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Over the course of one year, HDB connected with some 400 residents and local stakeholders in these towns to consult them on preliminary concepts.",8,947,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00947
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"It was a very fruitful exercise. Some residents from Woodlands hoped that their town remains green, and asked for a larger community space within Woodlands Central. Pasir Ris residents requested for a rejuvenated Town Centre and for the existing parks and commercial spaces to be upgraded. Toa Payoh residents desired a balance between older and newer developments, and for a greener and even more senior-friendly environment.",9,948,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00948
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"HDB has been refining the proposals based on these ideas and suggestions. The preliminary proposals are exciting, and cover three broad themes – namely, Identity, Public Spaces and Connectivity. Let me briefly elaborate.",10,949,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00949
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For Woodlands Town, residents can look forward to a transformed Woodlands Waterfront with interesting landscaping. In addition, within Woodlands Central, there will be a town plaza, which will offer a sizeable space for various large scale activities, including those for the community.",11,950,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00950
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For Pasir Ris, we plan to introduce a mixed-use development integrated with a new bus interchange in the town centre and upgrade the parks in the town.",12,951,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00951
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In Toa Payoh, we are looking to revamp the pedestrian mall in Toa Payoh Town Centre, with more greenery, rest areas and covered shopping streets at selected stretches, for residents to enjoy, even when it rains. We will also introduce dedicated cycling paths throughout the town to improve connectivity.",13,952,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00952
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Let me now move on to our HDB shops and the Revitalisation of Shops Scheme (ROS), which a number of Members have asked about. Since 2007, the scheme has benefitted about half of all HDB shops in town and neighbourhood centres, with upgraded shop fronts and funding support for business promotional activities.",14,953,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00953
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Last year, we announced that we would revise or review the ROS scheme. HDB shops play an important role in building our heartland communities, and we want to support them better. As Mr Saktiandi said, they make our estates a much livelier place to live in. They are where we buy our daily necessities and groceries, where we get our nasi lemak, chicken rice or kopi-o. The shopkeepers in our heartlands are often familiar faces that we grow up with.",15,954,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00954
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In carrying out the review, we consulted the heartland retail community. We set up the Revitalisation of Heartland Shops Committee comprising representatives from various Merchants Associations (MAs), retailers and grassroots organisations, to tap on their experience.",16,955,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00955
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We also conducted focus group discussions with MAs across the island, to hear their views. I thank the Committee, previously under the leadership of Mr Lee Yi Shyan, for their many suggestions. We have evaluated the suggestions carefully, and this is what we plan to do.",17,956,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00956
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"First, for upgrading works under Revitalisation of Shops (ROS), we will adjust the co-funding ratio between Government, the HDB shopkeeper and the Town Council. What this means is that our shopkeepers pay less, while Government and Town Councils pay more.",18,957,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00957
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Second, we will provide some start-up funding to support the formation of new Merchants' Associations.",19,958,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00958
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"HDB will announce the details before launching the next batch of ROS soon. Our review is still continuing, and there may be more in the pipeline. So, for instance, we are collaborating with MTI and SPRING to explore other areas of support for our local HDB heartland shops.",20,959,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00959
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We are also studying very carefully, whether to introduce a requirement for polling for ROS upgrading. Let me explain. Mr Ang makes a valid point that one of the challenges preventing higher take-up of ROS upgrading is the need for unanimous, or near unanimous support from shopkeepers or shop owners before upgrading works can commence.",21,960,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00960
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"One possible solution is to set a threshold – so if a certain percentage of shop owners polled want ROS upgrading, then this binds all the shops in the neighbourhood centre.",22,961,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00961
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"On the other hand, some retailers have also shared that upgrading works are less useful to them. And therefore, while they understand that it could benefit other retailers and residents, they were less inclined to support the programme. So, we are looking carefully at whether we should make legislative amendments to make polling a requirement.",23,962,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00962
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Miss Cheryl Chan said we should ensure a right mix of businesses in the heartlands, and asked whether SMEs and start-ups can be encouraged to set up shops there.",24,963,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00963
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In fact, we are already seeing a trend of an increasing number of young entrepreneurs setting up shops in the heartlands, such as ice cream parlours, artisan bakeries and hipster cafes. HDB is also partnering MTI and SPRING to tap current schemes to better support these young entrepreneurs.",25,964,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00964
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Let me now move on to the second of my three points. Sir, as we rejuvenate our heartlands and develop our urban spaces, we must also remember that we are special, because we are a City in a Garden.",26,965,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00965
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Not only do we have an extensive network of parks and park connectors, we have also incorporated greenery wherever we can, from walls to rooftops, to make it pervasive.",27,966,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00966
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"But we can do even better. Let me outline, briefly, some ways. First, we will make our parks more community-centric. In the next few years, we will continue to roll-out inclusive playgrounds in our parks. They enable all kids to have fun together, whether they are physically able or have disability. The first was launched last year at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, with the support of the National Council of Social Services. NParks will launch eight more in the next few years.",28,967,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00967
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We will also use greenery as therapy, especially for seniors. A study conducted by NParks and the National University Health System (NUHS) showed improved mental health in participants who participated in ""horticultural therapy"". Seniors and their caregivers can look forward to an upcoming network of therapeutic gardens, with contemplative spaces and activity zones, to support dementia and post-stroke patients.",29,968,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00968
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Second, with rapid urbanisation, we recognise that Singaporeans are also concerned about green spaces rich in our cultural and natural heritage. One such space is the Rail Corridor. Ms Low Yen Ling had asked about URA's plans for the development of the old Bukit Timah Fire Station as a key attraction and gateway to the Rail Corridor.",30,969,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00969
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Indeed, the winning proposal for URA's Request for Proposals last year shows how we can sensitively adapt the former Bukit Timah Fire Station as a hub for nature activities, providing seamless access to the nearby Nature Parks and the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve.",31,970,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00970
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As we implement these plans, we want to involve people who live, work and play along the Corridor, and create opportunities for them to lead community-based initiatives along the Rail Corridor.",32,971,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00971
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"This is why URA recently embarked on an unprecedented effort to consult residents along the Rail Corridor, from Tanjong Pagar Railway Station in the south to Kranji in the north, through a series of local exhibitions and dedicated workshops.",33,972,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00972
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Residents told us about the types of trails and landscapes they wanted to see, and how to retain its rustic character while making improvements, so it can be enjoyed by all Singaporeans. Many workshop participants also tried their hand at master-planning, drawing out their own ideas for each area. So, different residents with different interests had to debate, discuss with each other and then decide on what to put where, what to have, what not to have.",34,973,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00973
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"With such localised feedback, URA and the designers will review and refine our current plans to make the Rail Corridor an inclusive green space, with the community as active stewards.",35,974,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00974
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Another is the Sembawang Hot Springs. Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked if it can be developed into a park. As he rightly pointed out, the springs have an interesting history and are currently on MINDEF land. We are studying if we can sensitively enhance the area, in line with existing natural features, heritage and land use. Where possible, we want to retain and enhance such places, with the community, for everyone to enjoy.",36,975,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00975
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Beyond creating new green spaces with the community, we also want to support ground-up greening efforts. Today, we have about 1,000 Community in Bloom (CIB) gardens and 20,000 community gardeners.",37,976,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00976
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Some of these gardeners have gone the extra mile, contributing their harvests to disadvantaged families in the neighbourhood. Others use the gardens as an outdoor classroom to teach the younger generation about nature and how life used to be in the past, passing down knowledge and values along the way.",38,977,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00977
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The CIB programme is no longer just about spreading the love of gardening, but also the spirit of neighbourliness. They are about how communities come together to generate a greater social good.",39,978,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00978
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We have seen organic communities form at other parks too – brisk-walkers, joggers, exercise groups, cyclists, nature lovers, heritage buffs, educators and so no. That is why NParks launched the Friends of the Park scheme two weeks ago. Through this, volunteers can be even more involved in our parks, for example, by organising their own activities and partnering NParks in park management.",40,979,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00979
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We are happy to have some of our long-time volunteers step up to lead these communities. For example, Mr Sivasothi will chair the community for the Friends of Chestnut Nature Park, which we just opened. Well-known in the nature fraternity, he has been volunteering for over 20 years, conducting coastal clean-ups and nature walks and is also an avid cyclist. We are grateful to have him on-board. Over time, I believe we will see more people like him coming forward to jointly create and sustain a green and liveable environment for all Singaporeans.",41,980,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00980
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Coming to the third plank of my speech, Sir, this spirit of partnership, which I spoke about earlier, to rejuvenate our heartlands and enhance our green spaces also extends to our on-going efforts to transform our built environment sector and how we will build our city of the future.",42,981,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00981
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Over the years, we have progressively raised the professionalism, safety and quality in the sector through initiatives such as licensing builders, regulating buildability and raising workmanship quality through CONQUAS and Quality Mark. From 2010, we have also put in significant effort and resources to raise construction productivity.",43,982,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00982
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The transformation that we are seeking is slowly taking shape. The level of prefabrication for building structural systems and wall systems has increased significantly. Safety and quality will also be enhanced with more prefabrication. Site productivity or the amount of floor area completed per man day, has steadily increased by an average of 1.3% per year since 2009. In fact, for the last two years, we saw a 2% annual improvement. While this is positive, we should make a big push for even higher productivity gains over the next five years.",44,983,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00983
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Our vision of the future built environment sector is one that is efficient and collaborative, where industry stakeholders jointly go through the design and construction of a project in virtual reality first to finalise details and minimise abortive works. The building components are then manufactured and prefinished offsite in factories and then transported onsite for clean and quiet assembly. Meanwhile, autonomous drones are used to complete other tasks concurrently.",45,984,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00984
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Our built environment sector of the future will be one that is highly advanced, highly skilled and highly integrated.

2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As both Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Dr Teo Ho Pin have rightly pointed out, the Government has to very closely partner the industry and the entire ecosystem, if we are to effectively change the way we build, because there are different industry players involved in every project – developers, consultants, architects, contractors, sub-contractors – and there are many moving pieces. Jobs will have to be redesigned and processes will have to evolve or change, as part of the transformation. Critically, there needs to be more collaboration between key stakeholders, upstream, as Er Dr Lee Bee Wah quite rightly pointed out. Everyone has to play their part and be prepared to break out of our comfort zones.",47,986,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00986

2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"NTU's North Hill Hostel and OUE's Crowne Plaza Extension were the first projects to adopt Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction (PPVC) in Singapore. Such projects can be built quite quickly, with less disamenity to people living and working in the surroundings because the modules, the entire rooms so to speak, are prefabricated, sometimes with all finishes and fittings complete, before being brought on to site for installation.",49,988,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00988
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"But besides PPVC, there are many other productive technologies on the DFMA spectrum that the industry can adopt, as Er Dr Lee mentioned.

2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"At the same time, we recognise that there are challenges. Workforce upgrading, regulatory hurdles and logistics issues are some of the teething problems that the early adopters have faced. We value the industry's feedback and will do what we can to help the industry quickly overcome this learning curve. So, let me share some of the work in progress.",51,990,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00990
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"First, we have set up the Construction Productivity and Capability Fund (CPCF), and set aside a total of $885 million, over two tranches, to help firms raise their capability in the immediate term.",52,991,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00991
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Today, over 8,000 firms have already tapped this fund to either invest in more productive technologies, mechanise their processes or up-skill their workforce. BCA has also formulated a Sectoral Manpower Plan to ensure that future manpower demand can be met. With the support of our firms, we will continue to attract, retain and upgrade our workforce.",53,992,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00992
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For example, companies can partner BCA in its suite of scholarship and sponsorship programmes which aims to bring in new Singaporean entrants to the Built Environment Sector. More than 2,000 students and jobseekers have been brought in through these programmes since 2010.",54,993,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00993
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Further, through our Earn and Learn Programmes under SkillsFuture, our diploma and ITE graduates can continue learning while working, through on-the-job training, mentorship and upgrading courses. BCA also works closely with the industry associations such as SCAL to conduct regular Productivity Clinics since 2011. About 350 companies have benefitted from these one-on-one sessions with BCA as they embarked on their productivity journey.",55,994,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00994
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To encourage the wider adoption of DFMA and Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) and smoothen their implementation, we have taken the lessons learnt from the early adopters and set up a taskforce to look at building up an ecosystem. Dr Teo Ho Pin spoke earlier about having a whole-of-ecosystem steering committee. Here, we have set up a taskforce to drive the entire ecosystem. The industry will be consulted on its recommendations as part of the process.",56,995,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00995
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We have also reviewed regulatory requirements where necessary. For example, SCDF has relaxed height requirements for the majority of Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) building-use types from 12 metres to 24 metres. To facilitate optimal design for prefabrication and modularisation, LTA is reviewing requirements for the escort of oversized loads being transported, without compromising road safety.",57,996,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00996
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We are also considering setting aside land for PPVC production in Singapore.

A Construction Productivity R&D Roadmap is currently being developed together with industry players and will be launched in the second half of this year. Promising areas include 3-D printing, robotics, info-comm technology (ICT) and data analytics in the built environment sector. The Roadmap will help guide our R&D efforts for the sector and can provide valuable insights to the Committee on the Future Economy.",59,998,2016-04-11-T-004-S-00998

2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Let me now briefly address the remaining cuts. On the Lift Upgrading Programme, Mr Png Eng Huat had mentioned some concerns at Block 314. I presume it is in his area. Please raise it to HDB or to MND so that we can have a better look at it. Mr Low Thia Khiang spoke about lift maintenance, lift parts and about lift breakdowns. On the point on lift breakdowns, there is a tele-monitoring system in every lift in HDB, which provides data remotely to the Town Council, so you can establish what the cause of the fault is. So, I would urge the hon Member to take a look at the Town Council data and have a sense as to what the causes of these frequent breakdowns are. Some of it could be the nature of the use of the lift, some of it could be the frequency of Town Council's maintenance regime or the capability and the competence of the engineers they engage, amongst other reasons. So, I think it is good to drill down and analyse what your problems are.",61,1000,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01000
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As for the cost of maintenance which Mr Low said it is high because some original parts are owned by the lift manufacturer, this is something that will depend on the complexity of the part. There are over 20 lift brands used in HDB estates. So, there are a variety of parts, from smaller parts, simpler parts that can be manufactured by others to those that are more specialised and specific to the lift.",62,1001,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01001
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mr Low also talked about the high cost of lift maintenance and replacement. MND is reviewing ways to help Town Councils better manage the lifts and to plan ahead for the lift replacement needs. Given that lift replacement is a major sinking fund expenditure, Town Council should monitor their long term financial sufficiency. MND is also considering ring fencing part of the Town Council's sinking fund to cater for such expenditure.",63,1002,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01002
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Even so, my Ministry has provided Town Councils with additional assistance schemes. For instance, in September 2014, HDB rolled out the Selective Lift Replacement Programme to help Town Councils replace older lifts that lack key features such as energy-efficient motors, infra-red door safety sensors and vision panels found in more modern lifts.",64,1003,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01003
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mr Low has also asked about the outcomes of the Greenprint programme. HDB launched the first two HDB Greenprint projects at Yuhua in 2012 and Teck Ghee in 2015 respectively to introduce sustainable living concepts into existing HDB estates. The Yuhua project was just completed last November and we are still assessing the effectiveness of the project, the various components of the project including the Pneumatic Waste System that Mr Low talked about. Based on HDB's preliminary survey, Yuhua residents welcome the green features, including the secured bicycle parking and hobby farming zones.",65,1004,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01004
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mr Low asked specifically if the Pneumatic Waste Conveyance System will be extended to all suitable HDB estates. We plan to do so in new BTO developments where viable, including in Tampines North and Punggol Northshore. It may be more challenging to do so in existing older estates, due to site constraints and higher costs, but we will assess the performance of the system at Yuhua first before deciding on the next step.",66,1005,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01005

Working with diverse stakeholders, especially those with conflicting viewpoints, may not be the fastest way of getting things done, but it is necessary if we are to ensure that we as Singaporeans, take ownership of the kind of Singapore we want for ourselves and our children, that we hear and understand the differences in views from the diversity of interests making up our plural society and respect the choices then made to create not only a liveable environment but also a sustainable one.",68,1007,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01007

The previous 2009 to 2014 Food Fund also saw only 60% of the $30 million set aside utilised.",2,1010,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01010
2016-04-11-T-004,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,"While the APF is committed to driving up productivity, perhaps the key factor driving down adoption is the short tenancies coupled with the longer time it takes for farm owners or farm operators to recover investments and double coupled by the uncertainty of land acquisition.",3,1011,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01011

2016-04-11-T-004,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,"At the current moment, we import nearly 90% of our food produce and food security dictates that we continue to increase local productivity, innovate through mechanisation, and maximise land usage for better yields.

2016-04-11-T-004,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, I first declare my interest as the Chief Executive of an animal welfare group. The current estimated populations of stray dogs, stray cats and wild monkeys are about 7,000, 60,000 and 1,900 respectively.

2016-04-11-T-004,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,This is a win-win solution that will address both public safety and animal welfare concerns and result in a more humane and long-term approach. It might also result in cost savings for the AVA.,4,1018,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01018
2016-04-11-T-004,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, in the past five years, the number of alleged animal cruelty cases investigated by the AVA rose from 410 cases to 606 cases. With increased awareness on animal welfare, we can expect more reports from members of the public who are now more vigilant and more concerned about this issue. This will result in an increased workload for AVA. Can the Ministry clarify whether it has sufficient resources and manpower to respond in a timely manner and rapidly to such cases?",5,1019,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01019

In his speech, Minister Lawrence Wong quoted from our iconic national song ""Home"". He said  ""There is comfort in the knowledge, that home's about its people too"". I would like to expand on this with the preceding lines, ""When there are troubles to go through, we'll find a way to start anew"". For households who have fallen onto hard times, the Government helps them in various ways. One of these is enabling them to stay in heavily subsidised public rental flats.",1,1022,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01022
2016-04-11-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Koh Poh Koon),"A few Members asked about our supply of rental flats. We have ramped up the rental supply from 42,000 in 2007 to 53,500 now, and it will go up to 60,000 in 2017. As a result, waiting time for a rental flat has reduced significantly from 21 months in 2008 to four months today. For those in urgent need of rental housing or any housing, HDB may give them priority allocation for a rental flat, or provide them with Interim Rental Housing while they await their rental flat.",2,1023,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01023

Staying in public rental flats should only be temporary for families to rebuild their lives. Mr Lee Kuan Yew said, ""My primary preoccupation was to give every citizen a stake in the country and its future. I wanted a home-owning society"". We want to see families in rental flats progress into homeownership.

We currently set aside 10% of 2- and 3-room flats in our sales exercises under the Tenants' Priority Scheme (TPS). The scheme has been open to first-timer rental families. So, in 2015, we set aside 411 2-room flats under TPS. This is 8.5 times more than the 48 applications we received that year.",6,1027,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01027

These second-timer families in rental flats have the same housing need as first-timer rental families. But as second timers, they have a lower allocation quota when it comes to balloting for new HDB flats. Therefore, extending TPS to these second timer families will increase their chances of selecting a flat, and moving on to homeownership. So from HDB's next sales exercise, second-timer rental families can also benefit from the 10% quota of flats set aside under the TPS. Like their first-timer counterparts, they will be eligible if they have stayed for at least two years in a rental flat, and are applying for a 2- or 3-room homeownership flat.",7,1028,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01028

We want to help them get on with their lives again by solving the problem at its root.

Two, they can also move to a smaller flat, if they are a couple with no children staying with them. By doing so, and staying in a short-lease 2-room Flexi flat, they can also benefit from the Silver Housing Bonus which is a cash bonus.

Under the programme, AVA co-funds the cost of sterilising and micro-chipping stray cats in HDB estates. The AWGs also help to mediate cat-related feedback and manage community cat feeders to prevent nuisance to the community. Animal welfare groups play a very important intermediary role in the community. Going forward, AVA will expand the programme to cover stray cats in industrial and commercial areas, and private estates. With this expansion, we hope to sterilise 20,000 more stray cats.",35,1056,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01056

2016-04-11-T-004,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,"Thank you, Chairman. I have a clarification for the Minister with regard to the Fresh Start Housing Scheme. Could the Minister explain the rationale behind deciding the MOP as 20 years? The reason behind it is that if you set it at 20 years, it means that the average age of families who are entering this scheme would mean that most of them would not be able to move to a bigger flat by the time they hit the 20 years.",1,1075,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01075
2016-04-11-T-004,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,"The second clarification is about the 1,000 families that the Minister mentioned earlier. This seems to be a small proportion of the total number families. Would this scheme be incremental after the first pilot?",2,1076,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01076
2016-04-11-T-004,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,"Lastly, for large families, the 2-room flexi flats are a little bit small. Would the Ministry consider any flexibility in this area?",3,1077,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01077
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Chairman, I understand the Member's concern with regard to the size of the flat, the MOP requirement, and also the number of potential beneficiaries of Fresh Start.",1,1078,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01078
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I would just highlight that when we thought about the scheme and we looked at the potential beneficiaries, the profile I was talking about, second-timers in rental flats with young children, school-going children. If you look at the savings and the balances they have today, there is an affordability issue even if we say buy a 3-room flat now, even with the grant. It is not going to be so easy for them to do so.",2,1079,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01079
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So we have to realistic about what they can afford. Even after the Fresh Start grant, given the balances that they have in savings and the situation they are in, I think it is more realistic to aim for a 2-room Flexi flat for a start. And the longer MOP is there to make sure that there is stable environment for the children.",3,1080,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01080
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Should any of these families who apply, eventually down the road, say that they have been able to be successful, with better incomes and now are better to afford a 3-room flat, I think we can facilitate that. Even if it is within the MOP, we will find ways to facilitate that. Because that is a success story which we should celebrate; meaning this is a household, which came under Fresh Start, got a 2-room flat, and then said now we have succeeded, incomes are stabilised, are better, we are able to afford a 3-room flat. We will find ways to facilitate that. But we wanted the long MOP to make sure that there is stability for the home environment and also to avoid situations where families cash out their flats early.",4,1081,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01081
2016-04-11-T-004,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"I want to clarify that the Town Council does have a regular maintenance regime for the lifts. What we found out is that the breakdown or failure of the parts are unusually fast, compared to some other flats. The question then is what is the quality of the LUP lifts? What are the safeguards or specifications that HDB has got, in terms of the tender?",1,1082,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01082
2016-04-11-T-004,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"On the issue of lift market, maintenance market, I understand that the new lift being installed with the manufacturing company will come with its own motherboard, which other companies will not be able to maintain. Which means that, going forward, the Town Council's lift maintenance will be held ransom by this manufacturing company.",2,1083,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01083
2016-04-11-T-004,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"The fundamental question is what is the situation of the lift manufacture and maintenance market in Singapore? Is the market competitive or are we in a situation where you have not much of choice, but dependent on these companies? They decide how much they will increase the price in maintenance every year? Of course, probably Opposition Town Councils will at a disadvantage, because we are not given the leeway of discounts, as they give to PAP Town Councils, from what I know.",3,1084,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01084

2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Sir, the Member now raises a couple of issues which were mentioned earlier. On the issue of lift breakdowns, he talks about the quality of the LUP. In deciding what lifts are put into a housing estate, including in LUP, we process projects by way of a price quality procurement process where you look not just at price, but also the quality of the lift. So, there are certain specifications that have to be met. As I said earlier, I think we need to really have a proper drill down by the Town Council. If you think there is an issue, raise it to MND and HDB, so that you can assess whether it is an issue of the lift brand, lift model, or is it a specific issue with regards to a particular shaft? Is it a maintenance problem? Is it a usage issue? So, I think beyond speculation, it is better to look at specifics.",1,1086,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01086
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The hon Member also speaks about motherboards of lifts, and that therefore, he is concerned about whether there is market competitiveness with regards to maintenance of lifts in HDB estates, which responsibilities then fall on Town Councils across the island. As I said earlier, there are many players in the lift supply market and the lift maintenance market. In HDB estates across Singapore, there are easily at least 20 brands of lifts being used. Equally, many players in the lift maintenance market, including the original lift manufacturers and third-party contractors.",2,1087,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01087
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"So, Mr Low talked about the manufacturer then having proprietary ownership in the technology of the motherboards, but there are also other parts of the lifts. Each of these lift maintenance companies, whether they are manufacturer or third-party contractor, come in variant profile and capabilities. There may be more complex maintenance issues which may require certain parties with specific competencies, such as the original lift manufacturer to resolve.",3,1088,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01088
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"HDB upholds a competitive market, and will not allow any particular party to abuse its market power, whether it is a part, or whether it is a maintenance regime. If there are any concerns that he raises, please let us know specifically, whether the motherboard, the type he is concerned about, let us know.",4,1089,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01089
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Chairman, I just wanted to add in response to Mr Low's query, as I understand his suggestion is to look at how we can standardise more components within the lifts. We have two objectives. One, to bring down costs, and secondly, so that we will not be held hostage or the Town Councils will not be held hostage by any particular Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs).",1,1090,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01090
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I agree fully with those suggestions. The objectives that we have are indeed aligned, because we have over the years, been doing more standardisation. That is why in the early days, all the lifts maintenance contracts were done by OEMs entirely. We were in a very difficult situation where we had to pay whatever prices that the OEMs charged.",2,1091,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01091
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Now, we have a more competitive market. There are third-party contractors, but Mr Low is right, that not everything can be done by the third-party contractor. Sometimes, for very complex things, for certain parts, you still need to go to the OEM.",3,1092,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01092
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We should try and aim for an even more competitive market, so I agree with him. With just one caveat, that we have to study this very carefully, because this is quite complex. If we were to overly prescribe certain standards, and say only these things can be done, we may end up with a situation where we limit our choices that we have to purchase. Fewer OEMs will bid for lift contracts in Singapore, the cost may be higher. So, it is complex and we have to look at this in detail.",4,1093,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01093
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,I would say that the direction of what he has suggested is something we agree with. HDB has already done this and we would continue to do more of it.,5,1094,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01094
2016-04-11-T-004,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Sir, I would like to clarify my point that I have made in my cut on the Goodwill Repair Assistant scheme, which was replied to by Senior Minister of State Desmond Lee.",1,1095,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01095
2016-04-11-T-004,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"The main point of the cut is that under the current scheme, the repair is only being done to the top floor, upper floor. Basically, there is an issue of leakage, so repair work will be done on the floor of the upper floor unit, the source of the leak. But due to the leak, it damages the lower floor's ceiling. So, the repair of this damaged ceiling is not covered under the GRA. The feedback that I have got from those living on the lower floor units, they wonder why should they pay a share of the repair done on the upper floor. Sorry for being a bit confusing.",2,1096,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01096
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mr Chairman, the Goodwill Repair Assistance scheme involves HDB coming in to help facilitate the resolution of maintenance issues faced by both upper and lower floors.",1,1097,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01097
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In this particular instance, it will be the residents of the lower floor who are suffering from the leakage, and therefore the scheme encourages both parties to do what is necessary to solve the problem. So the Government, HDB will pay half the cost of fixing the leakage. Most of the work, as the Member rightly points out, involves waterproofing membrane works for the upper floor unit. For the lower floor unit, you may need to fix some spalling of concrete, because of the leakage problem. And so the GRA also addresses that. I think, for your particular case, let us have a closer look and we will see what aspect of the ceiling has been damaged, and whether it is related to the leakage.",2,1098,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01098
2016-04-11-T-004,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"Thank you, Chairman. I have three clarifications. First, on the singles scheme. I would like to know based on HDB's records, how many singles are still applying for the flat and have not got it successfully? The Minister mentioned that it will be cleared soon. I would like to know how soon?",1,1099,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01099
2016-04-11-T-004,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,The second question is on the Fresh Start Grant. Minister mentioned that they should have school-going age children. May I ask does it include children who are in tertiary education? Does it include private tertiary education?,2,1100,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01100
2016-04-11-T-004,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"The third question is on the construction industry. I would like to know whether is there any plan to encourage, retain and build up Singaporean core professionals like engineers, architects and the construction managers.",3,1101,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01101
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, on the first point about singles. We would not be able to exactly pin point what is the demand for singles, because there may be more coming forward to apply. We do not have the exact number in terms of forecasting demand from singles, but I would say that it is still quite strong. We still see quite a lot of applications even in the last BTO exercise. If you look at the application rate, as I mentioned, it is more than seven, which indicates that there is still very strong demand.",1,1102,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01102
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Based on that level, I think we will take two to three years to clear that level of demand. Will even more come forward once the queue gets shorter? Maybe. That is why I said even after we have cleared this current surge of demand, there may be more coming forward, but that is the kind of numbers and timeframe we are looking at.",2,1103,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01103
2016-04-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The second question is on the Fresh Start Grant and the condition for the school-going children. We are looking at a parent with at least one child in school, particularly because we want to make sure that the child has a stable environment to grow up in. At least one child, so that means school-going age, which is anything that is less than 16 years old. But if they have more than one child, they can be in university, they can be in tertiary institutions, private institutions, and that is fine.",3,1104,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01104
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Chairman, may I deal with the Member's last question, which is on whether BCA is doing anything to encourage the growth of the Singapore core with regard to the built environment sector. I presume she is talking about architects, consultants, designers, contractors.",1,1105,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01105
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Yes, certainly that is key. I spoke earlier in my speech about how BCA is going upstream and having a whole suite of scholarships to encourage Singapore students in our institutions, whether it is in ITE, Polytechnics and Universities, to come on-board the built environment sector. There is also an Earn-and-Learn scheme, where after they join the particular programme at an institution, they learn and earn along the way, and get brought in to the sector.",2,1106,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01106
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Certainly, building that core is critical. In fact, whilst the push to productivity is one of the key drivers behind adopting higher technology or game-changing technology in construction, such as VDC and DfMA. Ultimately, if you look at it by using technology, using ICT, building in a smart and creative way, this also creates niches and opportunities for Singaporeans to come into the built environment sector as well.",3,1107,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01107
2016-04-11-T-004,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin,"Chairman, I would like to seek a clarification for the Senior Minister of State, as to whether the Ministry will consider reviewing or removing the terms and conditions of the land sales, such as specifying the method of construction, which has an effect on increasing development cost?",1,1108,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01108
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Sir, there are certain requirements that we put into our Government Land Sales (GLS) in order to drive the industry towards higher productivity methods of construction. I think we all agree as to the direction. The Member is concerned about whether these actually achieve the objectives. The objective is the same, but on the methods we might have a slight difference of opinion.",1,1109,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01109
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Some of our GLS sales come with a condition that they meet certain buildability scores. That has been the norm. Now, we have some GLS which specify that the construction must be by PPVC, and it is not 100%. I think it is about 60% by PPVC; the rest can be by casting in situ, so we provide some flexibility. It is transparent and it is a level-playing field. Parties who bid for these land sale sites know that there is a certain technological requirement. These help create lead demand for us to adopt the higher productivity methods.",2,1110,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01110
2016-04-11-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As for one of the points, I think, the Member raised in his speech earlier about whether we can relax the requirement for contractors or developers to finish the project within x number of years, I think we do not want the land to be hoarded. There are certain requirements that drive us to have GLS, especially for residential and commercial uses. They are meant to meet the demand that we have projected and we do not want, and certainly, no Singaporean would want land to be hoarded indefinitely. We want to see that the project is developed. The timeline that URA provides is a reasonable one.",3,1111,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01111

2016-04-11-T-004,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,"Secondly, for financial assistance, I mentioned in my speech, whether previous economic downturns have provided us with any lessons?

2016-04-11-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"In terms of the question earlier about how we can increase the tenure to encourage them to be more productive, we are still in the midst of consulting our farmers. The indication is that they would prefer to have a longer tenure, in order to allow them to invest sufficiently. We will take their feedback into consideration in deciding how we want to award our tenures and scope the policy accordingly.",2,1115,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01115
2016-04-11-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"As for the question about whether the current schemes and measures are sufficient to help families in the economic downturn, there are quite a number of schemes and policies that can help families, whether they are first-timers, second-timers, whether they are divorced. At the end of the day, HDB does take a flexible approach to help families who are in need, even if they do fall within these schemes.

2016-04-11-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Thank you, Mr Chairman, just a few points of clarifications to the hon Minister of State. Firstly, on the statistics he cited that flat owners who are seeking to rent out rooms and that a survey was conducted a few years ago, where only 5% of them had difficulties finding tenants. The anecdotal feedback I have from residents",1,1122,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01122
2016-04-11-T-004,,The Chairman,"Mr Perera, please state the clarification and not make a speech.",1,1123,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01123
2016-04-11-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Yes. So, my question is  would the Minister of State consider doing this survey on a regular basis? Because my understanding is that the market has softened and the markets do go through cycles, so would such a survey about whether flat owners have difficulties finding tenants, be something that the Ministry would do on a regular basis?",1,1124,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01124
2016-04-11-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"The second point of clarification is regarding the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS). The hon Minister of State mentioned rental and downgrading as other options, but of course, rental depends on the market; downgrading has other downsides, like commissions and costs. There is evidence to suggest that the bequeath motives hold back some people from exercising LBS. Would the Ministry look into ways to address the bequeath motive issue that is holding back some people from making use of the LBS, such as the suggestion made by Mr Chen Show Mao?",2,1125,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01125
2016-04-11-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Lastly, on the Agricultural Productivity Fund (APF), I would like to ask the Ministry why the disbursement of the fund has been quite low so far. Clearly, there are deserving projects, in terms of indoor and vertical farming. Is it because of a lack of deserving projects? Or is it because of some lack of connectivity between the companies, the farmers, and the agency in charge of disbursing the fund?",3,1126,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01126
2016-04-11-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Chairman, Sir, for the first question that the Member raised about the rental survey, we all do our Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS), we have residents coming to see us, telling us their issues. One of the ways we can sense whether this is going to become an important issue is through our MPS. We can sense whether this is a common enough problem.",1,1127,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01127
2016-04-11-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"If it is picked up that this is a much more prevalent problem and is increasingly so, we can re-conduct another survey. But with or without a survey, estate agents are available, websites that allow matching of rental tenants and people with rooms to rent are also available. So, we do not quite need a survey for any of these services to be available. So, those who need this can avail themselves of these present available services right now.",2,1128,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01128
2016-04-11-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"For the second question on Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) and whether bequeathing is one of those things that holds people back from taking part in the LBS. I think at the end of the day, it is an option and a choice that the elderly couple has to decide, how they want to monetise their flat. If they do want to bequeath their flat, then I think it makes more sense for them to retain the whole flat, rent it out in the meantime – either whole flat or a room – while keeping the full intact value of the flat to bequeath it to their children.",3,1129,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01129
2016-04-11-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"If you have the LBS where you already sold part of the lease back to HDB and you only have such a short lease left, I am not sure how much value there is for the couple to bequeath to their children. If the intent is to bequeath the flat to their children, they should keep the flat. But if what they want is to monetise their flat, there are many options. We are not trying to push people to go onto the LBS, so there is no real need to try to make it so attractive for people to go onto the LBS. At this moment, by expanding the LBS to allow 4-room flat owners to join, we have already catered to almost 75% of the elderly who own flats. That is adequate for the moment.",4,1130,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01130
2016-04-11-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Regarding the APF and why the take-up rate may not be as high as we would want it to be, I think part of the reason could be that farmers make their choices about how they want to transform. We have to do it from two ways. One, encourage them to continue to look forward, to be more forward-looking and to adopt technology, so the persuasion part has to be there. Secondly, perhaps some farmers may find that the existing farms may be nearing the end of their lease, so they might be hesitant to take the lead and so do. Certainly, as they renew their lease, we can encourage them to look at how they can use the APF to further change the way they do farming, so that as they take on a new lease with a longer life span, they can then utilise the APF effectively to up their farming technologies.",5,1131,2016-04-11-T-004-S-01131

2016-04-11-T-005,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"I spoke earlier of the dichotomy of being efficient and effective. I explain. Being efficient is about doing things right.

2016-04-11-T-005,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"I raise three points for discussion. First, are Singaporeans adequately prepared to accept this changing transportation model? The ownership of cars is a norm in many countries. In Singapore, this is clearly unsustainable. Our population has grown significantly over the years and we expect it to grow more. Similarly, the number of vehicles has also grown. But the land we live on cannot. We have tried with land reclamation but we are clearly limited by what we can do.",13,1150,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01150
2016-04-11-T-005,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"The transport infrastructure model that is before us is clearly an efficient solution to this problem. It makes the best use of what we have, the best use of what modern technology can give us and plan it in the best way we know how.",14,1151,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01151
2016-04-11-T-005,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"But to make this transport infrastructure model also the most effective solution, the population that lives in this model must also participate actively and make the best use of it.",15,1152,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01152
2016-04-11-T-005,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Second, we are an ageing population. This is an issue close to my heart. In Potong Pasir, a significant proportion of my residents are elderly. The elderly are physically more constrained than the young. As such, we must be sensitive and aware of their travel needs.",16,1153,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01153
2016-04-11-T-005,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"I explain with an example. There is a new housing development now being built in Potong Pasir. The land it is on is directly next to Potong Pasir MRT station. During construction, the developer blocked off the most direct walking route that my residents take to the MRT station. The developer was required to build sheltered walkways along the perimeter of the land to facilitate our residents' needs. I remained deeply concerned. Yes, sheltered walkways are good but it is now a more circuitous route. A five-minute walk has become 15 minutes. For a young adult or even a not so young adult like me, we can manage. But for an elderly person, this extra 10 minutes of walking can be a torturous and excruciating exercise. I raise the example to show that a truly efficient and effective transportation model must be convenient and accessible to all Singaporeans and not just the able-bodied majority.",17,1154,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01154
2016-04-11-T-005,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"I therefore read with great pleasure of LTA's recent plans to introduce priority queues for the elderly, disabled and others at MRT stations and bus interchanges.

2016-04-11-T-005,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Third and lastly, reliability. Reliability of our public transport system, especially of our MRT system, has been an issue raised on many occasions. Improvements have clearly been done. But with the rapid expansion of the MRT lines or of a new line or extension every year for the next five years, is this a case of biting off more than we can chew? Are we equipped to ensure reliability across the entire MRT system while expanding its capacity at the same time?",19,1156,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01156

These stations are spacious and brightly lit with futuristic designs and decorated with art work. Some of the larger stations house a generous array of shops and eateries.

Will the overcrowding at the platform be resolved? Will it shield my residents from hot morning sun? Will it cover my residents' bicycles from rain and shine? Will it be more elderly friendly with the provision of more seats, brighter and bigger signages? Will there be beautiful artwork display perhaps to cool them down when they cannot squeeze into the overcrowded train and have to wait for the next train?

This is to take effect from 31 March  (a) train running on sections of the track where personnel are working on must operate on manual, not automatic mode; (b) trains to cease operating on the relevant section of the track before repair personnel is allowed on it; (c) robust authentication between personnel on track and the operations control centre to verify track isolation; (d) measures for isolation to be in place until staff have left the work area and track site; and finally, (e) watchman to be deployed to alert personnel of incoming trains.",2,1174,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01174
2016-04-11-T-005,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"I am surprised by this press release. I had expected these measures to be in place and to be so-called SOP. If they were, the press release would not have been necessary.",3,1175,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01175
2016-04-11-T-005,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,I would like to ask the Minister,4,1176,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01176
2016-04-11-T-005,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"(a) Before the accident, what were the obligations for LTA to check on the MRT operators' observance of safety protocols for maintenance and operations?",5,1177,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01177
2016-04-11-T-005,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"(b) After the accident, will there be any new measures for LTA to check and ensure that MRT operators follow the requisite safety procedures?",6,1178,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01178
2016-04-11-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Chairman, the developments in transport and its associate technology have been rapid in the last few years. Just last week, NuTonomy, a driverless car start-up out of the US sets its sights on operating a fully autonomous taxi service out of Singapore.",1,1179,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01179
2016-04-11-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The future of transport is arriving on our shores and sooner than we realise. I would like the MOT how it is preparing Singapore and keeping our regulations up-to-date, given the evolving transport technology trends, such as driverless vehicles, digital application such as Uber, as well as emerging models of vehicles using a myriad of technologies.",2,1180,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01180
2016-04-11-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The difference in views between the LTA and car manufacturer Tesla on test methodology for its cars earlier this year gained widespread international attention. The incident exemplifies this need for us to be ready to master new developments quickly and continuously engage new technology manufacturers to ensure that our laws, regulations and methods are up-to-date.",3,1181,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01181
2016-04-11-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"In terms of public transportation, what other developments can Singaporeans expect and how will these trends encourage greater use, provide greater confidence as well as real-time information and enhance the reliability of our own public transport system. The recent announcement of ERP2 is certainly a game changer and I am keen to know the Ministry's plans to balance the pace of transition in adopting this new technology.",4,1182,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01182
2016-04-11-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Given the rapid pace of adoption, it is especially important for the Ministry to guide Singaporeans through these investments and these developments. I hope the Ministry consults the public widely on the policy changes and inform them in advance of impending changes.",5,1183,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01183
2016-04-11-T-005,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,"Sir, the potential for autonomous vehicles to play a key role in our public transport service is exciting. In a press release by LTA last October, autonomous vehicles are touted to radically transform our land transportation, especially in two key areas of constraint − land and manpower.",1,1184,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01184
2016-04-11-T-005,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,The Committee on Autonomous Road Transport (CARTS) in Singapore was reported to be looking into some key roles for autonomous vehicles to complement our transport system in the hope of reducing road congestion during peak hours and manpower requirements.,2,1185,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01185
2016-04-11-T-005,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,"While I am not sure how autonomous vehicles can help Singapore ease its constraint on land use, the technology can certainly ease the manpower crunch in the public transport arena. I do see the potential for autonomous vehicle to complement our public transport system, especially in the area of feeder bus service where the route is short and fixed and standard fare applies. I do see the potential for autonomous feeder bus service to take over from OMO bus service at night when the traffic is light and to stay operational longer as well.",3,1186,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01186
2016-04-11-T-005,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,"Sir, I wish to ask the Ministry to share more on the roadmap for the autonomous bus service to play a key role in our public transport system. In the same, transport by CARTS, there was no mention of allowing private autonomous vehicles on our road. May I ask the Minister if private autonomous vehicles are also in the same roadmap to introduce self-driving vehicles on our road?",4,1187,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01187
2016-04-11-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Sir, electric bus technology has been constantly improving. Electric bus batteries can now power buses to travel longer with claimed ranges of 250 km on a single four to five hour charge, which should be sufficient in most cases to operate for a full day without the need to recharge. Innovative technologies such as induction charging can further boost capacity.",1,1188,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01188
2016-04-11-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"The batteries themselves have also longer lifespans and are estimated to last about seven-and-a-half years with more than 4,000 recharging cycles in a lifespan. These batteries are also made in increasingly environmentally friendly ways with chemical materials in the batteries capable of being recycled. Zero tail pipe emissions also mean that electric buses provide public transportation which is cleaner and quieter. While the upfront costs are currently higher, there is growing evidence that the lifecycle costs are becoming increasingly more competitive.",2,1189,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01189
2016-04-11-T-005,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Therefore, I would like to ask the Minister if he would consider using electric buses for our public transport system.",3,1190,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01190
2016-04-11-T-005,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Thank you, Chairman. Chairman, I would like to declare my interest as the Executive Secretary of the National Transport Workers' Union.",1,1191,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01191
2016-04-11-T-005,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Our public bus captains carry a heavy responsibility every day when they report for work, because thousands of commuters depend on public buses to safely and promptly reach their destinations all over Singapore.",2,1192,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01192
2016-04-11-T-005,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"With the introduction of the Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP) and the Bus Service Reliability Framework (BSRF), as well as the implementation of the Government Contracting Model (GCM), more bus captains are required in the industry. In fact, this year alone, the public bus operators seek to hire more than 3,000 bus captains.",3,1193,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01193
2016-04-11-T-005,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Although the starting wages of the bus captains have increased by over 30% since 2012, more needs to be done to enhance the bus captain profession to attract more Singaporeans to join the trade as well as to retain the current crop of bus captains.",4,1194,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01194
2016-04-11-T-005,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),I would like to ask the Ministry of Transport to consider the following suggestions,5,1195,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01195
2016-04-11-T-005,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"First, to make the Omnibus Driver Vocational Licence (ODVL) transferable. Bus captains currently possess this vocational licence, valid only while the holder is a bus driver with SBS Transit Limited or SMRT Bus Limited. When the holder leaves the employment of an operator to work for another, the licence is no longer valid and the new employer would have to submit a fresh application.",6,1196,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01196
2016-04-11-T-005,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Today, we have new and more bus operators coming into the industry by virtue of the Government contracting model. To alleviate the manpower situation in the industry, can the Ministry consider making the ODVL transferable? This would facilitate our bus captains to start work at the new company without waiting for the re-application of the licence, which can sometimes take up to an average of two months from the first point of application.",7,1197,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01197
2016-04-11-T-005,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Second, we need to enhance the career progression pathway for bus captains. To do so, we need to provide a centralised structured training framework which can help deepen one's professional skills and consequently, lead to progressive wages. Continuous training programmes should also be made accessible to bus captains at all stages of their career, for them to learn and acquire new skills.",8,1198,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01198
2016-04-11-T-005,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"For instance, in the past, bus captains had to do manual engine checks by lifting the heavy bonnet. Today, the checks can be conducted by simply using the dashboard at the driver's seat. Currently, the training of bus captains is decentralised to the respective public bus operators. A centralised training centre would be useful so as to standardise the basic training programmes for bus captains as well as to provide continuous training in a structured manner for them to keep up with environmental changes. Can the Ministry elaborate on any plans to enhance the training programmes for our bus captains?",9,1199,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01199
2016-04-11-T-005,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Third, due to the demanding working conditions of bus captains and the gradual ageing profile, the union is naturally concerned about their health and well-being. It is therefore, timely that we holistically review the overall working conditions of our bus captains, to ensure that they are physically and mentally fit to do their job well. Some of the areas we can look at include reviewing their work schedule, ergonomics intervention and fatigue management.",10,1200,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01200
2016-04-11-T-005,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Early detection and intervention can certainly help our bus captains identify and address potential health threats before they fall seriously ill. Through a recent health screening project piloted by the union involving close to 900 bus captains, we found that eight out of 10 had unhealthy BMI, blood pressure or cholesterol. I would like to urge the Ministry and the public transport operators to look into providing free annual health screenings for all bus captains and to include it as a condition inside the bus contracting model.",11,1201,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01201
2016-04-11-T-005,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Next, we need to stop the abuse of bus captains. During my ground visits, I hear bus captains having bad encounters with commuters. They are often at the receiving end of verbal abuse by some commuters. Sometimes, the abuse could also be physical. Our bus captains are striving to serve the commuters well every day. They deserve some respect for their hard work and not abuse. I would like to ask for the support of the Ministry and the public transport tripartite partners to do more to stop the abuse of our bus captains.",12,1202,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01202
2016-04-11-T-005,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Sir, there are more than 8,000 bus captains in Singapore and they serve an important duty to our society. Our bus captains deserve greater recognition than what they receive today. I hope that the Ministry can consider designating a ""Bus Captains' Day"" every year to recognise their dedicated contributions and service to our community.",13,1203,2016-04-11-T-005-S-01203

2016-04-11-T-008,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether the Ministry will consider offering rental rebates to hawkers who are affected by closure of hawker centres for improvement works to help offset some loss of income; and (b) whether the Ministry will be able to work with the Workforce Development Agency to send hawkers for training that is tailored for them during the shut-down period.,1,1214,2016-04-11-T-008-S-01214
