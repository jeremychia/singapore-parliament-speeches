2016-05-09-T-002,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David,asked	 the Minister for Transport whether the Government will consider setting up dedicated bicycle terminals at key locations in the city and downtown with the necessary facilities to support those who would like to cycle from their home to the city.,1,5,2016-05-09-T-002-S-00005
2016-05-09-T-002,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo),,1,6,2016-05-09-T-002-S-00006
2016-05-09-T-002,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo),"In answer to the Member Mr Darryl David, there are currently more than 800 bicycle parking lots at eight MRT stations located in the city area. For the Downtown Line, which is the newest line to be operational, bicycle parking lots will be provided at a majority of the stations in the city area.",2,7,2016-05-09-T-002-S-00007
2016-05-09-T-002,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo),"LTA also plans to require bicycle parking standards for private residential, commercial and community developments, including those in the city area. Besides parking, developers will soon have to submit a Walking and Cycling Plan which factors in other supporting facilities for cyclists, such as showers and lockers.",3,8,2016-05-09-T-002-S-00008
2016-05-09-T-002,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for her reply. It is heartening to know that this is going to happen, but until the developers provide these facilities, I was wondering if, whether it is under the URA or the LTA, we could consider that at the dedicated bicycle hubs or terminals, we provide those lockers, showers and facilities. While many of us would like to try to cycle to work, but due to our weather, by the time we get there, we cannot tell whether you are caught in the heat or in a storm because you are drenched. Would the Government consider this?",1,9,2016-05-09-T-002-S-00009
2016-05-09-T-002,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In response to the supplementary question, there are really two considerations. One is that at the sites where the MRT stations are located, we need to have the available space in order to carry out a plan like dedicated bicycle terminals. The second consideration is that when we provide bicycle facilities, we must bear in mind the objective, that is, first and last mile connectivity. That is why the intention is to involve building owners. Even if you have provided a bicycle terminal, the individual will still have to get to the destination. That, ultimately, is going to be a building with an owner. So, we prefer to require these owners to implement Walking and Cycling Plans so that facilities can be nearer to the destinations of the bicycle users.",1,10,2016-05-09-T-002-S-00010
2016-05-09-T-003,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee,asked	 the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider investing in lockers for storage of personal mobility devices (PMDs) and setting aside parking spaces/charging stations for parking of electric bicycles and bicycles at community clubs/centres/MRT stations to promote cycling and PMDs.,1,11,2016-05-09-T-003-S-00011

2016-05-09-T-003,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo),"At the moment, we have no plans to provide storage facilities for personal mobility devices. Users tend to carry the devices with them. We will, however, continue to monitor the trends.",2,13,2016-05-09-T-003-S-00013
2016-05-09-T-003,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Madam, I read with great interest the Walking and Cycling Plans for new developments that developers have to put in place. For existing developers, are there items or schemes that MOT may consider to encourage them to also do likewise so that they can provide especially storage facilities? I have visited and met some personal mobility device users who tend to carry their devices, whether e-scooters or hoverboards, to training classrooms or gyms. They have to move around with those equipment because there is no other proper place to store them.",1,14,2016-05-09-T-003-S-00014
2016-05-09-T-003,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mdm Speaker, as I had explained earlier, for existing buildings, it is a little harder to require retrospectively the owners to make such provisions available. Within the building, there could already be constraints. I think it is quite clear to the building owners that as the number of users increase, as part of their friendliness towards the tenants in the building, they would want to make such facilities available. We will continue to monitor the trends. The priority is to require new buildings to do so and where opportunities arise and it is possible for us to encourage existing building owners to do likewise, we will do so.",1,15,2016-05-09-T-003-S-00015
2016-05-09-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Just a supplementary question for the Senior Minister of State. For new Downtown Line stations, can I just confirm with the Senior Minister of State how many bicycle parking facilities will be made available at each station?",1,16,2016-05-09-T-003-S-00016
2016-05-09-T-003,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"I do not have the answer offhand. That is very detailed, but if you file a question, we will provide it to you.",1,17,2016-05-09-T-003-S-00017
2016-05-09-T-004,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef,"asked	 the Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs whether visitations to, and sharing of the work done by the Religious Rehabilitation Group (RRG) can be embedded into the curriculum of every cohort of asatizah as well as Secondary and post-Secondary madrasah students.",1,18,2016-05-09-T-004-S-00018
2016-05-09-T-004,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Madam, religious clerics or Asatizah registered under the Asatizah Recognition Scheme (ARS) are required to undergo the Continuing Professional Education (CPE) programme. Since 2013, the CPE includes a key module on counter-extremism by the Religious Rehabilitation Group, or RRG. Through this module, the RRG shares with Asatizah its experience in rehabilitating and reintegrating former Jemaah Islamiyah members into society. MUIS and the RRG will continue to update this module to ensure its relevance, and to aim for every Asatizah to attend it. Currently, 80% of our Asatizah are part of the ARS, and we will encourage the remaining 20% to come onboard.",1,19,2016-05-09-T-004-S-00019
2016-05-09-T-004,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Many Asatizah have visited the RRG Resource and Counselling Centre (RCC) at Khadijah Mosque since its launch in 2014, to learn first-hand RRG's efforts in tackling extremist ideologies especially those on social media platforms.",2,20,2016-05-09-T-004-S-00020
2016-05-09-T-004,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"The RRG also engages our secondary and post-secondary madrasah students on the threats of radicalisation and extremism through platforms such as learning journeys to the RCC and the Madrasah Pre-U Seminar. The Madrasah Pre-U Seminar is attended by all secondary and pre-U Madrasah students, and is held every two to three years. MUIS will continue to strengthen the madrasah curriculum with relevant content developed by the RRG.",3,21,2016-05-09-T-004-S-00021
2016-05-09-T-004,,,"I thank the Minister for the response. Can I also ask whether we encourage or make it part of the programme for our Mosque Committees, including the Youth Committees in our mosques, to actually attend and get to know about the work of the RRG. For the Asatizah that was mentioned earlier, are those who are qualified or are trained overseas required to understand what RRG does?",1,22,2016-05-09-T-004-S-00022
2016-05-09-T-004,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Mdm Speaker, if they are registered under the ARS, as mentioned in my reply, whether they are overseas graduates or not, they will have to go through the CPE and that would include the component on the work of the RRG. To her first question on whether or not we encourage mosques and youth groups to do so, we do that all the time. Mosques are free to arrange their own programmes. In fact, since the RRC was opened in 2014, there have been many, many visitors, not just from the religious fraternity but also from other groups, because we want to encourage a greater understand across the whole cross-section of Singapore society.",1,23,2016-05-09-T-004-S-00023
2016-05-09-T-005,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,"asked	 the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether the Ministry will consider encouraging major tourist attractions to charge special rates for multi-generational Singaporean visitors to promote inter-generational bonding.",1,24,2016-05-09-T-005-S-00024

2016-05-09-T-005,Sim Ann,"The Senior Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth (Ms Sim Ann)","For places of interest and facilities under the MCCY family, we encourage multi-generational visitors through family-oriented programming. The museums run by the National Heritage Board, including the National Museum of Singapore and Asian Civilizations Museum already offer free entry to Singaporeans for the permanent galleries. Their exhibitions particularly lend themselves to inter-generational bonding. The National Heritage Board also organises the annual Singapore Heritage Festival and Singapore Night Festival which have family-friendly activities such as performances and guided tours.",2,26,2016-05-09-T-005-S-00026

2016-05-09-T-005,Sim Ann,"The Senior Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth (Ms Sim Ann)",There are many other platforms to encourage inter-generational family bonding. These include a wide range of regular community events and free-access public spaces such as the Marina Barrage and popular parks such as Singapore Botanic Gardens and East Coast Park. The Families for Life Council also organises regular picnics at these and other heartland parks to encourage inter-generational family bonding.,4,28,2016-05-09-T-005-S-00028
2016-05-09-T-006,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"asked	 the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth with regard to heritage artefacts excavated by archaeologists or others in the last five years (a) whether all the artefacts have been properly documented and reported to the Government; (b) what is the legal ownership status of such artefacts; and (c) how are the artefacts stored and protected.",1,29,2016-05-09-T-006-S-00029

Remaining artefacts may be stored by partner agencies such as the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute.",3,32,2016-05-09-T-006-S-00032
2016-05-09-T-006,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien)","NHB typically does not have legal ownership of archaeological materials unearthed on private land. NHB has nevertheless worked closely with stakeholders to identify and protect important artefacts. An example from the past five years would be artefacts recovered from the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd, which are owned by the Roman Catholic Church. A number of artefacts recovered from the Cathedral are displayed at the Cathedral's Heritage and Resource Gallery. Selected artefacts are also displayed at the Indian Heritage Centre, managed by NHB, for the public to access and appreciate.",4,33,2016-05-09-T-006-S-00033
2016-05-09-T-006,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien)","The legal ownership status of archaeological materials unearthed on private land is an area that NHB is studying as part of a broader review on archaeology in Singapore.

NHB will seek feedback from stakeholders such as archaeologists, heritage experts and NGOs in its review.",5,34,2016-05-09-T-006-S-00034
2016-05-09-T-006,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Minister for the reply. I have a few supplementary questions. The first is, what are the guidelines for the storage or protection of these artefacts for the partner agencies? Whether the same process of protection and storage is applied to territorial waters in archaeological finds that are discovered territorial waters? And also, what happens when members of the public discovers traces of archaeological finds, especially during property construction and renovation? And whether the Ministry is going to consider imposing legal obligations for stopping work and reporting the finds to the Government?",1,35,2016-05-09-T-006-S-00035
2016-05-09-T-006,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for the supplementary questions. NHB will work very closely with the related agencies on the standard of protection and record keeping. I must say that right now, we are working with very good professionals. They themselves have a great interest on protecting the artefacts and I think that there is a close collaboration on ensuring that the artefacts are well kept and protected for all to appreciate in the future.",1,36,2016-05-09-T-006-S-00036
2016-05-09-T-006,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"On maritime archaeological finds, this is generally supported by the MPA through their Merchant Shipping Act. We are working closely also with MPA with regard to maritime archaeological finds. We place great importance on maritime artefacts. We display maritime artefacts in the Asian Civilisations Museum, for example. And with the support of philanthropists such as the Khoo Teck Puat family foundation as well as Kwek Hong Png's family, we are able to have good displays for the public to appreciate such finds.",2,37,2016-05-09-T-006-S-00037
2016-05-09-T-006,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"With regard to the public, as I have answered earlier on, this is an area that we are looking further into. We are looking at how we should improve our laws and regulations to not discourage the public for having an interest, but to embrace and engage the public who are interested in archaeology to cooperate with NHB. Ultimately, I think we share the same common purpose. It is to understand the history of Singapore through archaeology. And that history is really for the public, both present and future generations, to appreciate. So, we want to keep artefacts as evidence of history for the benefit of many generations to come.",3,38,2016-05-09-T-006-S-00038
2016-05-09-T-007,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,asked	  the Minister for Defence whether the National Day Parade Organising Committee will consider allowing greater priority for Pioneer Generation citizens when they apply to ballot for National Day Parade tickets.,1,39,2016-05-09-T-007-S-00039
2016-05-09-T-007,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),,1,40,2016-05-09-T-007-S-00040
2016-05-09-T-007,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"Indeed, the Pioneer Generation should be honoured and thanked for their sacrifices, achievements and immense contributions for building the Singapore we know and have today. However, as a national celebration for all Singaporeans, it is important that every Singaporean be given an equal chance to attend the NDP. We are mindful that preferential allocation of tickets would not be in line with this intent to include all Singaporeans as part of the nation's birthday. As it is, while the number of available tickets has increased, so will the number of applicants and it is inevitable that many will still be disappointed. To give greater priority to the Pioneer Generation – about 450,000 Singaporeans – will lead to reduced chances for other Singaporeans.",2,41,2016-05-09-T-007-S-00041
2016-05-09-T-007,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"So, the NDP Executive Committee (EXCO) endeavours to include as many Singaporeans as possible to experience NDP. As with previous NDPs, live telecast will also allow Singaporeans to watch the show at home. Singaporeans can also look forward to participating in NDP through the engagement efforts which the EXCO will unveil in the coming months.",3,42,2016-05-09-T-007-S-00042
2016-05-09-T-007,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I just wanted to ask the Senior Minister of State. The feedback that I have is that many residents say that they have balloted many times for the NDP tickets but have never been successful. Would the Ministry consider for those who have never successfully balloted for an NDP ticket, just to give them the opportunity to experience NDP live in the stadium, can be given, say, triple or double chances, just for those who have never, ever balloted successfully before; just to give them the experience?",1,43,2016-05-09-T-007-S-00043
2016-05-09-T-007,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Madam, I can appreciate where the Member is coming from. I think we all would like to give everybody the opportunity to experience NDP. It is going to be quite difficult to ascertain who has never, ever had a chance to attend an NDP over the last 50 years of our independence. It is going to be quite a difficult process to put in place in the first place. What we have done is, since 2013, those who have been successful in balloting in one year are then taken off the register for the subsequent year. So, we try to give opportunities for those who have not balloted successfully in one year to ballot again the next year. Those who have been successful in that year will not be allowed to ballot again the next year.",1,44,2016-05-09-T-007-S-00044
2016-05-09-T-007,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"So, that is the best we can do to try to limit access of one group who has succeeded in one year, and possibly expand the opportunities for the others. But I think Mr Lim would probably appreciate, it is going to be very difficult to first ascertain what is that frame of number of people who have never, ever. And everybody would probably say ""I have never, ever been successful"" because we cannot possibly ascertain that. Because everyone who ballots or applies (for tickets) can apply for one, two or… two, four or six tickets. So, the success is by one person, but six persons would have gone. So, it will be very difficult to ascertain that. I think the system we have today is fair and we will continue to try to facilitate a fair system where everybody gets an equal chance of being balloted for the tickets.",2,45,2016-05-09-T-007-S-00045

2016-05-09-T-007,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"It is a supplementary question, Mdm Speaker. Senior Minister of State, instead of one year of barring, that is, if you are successful for one year and you cannot benefit next year, why not extend to three years or five years, for that matter? Is this a system constraint or our own constraint?",1,47,2016-05-09-T-007-S-00047
2016-05-09-T-007,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"I guess the argument would go either way. One would say that, ""Barring me for one year is sufficient. I try again. It is not that I am going to get the chance of getting successful one more time."" But I think it is from feedback that we have put in place this system of barring them for one year. We can study it further; we can study the probability of one being successful even if we had blocked them for two years or three years. I think the point we recognise is that we want to give Singaporeans the opportunity to get access to the NDP. This year, for example, more will get a chance because the capacity is bigger and we will look into the system and facilitate as much as we can.",1,48,2016-05-09-T-007-S-00048

2016-05-09-T-008,Ng Chee Meng,The Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"Madam, Ministry of Education (MOE) introduced Compulsory Education only at the Primary level in Singapore in 2003, following the recommendations of the Committee on Compulsory Education. The Committee had also deliberated whether Secondary education should be made compulsory and Parliament discussed this when the Compulsory Education Act was introduced. Legislating Compulsory Education does not ensure full enrolment in schools or solve the root problems of non-attendance, as these are often complex and multi-faceted in nature.",1,50,2016-05-09-T-008-S-00050
2016-05-09-T-008,Ng Chee Meng,The Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"Instead, MOE has taken a holistic approach by working with parents, schools, community self-help groups and relevant agencies, such as the Ministry of Social and Family Development and Family Service Centres, to support families and help all students attend school. This includes tracking and helping students who are at-risk of dropping out of school, or those who are already out of the school system.",2,51,2016-05-09-T-008-S-00051
2016-05-09-T-008,Ng Chee Meng,The Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"We also focus on upstream efforts, such as ensuring that children attend Primary school regularly to get a good start in education.

2016-05-09-T-008,Ng Chee Meng,The Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"In addition, we recognise that regular school attendance is necessary but insufficient for real learning to take place. MOE therefore also invests in providing multiple pathways and a variety of programmes in our schools to cater to students of different learning needs, strengths and talents, so that every student is able to learn at a pace most suited to him or her, and has the opportunities to develop his or her strengths and is well-prepared for further progression in education and work. The quality of their school experience helps to keep our students interested and engaged in school, to strive for excellence in their respective domains.",4,53,2016-05-09-T-008-S-00053
2016-05-09-T-008,Ng Chee Meng,The Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"With these collective efforts, Singapore has achieved near-universal Secondary education. Today as it stands, less than 1% of each Primary 1 cohort does not complete Secondary education. A legislative extension of compulsory education is unlikely to be effective in reducing this any further. To prepare our youths for future challenges, MOE will continue to support our children in their education at every stage by providing a quality education and meeting their needs.",5,54,2016-05-09-T-008-S-00054
2016-05-09-T-009,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari,asked	 the Minister for Finance whether IRAS will allow Singaporeans who are retrenched due to the economic downturn this year to defer their income tax payment till they are able to find employment.,1,55,2016-05-09-T-009-S-00055
2016-05-09-T-009,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Mdm Speaker, under the existing IRAS GIRO Scheme, taxpayers can pay their income tax by up to 12 monthly interest-free instalments.

2016-05-09-T-009,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I have one supplementary question. In serious cases of financial difficulty, will IRAS consider reducing or waiving the person's tax liability?",1,57,2016-05-09-T-009-S-00057
2016-05-09-T-009,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Madam, I think that if a person has a serious financial hardship, what the person should do is approach IRAS and speak to them. As a general rule, IRAS does not waive income tax liabilities. You need to have some financial prudence and discipline but at the same time, you also need to balance that where individuals generally want to pay but for some reason, their circumstances really, really do not allow them to. So, the best approach is to speak to IRAS. Currently, they do have interest-free instalment plans. They would try where possible, to exercise a flexibility, but at the end of the day, we have to do two things, which is to maintain the fiscal prudence and the discipline in tax recovery for the state and where possible, balance that with compassion on the part of individuals.",1,58,2016-05-09-T-009-S-00058
2016-05-09-T-010,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,asked	 the Minister for Health (a) whether private insurers can be incentivised to offer riders for basic standard B1 Integrated Shield Plans to cover Singaporeans with pre-existing medical conditions; and (b) whether the Ministry will study the possibility of establishing a reinsurance risk pool across private insurers' basic standard B1 Integrated Shield Plans so as to lower premiums and facilitate extension of coverage to pre-existing medical conditions.,1,59,2016-05-09-T-010-S-00059

2016-05-09-T-010,Chee Hong Tat,The Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat),"Like all Integrated Shield Plans (IPs), Standard IP is an optional private insurance. Currently, IP insurers are allowed to offer riders for coverage of pre-existing conditions. The premiums for these riders are set by the insurers based on commercial and actuarial considerations. As the Government's focus is on providing basic health insurance for all Singaporeans through MediShield Life, we do not have any plans to incentivise insurers to offer such riders. We have to be prudent in extending subsidies and incentives beyond Medishield Life, as the cost increases will ultimately be borne by taxpayers.",2,61,2016-05-09-T-010-S-00061
2016-05-09-T-010,Chee Hong Tat,The Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat),"On Dr Tan Wu Meng's suggestion to establish a reinsurance risk pool, MOH will explore this proposal with the industry players. I thank the Member for his suggestion.",3,62,2016-05-09-T-010-S-00062
2016-05-09-T-010,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"I thank the Minister of State for his answer. If I may ask three supplementary questions. Firstly, would the Minister of State agree that different pre-existing medical conditions have different implications for risk? Secondly, would the Minister of State agree that in an ideal insurance market, pre-existing conditions will have an incremental price for coverage – rather than the insurer refusing to provide cover at all, which is the case that many of my residents have told me when they sought to obtain additional cover beyond MediShield Life. Thirdly, would the Minister of State give his view on whether the Ministry has a role in preventing market failure within the private healthcare insurance industry.",1,63,2016-05-09-T-010-S-00063

2016-05-09-T-010,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"The second question is whether we would look at allowing insurance companies to provide coverage for pre-existing conditions and charge different premiums. I would like to clarify that since MediShield Life was launched on 1 November 2015, we have allowed IP insurers to offer risk-loaded policies where individuals with pre-existing conditions can obtain coverage by paying additional premiums. The premiums will be calculated based on commercial and actuarial considerations, according to the different risks which different pre-existing conditions carry. Importantly, I think it is also useful for us to remember that pre-existing conditions today are already covered by MediShield Life, which is the basic health insurance that we have provided for all Singaporeans, for life.",2,65,2016-05-09-T-010-S-00065
2016-05-09-T-010,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"As for the third question, I think the Member is asking about whether we would look at measures if there is market failure.

2016-05-09-T-011,Chee Hong Tat,The Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat),"In assessing whether palliative care should be covered by IPs, we also need to look at whether the services are affordable for most Singaporeans. Based on data collected by MOH, hospice care is affordable through a combination of Government subsidies, charity dollars and Medisave. About eight out of 10 inpatient hospice bills did not require out-of-pocket cash payment while about nine in 10 home palliative care patients did not have to make out-of-pocket cash payments for their care. Needy patients who require further assistance can receive financial support through Medifund.",2,69,2016-05-09-T-011-S-00069
2016-05-09-T-011,Chee Hong Tat,The Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat),"MOH regularly reviews the amount of Government subsidies and Medisave use for hospice care to ensure it remains affordable for patients and also sustainable for providers. We are also working with community partners to enhance accessibility to palliative care services by increasing capacity for palliative care across the in-patient, home and community settings.",3,70,2016-05-09-T-011-S-00070
2016-05-09-T-011,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"I thank the Minister of State for his answer. Would the Minister of State agree that there is a group of patients who may fall into what some of us term the ""sandwiched class"", who might not qualify for as many subsidies as lower income patients, but at the same time would still want to take advantage of the benefits provided by their Integrated Shield Plans purchased from the private sector when they were healthy. Would the Minister of State agree that at the moment, the present system makes it somewhat unfortunate that these patients can access their Integrated Shield Plan benefits in a restructured hospital but cannot, should they choose to seek end-of-life care at an inpatient hospice?",1,71,2016-05-09-T-011-S-00071
2016-05-09-T-011,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. Today, government subsidies for hospice care, both inpatient hospice care as well as home hospice care, are extended up to the 67th percentile. In addition to government subsidies, the other important source of support for our patients would be charity dollars. This is an area where we work closely with VWOs and charities, and they bring more than financial support. They also bring care and concern, and service from the heart, which is very important for end-of-life care.",1,72,2016-05-09-T-011-S-00072
2016-05-09-T-011,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"The point about IPs and riders, we do have riders that are available, as I explained in my answer. The important point is that this is something which we will have to regularly review. We just started MediShield Life from 1 November last year. It is important for us to focus the scheme on the original intent in which it was set up to do, which is to cover large hospital bills. This is something we can review on an on-going basis to make sure that MediShield Life is able to meet the needs of Singaporeans.",2,73,2016-05-09-T-011-S-00073

The Ministry of Law regularly reviews the means test to ensure that those who are unable to afford to hire a lawyer can still obtain legal advice or representation. In 2013, the Act was amended to allow approximately 25% of Singapore citizens and permanent residents to qualify for legal aid under the means test, up from 17% previously.

We have considered these suggestions. In deciding on the allowable duration for Class 2 label holders, MSF and MND have to take into account the needs of all Class 1 and Class 2 label holders for accessible parking lots. With our ageing population, the number of Class 2 labels issued has also been increasing significantly. We believe that 60 minutes provide a reasonable amount of time for caregivers to ensure that passengers with physical disabilities alight and are in a safe place. Lengthening the time would make it more challenging for other label holders to seek accessible parking lots.",2,101,2016-05-09-T-015-S-00101

We have received several suggestions from members of the public as well, and we would just like to share that in deciding whether to extend or not, we have to look at the needs and demand of all label holders because they are all sharing this shared space. We believe that the 60 minutes given is a reasonable time for the caregivers to board and alight the persons with disabilities, bring that person to a safe place and, following that, go back to the vehicle to park it at the standard lots.

2016-05-09-T-018,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"Mdm Speaker, CPF members with serious medical conditions can apply for an early withdrawal of CPF savings under the CPF Medical Grounds Scheme. The four criteria are  having a terminal illness, permanent incapacitation, suffering from an unsound mind, and having a severely impaired life expectancy.",1,119,2016-05-09-T-018-S-00119
2016-05-09-T-018,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"It is not appropriate to adopt the Critical Illness Framework of the Life Insurance Association as the definition for severely impaired life expectancy, as suggested by the Member. This is because not all their listed medical conditions would result in a severely shortened life expectancy, for example, loss of hearing or loss of speech. Conversely, there may be medical conditions which are not on their list but could still result in a severely shortened life expectancy. We, therefore, require members who wish to make withdrawals on any of these four grounds to have their medical conditions certified by doctors either from public medical institutions or on the CPF Board's panel. In the last two years, the CPF Board approved about 1,000 applications each year.",2,120,2016-05-09-T-018-S-00120
2016-05-09-T-018,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"CPF members who are terminally ill will be able to withdraw all their retirement savings in one lump sum. Members who are permanently incapacitated, suffer from an unsound mind or have a severely impaired life expectancy will be able to make a lump-sum withdrawal from their retirement savings after setting aside a reduced Retirement Sum. Currently, it is $40,300, which is about half the current Basic Retirement Sum.",3,121,2016-05-09-T-018-S-00121
2016-05-09-T-018,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Minister. Is there an existing list of ailments that lead to severely limited life expectancy available for the public to consult, so that they know to apply for the scheme?",1,122,2016-05-09-T-018-S-00122
2016-05-09-T-018,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"My second question is  is this application process accessible for people from all walks of life, especially the elderly who cannot understand English well, and what may be done to make this scheme more accessible to them?",2,123,2016-05-09-T-018-S-00123
2016-05-09-T-018,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The third question is regarding the $5,000 cap for the fourth criterion. How long ago was this cap of $5,000 established and whether there were considerations to increase the cap, given the higher cost of living these days?",3,124,2016-05-09-T-018-S-00124
2016-05-09-T-018,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, firstly, whether there is a list – the answer is no, because it is not possible to have a complete list. Any member who wishes to apply for the scheme, all they need to do is to go see a doctor on our panel. We have a standard form for the doctor to do the certification. CPF Board will basically abide by the assessment of the medical expert.",1,125,2016-05-09-T-018-S-00125
2016-05-09-T-018,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"The second question was about accessibility. Every year we have 1,500 applications. So far, we have not heard of any feedback on lack of accessibility. When members need to use their money in the CPF prematurely, they will come to the CPF. They do not wait for us to reach out to them. Firstly, we do not know who they are; and secondly, once they need the money, based on our experience, they will come. Therefore, we do not think accessibility is an issue.",2,126,2016-05-09-T-018-S-00126
2016-05-09-T-018,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"The last point about the $5,000 cap – if I understand the Member's point correctly – is that the Member is asking whether we should raise the $5,000 cap. I would hesitate to do so because how the cap works is this. A member, having set aside the reduced Retirement Sum, and if the balance is less than $5,000, then they do not qualify under the scheme because the amount is too small. So, in other words, if we were to raise the sum, more and more of them will be deprived of this concession. Therefore, I think for now, I will just keep it at the $5,000 mark.",3,127,2016-05-09-T-018-S-00127
2016-05-09-T-018,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"Just to clarify. For successful applicants for withdrawal of CPF on medical grounds, they can either withdraw the higher of up to $5,000 or the savings after setting aside. So, the cap is actually the higher amount that they can withdraw, therefore, it is not that they will be unsuccessful if they have less than $5,000 in their CPF.",1,128,2016-05-09-T-018-S-00128
2016-05-09-T-018,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for the clarification. On balance, it is about allowing them to withdraw more in lump sum versus keeping some of them for their monthly withdrawal. Our assessment is that for members who are able to meet the reduced Retirement Sum, which currently is set at $40,300 – just to put it into perspective – they would be able to withdraw a monthly sum of only $550 which is derived from the Department of Statistics (DOS) Household Expenditure data for lower income households. $550 will be just sufficient to meet their basic requirements.",1,129,2016-05-09-T-018-S-00129
2016-05-09-T-018,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Another piece of information is that at $550, the amount of $40,300 can last about seven years. It is not all that long. In other words, on the part of CPF, we really have to strike a balance between allowing the member to draw more as a lump sum versus having some of these savings to support their monthly expenditure. On balance, we think $5,000 at this moment, is about the right amount.",2,130,2016-05-09-T-018-S-00130

2016-05-09-T-019,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Teo Ser Luck),"MOM and the tripartite partners also expect employers to implement fair and non-discriminatory employment practices in accordance with the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP). This is why TAFEP, as the advocate and champion for fair employment practices, takes an active role in looking into complaints of such unfair employment practices and refers cases to MOM for enforcement, if found to be true.",2,134,2016-05-09-T-019-S-00134
2016-05-09-T-019,Teo Ser Luck,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Teo Ser Luck),"MOM takes a serious view of all forms of employment discrimination, and if employers are found to have engaged in such unfair employment practices, MOM will take appropriate enforcement actions under the RRA, EA or CDCA. MOM can also suspend their work pass privileges under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act. Any employee who feels discriminated against can approach TAFEP for assistance.",3,135,2016-05-09-T-019-S-00135

2016-05-09-T-019,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Firstly, has the MOM had cases referred by TAFEP or from any other source where employers were allegedly engaged in discrimination for personal attributes, other than age or gender, for example, physical appearance or any other kind of personal attributes? In such cases, what were the tools of enforcement used?",2,137,2016-05-09-T-019-S-00137
2016-05-09-T-019,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),The second question is  have there been any cases of employers who have not been amenable to persuasion or pressure from MOM in such cases and are recalcitrant and refuse to actually amend their discriminatory practices in any way?,3,138,2016-05-09-T-019-S-00138
2016-05-09-T-019,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck,"I thank the Member for the questions. So far, we have received complaints of other attributes besides nationality, age and gender. We have received complaints based on attributes such as race, language, religion, family status and others. Most of the time, we will investigate, gather the evidence and I am encouraged that most of the companies rectified their employment practices.",1,139,2016-05-09-T-019-S-00139
2016-05-09-T-019,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck,"For complaints related to attributes besides nationality, for example, age and gender, the number has remained stable. Age and gender-related complaints accounted for about 20% of total complaints in 2015. We are monitoring the situation and will work with TAFEP closely. Whenever there is a complaint and where there is a need to investigate, we will do so.",2,140,2016-05-09-T-019-S-00140

2016-05-09-T-019,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck,"We are monitoring the situation closely. And so far, the number of complaints has remained stable. What we will do is to continue to educate and create greater awareness. TAFEP, as an advocate for fair employment practices, is enhancing and strengthening its educational efforts. We believe that this approach has worked so far as most employers engaged by TAFEP did rectify their employment practices.",1,142,2016-05-09-T-019-S-00142
2016-05-09-T-020,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked	 the Minister for Transport whether the Tesla Model 3 electric car will be entitled to a rebate under the Carbon Emissions-based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS).,1,143,2016-05-09-T-020-S-00143
2016-05-09-T-020,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Madam, Tesla Motors has just launched the Tesla Model 3 in the United States on 31 March 2016, and only a prototype was displayed. When it is ready to be sold in Singapore, the importers will have to submit its electrical energy consumption information for LTA to assess if it will attract a rebate or a surcharge. If it is as energy efficient as a new Tesla S, a new Tesla 3 car would be entitled to the maximum rebate under our current CEVS.",1,144,2016-05-09-T-020-S-00144
2016-05-09-T-020,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),I thank the Minister for his answer. I would like to ask why is it that there was such a hoo-ha about the Tesla in the previous case. Why is it that there was no rebate?,1,145,2016-05-09-T-020-S-00145
2016-05-09-T-020,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"I suppose Tesla, being a sexy and iconic product, attracts attention. But I think what was lost in the debate was that that particular unit was a second-hand Tesla. In other words, if it were a new Tesla model S, it would have enjoyed the maximum rebate of $30,000. But for all imported second-hand cars, whether electric or otherwise, we have a duty to require the second-hand car to be retested to find out what exactly is the fuel consumption or the CO2emission rate, so that we can apply the rebate or surcharge properly.",1,146,2016-05-09-T-020-S-00146

2016-05-09-T-021,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Madam, we encourage the use of vehicles that are more environmentally-friendly, or green, including electric cars.

So, do follow my example, if you cannot be a 100% public transport user, at least be a part-time public transport user. It is a little bit like being vegetarian, if you cannot do 100% like me, even 初一,十五, just twice a month, is good. [Laughter] So at least one day a week, I use public transport throughout the day. And sometimes, I do two days a week. The greenest form of transport is public transport.

I covered those points during my COS, that driverless vehicles, use of greener fuel like electricity should all be explored. In fact, besides the trial project involving 2,000 charging points and car-sharing, we have two other trials which are going on. One is for buses; one is for taxis, and commercial trucks. We certainly intend Singapore to be among the early adopters, if not, to be among the early pioneers on the use of such technology because we are a city, compact, and especially for electric vehicles, you can cover a long distance with a single charge. I read that for Tesla Model 3, they are talking about covering almost 400 km with one charge. At that rate, you can drive all the way to KL.",1,158,2016-05-09-T-021-S-00158

However, some may have specific reasons to sublet their flats within the MOP, for example, because of full-time work assignments overseas. In such cases, they will have to put up an application to HDB, which will then assess the request on a case-by-case basis. Each approval to sublet within the MOP is for short periods of one or two years. And when these flat owners reoccupy the flat, they will have to make up for the period of subletting to fulfil the MOP.",1,160,2016-05-09-T-022-S-00160

When they quote PRs who bought the units, but never stayed in the unit which has been rented off from day one. I am sure there have been some stories like that coming, sort of complaints.

What are some of the other common reasons which the Ministry assesses before it allows for the deviation of this policy?,1,164,2016-05-09-T-022-S-00164
2016-05-09-T-022,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We look at every case on its own merits. In fact, the most common reason for allowing is for work overseas. That is usually the most common reason why HDB would agree to a request to subletting within the MOP period, that means, the person having bought a HDB flat, for some reason, employers request them to work overseas and then that is a valid reason. There may be other reasons like family circumstances, parents or somebody who have fallen sick and extended periods of time, a resident would appeal on a sympathetic basis or compassionate basis to want to move to take care of an elderly father or mother and would like to do that for a year or so. So, there could be various other reasons like these. And, like I said, we will look at it case-by-case and, if it is valid, HDB would want to support and provide room and leeway for the residents to be able to do so, on the condition, as I have said, that then they would have to make up for that period after they return to their flat.",1,165,2016-05-09-T-022-S-00165

Which agency is responsible for ensuring the proper maintenance of the exhaust system? Number two is that many residents want to have more coffeeshops but few residents understand the inconvenience of staying above the coffeeshop units. Some of the visible damage is repaired post the fire incident but residents have actually fed back that, for example, the floor tiles, it may not be visible right after, and maybe the cracks may appear like six months or a year after.

We now have about 900 GP clinics and 650 dental clinics participating in CHAS. Last year, 650,000 Singaporeans benefited from CHAS subsidies at these clinics. Under CHAS, our Regional Health Systems are working with the private sector to set up Family Medicine Clinics, which focus on chronic disease management.",2,176,2016-05-09-T-024-S-00176

2016-05-09-T-024,Chee Hong Tat,The Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat),"For hospital care, MOH has worked with the private sector to provide subsidised care to our patients. One example is the Emergency Care Collaboration with Raffles Hospital since 2015. Patients can be sent to Raffles Hospital for emergency care, followed by inpatient or specialist outpatient care if required. Charges for Singaporean Citizens and Permanent Residents are similar to what they would pay at our public hospitals. Another example is the collaboration with Parkway Hospitals to receive dengue patients from Changi General Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).",4,178,2016-05-09-T-024-S-00178

We have a portable subsidy scheme with up to 75% subsidy at participating private nursing homes. We work with private and VWO operators to operate aged care facilities, such as nursing homes and eldercare centres. We are also partnering VWO operators to enhance palliative care services. For example, we are providing funding support for the development of the new Assisi Hospice, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year. And as part of this development, we are working with Assisi Hospice to expand its capacity for its inpatient, home and day hospice services so that more end of life patients can benefit.",6,180,2016-05-09-T-024-S-00180

2016-05-09-T-024,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for her question. The collaboration with Raffles Hospital started since 2015. And during the first few months of the collaboration, there were some teething issues, including how to work with the SCDF paramedics so that they know how and where to send the patients to. But since then, I think the arrangement has worked out well. We have got good feedback from patients on their experiences at Raffles Hospital. This is feedback that we collected through surveys.",1,183,2016-05-09-T-024-S-00183

Members might recall that in 2014, the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax purposes (of which Singapore is a member) and the Group of Twenty (G20) major economies, endorsed automatic exchange of information (AEOI) under the CRS as a global standard, and asked all members to commit to a timeline of 2018 or earlier for implementation.

To date, more than 90 jurisdictions, including major financial centres, such as Dubai, Hong Kong, Luxembourg and Switzerland, have also endorsed the CRS and committed to implementation timelines of 2017 or 2018. The proposed amendments in this Bill will enable financial institutions to put in place necessary processes and systems to collect CRS information from 1 January 2017, in order to meet our timeline to commence first exchange of information under the CRS in 2018.",6,196,2016-05-09-T-026-S-00196

The provisions introduced in 2013 provide IRAS the necessary information-gathering powers to fulfil Singapore's role in facilitating FATCA-compliance under the IGA. These powers include the routine collection and transmission of relevant information as well as enforcement powers to sanction non-compliance. The amendments in this Bill make clear that these existing provisions are also applicable to any other AEOI agreement that is in accordance with the CRS.

This is known as the ""Wider Approach"". The ""Wider Approach"" is an effective approach preferred by our financial institutions, because it removes the need for them to repeatedly review whether the accounts are reportable each time Singapore enters into a new Competent Authority Agreement.

It provides support to businesses that make investments to improve their productivity. There is no doubt that the PIC scheme has been a success. As stated by Senior Minister of State Ms Indranee Rajah in March, since inception until January this year, 102,000 companies, or 70%, of all active companies in IRAS' records for the Year of Assessment 2014 have benefited in one way or another from the PIC scheme.

2016-05-09-T-026,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"As previously mentioned also by Senior Minister of State Ms Indranee Rajah, IRAS does conduct rigorous compliance programmes to review and audit PIC claims. However, only 30% of claims from Years of Assessment 2011 to 2015 have been investigated or audited and about 2.1% of these claims investigated required clawback. For Years of Assessment 2011 to 2014, IRAS has clawed back $11 million.",4,206,2016-05-09-T-026-S-00206
2016-05-09-T-026,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"While the percentage requiring clawback seems low, it does represent a significant number of people trying to cheat the system or submitting inaccurate claims perhaps unintentionally and $11 million does seem like a sizable amount of money.",5,207,2016-05-09-T-026-S-00207
2016-05-09-T-026,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Quite clearly, if we investigate and audit the remaining 70% of claims, we will uncover even more cases and have to claw back even more funds.",6,208,2016-05-09-T-026-S-00208
2016-05-09-T-026,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"But what alarms me more are the other figures published in a Straits Times' article, and I quote, ""IRAS has rejected or clawed back the sums paid out to about one in three cash payout claims filed by the self-employed as the claims were inaccurate or false. The sums not given out or recovered from these dubious claims amounted to about $358 million in the last five years.""",7,209,2016-05-09-T-026-S-00209

2016-05-09-T-026,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),I support the proposed amendments to the Income Tax (Amendment No. 2) Bill to allow Singapore to implement the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) with effect from 1 January 2017 – a move that improves our international tax compliance. This is in line with Singapore's commitment to commence automatic exchange of financial account information (AEOI) in 2018.,3,227,2016-05-09-T-026-S-00227
2016-05-09-T-026,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Madam, whilst this remains the goal that Singapore must pursue, we should be under no illusions of the complexity of CRS implementation.

I would like to highlight four areas of concern.",4,228,2016-05-09-T-026-S-00228
2016-05-09-T-026,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"First, we should be mindful of the impact of CRS on Singapore's competitiveness as an international financial centre. Many industry participants are concerned that an overly enthusiastic response at this early implementation stage, imposing more than the required obligations on Financial Institutions (FIs) may hurt the competitiveness and growth of our wealth management industry. It is important to observe the pace adopted by other jurisdictions and consider a measured approach at a prudent pace. Not all countries have signed up, and those who have signed may implement Competent Authority Agreements (CAAs) at different pace. Could the Minister share the impact on Singapore's competitiveness if other financial centres adopt a different approach? How can we ensure a level playing field amongst all major financial centres, including Dubai, Hong Kong, Luxembourg and Switzerland, to minimise regulatory arbitrage?",5,229,2016-05-09-T-026-S-00229
2016-05-09-T-026,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Second, the implementation of CRS and AEOI will add significant compliance costs to FIs. To avoid FIs being overwhelmed by the administrative burden of CRS implementation and the complexity of system enhancements, they will need clear guidance to enable a consistent interpretation of requirements. The industry expects MAS to issue guidance notes that set a reasonable industry standard that strives to balance responsible global compliance with reasonable expectations of responses from FIs. Burdensome complexity brings with it the risk of non-compliance and its accompanying cost of penalties.",6,230,2016-05-09-T-026-S-00230
2016-05-09-T-026,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Madam, the guidance must be sufficiently meaningful so as to enable FIs to determine tax residency consistently across banks. For example, it is common for FI clients to maintain multiple residences or they may travel so frequently they have no tax residency status. Another example is how will information that Singapore receives on offshore income of Singapore resident taxpayers be used, collected and shared? Different FIs may hold differing reading of the same individual's tax status. So, I would like to ask the Minister how we could take a more nuanced approach that would provide greater clarity for industry players to deal with issues of tax residency.",7,231,2016-05-09-T-026-S-00231
2016-05-09-T-026,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"FIs should be expected to do the necessary due diligence to establish the clients' tax residency. But, to a large extent, FIs will have to rely on their clients' declarations or what their clients declare to them – is that good enough, or will the FIs be expected to corroborate those declarations, and how far are they expected to go to do so? To what extent will FIs be culpable for inaccurate declarations?",8,232,2016-05-09-T-026-S-00232
2016-05-09-T-026,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Third, we must ensure that a robust process is in place to determine the readiness of bilateral partners of CAAs before bilateral information exchanges commence.

However, we need to guard against regulatory arbitrage, implementation complexity, and systemic leakage and misuse of information exchange. FI clients must ready themselves for a new age of unprecedented transparency and big changes to tax regimes, as governments work hard to get what is due their peoples.

He suggested that IRAS audit and investigate more PIC claims. IRAS takes a risk-based approach in its enforcement, and this 30% is not a fixed rule. The 71,000 claims were identified for investigation or audit based on the use of analytics and risk profiling, as well as the experience of the IRAS investigators. Of these 71,000 claims, about 44,000 claims or 62%, were rejected upfront even before any cash was disbursed. Hence, there was no need for a claw-back.

In 2010, we hit our lowest number of citizen births at just over 30,000 babies born. In 2012, in the Chinese zodiac Year of the Dragon, citizen births increased to over 33,000 babies. The good news is that citizen births in the last two years have matched the auspicious Year of the Dragon. And in fact, last year citizen births almost hit 34,000 babies, the highest in a decade.

Middle income families just managing to make ends meet to support three children would need to lock up $24,000 in the CDA to reap the full benefits of dollar-for-dollar matching from the Government. Furthermore, as the quantum increases from $6,000 for each of the first two children, to $12,000 each for the third and fourth child, and $18,000 each for the fifth child and beyond, this actually encourages higher income couples who could make the larger savings to have more children.",8,278,2016-05-09-T-027-S-00278

We have the benefit of hindsight in the struggle against low birth rates for nearly 30 years now. Singapore's TFR fell below the replacement level of 2.1 in 1976 and reached the first low of 1.4 in 1986. In 1987, the Government's policy reversal from promoting birth control to encouraging Singaporeans to have more children, helped push the birth rate up in the following years. Many of the young couples having children today were born during the mini-baby boom caused by the policy reversal.",10,280,2016-05-09-T-027-S-00280

2016-05-09-T-027,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"So, what are the lessons here? First, the Government's pro-birth policy is important and can be effective in halting or slowing down birth rate declines. However, most of the pro-birth policy changes have been reactive rather than proactive. The 1987 reversal reacting to the low in 1986, the Baby Bonus scheme reacting to the low in 2001, and the enhancements in the last few years reacting to the lowest in 2010. This reactiveness limits the effectiveness of pro-birth policies.",12,282,2016-05-09-T-027-S-00282
2016-05-09-T-027,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Instead of reacting to plunges and new lows in birth rates, I believe the Government should set a target of achieving a TFR of 1.4 in 2020 and a TFR of 1.7 by 2030. This will change the tone of the issue from being marked as a demographic problem to be struggled with to a performance target to be achieved, on par with many of the Government's socio-economic policies. After all, the TFR is as much a socio-economic issue as it is a demographic issue.",13,283,2016-05-09-T-027-S-00283
2016-05-09-T-027,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The other lesson to be had here is that policies need to go beyond the carrot-and-stick approach and take a whole-of-Government approach to be effective over the long run. In this respect, there is one dot that the Government has not connected to the birth rate issue, and it should. One reason why pro-birth policies seem to be swimming against the tide in the 1990s and 2000s was because Singaporeans experienced growing socio-economic inequality and lingering gender inequality in those two decades. Equality matters for increasing birth rates. This has been shown in many studies in other developed countries. And on this issue, I would like to make three points.",14,284,2016-05-09-T-027-S-00284
2016-05-09-T-027,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"First, gender equality matters a whole lot. As more fathers take on more responsibility in childcare, pro-birth policies such as those promoting flexi-work arrangements should adapt to help fathers realise their parenting aspirations. As employer and management mind-sets start to change due to the Government's promotion of flexi-work arrangements through the Work-Life Grant, it would be important to help mould the new mind-sets to emphasise flexi-work arrangements are not meant only or mainly for working mothers, but should be made as accessible to working fathers too.",15,285,2016-05-09-T-027-S-00285
2016-05-09-T-027,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"In this respect, the Government will need to change its own mind-set that establishes a hard association between mothers and child care.

This is so as to emphasise in our laws that the State does not place the burden of birth rates and thus the blame of low births solely on the motivations of women but recognise that the decision to have children and the raising of children is the shared responsibility of both spouses. The wording of the Child Development Co-Savings Act should be thoroughly looked at to emphasise this shared responsibility to have and raise more children.",17,287,2016-05-09-T-027-S-00287
2016-05-09-T-027,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Also, since the Act has expanded beyond the original monetary co-savings carrot, the Government should also consider renaming the Act to reflect the contents more accurately and better symbolically, perhaps as the Family Life Promotion Act.",18,288,2016-05-09-T-027-S-00288
2016-05-09-T-027,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Second, we should extend the equality of benefits to all men and women who are parents of Singaporean children as far as possible. This includes single unwed parents and also the non-citizen spouses of Singaporeans. This may not seem related to the birth rates of married citizen couples at first glance. But we are all social beings living in communities of shared interests in the first instance, not detached individuals with selfish interests. As we have seen in this House, Members from across the political spectrum have strongly empathised with single unwed mothers. There is something universal in this sentiment, as those of us who have or aspire to have children cannot bear to see other children suffer through no fault of their own. Extending equality to all parents of Singaporean children cultivates positive sentiment for having babies and raising children.",19,289,2016-05-09-T-027-S-00289
2016-05-09-T-027,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Extending eligibility for the CDA co-savings grant to the children of single unwed parents is a good first step. The next step is to consider extending the Baby Bonus Cash Gift to the same children, but perhaps to be deposited into the CDA so that the grant may be locked up for the sole benefit of the children.",20,290,2016-05-09-T-027-S-00290
2016-05-09-T-027,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"It is also a good time to look at the housing needs of children of single unwed parents. As it is, this group of single parents is prevented from buying a new or resale HDB flat until they are 35 years old to go under the Single Singapore Citizen Scheme. This creates an unacceptable inequality where permanent residents benefit more from HDB home ownership than a group of citizens. More importantly, the children are denied a stable physical and social environment to grow up in to focus on their schooling and playing.",21,291,2016-05-09-T-027-S-00291
2016-05-09-T-027,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),The empathy for suffering Singaporean children and their parents also extends to non-citizen spouses who struggle with residential security due to the need to constantly renew visit passes. The Government should alleviate the stress and separation anxieties faced by the Singaporean spouses and children in such situations. I reiterate The Workers' Party's call for foreign spouses of Singaporean citizens to be given priority for citizenship naturalisation after five years on the Long Term Visit Pass Plus.,22,292,2016-05-09-T-027-S-00292
2016-05-09-T-027,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Third, socio-economic inequality matters, and so, therefore socio-economic equality matters. Singaporeans are economically rational and both short-term and long-term financial security affects their decisions to have more babies. The CDA First Step grant is a welcome move towards narrowing the gap in child development resources between low-income and high-income households. The Government should bring this policy move to its logical conclusion by automatically allocating to the CDA a standardised $10,000 for each child. It is then up to the parents to match the grant by topping up the CDA up to another $10,000 to earn higher interest and earmark savings for the child's education and well-being. The Government could create incentives for parents to make the additional savings by making the savings eligible for income tax reliefs.",23,293,2016-05-09-T-027-S-00293
2016-05-09-T-027,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The reason we are calling for a standardised grant for each child instead of the stepwise $6,000, $12,000 and $18,000 formula for the CDA grants is because short-term financial security is a factor, especially for lower income and middle-income households. The stepwise formula is meant to be carrots to entice parents to have three babies or more, but ignores the fact that the immediate stress and cost of raising existing children would put off parents from deciding on the third baby. Giving a bigger grant for the existing children would alleviate the immediate stress, encourage a healthy family life and persuade parents that it is worth the while to have a third child and more.",24,294,2016-05-09-T-027-S-00294
2016-05-09-T-027,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Equalising the grants would also remove an artificial inequality within the family created by the policy. With the current policy, the third and fourth child could receive up to $12,000 more savings and grants compared to the first and second child, and the fifth child onwards could receive up to $24,000 more. This means that the older children would have less funds benefiting their education and well-being compared to the younger children.",25,295,2016-05-09-T-027-S-00295
2016-05-09-T-027,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Mdm Speaker, I am cautiously optimistic that we are at the crossroads of turning around our declining birth rates. I am cautiously optimistic that the Government has finally found the verve after three decades to stop blaming Singaporeans for not choosing to have babies and to start addressing the structural obstacles to enable Singaporeans to have more babies. As the lessons of three decades show, the Government cannot be reactive towards lower birth rates and should be proactive to aim for higher birth rates. And as the Government seeks to enable and empower Singaporeans to have more babies, please remember these two words as a key principle to guide pro-birth policy  equality matters. On this note, I support the Bill.",26,296,2016-05-09-T-027-S-00296

Many of the suggestions come from both sides of the House, and many members of the public out there. And many ideas, many different suggestions; some initiatives are carried out in other countries; some have worked better; some have not worked as well. Sometimes, it is also contextual and depending on the cultural context. Broadly, we do want to look at not just carrots and sticks, but really the overall environment is important.

We know that this has been an issue that many have been championing for some time. It is something I personally felt very strongly about. I have noted that they would like the Government to extend to unwed mothers the same high level of support we give to married mothers on all fronts.,6,324,2016-05-09-T-027-S-00324

2016-05-09-T-027,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Firstly, the benefits extended must directly contribute to the child's development or caregiving needs. So that is one motivating reason. Secondly, the benefits must also support the unwed parent's efforts to provide for the child. Lastly, it is also important for us to remember that we do want to encourage families to have children within the confines of parenthood and within the confines of marriage. I think this is to the prevailing prevalent social norm and we all would agree that it is always best for children to grown up in that environment and that is something that we want to continue to encourage.",8,326,2016-05-09-T-027-S-00326
2016-05-09-T-027,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I think it is also important – we have said this several times, but I would like to repeat this here again – it is important to note that while there might be some differentiation for unwed parents, the children of these unwed parents do continue to be provided for on many fronts. It would be not correct to say that they are deprived of everything else. Yes, there are some differences. We have equalised some of it in my recent moves. But I want to emphasise that we do want to support the growth and development of all Singapore citizen children, regardless of the marital status of their parents. For example, the benefits include education, healthcare subsidies, Medisave grant for newborns, centre-based infant and childcare subsidies and foreign domestic worker levy concession. All working parents, regardless of their marital status, are also eligible for infant care leave, child care leave before the child turns seven, and extended childcare leave when the child is seven to 12 years old.

More importantly, the support you give your staff to better manage their work-life responsibilities, will enhance their loyalty and productivity as well. Employers who go the extra mile will also attract talent, especially in today's tight labour market.

But many of us will also know that we do have choices to make. Oftentimes, we cite reasons – work and so on – but sometimes we are also distracted by our own preoccupations. The question is  are we prepared to put in the sacrifices, are we prepared to put in the time? Instead of spending time with our friends watching football somewhere else, spending time with children, and so on and so forth.

So, it is important for us to be more active, to play a vigilant role.

The Mental Capacity Act was passed in 2008 and it introduced two frameworks to deal with the issues arising from the lack of mental capacity.

2016-05-09-T-028,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),Clause 50 of the Bill amends the Wills Act to expressly confer our Courts with the power to order rectification of a will upon application of any interested person.

2016-05-09-T-028,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to seek some clarifications on the amendments being made to the Wills Act, the Government Proceedings Act and the Legal Profession Act. I declare that I am a lawyer with a Practising Certificate in force.",1,391,2016-05-09-T-028-S-00391
2016-05-09-T-028,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, the Wills Act. Clause 50 of the Bill will introduce a new provision to the Wills Act. The new section 28 will allow a court to order that a will be rectified if the court is satisfied that the will is expressed in such a way that it fails to carry out the testator's intention due to a clerical error or a failure to understand the testator's instructions, or both. This provision seems to be influenced by legislation in other countries, such as the UK Administration of Justice Act 1982, which contains a section 20 similar in wording to the Bill. I have noted that an NUS law academic, Assoc Prof Barry Crown, had recommended that our Wills Act be amended to include such a statutory right to rectify a will to bring more certainty to this area of the law. This is because a 2014 case decided by the UK Supreme Court had suggested that the courts had a common law right to rectify wills even if there is no statutory right, and it is probably more prudent to legislate the right to make clear what powers the court should have.",2,392,2016-05-09-T-028-S-00392
2016-05-09-T-028,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Nevertheless, the UK case in question, Marley v Rawlings, also raises questions about how wide the power under the new provision should be. In that case, a husband and wife made mirror wills to leave their entire estate to a non-family member. But each spouse signed the other spouse's will by mistake. Clearly, the lawyer's office was at fault in not checking that the wills were executed by the proper party. What the court did in that case was to exercise the statutory power under the Administration of Justice Act to rectify the wills by replacing wholesale the words of each will with the text of the other spouse's will. This is way beyond the usual understanding of rectification being the adding or omitting of certain words only. Is the Ministry intending the court to have such a wide rectification power?",3,393,2016-05-09-T-028-S-00393
2016-05-09-T-028,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),I would also like a confirmation about the implication of such a provision on lawyers who have been negligent in drafting wills or in will execution. How will this provision save them from being liable for negligence? Will clients be expected to go to court first to try to rectify the will before suing lawyers for negligence? This would put a heavy burden on clients.,4,394,2016-05-09-T-028-S-00394
2016-05-09-T-028,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, Government Proceedings Act. The Government Proceedings Act enables the Government to sue and to be sued. Clause 9 of the Bill amends section 29 of the Act to provide that, in such law suits, it is possible that the court can certify that legal costs for more than two Government lawyers may be payable. This is a change from the current position where the maximum number of Government lawyers a litigant may have to pay for is two. According to the explanatory note, the change is to bring the position in line with that in other civil suits and family matters. The current position in other civil suits and family matters is that the court may order a litigant who loses to pay legal costs for more than two solicitors on the winning side. In order for such a court order to be obtained, the court must find that more than two lawyers were reasonably required to handle the case due to factors, such as the complexity of the case or novel points of law being raised.",5,395,2016-05-09-T-028-S-00395
2016-05-09-T-028,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, I have concerns about the Government taking such a position as the prospect of a very heavy legal burden in legal costs could have a dampening or even crushing effect on persons involved in suits against the Government. As it currently stands, anyone who is thinking of suing the Government or defending a legal action by the Government is aware that if the action is lost, he would likely have to pay legal costs to the Government. This is on top of funding his own lawyers to meet the fierce challenges thrown by the Government's legal team whose limitless resources include having the entire Legal Service and Civil Service at its disposal. Not many individuals or entities have the financial resources needed to take the Government to court or to defend a suit by the Government.",6,396,2016-05-09-T-028-S-00396
2016-05-09-T-028,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I believe the Government should consider taking a broader view on this matter and keep the current provision of capping its claim for legal costs to no more than two legal officers. After all, the purpose of the Government Proceedings Act is to enable the Government to sue and to be sued. If the costs of suing or being sued by the Government are too high, people will surrender. There must not be a signal sent that the Government is trying to use the prospect of crushing legal costs to deter or wear down those who may wish to sue the Government or to defend Government law suits vigorously.",7,397,2016-05-09-T-028-S-00397
2016-05-09-T-028,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Lastly, Madam, the Legal Profession Act. Clause 16 of the Bill makes various amendments to the Legal Profession Act. My query relates to clauses 16(t) and (u) which deal with the disciplinary proceedings against lawyers who have misconducted themselves. Under clauses 16(t) and (u), the Minister may make rules to exempt lawyers from disciplinary action if they had given gratifications or remuneration to those who procure business for themselves or other lawyers under circumstances to be prescribed in the rules. The act of giving gratifications for procuring legal services is generally abhorrent to the profession. What sorts of exemptions are being contemplated and under what circumstances?",8,398,2016-05-09-T-028-S-00398

2016-05-09-T-028,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Firstly, the proposed amendment to the Community Mediation Centres Act removes the requirement for the Director of a Community Mediation Centre (CMC) to prepare and submit to the Minister an annual report on the activities, operations and use of the CMC.

2016-05-09-T-028,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Based on my house visits and Meet-the-People Sessions, I sense an increasing number of neighbourly disputes.

This Bill seeks to make several amendments to about 51 Acts, most of which are mainly technical in nature.

2016-05-09-T-028,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"From an accountability point of view, when a Community Mediation Centre is established by the Government and funded by the Government, and the Director and staff are deemed public servants, surely the Director should continue to provide a report to the Minister. This is to allow proper accountability of civil servants to the Executive arm of the Government. I am also of the view that the Minister ought to continue to lay the report before Parliament and account for the activities and efficacy of the Community Mediation Centres. So, if I could ask the Minister to clarify the rationale for repealing section 21 of the Community Mediation Centres Act.",3,411,2016-05-09-T-028-S-00411

Mdm Speaker, there was a recent case involving an engineer who had lost mental capacity following an accident.

Let me cite the section 22(2) which has been substituted. It says  ""Where it appears to the Commissioner that compensation or interest is payable to an employee under this Act and the employee lacks capacity within the meaning of the Mental Capacity Act, before such payment is made, it is lawful for the Commissioner to receive and pay the compensation or interest to any one or more of the dependants of the employee for the benefit of the employee, even if there is no donee of a Lasting Power of Attorney which is granted by the employee under the Mental Capacity Act and under which the employee confers on the donee authority to receive the compensation or interest, and even if there is no deputy who is appointed or deemed to be appointed for the employee by the court under the Mental Capacity Act and who is conferred power to receive compensation or interest"".",5,413,2016-05-09-T-028-S-00413

However, we do agree that information on the activities and the operations of the CMC should be available to the public.

So, in other words, wherever you see deputy, the donee will have the same standing. This particular amendment is not intended to address the larger question, which is whether other third parties are entitled to file claims or receive compensation under WICA. There has been a recent decision by the Court of Appeal, as Mr Lim has alluded to, on this wider issue, and MOM is studying the implications of this decision. So, at the present time, it would be premature for me to make any remarks on that at this moment.

In May 2013, the report on the 4th Committee on the Supply of Lawyers identified three main factors as causing or contributing to attrition amongst legal professionals. They were unsustainable work practices, unsuitability of the individual legal professional for legal work and structural problems within law firms.",6,425,2016-05-09-T-028-S-00425
2016-05-09-T-028,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"To address this issue of attrition, the 4th Committee recommended for the two existing local law schools that they should consider a more targeted selection of law school applicants, and to help prepare young graduates early for the realities of practice, for example, by expanding clinical legal programmes currently offered. And to address the work-life balance concerns, by providing flexibility in legal practice, for example, allowing flexible schedules or different career tracks for lawyers and by providing greater support and welfare, for example, by providing lawyers with tools to create a better working environment.",7,426,2016-05-09-T-028-S-00426
2016-05-09-T-028,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Tackling these issues will take time and require a concerted effort on the part of the law schools and the legal profession as a whole. Steps are being taken to look into this. The Law Society is presently conducting a study to look into how junior lawyers can be encouraged to stay in practice which, in turn, will help the number of lawyers in this middle category. The findings of their study should be available later in the year.",8,427,2016-05-09-T-028-S-00427
2016-05-09-T-028,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"There are also longer term initiatives which have taken these concerns into account. For example, the third law school at UniSIM will select its students based not just on academic ability but also aptitude, attitude and interest in the practice of family and criminal law. Their curriculum will be practice-oriented, culminating in a six-month practicum training, so that students will be better prepared and equipped for the realities of practice. So, this will deal, to some extent, with the second problem identified by the 4th Committee, in relation to the unsuitability of individuals for legal work.",9,428,2016-05-09-T-028-S-00428

It represents five cohorts of lawyers – those between seven and 12 years of standing. In comparison, the junior and senior categories represent lawyers under seven years' standing and not less than 12 years' standing respectively, which is a larger number of cohorts. In addition, the statistics relate to the number of lawyers who remain in private practice in law firms. Some of those who leave private practice remain in the legal profession as in-house counsel in the private sector, or by joining the public sector, or academia. Others move into other industries, such as investment banking, fund management, private equity, where their legal skills come in useful, and they continue to make a meaningful contribution to the wider economy.",10,429,2016-05-09-T-028-S-00429

What is driving this amendment was the Singapore Court of Appeal's decision in Cheo Yeo & Associates and another where the Court of Appeal held obiter that the remedy of rectification of wills is not available in Singapore. The Court of Appeal's decision strongly suggested that where a will fails to embody the intentions of the testator due to a clerical error or a failure to understand the testator's intention, the Singapore courts do not have the power to correct the error in the will.",11,430,2016-05-09-T-028-S-00430

2016-05-09-T-028,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"My third clarification concerns the cost of Government proceedings. She mentioned that this does not give the Government additional powers but the fact is that under the existing section 29 of the Government Proceedings Act (GPA), the cost claimable is limited to two. So, this amendment would actually give an allowance for the court to certify more than two lawyers' costs being payable. So, it is a change to the legal position as far as the GPA is concerned. I have my grave reservations for this clause for the reasons I stated earlier.",3,436,2016-05-09-T-028-S-00436

So, it is not intended to be used in an oppressive manner but really where if costs are incurred, it gives the court the discretion to allow costs for more than two counsel, if the court really thinks that this is an appropriate case to do so.

The point here, of course, is that when you have the Government on one side of a legal proceeding and perhaps a private individual or private entity on the other side, you are dealing with an inequality of resources in most cases. The Government with its Legal Officers, having the whole Civil Service there, the prospect of a litigant going into litigation with the Government and sustaining that litigation, I think it is already prohibitive to most people.",1,441,2016-05-09-T-028-S-00441

First, it was prompted by our Court of Appeal's decision, but when the Government drafted these provisions, the Government did look at the UK case and some of the wording was based on that. That is as far as I can go. Obviously when our courts apply it, and when they look at other precedents, our courts will have to give effect to the law as our courts see correct.

So, you have no choice whether you think you are being wrongly or rightly prosecuted, but because you look at the cost, you say, ""Oh let's forget about it, let's pay.""",1,455,2016-05-09-T-028-S-00455

That the people who feel somehow victimised by the Government are intimidated by the cost; you do not know how much the court is going to decide. In the past, you said, ""Ok, it is limited to two lawyers"", but now there will be more.

We have therefore prioritised our funding to target the purchase of essential mobility equipment, rather than maintenance and repair, including battery replacement.

2016-05-09-T-038,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"We have studied the practices of countries that have longer histories of facilitating the use of bicycles and personal mobility devices (PMDs). As PMDs are generally safe, most of these countries do not mandate helmets and insurance for cyclists or PMD users. In our case, PMDs are not allowed on roads and have to abide by speed limits of 15km/h on footpaths and 25km/h on shared and cycling paths. These rules provide further safeguards to pedestrians. We are aware that some cyclists and PMDs voluntarily wear helmets or buy insurance as added precaution. For now, we have decided not to impose additional costs on everyone by making helmets and insurance compulsory. Let us monitor the situation and keep an open mind on whether a change is warranted in future.",1,502,2016-05-09-T-038-S-00502
2016-05-09-T-038,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"At the same time, we need to educate users and enforce against those who flout the rules.

2016-05-09-T-041,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"In August 2012, taxis were taken out of the COE bidding process. Taxi operators are allowed to pay the CAT A Prevailing Quota Premium for their COEs, regardless of the model of taxi being registered, in recognition of their public transport role. The Taxi Availability standards were also introduced, and taxi operators can grow their fleets by up to 2% per annum, subject to them meeting the standards. Since the introduction of the standards, more taxis are plying the roads to serve commuters especially during peak hours, and the taxis are being more efficiently utilised.

2016-05-09-T-048,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak,asked the Minister for Home Affairs given the recent spate of multiple-vehicle pile-ups on our highway (a) how often are reviews made for the L-drivers' syllabus conducted by driving centres and schools so that what is taught is relevant to current road traffic conditions; and (b) how are driving instructors regulated to ensure that they keep up-to-date.,1,530,2016-05-09-T-048-S-00530
2016-05-09-T-048,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The recent multiple-vehicle pile-ups have mainly been caused by motorists' failure to keep a proper lookout or to maintain proper control of their vehicles. These core driving skills are already included in the driving school syllabus for learner motorists. The syllabus for learner motorists includes both theory and practical components and is designed to teach the basics of driving. The syllabus is regularly reviewed to ensure that it remains up to date with the latest road traffic rules and regulations and the road safety situation. Over the last few years, Traffic Police has updated the syllabus to include new elements such as driving on slope for those learning to drive automatic-transmission motor cars, and emergency braking on wet surfaces and expressway familiarisation for those learning to ride motorcycles.",1,531,2016-05-09-T-048-S-00531
2016-05-09-T-048,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,The syllabus is taught by driving instructors who are regulated by the Traffic Police through a licensing regime stipulated under the Road Traffic Act and the Road Traffic (Driving Instructors and Driving Schools) Rules. Driving instructors at the driving schools take an annual Instructors' Skill & Knowledge Evaluation to ensure that they continue to keep up-to-date.,2,532,2016-05-09-T-048-S-00532
2016-05-09-T-048,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Learner motorists have to complete the syllabus and pass the driving test before obtaining a driving licence. Beyond learning driving and passing the driving test, motorists have to continue to drive safely and obey traffic rules when on the road. This is especially relevant in our efforts to improve road safety and reduce accidents. Traffic Police will continue to educate road users and step up enforcement efforts to maintain safety on our roads.",3,533,2016-05-09-T-048-S-00533
2016-05-09-T-049,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong,asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many fires have broken out in the last three years in coffeeshops in HDB blocks with residential units located above them; (b) whether there are specific fire safety provisions pertaining to these coffeeshops; (c) whether the Ministry will consider strengthening the fire safety provisions for these coffeeshops including the mandatory installation of automatic sprinkler systems so as to protect residents living above the coffeeshops.,1,534,2016-05-09-T-049-S-00534
2016-05-09-T-049,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In the last three years, a total of 33 fires have broken out in coffeeshops in HDB blocks with residential units located above them. There were 14 such fires in 2013, 12 in 2014, and 7 in 2015.",1,535,2016-05-09-T-049-S-00535
2016-05-09-T-049,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Fire Code, which is administered under the Fire Safety Act, stipulates fire safety requirements in buildings, including coffeeshops that are sited within HDB blocks. The requirements applicable to coffeeshops include the provision of ventilation openings for smoke dispersion, and separation of kitchens via fire-resistant walls if open flame-cooking appliances are used, in order to reduce the risk of fire spreading to other adjoining spaces. Alternatively the Fire Code requires that the kitchens be equipped with fire-extinguishing systems to minimise the risk of fire spreading. There are also a number of other risk mitigation requirements.",2,536,2016-05-09-T-049-S-00536
2016-05-09-T-049,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) has been working closely with HDB to ensure that operators of food and beverage (F&B) outlets in HDB premises including coffeeshops, comply with the fire safety measures. The SCDF also partners the National Environment Agency (NEA) to advise NEA food establishment licensees to clean the exhaust systems and ductings in their regular maintenance regimes.",3,537,2016-05-09-T-049-S-00537
2016-05-09-T-049,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The SCDF takes a risk-based approach, assessing the benefit of any requirement, against the risks. The current SCDF requirements take into account that the fires at coffeeshops in HDB blocks over the past three years have been confined to the affected premises, with no fire spread to the residential units above the coffeeshops.",4,538,2016-05-09-T-049-S-00538

2016-05-09-T-050,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In regulating the moneylending industry, we seek to maintain a balance between protecting borrowers and ensuring that there is reasonable access to credit from licensed sources. Over the last three years, there has been an increasing trend in terms of the value of loans granted by the industry. During the same period, a number of measures were also introduced to strengthen protection for borrowers, such as controls on interest rates and fees which were implemented in 2015. We will be implementing further regulatory changes in the coming months.",3,542,2016-05-09-T-050-S-00542

2016-05-09-T-053,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Singapore is a city-state, and unlike other countries with large land mass, Singapore has to accommodate all our needs within limited land. Nonetheless, we recognise the value of these greenery and biodiversity systems and make a constant effort to sustain them. Today, there are four gazetted Nature Reserves and 20 recognised Nature Areas in Singapore. Nature Reserves and Nature Areas make up about 5% and 3% of Singapore’s land area respectively. Together, they occupy about 5,400 hectares. This is a significant size, and is equivalent to about eight Ang Mo Kio towns, or almost half of all housing land in Singapore.",1,552,2016-05-09-T-053-S-00552
2016-05-09-T-053,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In addition to setting aside land for Nature Reserves and Nature Areas, we have been adopting unique solutions to conserve nature in our urban setting.
