2016-10-10-T-002,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,asked	 the Minister for Social and Family Development what are the safeguards to prevent an increase in online gambling addiction in light of the pending approval of exempted online providers.,1,6,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00006
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Mdm Speaker, before I answer the Member's question in full, I thought it would be useful to provide a setting because this and the next Parliamentary Question (PQ) involve related issues.",1,7,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00007
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Firstly, from the Government's perspective, we are very clear about the issues concerning problem gambling. For my Ministry, we see the extent of the problems because we deal with the individuals and their families who suffer from it. This is the reality that we grapple with. We do not under-estimate the impact that problem gambling has on individuals as well as families. We are not in favour of gambling; we do not encourage it; and we do not want to promote it amongst our people. We share fairly similar perspectives that many Members have with regard to this issue.",2,8,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00008
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"However, taking that position does not preclude the fact that gambling will exist. It is something that others who engage in it have different viewpoints on. Like it or not, it is something that people participate in, in some form or other. By banning it, what will happen? Will it just drive it underground? Our basic concern really is this  as far as remote gambling is concerned, it is an area that is growing. We look at what is happening around the world; it is proliferating; it is growing significantly. In Singapore, where the Internet penetration rate is particularly significant and smart devices abound, there is a very high probability that this is something that would become more of an issue with time.",3,9,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00009
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"We share very significant concerns with regard to that, which is why two years ago, we debated in this House the Remote Gambling Act. In that Act, there were the provisions for the exempt operator regime, because we believe that even though we may take a very robust position with regard to managing this space, we are all familiar with the Internet – it is impossible to completely regulate it. There will be ways to bypass – by VPN, proxy sites and so on – for those who wish to engage in online gambling.",4,10,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00010
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"We recognise the reality. While we take a very robust position, having a tightly managed, controlled space with safeguards put in place would allow those who continue to gamble online to have a space where at least some level of management can take place.",5,11,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00011
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),That is the approach that we are taking with this issue at hand today.,6,12,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00012
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"We take a whole-of-Government approach. MSF works very closely with MHA to develop a range of social safeguards for the exempt operators (EOs) to implement, to protect young persons and other vulnerable persons from the harms of remote gambling.",7,13,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00013
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"To prevent youth gambling, all account holders must be at least 21 years old before they can open a remote gambling account. The EOs have to carry out stringent checks to verify the identity of the applicant, such as a face-to-face verification at physical outlets with a valid NRIC/FIN and screening of existing casino exclusions with the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG), before an account can be opened.",8,14,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00014
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"To protect financially vulnerable individuals, persons who have been excluded from casinos due to family objection or their financial situation will not be allowed to open an individual account. Individuals can also apply to exclude themselves from remote gambling.",9,15,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00015
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"To prevent over-spending and addiction, all account holders will be required to set a daily expenditure limit and funding limit before they are allowed to place bets. Funding limit means the maximum amount that can be transferred or deposited into the account per calendar day, while expenditure limit means the maximum amount that can be used for betting per calendar day. Once they have reached their expenditure limits, they will no longer be allowed to place any bets for the rest of the day. As an additional safeguard, any request to increase their expenditure limit will only take place the next day, while requests to reduce their expenditure limit will be effective immediately.",10,16,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00016
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"To facilitate informed play, the EOs are required to display responsible gambling messages prominently, such as the time and amount spent, the total win/losses for the day, and alert the individual if he has reached or exceeded 75% of his daily expenditure limit.",11,17,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00017
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Lastly, the EOs will be required to submit all advertising and promotion (A&P) materials to MSF for approval. Advertisements and promotions must not induce gambling.",12,18,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00018
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"NCPG has been active in rolling out prevention programmes to complement the stringent safeguards for remote gambling. For example, NCPG partners TOUCH Cyber Wellness and Fei Yue Community Services to deliver cyber wellness roadshows and talks to students and parents. NCPG also launches public education campaigns and videos to highlight the risks of problem gambling. One of the recent videos has a backdrop of sports betting and illegal online betting, to educate youths on spotting the signs of problem gambling and helping their friends in need. Another features popular getai emcee Wang Lei relating his struggles with problem gambling and the importance of family support in helping him recover from problem gambling.",13,19,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00019
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"While the Government puts in place stringent safeguards, complemented with NCPG's public education efforts, personal responsibility as well as family and community support are still essential to address this complex issue of problem gambling.",14,20,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00020
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Essentially, what we are doing is to put in place a robust set of laws to have a tightly managed space with safeguards, having an extensive effort as much as possible to raise awareness and have public education and provide support measures for those with these issues. We all understand the ills that come with this. We all would like to take a strong position with regard to this and we do take that, although we also recognise the reality is that, given the Internet space, we would not be able to completely remove the possibility of people gambling online. We believe that having a tightly managed space with safeguards put in place would help at least to ameliorate some of those concerns, even as we continue to work hard on the other measures in place.",15,21,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00021
2016-10-10-T-002,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Minister for the response. May I ask two questions? First, if, after the EOs start their trade, the number of Singaporeans moving into online gambling increases, will the Government review its decision regarding the two exemptions? Secondly, if the number of online gambling addiction cases increases as a result of the exemptions, will the Government reconsider the exemptions?",1,22,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00022
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker,  firstly, with regard to online gambling, today, it is very difficult to track the specific numbers online. We do carry out surveys to have a sense of the number of people who are gambling and how many of them are gambling online. We will track the numbers and see how those compare over time, but we do not have definitive numbers of who exactly are online today. We are not able to fully track that. We will track in terms of survey, in terms of responses and see how those numbers grow and we will assess the situation accordingly.",1,23,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00023
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Similarly, with gambling addiction, we find through surveys, the overall numbers have largely remained quite stable. We do see more coming forward to seek treatment. That, we believe, is also due to greater awareness and public education. Again, in terms of data, as we begin to track some of these things more definitely, we are able to then detect trends and patterns to see how we can deal with it accordingly. If we need to tighten measures and review policies, we will continue to do so.",2,24,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00024
2016-10-10-T-002,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Mr de Souza, you have another question?",1,25,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00025
2016-10-10-T-002,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,"I am grateful, Mdm Speaker. I thank the Minister for the response. In my view, there is actually a basis for comparison. The Bill was debated in October 2014; it came into force in February 2015; it is now October 2016. That would mean 20 months of a total ban. So, there is a comparison. My question is  how many were gambling online illegally during that 20-month total ban period? My suggestion is to compare that figure with the numbers after the exemptions. That is a possible test, in my humble view.",1,26,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00026
2016-10-10-T-002,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,"My questions are  if the online gambling cases go up, would the Minister consider removing the exemptions and implement a complete ban?",2,27,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00027
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, I am not sure how the Member believes that we would be able to know exactly how many people are illegally gambling online. We are not able to track all of them. Those that we are able to track, we have taken some operations. MHA will be able to elaborate on some of the details and actions against those who have violated the laws.",1,28,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00028
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"What we have are indicators in terms of the overall market and how it is growing globally. This is not just a problem that is faced by a local market. The online gambling space is international. What we have are participation rates from surveys, from when we survey Singaporeans on how many of them are engaged in some form of gambling and, for those who are gambling, how many of them would engage in some form of online gambling. Obviously, when they do that, they would be in an illegal space. That is something we will track. But in terms of his specific position, that we have been able to know the specific numbers in the course of the last one year plus, we would not be able to do that. Those who are gambling illegally online, we are not able to track every single one of them. We would track in terms of survey numbers; we look at how things develop.",2,29,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00029
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I would highlight this  our objective is to see how best we can look after the well-being of our people. I know that from a specific individual perspective, we may like to take a stronger position and say that we ban it and send a very clear signal that way. We share the same objective. The issue now is how to deal with a very real and practical problem, which is that people are gambling online. Even with the ban being put in place, with MHA taking very active steps to ban new sites coming online, it is the nature of the Internet that we are not able to completely seal off that space. We know that there are people gambling because there have been people and associated individuals arrested as a result of gambling illegally.",3,30,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00030
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"For those who are actually gambling online, when there are no safeguards, no safety valves, no safety measures put in place, they are being exposed to very real dangers. One of the biggest concerns we have is criminal elements. What we do see, and we have arrested, is that it is not just the virtual gambling space, it extends to a very real world problem. There are punters, bookies, runners, agents collecting bet monies and extending credit lines. A lot of them, unfortunately, are involved with syndicated crime. It is not trivial from that perspective as well. That is a real thing that is happening today in the course of the last many months after the Remote Gambling Act was put in place.",4,31,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00031
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"How do we best deal with it? We believe that having a tightly managed space with social safeguards would help, but if it turns out that there continue to be issues, we will have to take a look at how best to deal with this.",5,32,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00032
2016-10-10-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask two supplementary questions. The Minister just mentioned that there are lots of ills of gambling,we cannot track and cannot seal it totally online. I would like to ask this  by giving the licences to two operators, how does the Government solve the problem of online gambling? Are you not encouraging more people to go online gambling by making it legitimate? The second question is  comparing total ban and now we have two operators who are licensed, what are the benefits that you are trying to achieve?",1,33,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00033
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, in the real world today, what is happening is that even with the ban in place, there are people who are gambling. The global market for online gambling continues to grow. Internet penetration, as I have mentioned, is pervasive in Singapore and that will continue to grow as well. We all know that no ban on the Internet will completely seal things off. The reality is that there are Singaporeans who are gambling online and they are gambling in a space where there are no social safeguards, no monitoring. Those that we are able to monitor, we will be able to take some action. But it is a very large space and it is impossible to be able to completely ban that space.",1,34,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00034
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"What happens to Singaporeans who are out there, who still feel that they want to be online and gambling and getting their fix in some shape and form? It is not just the social ills that come with that. It is also a very real concern with law and order issues because, as I have mentioned, criminal elements are involved. When you are betting online, whether on 4D, Toto, horse-racing and so on, there are bookies who collect the monies. There are agents who are there to promote. There are agents who are there to extend unlicensed moneylending facilities.",2,35,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00035
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The real issues that we are concerned with do not really go away. Are we seeking to encourage? No. That is not our position. Our position is not to encourage. Our position is recognising a reality, which is that there are Singaporeans in that space. We are concerned that the numbers may grow as the space continues to proliferate and as the Internet continues to grow in terms of accessibility. So, for those who are there, we can at least provide some form of a safer space to manage that.",3,36,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00036
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Members would remember, in the earlier years in the 1960s, we had a lot of illegal gambling, triad links and so on. Then, we put in place Singapore Pools, the Tote Board, Turf Club, not-for-profit organisations. All the existing illegal online operators are there for profit and to exploit as much as they can. But the whole issue here is to really recognise that some of these vices will not go away.",4,37,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00037
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"How do I deal with a real world problem? How do we look out for the best interest of our people? It is not to encourage gambling. We will continue to discourage it. We will want to continue, through public education and raising awareness, to dissuade Singaporeans from gambling in the first place and particularly online gambling. But for those who are in that space, can we provide some form of outlet where there are safeguards put in place?",5,38,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00038
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"This is what is happening in Hong Kong and Norway as well. They have also studied very closely the effects of what they have done. What they have found from their assessment is that it has not proliferated and encouraged online gambling in a very big way, but it allows them some space to manage that. And that is the way we want to approach it.",6,39,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00039
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"So, we share very similar concerns as Members do, which is to deal with the excesses of online gambling. But how best to deal with the issue? We believe that having this fairly controlled, tightly managed space with social safeguards will be one way to deal with it.",7,40,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00040
2016-10-10-T-002,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"I just want to remind Members that Question No 2 will address some of the issues that you are also raising, so you can also reserve your supplementary questions for Question No 2. Mr Pritam Singh.",1,41,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00041
2016-10-10-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I have a few supplementary questions for the Minister. Firstly, during the Second Reading of the Remote Gambling Bill, the then Minister for Social and Family Development said that, minimally, exempt operators would be expected to include measures for self-exclusion, employee training, patron education, amongst others. In view of the differences between online and terrestrial gambling, what are the new measures – and I emphasise, new measures – that have been undertaken by the Ministry beyond the baseline measures to address the negative effect of online gambling at all levels – upstream, midstream and downstream?",1,42,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00042
2016-10-10-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second question  at the Second Reading of the Bill, the then Minister for Social and Family Development also spoke of the prospect of online counselling. Can the Minister please brief this House as to whether such measures, specific to online gambling, are going to be introduced? And in this vein, as the Minister just mentioned, what are the expenditure and funding limits for online gambling on a daily basis, in specific numbers?",2,43,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00043
2016-10-10-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thirdly, beyond the requirements that are outlined in the Act, has the Government imposed any additional or specific directions on the Turf Club or Singapore Pools, in relation to the conduct, supervision and control of remote gambling in Singapore? Finally, how long are the exemptions for the Turf Club and Singapore Pools valid for, and on what basis does the Ministry assess these exemptions in an on-going way?",3,44,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00044
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, I will leave some of these details to be taken up by my colleague who will address the second PQ. Let me respond to some of the questions raised by the Member.",1,45,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00045
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In terms of the measures that are being put in place to deal with online gambling, the whole list of these has been highlighted. Let me highlight some of these. For example, we have mentioned that, in terms of age limit, you have to be at least 21 years old to open a remote gambling account; persons with relevant casino exclusion will be prohibited from opening an account; the exempt operators will conduct periodic checks with NCPG and account holders who are found to be on any of the relevant casino exclusions will have their accounts closed; relevant casino exclusions include the Family Exclusion Order, the Third Party Exclusion Order and also Automatic Exclusion by law. As at 30 June 2016, approximately 51,000 individuals are under the relevant casino exclusions and will be prohibited from opening a remote gambling account.",2,46,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00046
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"What are the daily funding and expenditure limits? Well, the funding limit will be $300, $500, $1,000 and part of it will be user-defined. Expenditure limits are $50, $75, $100, $125, $150, $200, $250, $300 and user-defined. As an additional safeguard, as I have mentioned, any increase in limits takes effect from the next day, while decisions to decrease the limits will take effect immediately.",3,47,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00047
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In terms of the Remote Responsible Gambling Programme, the exempt operators are required to implement remote responsible gambling programmes which would promote responsible gambling and informed play amongst players. Requirements are as follows  (a) display of responsible gambling messages, which means they need to display responsible gambling messages on all remote gambling web pages; (b) players must acknowledge a warning message of the risk of problem gambling before logging in; (c) display of a time counter to indicate the time spent since the player logged into the account; and (d) the provision of information to players to facilitate informed play, for example, a pop-up message indicating the player's total wins/losses for the day is displayed at log-out, an additional pop-up message indicating the player has exceeded 75% of his daily expenditure limit, and the player can access online monthly or weekly statements of the player's past gambling activities to allow for informed play.",4,48,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00048
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Just to illustrate  today, when someone goes to the outlet to buy 4D or Toto, he usually does not track, depending on whether he keeps his own excel spreadsheet or whatever he does to track his expenditure. He actually may have no clue how much he has been spending accumulatively over time. When they are online, that is something that would be made available and made obvious to the individuals concerned. That could have a salutary effect, possibly for some of them.",5,49,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00049
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"For the operators themselves, there will be training of the staff. The training programme will be put in place to train them to recognise the signs and harms of problem gambling. Staff would be trained to promote responsible gambling and develop protocols for existing players who request for assistance, or to detect signs of problem gambling.",6,50,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00050
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Additionally, there is a prevention of gambling inducement via advertising and promotions, so the exempt operators have to submit all materials, as mentioned earlier, for advertising and promotions to MSF for approval. Essentially, no inducement of gambling, no depiction of gambling as a positive avenue, no misleading or false statements about chances of winnings, no appeal to vulnerable groups, including youths.",7,51,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00051
2016-10-10-T-002,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"These are measures that we are looking at putting in place. We will constantly review them in terms of their effectiveness and whether things need to be tightened, or if there are new measures to be introduced. That is something that we will track. In terms of the provision of counselling of various sorts, we will continue to look at whatever measures that may be possible. The existing measures will continue to be there, but we will also explore different ways of providing support for the individuals who may need counselling and that would include online counselling. But that is something that we are still looking at in terms of how that may take place.",8,52,2016-10-10-T-002-S-00052

2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Madam, before I proceed, I would like to say that I believe all of us in this House have views on this issue, given the number of questions that have been raised. All of us feel very strongly about the ills of remote gambling, both the law-and-order concerns, as well as the social concerns that arise from problem gambling. Like many people outside this House, many of us here may also have personal convictions, values and beliefs about gambling. We respect and understand those personal viewpoints, values and beliefs. But we have to look at the issue from the national viewpoint, understanding the realities, practicalities and challenges at hand.",1,58,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00058
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Madam, the Remote Gambling Act (RGA) was passed by Parliament two years ago in 2014 and came into force in February last year.",2,59,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00059
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"The legislation aims to tackle law-and-order issues associated with remote gambling and to protect young persons and other vulnerable persons from being harmed by remote gambling. The Act provides for a general prohibition on remote gambling. It criminalises the entire spectrum of remote gambling activities and puts in place a comprehensive set of website- and payment-blocking measures. It also provides for a tightly controlled exempt operator regime. So, when the Act was introduced, that was the framework  prohibition with a tightly-controlled valve.",3,60,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00060
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Madam, globally, remote gambling is a significant and fast-growing sector. Global remote gambling activities were estimated to be around US$40 billion in 2015 and grew at a rate of 6%-8% annually over the past five years. At this rate, the remote gambling market will double in size roughly every 10 years.",4,61,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00061
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Singapore is not immune from these global trends, given our high Internet and smartphone penetration rates. If we look at IDA's data, in 2014, our mobile penetration rate was at a whopping 148%, compared to the global rate then at 93%. Likewise, the Internet penetration rate in Singapore was at 73%, versus a global average of 35%.",5,62,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00062
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Since the RGA came into force, we have effected a general prohibition, with robust enforcement and comprehensive blocking measures, to stem the growth of remote gambling within Singapore. Several hundred gambling websites, together with bank accounts and payments linked to remote gambling services, have been blocked. These measures are necessary, but not sufficient, to protect Singaporeans from the harms of illegal remote gambling and problem gambling.",6,63,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00063
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"The nature of the Internet is such that it is not possible to completely block access to illegal gambling websites. We would be mistaken to believe that illegal online gambling does not exist today. Determined gamblers can circumvent website-blocking measures by using virtual private networks (VPNs) or through proxy websites. Since February 2015 to date, Police have arrested more than 120 persons for remote gambling activities.",7,64,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00064
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Underground gambling poses serious law-and-order concerns, particularly because of its linkages with organised crime. Secret societies are known to offer illegal 4D and other gambling products. Illegal bookies also engage in unlicensed moneylending and money laundering.",8,65,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00065
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Illegal remote gambling does not come with any social safeguards, as the Minister for Social and Family Development reiterated a number of times in his response.

2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Many underground gambling operations are related to international crime syndicates. For example, in the run-up to and during the recent Euro 2016 football championship, Police worked with foreign law enforcement agencies through Operation SOGA VI, which was an Interpol-led effort, to arrest persons involved in syndicated remote betting operations. In that one operation, 4,000 individuals were arrested across France, Greece, Italy, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, China and Singapore. As part of that operation, the Singapore Police Force apprehended 39 suspects in Singapore, who dealt with S$2.5 million of bets.",10,67,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00067
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Taking a realistic and clear-minded approach, we have to recognise that a complete ban on remote gambling will drive demand underground and create larger incentives for criminal syndicates to target Singaporeans. Hence, the Remote Gambling Act provided for a tightly-controlled exempt operator regime. The exemption regime complements our strategy of general prohibition and blocking measures. Seen in totality, it is an entire ecosystem and framework of measures trying to reduce the problem of online problem gambling.",11,68,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00068
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Madam, this is consistent with our existing approach in the terrestrial gambling space – gambling activities are criminalised and a tightly-controlled valve is allowed as part of the overall system to minimise law-and-order concerns. From our experience with the terrestrial gambling space, this has worked well. A number of other jurisdictions, such as Hong Kong and Norway, adopt a similar approach – allowing regulated operators to complement a general prohibition of remote gambling.",12,69,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00069
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"However, we are very careful with providing the exemption. We have imposed strict qualifying criteria for the exemption certificate. The exempt operator has to be a not-for-profit entity that distributes monies to public, social or charitable purposes. Directors and key officers of the operator cannot have been convicted of offences that render them unfit. The operator must possess a consistent track record of compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.",13,70,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00070
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),We have also restricted the betting products that the operators can offer. Betting products are limited to those currently available via terrestrial channels. Casino-style games and poker will not be allowed.,14,71,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00071
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"The exempt operator is also required to implement strict social safeguards, to minimise potential harm to customers. The Minister for Social and Family Development had earlier elaborated on those social safeguards, in response to Mr Christopher de Souza's question.",15,72,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00072
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),I would like to stress that the exemption regime does not change our stance towards gambling. We do not promote gambling. We do not think gambling should be a way to make a living. We conduct public education on the potential harm of gambling and we have social safeguards in place. We will continue to enforce strongly against all underground gambling activities.,16,73,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00073
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Our approach towards gambling is somewhat similar to the approach in many countries when managing other vices, such as drinking and smoking. Although we discourage drinking and smoking, we do not have a complete ban. Instead, we manage the potential harm through regulations and public education.",17,74,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00074
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Some have compared gambling to drug abuse and say if we allow a safety valve for gambling, why not have a safety valve for drug taking or drug offences. I believe they are asking a rhetorical question and conflating the way in which you tackle crime and the way in which societies manage vices that have been around for ages. The magnitude of harm resulting from drug abuse is vastly different and much more severe. Our regimes towards drug abuse and vices, such as gambling, are , therefore, different in complexion.",18,75,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00075
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"To conclude, the reality is that illegal gambling exists today. We cannot wish away the presence of underground markets, where criminal activities abound and signs of problem gambling go undetected.",19,76,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00076
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"The exempt operator regime aims to provide a regulated and controlled outlet, to divert activities from illegal operators. It is an integral part of our strategy to deal with the problem of remote gambling. It complements the general prohibition of remote gambling, blocking of access and payments to illegal sites, strict enforcement and promotion of awareness and personal responsibility through public education, outreach and engagement.",20,77,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00077
2016-10-10-T-003,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for his response. Four supplementary questions.,1,78,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00078
2016-10-10-T-003,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Firstly, how does the Government intend to address the mixed signals that come from this provision? On one hand, we say that gambling, especially remote gambling is pervasive and very undesirable, but on the other hand, it is kind of legal if you go to the exempt operators like Singapore Pools and Singapore Turf Club.",2,79,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00079
2016-10-10-T-003,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Secondly, a total ban has happened for the last two years. I would like to ask the Ministry how the performance of this total ban has been. From what I have heard on the ground, the Ministry has performed quite well in terms of measures, enforcements, such as the blocking of the remote gambling sites. I would like to ask the Ministry for some details on that.",3,80,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00080
2016-10-10-T-003,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Thirdly, if we are doing well for that, would the Government seriously consider investing even more resources in the enforcement of this total ban, which has happened for the last two years, instead of spending more money trying to manage things downstream?",4,81,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00081
2016-10-10-T-003,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Fourthly, again, would the Ministry or the Government consider a total ban in view of the fact that Singapore has banned many less significant things, such as chewing gum and pornographic materials and so forth. Under what circumstances would the Government consider a total ban?",5,82,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00082
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"I thank the Member for her questions. She asked about mixed signals, when in 2014 remote gambling was banned and then now in 2016 remote gambling is allowed through the exempt operators. As both the Minister for Social and Family Development and I have reiterated, in 2014 when the Bill was passed through Parliament, it was made clear that the framework comprised a comprehensive blocking of illegal websites, advertising targeted at Singaporeans and payments related to online gambling, as well as a safety valve. It reflected the way in which the problem could be managed and had been managed in the terrestrial sphere. Madam, in response to the Member's question, there has been no mixed signal. We were very clear and upfront that this was the framework and this was the way to tackle the growth of online gambling back in 2014.",1,83,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00083
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"But let us be clear that we understand and we share the concerns of the Member and others who have voiced concerns consistently over the years about problem gambling. We are not in favour of gambling. We do not promote and we do not encourage it amongst our people. But we recognise gambling exists and people have very different viewpoints and values about gambling. Some object to gambling, fundamentally and in principle; others think that responsible gambling is possible and there is some autonomy they want to exercise. We have to be practical and recognise the realities when regulating and managing these vices.",2,84,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00084
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As I have said earlier, with Internet access and smartphone penetration rates in Singapore being amongst the world's highest, the reality is that online gambling is available at people's fingertips, whether it is in your home, as Mr Png Eng Huat mentioned in 2014 in his speech, or in people's pockets because they have smartphones with them. Likewise, with VPN and other technology, punters and syndicates will continue to try to circumvent blocking and enforcement measures.",3,85,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00085
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We hope people do not take to remote gambling. The collective effort must be undertaken by the Government, NGOs and VWOs. Public education and awareness raising have to work together with deterrence and law enforcement. But if you ask if a total ban will mean absolutely no online illegal gambling whatsoever, I think the answer is no.",4,86,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00086
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Let me just give some proxy data. As the Member has said earlier, in the last year plus, we had not had this exempt operator regime. Under the framework, there was, in fact, a grandfathering of existing remote betting facilities by both the applicants until the application is resolved. So, in some ways, it has not been an entire total ban, although we had implemented blocking measures.",5,87,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00087
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Nevertheless, online gambling has been here for the last year plus. It is attracting many people and is set to grow. How do we know this?",6,88,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00088
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"First, look at the global trends. As I have said earlier, estimates are that the global online gambling size was around US$40 billion last year. Over the last five years, it grew by 6% to 8% percent. It will double every 10 years or so, assuming that the rate does not increase. And most of us are very connected to the Internet and are very tech-savvy. So, these global trends will impact us and we have to recognise that these trends will affect us. Hence, we have to make sure our system is sufficiently robust, sophisticated and practical to address them.",7,89,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00089
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Some people asked for hard data. They say, ""There are global trends, we know all these but do you have any data?"" I think Mr Christopher de Souza had also asked this question. As the Minister for Social and Family Development had earlier alluded to, the nature of remote gambling, especially underground illegal gambling, is such that it is hard to get precise and accurate details of the nature and extent or the exact number of people who are accessing these sites. As a result, we can only rely on best estimates, where there will be varying figures, estimates and statistics.",8,90,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00090
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Let me give Members a few proxies, so you get a sense of where we are. In 2013, MHA, prior to introducing the Bill, had conducted and commissioned a study. Then-Second Minister for Home Affairs mentioned this in a speech in 2013. This was a study by an external consultant for the Ministry which included a survey of Internet users. Out of over a thousand respondents, three in 10 acknowledged that they had engaged in remote gambling at least once in the past year, and two-thirds of them were between the ages of 25 and 44. That was 2013, so it is just one data point.",9,91,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00091
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"There are varying estimates by external analysts on the size of remote gambling in Singapore. We can look for these reports, you can purchase them. The reports analyse the remote gambling market around the world, including in specific jurisdictions. For Singapore, there is a wide range. One estimate suggested that remote gambling in Singapore in 2015 could well be as large as S$461 million, at a time when remote gambling was banned.",10,92,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00092
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Enforcement wise, since 2015 till 2016, Police have arrested more than 120 people involved in illegal remote gambling – syndicates, runners, punters – and these include the 39 arrested during Operation SOGA VI, which was the prelude to Euro 2016. Police carried out more than 100 raids against illegal gambling – terrestrial and online – each year. They continue to keep up this tempo. In 2015, close to 300 people were arrested for illegal gambling, with about 50 charged under the Remote Gambling Act. About 90% of those arrested for illegal football gambling were involved in online football gambling. More than one-third of those arrested for illegal lotteries were involved in online remote lotteries.",11,93,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00093
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Police also continue to arrest illegal bookmakers and agents on an on-going basis. Our experience with terrestrial gambling since the 1960s is that illegal terrestrial gambling activities have largely been kept under control, based on recent arrest figures, which number in the few hundreds each year. In a way, the safety valves in Singapore Pools and in Singapore Turf Club have partly contributed to that.",12,94,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00094
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We have observed and monitored the illegal gambling situation. Whilst the ban and the prohibitions have reduced traffic to a lot of these sites, there is still this traffic from Singapore to some of the blocked sites, via diversionary measures. There is also traffic to new sites, which pop up each and every day.",13,95,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00095
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Over the years, the Police have observed a very obvious shift – syndicates expanding their realm from terrestrial gambling to online remote sphere. Syndicates run bet exchanges for online horseracing, casino gambling, soccer betting and lotteries. Syndicates also use technology – WhatsApp, WeChat – to collect bets, finding ways to circumvent detection and enforcement.",14,96,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00096
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As part of implementing the exempt operator regime, MHA is working with both operators to conduct surveys and studies. This will give us more data points. Indeed, the experience of foreign jurisdictions with narrow exempt operator frameworks – Hong Kong and Norway – has allowed regulators and law enforcement agencies to collect data on betting patterns, which may otherwise have gone undetected. This helps them to finetune policy decisions relating to remote gambling.",15,97,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00097
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"I hope that this addresses the Member's question about what has been the experience since 2015 to date. I have given Members some data points and statistics. At the end of the day, given the nature of what we are grappling with, it is very difficult to have and to pin down the exact numbers as you would with something that happens legitimately on a daily basis out in the daylight.",16,98,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00098
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"That also answers the Member's third question, which is why not invest more in technology. The exempt operator framework only provides for what is already existing in the terrestrial framework. It does not provide for casino-style games and poker. We will continue and must continue to invest in technology. But at the end of the day, we recognise that this is almost like a technological cat-and-mouse game and we recognise that there will still be growth in online gambling. We must have an entire ecosystem – prohibitions, enforcement, education, moral suasion, family support, community support as well as a tightly-controlled valve – that reflects what we do in the terrestrial sphere.",17,99,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00099
2016-10-10-T-003,Chia Yong Yong,Ms Chia Yong Yong (Nominated Member),"Madam, may I request the Senior Minister of State to elaborate on the measures that are in place or should be in place to safeguard against proxy online gambling whereby persons who are not eligible gamble through accounts of those who are?",1,100,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00100
2016-10-10-T-003,Chia Yong Yong,Ms Chia Yong Yong (Nominated Member),"Secondly, in relation to the gambling trends, I note that the Senior Minister of State has said the Government does monitor the macro-trends. Could we also consider or are we considering monitoring at a more focused level whereby we gather data from the gambling accounts and ascertain gambling patterns for earlier counselling intervention?",2,101,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00101
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In response to the Member's first question, when a person uses another person's online gambling account as a proxy ‒ presumably because he may not qualify due to age or because he or she is on the exclusion list ‒ the application for both Singapore Pools and Singapore Turf Club is not automatic, and approval is not given immediately. The person can make an application but he has to turn up physically in person to be verified at one of the centres, to verify his age and eligibility. The operators are required to vet for exclusions and other requirements. The requirement for physical appearance is important.",1,102,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00102
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"There is also two-factor authentication every time the real gambler accesses the online account. Two-factor authentication takes place through a mobile number, which ought to belong to the real gambler. So, that is an additional friction. And there will be monitoring by the operators and regulators. If it is detected that an account is used as a proxy, then, the exempt operators would, first of all, have to take firm action. Additionally, the regulators and the Police would have to see if any offence has been committed.",2,103,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00103
2016-10-10-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In her second question, the Member asked whether we monitor local trends and will be looking at the data that is generated from the exempt operators' systems. We certainly will look at all trends and all the data that are available. As I have said earlier, in both Hong Kong and Norway, the valve has enabled the regulators there to have more data points about online gambling trends. They can use this information to help sharpen, tighten and revise their overall framework on online gambling.",3,104,2016-10-10-T-003-S-00104

The Government has said that it requested the Council to review the awards scheme. May I know what is the Government's view that has been communicated to the Councils in terms of the review, what are the terms of the review, have the Singapore National Olympic Council and the Singapore National Paralympic Council responded to the request and what is the timeline for the review?",1,127,2016-10-10-T-004-S-00127

These two NGOs will have their own agenda and timeline, and I am sure they will take this review quite seriously. But, more importantly is that they need to have conversations with the donors and supporters because both organisations may have different needs and objectives. I think it is best to leave them to look at their overall plan. SNPC has just had a new President elected. I am sure he has to find his feet and get on with his work.",1,128,2016-10-10-T-004-S-00128

I believe there is some amount of confusion among the public in terms of the amount that our Paralympians are receiving. May I ask the Minister if she could confirm that Pin Xiu would be receiving $200,000 per medal that she has got, which means that she will be receiving $400,000, rather than the $200,000 that is being bandied about online?",1,129,2016-10-10-T-004-S-00129
2016-10-10-T-004,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"My second question is on sponsors for the SNPC as well as the SNOC.

SNPC has stated before the Games, that there will be an award of $200,000 per medal and, because Pin Xiu has gotten two medals, so, it will be $400,000. The scheme by SNOC, on the other hand, is different. They have a $1 million cap, regardless of the number of gold medals. So, Joseph Schooling will be receiving $1 million for his medal.",2,134,2016-10-10-T-004-S-00134
2016-10-10-T-004,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"As far as sponsors are concerned, yes, Tote Board and Singapore Pools are the two main sponsors at this point in time. But if you look back at the history of these two awards, actually the two organisations have been working with several donors in the past and, for various reasons, the donors have been coming in and out of the schemes. But at this juncture, with the very tremendous achievements that our athletes have put in, both at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics and the Paralympics, we would really like to encourage the corporates to step up again to support our athletes. So, it started off as a scheme that had multiple sponsors, all like-minded and wanting to give our athletes an encouragement and a push. So, I would urge corporates to step up again.",3,135,2016-10-10-T-004-S-00135

The athletes whom we speak to are actually looking at internships and employment where companies can allow them to make a living and, at the same time, accommodate their training and competition schedule. They are also looking at accumulating experience that will serve them well as they retire from their sporting career. So, it is important for companies to also step forward to look at the values that our athletes have displayed ‒ values that are very much treasured by companies these days – teamwork, resilience, confidence.

Nurul has gone through two cycles, supported by us, and Sze Ning as well for the latest cycle in Rio.

2016-10-10-T-005,Lim Hng Kiang,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"In the near term, the global economic outlook is expected to remain weak. Investment demand in key advanced economies remains sluggish, while China's growth continues to moderate as it restructures its economy. Low oil prices have also affected the growth prospects of oil exporters, including those in the region. At the same time, global trade flows have been weak, in part due to the sluggish global growth, as well as in-sourcing trends in economies like China. More recently, the UK's vote in June to leave the European Union has dampened and added uncertainties to the global growth outlook.",2,146,2016-10-10-T-005-S-00146

While growth came in at 2.1% in the first half of 2016, it is likely to weaken in the second half of this year. First, externally-oriented services sectors, such as finance and insurance, and wholesale trade, have slowed and could continue to face external headwinds. Second, although manufacturing output saw a pick-up in the second quarter, it has shown signs of weakening on the back of sluggish external demand. Low oil prices have continued to dampen the performance of firms in the marine and offshore engineering segment, as well as those in the precision engineering cluster that support the global oil and gas industry. In line with the weakness seen in the manufacturing sector, non-oil domestic exports (NODX) contracted over the July to August period.

Minister Lim Hng Kiang has just spoken on the external headwinds that are affecting industries, such as wholesale trade and marine and offshore engineering, as well as the weakness in industries, such as food services and real estate.

2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah has asked about business costs. There are several components to this. Let me just speak on a few of them. The cost of utilities is expected to remain subdued, given sustained low oil prices. One reference point is the regulated tariffs that households pay because they are in a non-contestable market, and that have declined by 24% from the beginning of last year to the second quarter of 2016. And there are similar trends for those in the industry, especially because they have greater flexibility in negotiating contracts.",2,163,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00163
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Industrial rental index has decreased by 6.8% over the past five quarters. For commercial rents, the office rental index in the central region fell by 12.2%, while the retail rental index also in the central region declined by 9.3% over the same period. And the strong pipeline supply of industrial and commercial space coming on-stream in 2016 should continue to ease rental cost pressures. For labour costs, there are variations across sectors. In the manufacturing sector, unit labour cost (ULC) fell by 0.7%. This is in Q2 on a year-on-year basis on the back of productivity improvements. In contrast, the ULC in the services sector rose by 4.5%. These trends, and their differential impact on our industries, underscore the need to redouble our efforts to improve productivity and to adopt industry-specific strategies to sustain competitiveness.",3,164,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00164
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Against this challenging economic backdrop, the Government seeks to help companies manage immediate pressures but also importantly to adapt to stay competitive in the medium to long term. So, SPRINGSingapore launched the Working Capital Loan (WCL) this year to help address Small and Medium Enterprises' (SMEs) near-term cash flow concerns and growth financing needs. The WCL is expected to catalyse more than S$2 billion of loans over the next three years, and complements existing loan schemes. This year, there has been a strong take-up of SPRINGSingapore's various loan schemes, with over S$1.2 billion worth of loans given to SMEs so far.",4,165,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00165
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Notwithstanding these cyclical headwinds, there remain good market opportunities for our companies. If I can illustrate, the annual growth for the ASEAN region is expected to average 5.2% from 2016 to 2020. In fact, for Asia, it is meant to be even higher. And this is significantly higher, compared to the projected global growth for the same period. To seize these opportunities, our industries, enterprises and workers must transform.",5,166,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00166
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Structurally, Singapore is entering a new mode of growth. Rather than increasing manpower, we must anchor Singapore's competitiveness and growth in increased productivity and greater innovation. So, in April this year, the Government announced a grant budget of over S$2.3 billion under the Enterprise Development Fund (EDF) for the development of local companies. This will support the efforts that are undertaken at the enterprise level to upgrade capabilities, automate processes and internationalise.",6,167,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00167
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In addition, as part of the S$4.5 billion Industry Transformation Programme announced in Budget 2016, the Government will develop customised roadmaps for key industries. This is really what the Industry Transformation Maps are about. Each roadmap will comprise a growth and competitiveness plan, supported by strategies to upgrade productivity, develop skills, promote technology adoption and innovation, and help our companies expand overseas.",7,168,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00168
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked about falling private investments. Attracting investments remains a key part of our strategy to grow the Singapore economy. The investment commitments that EDB has secured for fixed asset investments (FAI) have moderated from S$12.1 billion in 2013 to S$11.5 billion in 2015. This is partly due to the uncertain global economic conditions, but it is also a reflection of our targeted approach towards attracting projects that are more consistent with our stage of economic development, manpower policies and international commitments on carbon emissions.",8,169,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00169
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Companies generally understand and accept these constraints, which are by no means unique to Singapore, and have been supportive of our push towards productivity-driven growth. Re-investments from the existing base of companies have focused on increasing productivity through the adoption of automation technologies and upskilling of the workforce. In addition, EDB continues to harness investor interest in the growth markets of Asia and ASEAN to establish ""Homes"", that is, headquarters that comprise top decision-makers and differentiating competencies. These initiatives do not always entail large FAIs but they create good jobs for Singaporeans.",9,170,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00170
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Assoc Prof Randolph Tan asked if there have been difficulties filling jobs created via EDB's investment commitments. At the project level, EDB works closely with the companies to meet their projected job commitments. And this includes partnering our academic institutions and industry to ensure that Singaporeans are equipped with the appropriate skillsets to take up the diverse range of jobs that are on offer. Specific interventions include curriculum development for pre-employment training (PET), continuing education and training (CET) with local Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), as well as partnerships with companies to provide apprenticeships and other applied learning opportunities for our students. These manpower efforts are aligned with our national SkillsFuture movement, which aims to prepare Singaporeans for jobs of the future, with a judicious complement of foreign manpower to address any skills gaps in the short to medium term.",10,171,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00171
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, the Singapore economy will continue to create and generate good job opportunities for Singaporeans who are willing to upgrade their skills and work in growth sectors. For 2016, EDB expects investment commitments to create 20,000 to 22,000 jobs. This represents an increase in job commitments, compared to 16,800 in 2015 and 18,600 in 2014. At the same time, our industry transformation efforts, which I have described, will also support sustainable job creation in the medium term in both new and existing industries.",11,172,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00172
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Many of these jobs, and others in sectors like education and healthcare, are suitable not just for new entrants to the job market but also for mature workers seeking a new career. The Minister for Manpower will be elaborating on our efforts and measures to help workers adapt and secure these job opportunities.",12,173,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00173
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, successful economic transformation will require the collective effort of our workers, unions, companies, industry associations and the Government. It is critical that our companies stand ready to embrace new technologies and business models and that our workers stay open to learning new skills and capabilities in order to take on new or redesigned jobs. On its part, the Government is firmly committed to supporting our workers and companies through this transformation.",13,174,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00174
2016-10-10-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister for the answer and the data that he shared about the drop by about $10 billion in terms of EDB's commitments over the past two years. And he explained that the targeted approach actually led to the decline. In light of the economic transformation and the cyclical headwinds, the data show also, in terms of declining foreign manufacturing investments over the past two and half years or so, I am a bit concerned on that part and I am wondering what the Government's view is in terms of declining foreign manufacturing investments, particularly because the job creation in the manufacturing side would probably create a bit more volume than that on the services side. And what would be the Government's strategy in terms of the declining foreign manufacturing investments in light of the decline in EDB's foreign investment commitments over the next five to 10 years?",1,175,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00175
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, I thank the Member for his questions. First, a point of clarification. It is not a decline of $10 billion. I said $12.1 billion in 2013 and $11.5 billion in 2015. So, it is a different order of magnitude.",1,176,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00176
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Secondly, when talking about manufacturing investments in Singapore, let me talk in general and also specific terms. First, manufacturing is changing. So, it is no longer just about investing in fixed assets, plants, equipment and doing manufacturing in the conventional sense that we understand. In fact, manufacturing has got a very significant complementary aspect. Some call it the ""servitisation"" of manufacturing. What it basically means is that traditional manufacturers are also embarking on very different service-oriented models.",2,177,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00177
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"One example is Rolls Royce. We understand Rolls Royce to be a company that sells engines for aircraft. But Rolls Royce is increasingly moving towards a model where they sell power by the hour. In other words, I do not sell you the engine but I sell you the power that drives the aircraft by the hour. And that means the business model changes. It may not always be reflected as an investment in manufacturing in our context, but, in terms of its impact on the economy and in terms of what we are doing for job creation, it remains absolutely valid. So, in a very general sense, manufacturing is changing.",3,178,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00178
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Having said that, even at the more traditional understanding of manufacturing, we continue to attract good investments. In recent times, Members would have read about the commitment by Micron, which has a substantial investment in semi-conductor manufacturing in the wafer fabrication sector, which is an important part of our electronics cluster in Singapore. Also about AbbVie in bio-pharmaceutical manufacturing.",4,179,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00179
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, we continue to attract good quality manufacturing investments. But the key is really to make sure that the investments that we attract are consistent with, first, as I have said earlier, our stage of development, because it is no point shoe-horning a manufacturer into our environment if it is not something that is sustainable in the medium to long-term. Far better for us to target the sectors or the part of the value chain that can continue to operate in Singapore in a sustainable way and that will then drive economic growth and job creation.",5,180,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00180
2016-10-10-T-006,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister two supplementary questions. Just a few days ago, there was a pharmaceutical research company that pulled out of Singapore. I would like to ask the Minister whether is that a concern and what is the real reason. Will there be more companies pulling out of Singapore? The second question is that, on the ground, there are quite a lot of retrenchments as well as pay cuts. Is the Minister concerned with these and are there any measures to be taken soon?",1,181,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00181
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, I thank the Member for her questions. I think she is referring to the announcement about Novartis moving out their tropical disease research facility. I do not want to go into the details of a specific company or what drives their decisions, but let me make a more general point.",1,182,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00182
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"First of all, one should not read too much into individual cases because individual companies make decisions for a variety of reasons. It could be because of internal restructuring; sometimes, it could be something as prosaic as a person in charge of that particular line of business deciding they want to run things in a different way. And all these things have got knock-on effects in the way that business is restructured. So, I would not want to extrapolate from that and draw broader conclusions about the viability, for example, in this case, of our pharmaceutical space.",2,183,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00183
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"As I have said, just a couple of weeks back, I opened a facility by AbbVie, a bio-pharmaceutical company producing state-of-the-art biological treatments for cancers and various other disease conditions.",3,184,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00184
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, in the context of Singapore, we continue to attract good investments in this space. We should not be complacent, but it is not something that should cause great alarm because it is in the context of one particular company making a decision on one particular aspect of its activity in Singapore.",4,185,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00185
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The other point was about retrenchments, pay cuts and so on. I think the Minister for Manpower will be addressing several of these points later. But let me just make a more general point. If you look at the job creation data that I have shared, we continue to create jobs and there are adequate jobs in many ways to meet the needs and aspirations of Singaporeans. The real challenge for us is in ensuring that Singaporeans have the right skillsets in order to be able to take those jobs and run with it and develop new careers with it, in the case of those who are switching careers. So, that is really a summary of the situation, and the Minister for Manpower will be able to give a far more detailed explanation.",5,186,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00186
2016-10-10-T-006,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"Madam, I thank the Minister for this very good news, which is that job creation is actually increasing. But I think that is a challenge because we all know about the slack in the labour market. My question, if I may, goes back to the last point that the Minister made, which is, with increasing job creation and the slack in the labour market, what are the challenges? Have we seen what had happened in the last five years, for instance, where we had either been able to or not able to find a match between supply and demand of certain types of skilled manpower?",1,187,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00187
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"If I may clarify, the Member's question is whether we have been able to find appropriate manpower to fill the jobs, is that correct?",1,188,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00188
2016-10-10-T-006,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan,That is right.,1,189,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00189
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"First, I want to just restate the point I made earlier, Mdm Speaker, which is that EDB's efforts continue to generate jobs. There are some sectors, other sectors where also there are jobs being created, for example, in education and healthcare. There are also sectors which are taking a bit of a hit because of external headwinds and, therefore, there is job decline there.",1,190,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00190
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, you have to look at the economy as a whole. It is uneven, there are pockets where the opportunities exist for companies, for individuals. There are pockets where the environment and the circumstances are more challenging. The point about whether we are able to find appropriate people, Singaporeans, to take up the jobs, this continues to be the key challenge because we are seeing major changes in the way various industries are running, because there is a lot more emphasis, and if I can just take one or two cases in point. In the whole digital economy space, the importance of site security and having people who understand digital space and are able to work with data and do analytics and inform a company's business and marketing strategies, these are very essential skillsets in the new economy. There is a global shortage of people in this sort of space. We are not unique in this. So, we are creating opportunities and there are other sectors I can talk about.",2,191,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00191
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"There is always this issue of a skills mismatch, which is why we need to work on this on a few levels. The first is securing the investments and the opportunities so that we actually have a pipeline that Singaporeans can benefit from. The second is to work upstream with our Universities and Institutions of Higher Learning to make sure that the skillsets that are needed are being provided, not just through three-year degree programmes or diploma programmes but even, if necessary, doing some targeted modular programmes which is what we do collectively between MTI and MOM, and our agencies like EDB working with WDA, MOE and the institutions.",3,192,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00192
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"That is on the one side; this is more pre-employment for new entrants. But on the other side is really for the mature workers who are looking to switch careers. Harder to do, but it is something that is very important and that is why I have made the point that many of the jobs can actually be taken up by mature workers. But they need to make the move, adapt, take up the relevant skills training and adjustment in order to be able to participate in the new business. And we have seen examples of people doing that.",4,193,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00193
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In the bio-pharmaceutical company that I visited, I saw an individual who was in his late 40s, worked in China in the electronics sector and came back because the company terminated his employment. He came back, he decided he wanted to make a switch, he got into the biopharmaceutical space, he got the training through WDA – and I think it is the Professional Conversion Programme – and now heads the unit there or certain aspects of production.",5,194,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00194
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"It is a good example. Individual stories, but demonstrating that the larger strategy can work and we need the individuals to step up and benefit fully from our programmes.",6,195,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00195
2016-10-10-T-006,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Madam, I am not sure if the Minister has addressed the question by Mr Saktiandi on the number of firms failing and closing but I would like to ask again whether the Minister sees increasing numbers of companies running into serious problems and not surviving.",1,196,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00196
2016-10-10-T-006,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"And related to that, whether as these companies fail, are we at risk of permanently losing these capabilities – engineering and economic capabilities, for example, for the oil and gas sector – the contracting capabilities. And whether the Government will come up with sector-specific measures to help these industries and sectors. For example, the Industry Transformation Map, whether you want to activate this early to help these companies.",2,197,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00197
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I thank the Member for the questions. Let me first clarify, I think the earlier question was working off data provided by ACRA. And I think the data the Member looked at was for September. I understand, because I did a check. ACRA has actually updated the data. In fact, in the first and second quarters of this year, there was net enterprise formation, positive. It was actually not an insignificant number, it was 2,001 for the first quarter and 9,000 in the second quarter. And I think this has got something also to do and there is some explanation there about some technical treatment. So, I would urge Members to check it out and maybe file a PQ to get further clarification.",1,198,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00198
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But the first point I am making is that in the first two quarters of this year, rather than negative, there has actually been positive enterprise formation, at least based on the data we get from ACRA. I think the more important point the Member is raising is really whether we have a concern in terms of what is happening on the ground, in terms of companies. Enterprise formation, we know some companies form SPVs, there is restructuring, these things happen all the time. They do not necessarily reflect or affect what is happening on the ground in terms of actual business and jobs.",2,199,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00199
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, I would say that, if I go back to the point I made earlier, there is a diversity; if you look at the landscape, it is variegated. Some sectors are doing well or reasonably well, others are having a hard time. Even within the sectors that are challenged, there are companies that are thriving because they have been able to adapt, or they have been able to find a niche and they are doing well.",3,200,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00200
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,The fact of the matter is that it is an uneven terrain. It is not so much about having a broad-brush general programme or strategy because that is just going to be wasteful and some would argue that the natural business cycle should be allowed to take its course so that there is some appropriate consolidation and re-channelling of resources at the economy level.,4,201,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00201
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"We are mindful there are certain sectors or industries where we do need to be very careful, that we do not, in the process, lose core capabilities that have been built up over a long period of time. Therefore, in those sorts of very specific areas, we are tracking it and we are working on ideas as to how we can do this in a way that does not become so interventionist that it distorts the market, but it minimises the loss of capabilities, which we need to preserve in order to sustain the competitiveness of our companies in those sectors, especially when the situation improves.",5,202,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00202
2016-10-10-T-006,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The Minister spoke about transformations of the various industries. One feedback I often get from the industries is  how do they align with some of these strategies and sub-strategies because a lot of times the Ministry talks about strategies in very broad terms? From a sector-specific agenda, would the Ministry be sharing specific sector strategies, whether certain sectors will be defocused and others ramped up. I think what the industry is looking for is guidance so that that also helps in terms of manpower deployment and transformation, for example, where do they align to? Would the Ministry be sharing its sub-strategies in a more detailed manner?",1,203,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00203
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The Member raises an important point. First, the Industry Transformation Maps are being developed for 23 sectors which we have talked about. It is a process. We have already announced a couple of them. One is in food services and another is for retail. There will be progressively more of these programmes that will be announced and shared. These programmes  go into a great deal of detail in terms of the productivity, innovation, internationalisation and manpower aspects.",1,204,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00204
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Many of the programmes that we have are being, at the backend, integrated and channelled along these lines. For the businesses, in order to understand and navigate the space, the first thing I would say is we will definitely be communicating this not just through major announcements but it will be percolated down through the industry associations and various other channels.",2,205,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00205
2016-10-10-T-006,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Second, even if the larger transformation plan may not be entirely relevant for a particular business, what they need to do – I am talking about the SMEs in particular – is to get in touch with one of our SME Centres, quite a number of which are now on the ground, through our various chambers and trade associations, or through the trade association and industry association members, or directly with SPRINGSingapore. Then, the dialogue can start on what is appropriate in terms of the companies' own plans and strategies, and how some of the programmes that we have can assist them.",3,206,2016-10-10-T-006-S-00206

2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"In response to Mr Patrick Tay and Mr Melvin Yong, on the ground, there is much concern that local employment growth has been flat. It went up by 700 last year and came down by 200 in the first half of this year, giving a net increase of just 500 over 18 months. I am concerned too.",3,223,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00223
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Fortunately, while the unemployment rate has increased, it did not rise sharply. It exceeded marginally the range of 2.6% - 2.9% registered in the past five years, to reach 3% in June 2016.",4,224,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00224
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"I was puzzled. Why did the sharp drop in local employment growth not lead to a sharp rise in unemployment rate? With the help of my colleagues at MOM, I soon discovered that the main reason for the flat growth in local employment was a slowdown in local workforce growth. Let me share what I have learnt with this House.",5,225,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00225
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, with your permission, may I display a few charts on the LED, please?",6,226,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00226

2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"In the three years from 2012 to 2014, an average of 226,000 locals joined and 153,000 left the workforce each year, giving an average net increase of 73,000, or 79,000 if we were to include the self-employed.",1,228,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00228
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"But in 2015, the number of locals entering dropped significantly by about 36,000, while the number leaving increased by about 37,000. This is a swing of 73,000 and resulted in the flat growth in our local employment to just 700.",2,229,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00229
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,This swing was partly cyclical. We saw more people left employment after termination and completion of contract and casual employment. More also left to pursue further studies and upgrading.,3,230,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00230
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"But the swing was also structural, across all age groups. For those aged 25-64, our labour force participation rate of 83.1% is already high and showing signs of plateauing. For the younger ones aged 15-24, the size of the cohort entering the labour force had already peaked in 2013 and started to decline since then. More importantly, the number of people retiring is also on the rise, doubling over the last two years. This will continue as more baby boomers enter retirement.",4,231,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00231
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"In short, even though the numbers of exits and entries in our local workforce will fluctuate from year to year due to prevailing economic conditions and policy factors, but with ageing and lower birth rates, coupled with our relatively high labour force participation rate and low unemployment rate, we will see a continued slowdown of local labour force growth, towards negligible levels, or even stagnation in the next decade.",5,232,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00232
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"This has three major implications. First, we must work our way towards healthier economic growth. Even though flat local employment growth in the past 18 months did not lead to a sharp rise in unemployment rate or any drop in our labour force participation, we are still concerned that this could still happen if the global economic situation does not improve or worsen further. We must make sure that the current low growth of 1%-2% is transitional. Our future norm should be 2%-3% of quality growth, not 1%-2% of low growth.",6,233,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00233
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"This is because our ultimate objective in pursuing growth is not in growth itself, but to create jobs in sufficient quantity and of good enough quality for our people to have better jobs, better wages and better careers.",7,234,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00234
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Madam, with our local workforce growth slowing, it does not mean that we can afford to move slower, too, in our efforts to create jobs.",8,235,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00235
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"I will use 2015 as an illustration. Even though local employment went up by only 700, but the number of locals looking for jobs was many times higher than that. We must not forget that there were actually 190,000 new entries of young locals and re-entries of mature locals in that year alone. Many of them were not just looking for the same jobs vacated by those who have left employment. With better education and skills profile, they wanted better jobs to meet their higher expectations and aspirations. The same also applies to those who were already in the workforce. And I think this is good. This is also why we can never slow down.",9,236,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00236
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"To move faster, we have mobilised industry leaders, unions and economic agencies to create and re-create many more quality jobs in more than 20 sectors, as explained by Minister Lim Hng Kiang and Minister Iswaran.

2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Madam, second, our policy on foreign manpower must be well-balanced. At one extreme, if we try to make up for the drop in local labour force growth by taking in many more foreign workers, the pace of our restructuring will slow. Eventually, we will become overly reliant on foreign manpower and our wages will also stagnate without productivity gain.",11,238,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00238
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"At the other extreme, if we try to reduce the growth of foreign manpower to zero, zero local labour force growth plus zero foreign manpower growth will give us zero growth in total labour force. Our total labour force will eventually stagnate. And if labour productivity growth continues to remain at the current level – then zero growth in local workforce, zero growth in foreign manpower, plus zero growth in productivity as we have seen in recent years – it will give us zero growth in our GDP. Our economy will eventually stagnate, too, and we obviously cannot allow this to happen.",12,239,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00239

2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"In response to Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Ms Foo Mee Har, the annual increase in foreign manpower has dropped significantly by more than two-thirds, from the last peak of 80,000 in 2011 to about 24,000 in the past two years. We are increasingly more selective in terms of qualifications and experience of the individual foreigners. At the same time, more importantly, to ensure that our people are treated fairly at all levels in all industries, we have included the adoption of fair and progressive HR practices as part of our Work Pass criteria.",14,241,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00241
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"This balanced approach will enable our combined workforce of locals and foreigners to complement each other better and compete more aggressively for good investments globally, such as the opening of Micron's expanded facility here last month, as cited by Minister Iswaran. We need to compete and win many more of such good investments so that we can keep creating better quality growth for the economy and, more importantly, better quality jobs for our people.",15,242,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00242

They came from various age groups – one in three were below 40 years old, one in four between 40 and 49, and 40%, or two in five, were aged 50 and above.

With the exodus of the baby boomers in the coming years and also lower fertility rate and the slower entrance of new workers, does MOM foresee that in the longer term, in five or 10 years' time, we will be able to sustain that one-third to two-thirds local to foreign manpower ratio? Is it possible to sustain that?",5,278,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00278
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, first, on Fair Consideration Framework, in February this year, we identified 100 companies that we considered as being ""triple weak"". We subjected their EP applications to closer scrutiny. In the last six months, TAFEP has been working very closely with them to improve their HR practices.",1,279,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00279
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Of the 100 companies, about 20%, or one in five, responded by taking part in our job fairs and stepping up training for the locals. Some even have knowledge transfer programmes for the locals. For this one-fifth of companies, on the recommendation of TAFEP, we have decided to remove them from the watch-list because their HR practices are now on par with the industry standard.",2,280,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00280
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"For the remaining 80%, even though many of them have made some improvements, we think that a lot more can be done. We will continue to monitor them. Among them, right now, there are about 300 EP applications still being closely scrutinised, until we are convinced that they have met our fair consideration requirement.",3,281,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00281
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"At the same time, we will continue to identify more of these ""triple weak"" companies. So far, we have identified another 180 of them. If we put 180 plus the 80% of the 100, we now have altogether about 250 companies on our watch-list. The whole purpose is not to punish them, but rather to work with them, engage them and enhance their HR practices to give our Singaporeans fair consideration.",4,282,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00282
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"On the second point of whether we can do more for the mature PMETs, I would say, certainly, yes. We are stepping up our effort. Earlier, I talked about expanding PCP from 22 programmes to at least 50 by the end of this year. More importantly, we are working with more and more companies to open up their job openings to mature workers and to those on the PCP.",5,283,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00283
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"What we are doing now is, whenever we organise a job fair, whether it is a virtual or physical job fair, the employers will indicate whether they are prepared to take in mature workers for a particular job under CSP or take in workers who are not job-ready but are prepared to go for job conversion under PCP. In most cases, it is for both.",6,284,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00284
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Our intention is to keep growing the list of employers who are prepared to open up more of their jobs under PCP and CSP.

2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"The third question about whether we are able to sustain the one-third to two-thirds local to foreign manpower ratio, right now, we are still about there. Looking ahead to the next five to 10 years, will we be able to sustain the one-third to two-thirds ratio? I would say the key consideration is productivity gain. If we are able to strive for the 2%-3% productivity gain, then the pressure on increasing the total workforce would be less. Therefore, I am not able to give you any projection. But I would say that for now and in the near future, let us focus and apply our mind to innovation and productivity because that is the most sustainable way for us to sustain our growth in the long term without becoming overly dependent on foreign manpower.",8,286,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00286
2016-10-10-T-007,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Recently, I attended a job fair organised by e2i at one of the community centres. I noticed that employers who had placed jobs were familiar employers. They have been active before. They have adopted the suite of programmes the Minister recommended. I would like to ask the Minister to give an assessment about the other late majority, other employers who have placed jobs in the Jobs Bank but have not come out very actively to participate in job fairs. How do we, therefore, nudge them to be more proactive in placing locals and adopting the suite of programmes that he mentioned earlier?",1,287,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00287
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Madam, for the job fairs at the community level, I would not be surprised if you keep seeing about the same faces. Because for our job fairs in the community, we try to reach out to employers where the jobs are nearby in the community. Since the companies do not move in and out of communities too quickly, as a result, you are likely to see more of the familiar faces.",1,288,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00288
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Having said that, I do share Mr Ang's concern whether we can keep encouraging more and more companies to step forward, to open up their jobs to our locals.

2016-10-10-T-007,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"First, will the Minister adjust the Employment Pass (EP) scheme such that Singaporeans with the necessary skills and experience are provided with the opportunities to be considered first for vacancies? Second, will the Minister consider providing incentives to employers to retain Singaporeans over EP holders during a retrenchment exercise, for example, widening the Career Support Programme so that employers can access them to keep Singaporeans employed, rather than wait for them to be retrenched, that is, keep them employed as they restructure their businesses?",2,292,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00292
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, the first question about EP, whether we can adopt the policy of Singaporeans-first in processing an EP application, I am hesitant about this. If I may go back to the example highlighted by Mr Iswaran. Micron has just opened their expanded facility with an investment of a few billion dollars. For that facility which comes with such a heavy investment, they need to have a few hundred PMETs to keep the place running non-stop. If MOM were to come in and say, ""You have to keep recruiting Singaporeans first until no more Singaporeans would take the jobs before you allow foreigners to take on these jobs"", my worry is that if we have that Singaporeans-first reputation, eventually, EDB, MTI, all our agencies will have problems competing for the best investments in the world.",1,293,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00293
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Let me also put it this way. If you look at the EP and at the PMET levels, a vast majority of PMETs in Singapore are local. Many years from now, we will still have EPs in our workforce. I have illustrated earlier to Members that our local workforce growth is slowing down. So, we do need to continue to have foreigners.",2,294,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00294
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,Having EP in our system is not a bad thing. But what is bad is if it leads to unfair consideration for the locals. What we are doing is to tighten the EP criteria to maximise the complementarity between EP and the locals. I would say that the best way for us to help the locals is to focus on enhancing their employability. This is something we have been doing.,3,295,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00295
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"The other point is about retrenchment ‒ whether we can provide incentives for companies to retain locals. The answer is yes. We are already doing that. For companies which retain their locals, we provide a lot of support to them. Let me give a simple example.",4,296,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00296
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Earlier, in the Committee of Supply (COS) this year, I announced that we have extended the PCP to in-house PCP. In other words, PMETs, instead of being retrenched, if the company is able to redeploy them within the company, we will support them with the PCP. Under the PCP, during the retraining period of up to a maximum of 18 to 24 months, we subsidise their wages and training programme. These are things we are already doing.",5,297,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00297
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"On the whole, I just want to caution that, firstly, retrenchment is not by individuals. Retrenchment is by an operation. Earlier, we talked about a company transferring its R&D operations out of Singapore. The whole team will be affected, whether you are local or an EP holder, the entire operation will be affected. Secondly, at the PMET level, the local PMETs outnumber the foreign PMETs in most cases. That is why we are concerned that we will see more local PMETs being affected. That is the reason why I mentioned earlier we are going to do a lot more to help them to adapt and grow again.",6,298,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00298

The CSP is obviously a very useful programme for all PMETs. I am wondering why restrict the access to the CSP for younger PMETs under 40 years old to only those who are at least unemployed for six months. Why not open CSP to all PMETs, regardless of age?",1,299,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00299
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Madam, we are trying to help all PMETs. In helping them, we recognise that some PMETs may need more help than the others. We have observed that the mature PMETs face more challenges. I will give a simple example. For the mature PMETs, many of them have been working in the industry for 10, 20 years, and their wages are higher. When they are affected by redundancy, when they move on to another company, to command a similar level of salary is always a big challenge. As a result, the pay cut that the mature PMETs have to take is normally higher than that for the younger PMETs.",1,300,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00300
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"The purpose of the CSP is to minimise the wage cut. For example, if a PMET is earning between $4,000 and $7,000, under the CSP, we subsidise their wages for the first year. Our intention is to help these mature PMETs to move to a new company with a new employer, hopefully, without having to suffer too severe a pay cut. The same may not necessarily apply to the younger PMETs.",2,301,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00301

I would like to ask the Minister, as we scale up the PCPs and the CSP, can particular emphasis be given to how we can preserve the skills or, if not, preserve the abilities? They may have rich experience and so on, so how do we preserve these? This is so that, as a whole, our human capital is preserved and retained so that we can use that to grow our economy.",1,306,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00306
2016-10-10-T-007,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, I think Mr Liang touched on a very important point.

We have started trying out the services of the private placement companies. We are now in the process of scaling them up. So, in the near future, you will hear us announcing a partnership programme with the private placement community to help middle to senior levels of PMETs to pursue job openings in a more effective way.",4,310,2016-10-10-T-007-S-00310

First, we will not allow any device heavier than 20 kg or wider than 70 cm, or have a maximum speed that can exceed 25 km/h to be used on any public paths, because these devices have high propensity for serious accidents. Power-assisted bicycles, even if they meet these criteria, will not be allowed on footpaths.",7,327,2016-10-10-T-008-S-00327

All must observe a speed limit of 15 km/h on footpaths and 25 km/h on cycling paths. They must also abide by a code of conduct.

The Land Transport Authority had set up a dedicated team of Active Mobility Enforcement Officers, and since May this year, the team has been patrolling hotspots where many cyclists and PMD users share paths with pedestrians. These enforcement officers have issued advisories to over 700 cyclists and PMD users for unsafe behaviours. This is about 5% of those that they engaged. In other words, what that means is that the vast majority of cyclists and PMD users have been observed to be riding safely and responsibly. In addition, LTA has conducted close to 20 joint operations with the Traffic Police to clamp down on reckless riding behaviour, and will continue with such enforcement operations.",9,329,2016-10-10-T-008-S-00329

The Safe Cycling Programme, which will start by February next year, will strengthen previous campaigns by also educating cyclists and PMD users about the new rules and code of conduct. We are also partnering the community to roll out the Active Mobility Patrol scheme in more than 20 constituencies, where we will mobilise volunteers to join in the education outreach. LTA has also engaged retailers of PMDs to educate them about the new rules and, migh It add, the penalties. This is so that they are aware of the criteria for devices that can be used on public paths and the consequences of selling illegal devices.",10,330,2016-10-10-T-008-S-00330
2016-10-10-T-008,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Some Members have asked if we should register bicycles and PMDs and mandate third party insurance. These were suggestions that the Panel considered.

2016-10-10-T-017,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"With this change, members will have three options on their lump-sum withdrawal. First, withdraw the lump sum starting from their PEA birthday.

Third, convert the lump sum into monthly payouts through CPF LIFE or the Retirement Sum Scheme.",5,366,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00366

2016-10-10-T-017,Lim Swee Say,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say),"We are, therefore, amending the CPF Act to allow for automatic starting of payouts at age 70 for members on the Retirement Sum Scheme.

But I am equally concerned about members' immediate needs. Just to give one example. I have seen residents at my Meet-the-People Session, in particular, a resident who lives with her family members, her children's family, and are not happy with the situation and wanted to shift out and buy her own flat. She does not have cash but her money is in her CPF account. So, she says that """"我 只 可 以 看 , 不 可 以 动, 不 可 以 用 "" and this is a situation where I feel that perhaps CPF can be more flexible.",4,382,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00382

2016-10-10-T-017,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Is it to address a concern that the financial adequacy of MediSave Accounts would deteriorate over time, if the same accounts are repeatedly being used to pay for the medical expenses of related persons? Would members, who are unable to tap on their MediSave Account to help their loved ones for whatever reason, be asked to use their Ordinary or Special Account instead, via a transfer made permissible under the new section?",5,398,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00398
2016-10-10-T-017,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"There is not much detail specified in the new section 18D of the Bill, but, as it stands, such a move will affect the retirement adequacy of members, now that their Ordinary and Special accounts can also be used to top up the MediSave Accounts of their loved ones. I seek clarifications on the new section 18D of the Bill.",6,399,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00399

2016-10-10-T-017,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The CPF Review Panel, in its report in early 2015, said it recognises that many members may have short-term cash flow needs in retirement, and came up with the flexibility to allow members to withdraw up to 20% of their Retirement Account savings, but only at PEA. The decision to delay such withdrawal till PEA was premised on a belief that members would be clearer at that point in time to understand the trade-off between a lump-sum withdrawal of one's retirement savings and lower monthly payouts.",8,401,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00401

For members with about $80,000 in their Retirement Accounts, it is just a toss between receiving $680 a month or $580 a month with a lump-sum withdrawal of about $20,000.",9,402,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00402

2016-10-10-T-017,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The CPF Review Panel has made the right recommendation to allow members the flexibility to withdraw up to 20% of their Retirement Account savings, but it has fallen short by restricting the option to exercise this flexibility only when members attain their PEA. There should be an option for members to exercise such withdrawal after age 55 and prior to reaching PEA.",11,404,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00404
2016-10-10-T-017,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Madam, at age 55, members will have their CPF savings locked up in their Retirement Accounts. For members who have set their minds on withdrawing 20% of their Retirement Account savings, what difference does it make to have them withdraw a portion of their CPF savings at age 60, 65, or whatever the PEA may be in the future? These members are already mentally prepared for a lower monthly retirement income to begin with, and the illustrative table provided by the CPF Review Report will give them a good gauge of the trade-off involved. What these members will stand to lose, however, is the compounded interest on the portion of the retirement savings they wish to take out before attaining PEA, and that may not amount to anything significant, depending on the amount withdrawn.",12,405,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00405

2016-10-10-T-017,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech on Pg xx.] Mdm Speaker, the CPF system is Singapore's important social security foundation. It has been successfully operating for more than 60 years. In order to ensure that this system keeps pace with changes, and continue to function effectively, I believe it is necessary to make amendments to the CPF Act. However, we need to take note of two fundamental principles in making amendments to the system.",2,409,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00409
2016-10-10-T-017,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"Firstly, CPF is a retirement scheme which addresses housing, healthcare and children's education needs. Essentially, it safeguards the quality of the lifestyle of an individual and that of the household. From this perspective, CPF has to adopt a proper and stable management model that is not easily vulnerable to risks.",3,410,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00410
2016-10-10-T-017,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"It is commonly said that ""Investment always carries risks and one needs to proceed with caution."" There is no business that only earns profits and suffers no losses. Even the most savvy investor may plunge into losses in a volatile and uncertain market. In July this year, Temasek Holdings announced that in the 2016 financial year, shareholder returns came in at a negative 9%, stirring up much public debate. But looking at the 10-year period, Temasek still performs very well overall. Investment is a specialised area of expertise. If even Temasek with its very professional team of researchers could also end up with losses, we cannot expect the small everyday investor to remain unscathed. Thus, it is critical for the investment of CPF monies to be handled with extreme caution, as this would have a great impact on retirement plans and social stability. From a business standpoint, we hope that our employees work very hard when they are young and that they could enjoy their twilight years after retirement. We do not wish to see our employees liberally use CPF funds to invest, and have this affect their mood and work should they suffer investment losses.",4,411,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00411
2016-10-10-T-017,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"The second principle is that CPF is part of the worker's salary. Every worker needs to contribute CPF; the employer has to contribute CPF on behalf of his workers, too. Hence, whether you are a local employer or an overseas investor, CPF contributions should always be taken into account when computing business overheads.",5,412,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00412
2016-10-10-T-017,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"I recall this saying  ""The man without thought for the future will surely have trouble close at hand."" Presently, Singapore is feeling the impact of a rapidly ageing population. If we introduce more flexibility into managing CPF funds and allow people to use their CPF funds for other investment purposes, they may even withdraw their CPF funds completely and spend them when they reach a certain age. If the elderly lose their means of financial protection which, in turn, affects social stability, this deviates from the original intention of setting up the CPF scheme.",6,413,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00413
2016-10-10-T-017,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"We need money to sustain our livelihood as we age. However, due to inflation, some elderly people who have reached retirement age have insufficient funds in their CPF to maintain their basic living expenses. They have no choice but to continue working to avoid losing the source of income. This phenomenon should be brought to the attention of the public at large.",7,414,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00414
2016-10-10-T-017,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"Of late, disputes on CPF have become very frequent. This is natural. Times have changed. Singaporeans have become more educated. Everyone is expressing concern about the CPF system and safeguards for the elderly. This is a good thing. CPF is very important to social harmony and stability, and, therefore, the tripartite partners need to review this earnestly. The Government needs to reflect on the reasons behind the public discontent and decide whether it needs to increase management transparency. Employers have to make timely contributions to CPF to ensure peace of mind for their employees to do their work. Employees should also not forget that CPF was set up to provide for their old age. Most of all, every good system needs to be time-tested. Having said this, I feel that amendments to the CPF Act should be handled with extreme prudence.",8,415,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00415

2016-10-10-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Firstly, the greater discretion accorded to CPF Board will lead to greater efficiency.

2016-10-10-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I understand that we are doing this, as the Minister has mentioned, because some members on the Retirement Sum Scheme may not have made these applications despite receiving repeated reminder letters from CPF Board around two months before their PEA. Can I ask if the Board has found out the reasons as to why members did not make these applications? Was there an increasing number of members who did not make these applications over the past few years? While this amendment will solve this issue on the surface, I wonder if there are other underlying reasons which we need to look into and address as well.",4,430,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00430
2016-10-10-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Secondly, I support the implementation of BHS and the amendments to remove the requirement to top up the MediSave Account. Withdrawal of CPF is often a much-awaited event for many retiring Singaporeans who have laboured hard throughout their lives. But the current policy causes a strain on members when they are required to top up their MediSave Accounts before withdrawing from their Ordinary or Special Accounts. This amendment is a step forward to help increase their retirement funds.",5,431,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00431

2016-10-10-T-017,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"On the topic of simplification, the current CPF scheme, though sound, comprehensive and intricate, can still be seen to be quite complicated. It is currently made up of three main accounts – Ordinary Account, Special Account, MediSave Account. Then, a fourth account, the Retirement Account, is created when the member is 55 years old. Each account has its own set of processes and benefits.",4,467,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00467
2016-10-10-T-017,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Because the entire scheme is not so simple and challenging to grasp by the layman, a quick search on the Internet reveals several Singaporean blogs and websites proffering help on understanding the whole scheme and advice on optimising the CPF scheme for financial benefit. Some of the advice is sound and others give incorrect information. Then there are some that exist to incite resentment towards the scheme. I believe most of us here are familiar with the ""Return Our CPF"" saga.",5,468,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00468
2016-10-10-T-017,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Reasonably, Singaporeans want more transparency about their hard-earned money, and the Government has done its best to make all the information available, even attempting to explain it through case studies, graphics and cartoons.",6,469,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00469
2016-10-10-T-017,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I am especially glad that CPF Board has started a series of roadshows and campaigns to help the people understand and start planning for retirement. I do hope the public will take advantage of these platforms. I also hope CPF Board could perhaps explore how it can be even more proactive on an ongoing basis in engaging the public so that the people are kept abreast of its good work and, hopefully, in a simplified way.",7,470,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00470

2016-10-10-T-017,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech on Pg xx.] The amendments to the Act this time round also include the option for CPF members to make a lump-sum withdrawal from the Retirement Account. It offers greater flexibility in managing money and will be especially useful for those who need some large expenses in their old age. Those who do not have health problems can use the money for self-improvement and learn constructive skills and hobbies that they were not able to learn when they were younger.,9,472,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00472
2016-10-10-T-017,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),I note CPF Board's efforts to use cartoons to explain the CPF system to the public. This is commendable but I believe that the issue of cost had constrained CPF Board from placing more media advertisements.,10,473,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00473
2016-10-10-T-017,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"For instance, the amendments to the CPF Act in the last round allowed transfers between married couples. I am not sure if many Singaporeans are aware that this can be done. We should remind CPF members whose spouses are homemakers that they need to do their best to enhance or top up the amount in their spouse's accounts. This will enable their housewife spouses to become more secure and more comfortable during their retirement. It is a good form of savings for old age and can also help the family.",11,474,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00474
2016-10-10-T-017,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Nonetheless, having such a huge amount of money in hand means there will be many temptations. I would like to urge those who choose a lump-sum withdrawal to be careful with their finances. It is reasonable, of course, to want to pamper yourself with a little reward after working hard for so many years. But expenses meant for enjoyment and comfort, for instance, taking a luxury cruise, buying a new car or renovating your homes – these expenses will build up and the money withdrawn will be gone in a flash.",12,475,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00475

Refrain from making high-risk investments if these involve savings that you cannot afford to lose. Even when buying bonds, one should be careful because we have seen recently how companies are increasingly facing difficulties in fulfilling their obligations and requested for refinancing of payments and others.

2016-10-10-T-017,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"With the lump-sum withdrawal now an option, I am concerned that senior citizens will become an even more prominent target for scams after the age of 65. Family members must make efforts to ensure that their elderly relatives, parents and grandparents are aware of these scams. I hope the Government would do more to reach out to this group of people and generate more awareness.",15,478,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00478
2016-10-10-T-017,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Singaporeans who have plans for the money they have withdrawn should then be prepared to cash in on their homes, with schemes like the Lease Buyback scheme or Silver Housing Bonus to fall back on to supplement their income for the rest of their life.",16,479,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00479

Instead, she chose to continue living in her 4-room flat. As a result, she has to continue working full-time to support her choice. Some, like her, have made a conscious choice.

2016-10-10-T-017,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),A key amendment today is to allow a lump-sum withdrawal of up to 20% from eligible members' Retirement Accounts when they reach 65. This option will be available to those born in 1958 or later. Those who prefer to defer their withdrawals have the additional options of transferring the amounts to the Ordinary Account or converting them into monthly payouts through CPF LIFE or the Retirement Sum Scheme.,2,484,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00484
2016-10-10-T-017,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),Many Singaporeans welcome this new flexibility. It is always good to have options to withdraw more and get lower monthly payouts or withdraw less and get higher monthly payouts to cater to different retirement needs. I would like to commend the Advisory Panel for its painstaking efforts in reviewing our CPF system. It is not easy to ensure retirement funding sufficiency while introducing more elements of flexibility in the use of CPF funds.,3,485,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00485
2016-10-10-T-017,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"As it is today, our CPF funds are being used for housing, healthcare, education and investments to a point where, for some members, they do not have enough to fund their retirement expenses, which was the original intent of CPF in the first place.",4,486,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00486
2016-10-10-T-017,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"And, yet, we continue to receive requests to further liberalise the use of CPF funds. Some argue that the older generation, many of whom are less educated, may need more help from the Government to manage their funds. On the other hand, they assert, those in the younger generation are more highly educated and should be empowered to save up for their retirement. I disagree.",5,487,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00487
2016-10-10-T-017,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"There is a difference between being more highly educated and financially literate. It takes knowledge, skills and personal discipline to accumulate funds for the distant future, especially when there are already many current needs and wants. As years of data have shown, most investors who had used their CPF to invest would have been better off leaving them in the Ordinary Account. It may be better to err on the side of caution when considering the use of CPF funds for investments by members. CPF should remain a low-risk asset for members.",6,488,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00488
2016-10-10-T-017,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Instead, we should get all members, particularly those from the lower income groups, to focus on building up their CPF accounts.

2016-10-10-T-017,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Those seeking employment, including the self-employed, should not be tempted to receive more cash payments upfront in lieu of CPF contributions. They stand to lose out on Government top ups, if they do not have active CPF accounts and the attractive CPF interest rates. They should be constantly reminded to contribute to their CPF. Without funds in their CPF, it would be difficult for them to plan ahead for important milestones, such as buying a home, funding their children's education or be able to afford unexpected medical expenses, let alone fulfil their retirement needs.",8,490,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00490
2016-10-10-T-017,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"At this point, I would like to commend MOM's public education efforts to increase awareness among workers of their rights. The recent TV advertisements to inform workers of their entitlements to CPF contributions do a great job in reaching out to workers in an interesting and easy to understand format. MOM's acronym is particularly suitable for this message – if your employer is not treating you right, just call the hotline and tell MOM!",9,491,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00491
2016-10-10-T-017,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Lastly, I would like to voice my support for the amendments to simplify the MediSave top up process for family members. Currently, there are tax-based incentive schemes to encourage family members to top up the CPF accounts of their loved ones. By allowing the transfer of monies in either or both of the member's Ordinary Accounts and Special Accounts to the MediSave Accounts of their family members who have lower balances, the recipients can benefit from the extra interest on lower balances and enjoy a higher effective interest rate overall. In the long term, they will be closer to having their own CPF LIFE plans. This amendment will benefit family members who are not working or are engaged in lower paying jobs for a variety of reasons – to look after the family, illness or disability. The ease of fund transfers will facilitate the strengthening of bonds among family members. I would like to conclude with my support for the Bill.",10,492,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00492

2016-10-10-T-017,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Firstly, providing the flexibility of a 20% lump-sum withdrawal from the Payout Eligibility Age (PEA). When the CPF Advisory Panel deliberated on this particular recommendation, the views werre divided. There were some panel members who felt that we have to continue to tighten on any early withdrawal; while there were others who felt we should provide for flexibility. So, it is a balance between flexibility for early withdrawal versus preserving as much as possible for retirement needs.",2,495,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00495
2016-10-10-T-017,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"At the end of the day, the Advisory Panel's recommendation is a well-balanced one. They recognised that some people may need to withdraw the money earlier but there should be a cap of 20%, including the amount withdrawn at the age of 55. And we should provide for this early withdrawal not at 55 but at the PEA because, by then, the person would, at the age of 65, for most, be in a better position to look ahead and make the assessment whether he needs more money now or to keep more for retirement years.",3,496,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00496
2016-10-10-T-017,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"The comments earlier by the various Members reflect these divided views. For example, Mr Png Eng Huat asked, ""Why not bring forward to 55?"" So, he belongs to the group that goes for flexible provision. We also have Mr Thomas Chua who reminded the House that we should try to preserve as much as possible for retirement. Prof Randolph Tan highlighted the same. Mr Saktiandi Supaat likewise called for the public to be cautious.

2016-10-10-T-017,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Secondly, automatic payout for the Retirement Sum Scheme. Broadly, all Members supported this move. Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Louis Ng asked why some members did not activate their Retirement Sum payouts even at the age of 70 and beyond.

They keep it in the Retirement Account. Some of them have been receiving adequate support from their children. So, they said, ""Look, at this moment, I am comfortable with the support. I don't need to draw on the money."" Some of them do not know that they have to activate their payouts under the Retirement Sum Scheme (RSS). So, they said, ""Oh, you mean I have to activate it?""",7,500,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00500
2016-10-10-T-017,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"There is yet another group. Their concern is, ""But what if I outlive my Retirement Account savings?"" RSS, typically, provides for up to 20 years of payouts. Therefore, they said, ""Look, I would like to keep it. I don't know how long I will live. It is better to defer the RSS payouts to as late as possible, just in case I outlive my Retirement Account savings.""",8,501,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00501

2016-10-10-T-017,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Lastly, various amendments about recovering over-payment, payment in error by the Government agencies, I want to explain that members will be served the notice in advance. CPF Board would not just recover the payment in error without notifying the CPF members. They would be notified in advance and,if the members have any queries or any objections, they can raise these to CPF Board and then CPF Board will consult the relevant agencies. Most of these payments made in error did not originate from CPF Board.

But for cheque payments, if they are not encashed and the cheques expire, then the money is now put into their CPF accounts. It is only under these circumstances, if later on, the agencies involved discover that they have made the payment in error, then they will notify CPF Board to recover the money. As far as CPF recovery is concerned, if the money is still in members' CPF accounts, we will help them to recover. But if the money is already spent, then it will be beyond the scope of CPF Board. This is to assure Members that there are enough safeguards in place.",14,507,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00507

The family members would include not just spouses but also siblings, parents, grandparents, parents-in-law and grandparents-in-law. A Member asked whether a son-in-law, daughter-in-law can do the transfer. The answer is yes. If a son-in-law or daughter-in-law wants to top up the parents-in-law's accounts, they are encouraged to do so.",15,508,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00508

We have a general policy for the transfer of CPF savings where we would like to encourage the younger generations to top up the CPF account for the older generations and not the other way round. But if the father-in-law loves his son-in-law so much that he decides to withdraw the money in his CPF account in cash and then give the money to the son-in-law and the son-in-law then puts it back into his MediSave Account, obviously, CPF Board cannot stop it.",16,509,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00509

I fully accept that. In fact, that is the reason why CPF Board is now mounting another exercise to try and explain the CPF system in a simpler way, in a way that, hopefully, more members will be able to have a better appreciation.",18,511,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00511

Quite a number of them feel that they are now more confident to help us explain the CPF system to members of the public. We are going to conduct a few more sessions in Tamil, Malay and Mandarin. After this series of four sessions, we are going to take stock based on the feedback and see how can we refine it further and, beyond that, I want to go back to all the Grassroots Advisers to help us send out the message.

In this regard, I am happy to say that CPF Board had, in the second half of last year, piloted a retirement planning service. They invited CPF members, just before they turn 55, to come to CPF Board for a one-to-one, face-to-face consultation where CPF Board staff will try to explain to them what are the options, what are the decisions and so on. The feedback has been very positive. Thus, starting from October this year, starting this month, CPF Board will send information pamphlets to all members at age 54. CPF Board will also send invites to a target group on this retirement planning service before they turn 55, so that they are aware of this optional service available to them.",20,513,2016-10-10-T-017-S-00513

2016-10-10-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Mdm Speaker, I raised this Motion so as to create a better understanding on the need to preserve our heritage, culture and history and, in particular, to urge the Government to consider the conservation of Dakota Crescent.",1,524,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00524
2016-10-10-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"When I was young, I was a regular visitor to the National Library at Stamford Road. The National Library allowed me to read books and to find out more about the world without having to take a single step out of Singapore.",2,525,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00525
2016-10-10-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"I recall spending hours at the old National Library reading fictional books, books about playing chess, stories about Greek mythology and so on.",3,526,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00526
2016-10-10-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"When the National Library at Stamford Road was torn down in 2005 to make way for Fort Canning Tunnel, I was very disappointed. The National Library was a building which carries many fond memories not just for myself but for many other Singaporeans around my age group. I can still recall eating ice kacang from the stall full of bees flying around at the coffeeshop. Sadly, those memories of my time as a young boy at the Stamford Road National Library would now only remain as memories.",4,527,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00527
2016-10-10-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"In 2011, LTA announced that Rochor Centre would be demolished to make way for the new North South Expressway. I had lived at Rochor Centre from 1977 to 1990. I shifted there when I was in Secondary 2 when it was a new block of flats and lived there until I married and moved out. I spent the better part of my growing up years in that estate. It was at Rochor Centre that I started volunteering as a grassroots leader because I wanted to improve the condition of the estate. It saddens me that the four multi-coloured blocks of flats which carry 40 years of memories for those residents would disappear soon.",5,528,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00528
2016-10-10-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Over the years, we have seen the demolition and loss of other prominent buildings like the National Theatre, the Van Kleef Aquarium and Queensway Cinema. Prominent places like New World, Gay World, Great World – they are all gone. The old Bugis Street, Chinatown and Sungei Road are also all gone and, in their places, we have commercial buildings and shopping complexes, many of which lack the original identity. Critics say that they all look similar to other buildings and shopping complexes which can be found all over Singapore.",6,529,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00529
2016-10-10-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"I recognise that Singapore needs to progress and development has to take place. However, when Singaporeans experience loss of too many familiar buildings, familiar places of entertainment and environment, there will be this sense of loss of roots, a loss of emotional attachment to Singapore.",7,530,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00530
2016-10-10-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Museums should not be the only repositories of a nation's memories and history. Our children and the future generation should not be left to read about Singapore's heritage, culture and history only through history textbooks, photographs or some heritage trails.",8,531,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00531
2016-10-10-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Our future generation should have the opportunity to walk through and experience for themselves the same places which their parents had previously walked through, to allow them to experience and feel the presence of a particular environment of a local culture. Just to cite an example, I can show a person a picture book of the Botanic Gardens, or even take him on an interactive journey on the computer to explore the Botanic Gardens, but it is never the same as taking him to the Botanic Gardens for a walk in the park to admire the rainforest, the Ginger Garden, the majestic Tembusu tree or to watch the swans at the lake.",9,532,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00532
2016-10-10-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Mdm Speaker, we need to do more to encourage our citizens to develop a greater emotional connection to Singapore, to develop greater social cohesion and to better identify themselves as Singaporeans. One way to do so is to identify the collective memories of Singaporeans and to see how we can preserve the existing way of life and the local identity. Old buildings like the National Library, National Theatre, Van Kleef Aquarium; places like Sungei Road, Chinatown, Little India, Bugis Street; they all form part of the culture and heritage of Singapore. These are the buildings and places which existed during the days of nation building. They are all part of the Singapore history.",10,533,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00533
2016-10-10-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Many other countries are also taking steps to preserve their heritage and culture. Just look at the efforts by Japan, Hong Kong and the countries in Europe. If Singapore does not take urgent action to evaluate what to preserve and how to preserve our local heritage, culture and identity, these memories may be lost forever. Try as we may, we may never be able to re-create the same culture, the same setting. Just look at Chinatown and Bugis Street as examples of our attempts to re-create the environment and setting but which did not succeed. One of my concerns is that when a Singaporean leaves the country to work or study for a few years, when he returns, the place becomes unrecognisable because new buildings keep sprouting up and older buildings get demolished.",11,534,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00534
2016-10-10-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Prof Tommy Koh, in a recent speech at the World Cities Summit, said, ""History and culture can play an important role in the rejuvenation of cities and in transforming ordinary cities into great cities."" Prof Koh said that ""the Singapore conservation movement came in time to realise the importance of conserving our built heritage and the anchors of our individual and collective memories"".",12,535,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00535
2016-10-10-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"This brings me to the question  how does the Government balance between developing our country for better progress as against preserving our heritage, culture and history? Can the Government help citizens to develop a greater sense of belonging to Singapore by preserving more of our history, more of our culture and more of our heritage buildings? How can we recall our past with nostalgia?",13,536,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00536
2016-10-10-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Hence, I wish to call on the Government to reconsider its plans for redeveloping Dakota Crescent which is within Mountbatten constituency. I raised this matter in 2015 in a Parliamentary Question.",14,537,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00537
2016-10-10-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"And plans for the redevelopment of Dakota Crescent were made known sometime in 2014. After the announcement, HDB started to brief the residents about their relocation options and the plan to move the residents to a new block of rental flats. During this period, many residents came to share with me that they will miss the place after staying in Dakota Crescent for more than 50 years. They have so many stories to tell and so many memories attached to the place.",15,538,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00538
2016-10-10-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),Even people whom I have not met before came up to me to share that they had lived in the estate when they were young. They can recall their days growing up in the Old Airport estate and Dakota area.,16,539,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00539
2016-10-10-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sometime in 2015, several residents approached me to argue that there is sufficient merit for the Government to consider preserving Dakota Crescent. I met these residents and other interested parties to better understand their viewpoint. After hearing them out, I agreed with them.",17,540,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00540
2016-10-10-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Dakota Crescent was built in 1958 by the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT), the predecessor of HDB. There are 10 blocks of seven-storey flats, four blocks of three storey flats and one block of two storey flats. It is a tranquil place located next to the river. In fact, I would invite Members of the House to drop by there one day just to walk in the evening, very tranquil. To many Singaporeans who pass by Old Airport Road regularly, they call the flats the ""seven-storey houses"", or what they say in Hokkien, ""qi lao chu"". Dakota Crescent is one of the first public housing projects built during the SIT era to provide mass housing just before the role of mass building for the public was passed on to HDB. The fact that this estate is older than Singapore is a cause for celebration and should be an important consideration for conservation.",18,541,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00541
2016-10-10-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"The estate was named after a Dakota plane crashed at Kallang Airport. In the midst of the estate sits a dove-shape marble playground which I was told is the only dove-shape playground left in Singapore. I was also told that in 1959, the Constitution Exposition was held at Kallang Airport to commemorate internal self-government in Singapore. It was a spectacular exhibition and a huge celebration at that time. Dakota Crescent was witness to this exhibition as it was situated just next to Kallang Airport.",19,542,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00542
2016-10-10-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"The group of residents whom I talked to laboured for many months and they have prepared a Conservation Report to URA and the National Heritage Board. This report is a ground-up movement from interested residents who feel passionately that Dakota Crescent should be preserved. In the Conservation Report, they shared more about the architectural, historical and social significance of Dakota Crescent and the rationale for wanting to preserve this unique piece of estate. I have seen the report. Mdm Speaker, it is with me and it will be presented to NHB and URA. It is very interesting to learn more about the uniqueness of the design of the flats from an architectural point of view.",20,543,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00543
2016-10-10-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"The Conservation Report shared about how Dakota can be used to become a space for educating the future generation about Singapore. There are suggestions as to how the estate can be re-developed for use by arts groups, social enterprises, or as rental flats for couples waiting for their BTO flats. So, this is not just a call by residents to conserve the place. They have even taken the effort to share more about how the Government can use the space even as we conserve it.",21,544,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00544
2016-10-10-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Many of these suggestions warrant serious consideration by the town planners. I hope that by speaking on this Motion, I can persuade the Government to re-think its redevelopment plans for Dakota Crescent.",22,545,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00545
2016-10-10-T-019,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"I believe that this Government can do more to preserve our heritage, culture and history. And by preserving key portions of a unique neighbourhood like Dakota Crescent, the Government would encourage cultural and social networks to be involved and to thrive. This, Mdm Speaker, I submit, would make Singapore a better place for all our future generations.",23,546,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00546
2016-10-10-T-019,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, I support the Motion because I believe that as we continue to forge ahead in terms of national development, it is crucial that we have an acute appreciation for our cultural assets and incorporate them holistically in urban planning.",1,547,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00547
2016-10-10-T-019,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),Let me illustrate this through the example of Toronto's Wychwood Barns.,2,548,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00548
2016-10-10-T-019,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"In 1996, the Wychwood Barns, a complex of five tram sheds constructed in 1913 for the Toronto Civic Railway was slated for demolishment and the land where it sat on was to be sold.",3,549,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00549
2016-10-10-T-019,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"While the Barns was an important transit facility from the 1920s to the 1940s, when trams were phased out, this unique red-brick complex was decommissioned, unattended to and soon degenerated into disrepair. Then, it was closed for many years.",4,550,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00550
2016-10-10-T-019,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"However, fearful of what might be redeveloped on the site, local City Councillor Joe Mihevc and some of his residents around the area decided to act quickly. The Barn was opened for residents to visit and acquaint themselves with the space. Many were awed by the structure, its high ceiling and its enchanting red bricks. The community rallied together, requesting that a Heritage and Environmental Impact assessment be conducted. People gathered together over many sessions to discuss plans for the building and the land. The residents also engaged Artscape, a non-profit organisation that engaged in real estate and programme development for the arts and creative sector, to help develop ideas. The conversations and the consultations took many years and the final proposal was only ready in 2005.",5,551,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00551
2016-10-10-T-019,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"I visited the Barn in 2014 and was awed by what it has become. The Wychwood Barns reopened in 2008 and has become the ""social heart"" of the community, hosting 26 artist live­work spaces, programming and administrative facilities for 10 non-profit organisations, 14 artists' studios, indoor and outdoor community gardens, a community-run gallery and an 8,000-square feet covered street used for farmers and art markets, conference and events.",6,552,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00552
2016-10-10-T-019,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"There are many other such amazing creative place-making projects, like Project Row House in Houston, Pillsbury House in Minnesota.",7,553,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00553
2016-10-10-T-019,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),I quoted these examples because they have so much resonance with what my fellow parliamentarian Mr Lim Biow Chuan has shared in his speech. I am supportive of his Motion and the effort to champion this important cause for two very important reasons.,8,554,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00554
2016-10-10-T-019,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"One, redevelopment with cultural assets as a resource. I would like to reiterate that any argument for conservation is not, and I repeat, not an argument against development. What the conservationists are arguing for is development that takes heritage as our cultural asset into consideration such that heritage becomes a resource for development.",9,555,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00555
2016-10-10-T-019,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"As we strive to become a more liveable, sustainable city state, such cultural assets should be a key component for redevelopment because they can serve to enhance its overall value. Conservation of precincts, such as Dakota Crescent, allows us to protect and promote our identity as a nation with rich and complex identities, histories and narratives – all of which are traits that not only make us interesting and exciting, but also show our resilience and the relevance of our historical development to our success today.",10,556,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00556
2016-10-10-T-019,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"While demolishment may be the cheapest solution or the easiest one, we lose not just tangible assets like buildings but also intangible cultural assets, historical narratives and memories.",11,557,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00557
2016-10-10-T-019,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"Some may say that history can be told through books and photographs. But I would counter that by arguing that these cannot replace the role and power of actual sites, resplete with their stories, lessons learnt and hopes for the future. Heritage is not about celebrating the past.",12,558,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00558
2016-10-10-T-019,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"Hence, I urge the Government and urban planners to embrace cultural assets as a resource for development and, in considering adaptive uses for them, move from just urban planning towards cultural planning.",13,559,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00559
2016-10-10-T-019,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"Secondly, the ground-up Initiative. Joe Mihevc, the Toronto City Councillor who led the ground-up effort to transform the Wychwood Barn, reflected, ""If there is one key lesson to be learnt it is that positive things happen when Torontonians step up and take charge. The passion and dedication of hundreds of people created a critical web of support. Together, with each holding a piece of the puzzle and needing the cooperation of the others to make it happen, the Barns project was an unstoppable force.""",14,560,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00560
2016-10-10-T-019,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"Going back to the case of Dakota Crescent. When news that the SIT flats of Dakota Crescent would make way for future development, Singaporeans and residents of Dakota very quickly responded. People visited Dakota Crescent to take pictures of the quaint little estate, artists came to create engagement projects to document what was valuable about Dakota. Some, like Dakota Adventures, helped people to understand more about the area. Others, such as residents like Jonathan Poh, organised themselves and envisioned a different future for Dakota Crescent.",15,561,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00561
2016-10-10-T-019,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"Clearly, for many Singaporeans, city-building is not merely about the physical or architectural side of projects. Rather, they saw and valued intangible assets of the precinct, personal relationships and organisation within the community, meaning-making of the space they lived in and were proud of it. In short, what we witnessed was a case of citizens who want to take ownership of their community and history. And their sense of ownership is what makes for successful development.",16,562,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00562
2016-10-10-T-019,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"The proposal that Mr Lim had presented earlier is exactly what the Government has always been looking for – ground-up initiative with a bold vision. The proposal requires us to work with many different communities within and outside of Dakota, to redevelop the place into something inclusive, yet deeply respectful of the heritage and community of Dakota Crescent.",17,563,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00563
2016-10-10-T-019,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"Furthermore, the proposal has the makings of a successful place-making project. One, it has leadership and ownership from the community. Two, it embraces collaboration, and is consultative. Three, it embraces diversity and openness. And four, it is creative.",18,564,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00564
2016-10-10-T-019,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),The proposal is spearheaded by a community that has rallied together through a common recognition of a cultural asset of the precinct and a desire to enhance this value. It is a ground-up initiative by a community that seeks to strengthen itself and remain relevant to our nation's narrative.,19,565,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00565
2016-10-10-T-019,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, I firmly believe that this proposal as presented by Mr Lim is an extraordinary community effort that should be taken seriously.

2016-10-10-T-019,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"What we have is a potentially pioneering project that could become a milestone in our approach towards urban and community development, one where the people take ownership and proactively negotiate amongst themselves to put forward viable, sustainable plans for the future.",21,567,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00567

2016-10-10-T-019,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"In master-planning our land-scarce city-state, our planners have many considerations to address.

And can we conserve without stalling progress and change? The answer, I think, must lie in striking the right balance, between preserving our past and catering to the needs of the present and the future. Mr Kok talked about cultural planning where both development and conservation can co-exist. I think these are solutions that increasingly we have to find.",6,573,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00573
2016-10-10-T-019,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"MND is very mindful of this balance. When we do our work, our focus is not just to plan and build new infrastructure but to undertake development in a way that is sensitive to nature and to our past, and to build stronger emotional connections with our city. That is why, over the years, we have placed more emphasis on the conservation of buildings as an integral part of our urban master plan. For example, we have conserved large areas, such as the Historic Districts of Chinatown, Kampong Glam, Little India and Singapore River. And for Kampong Glam, some of you may know, there is actually a community committee, both of people who live there, people who run businesses there, stakeholders who are interested in heritage, culture and so on.",7,574,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00574
2016-10-10-T-019,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"We have retained several pre-World War II residential flats in Tiong Bahru built by SIT.

2016-10-10-T-019,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"This process of identifying buildings and sites for conservation is an extensive and rigorous one.

2016-10-10-T-019,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"We also involve many stakeholders in the process. MND and URA take in feedback from our Conservation Advisory Panel (CAP), local community groups and also members of the public. In addition, NHB has recently embarked on a tangible heritage survey to build on NHB's existing database of heritage resources. This survey includes research and documentation of buildings and sites of historic or cultural interest found in Singapore and completed in and before 1980. This will also allow us to be better informed when drawing up future land-use plans.",10,577,2016-10-10-T-019-S-00577
2016-10-10-T-019,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Even after deciding to conserve a building, much research and documentation work still needs to be carried out.

Between 2011 and 2016, the number of attendances in our memory clinics increased from about 7,500 attendances to more than 13,000 attendances.

Second, we are strengthening the capability of care staff and caregivers in supporting those with dementia. Between 2013 and 2015, for example, AIC offered over 2,400 training places in dementia-related courses and talks. AIC also provides a Caregivers' Training Grant to caregivers, including foreign domestic workers, to attend many of such courses.

The fact that there are SC family members, for example, an SC spouse or child, would be a plus factor in the evaluation. The circumstances in which the person became stateless may also be relevant. People may, for example, have chosen to give up their foreign citizenship, or may not have acquired foreign citizenship because of the actions/inactions of their parents. There are also some who are stateless, by reason of not applying for citizenship in Singapore previously.

2016-10-10-T-039,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will include the option to reconstruct apron drains and re-screed void decks under block-related works for Town Councils in its Neighbourhood Renewal Programme manual.,1,703,2016-10-10-T-039-S-00703
2016-10-10-T-039,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Since September 2014, the scope of the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme has been expanded to include additional works, such as repainting and various repair works. The repair works include the reconstruction of apron drains and the re-screeding of void decks.

2016-10-10-T-040,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what are the past and present reasons underpinning the policy of not recognising children of unwed mothers as legitimate children; (b) what are the best avenues of assistance for single unwed mothers who wish to adopt their own child to make them legitimate but struggle to afford the legal fees to do so; and (c) how does the Ministry protect the welfare of minors whose single unwed mother died without a will and their status of illegitimacy denies them a share of their mother's assets.,1,706,2016-10-10-T-040-S-00706
2016-10-10-T-040,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The family is the basic building block of our society. Strong marriages are the key to strong families, and parenthood within marriage is the desired and prevailing social norm. Hence, benefits, such as the Baby Bonus cash gift, housing benefits and tax reliefs, are provided to families with legitimate children, to encourage births within marriages. Other benefits that support the growth and development of children are given to all children. These include the recently extended Child Development Account (CDA) benefits, as well as education and healthcare subsidies, the Medisave grant for newborns, infant care and childcare subsidies and the foreign domestic worker levy concession.",1,707,2016-10-10-T-040-S-00707
2016-10-10-T-040,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Those who have difficulty affording legal fees, including unwed mothers who wish to adopt their own child may approach the Legal Aid Bureau for assistance. Applicants will have to satisfy a means test and a merits test to qualify for legal aid.",2,708,2016-10-10-T-040-S-00708
2016-10-10-T-040,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Every situation involving an illegitimate child is different. The Government thus considers each case that it comes across before deciding on the appropriate course of action to take. For instance, illegitimate children can inherit their mother’s estate if their mother dies without a will and has no surviving legitimate children. They may also have other family or social support. These are scenarios where the individual would not need Government support. For children who are vulnerable, MSF's Social Service Offices will assess their needs, provide financial assistance and coordinate support with other social service agencies, where necessary. If there is clearly no next-of-kin and the safety of the minor (aged 16 and below) is compromised, my Ministry can apply for a Court order to place the minor in an alternative environment.",3,709,2016-10-10-T-040-S-00709

2016-10-10-T-043,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien (for the Prime Minister),"It is right and fitting that when Singaporeans who have made major contributions to the country pass away, they are honoured and mourned by the nation. The decision of how to honour the person, including whether to hold a State Funeral, is made by the Government of the day after consulting the family. The appropriate way to do so will vary with each individual. It is not feasible to set a formula as to who should receive a State Funeral, simply based on the person’s rank or appointment held.",2,716,2016-10-10-T-043-S-00716
2016-10-10-T-043,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien (for the Prime Minister),"When Mr Ong Teng Cheong passed away in 2002, the then Cabinet arranged a State-Assisted funeral for Mr Ong after consulting with his family. This included the following the state flag was flown at half-mast on all Government buildings on 11 February 2002; the SAF and Police provided the Coffin Bearer party; vigil guards were deployed as a mark of respect; there was an escort band for the funeral march; the SAF helped to organise the family wake and crematorium service and the Police assisted in crowd and traffic control.",3,717,2016-10-10-T-043-S-00717

2016-10-10-T-044,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Patients are extended healthcare subsidies based on their citizenship status and not that of their children.

2016-10-10-T-044,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We understand that some Singapore Citizens with non-citizen spouses and some Singaporean children with non-citizen parents may require additional support.

2016-10-10-T-044,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We have to take into account the policy objective of differentiating social benefits and subsidies by citizenship, to give greater support to Singapore Citizens. We also need to be mindful that the cost of giving more Government subsidies will ultimately be borne by all Singaporeans. Hence, any proposal to further extend more Government subsidies to foreigners who are neither Permanent Residents nor Long-Term Visit Pass-Plus holders would need to be carefully considered.",4,722,2016-10-10-T-044-S-00722
2016-10-10-T-045,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider reviewing the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) urgently given that 38% of investors have suffered losses through CPFIS and only 16% of investors in the scheme managed to achieve better than the 2.5% interest rate they would have otherwise earned by leaving their money in the CPF Ordinary Account.,1,723,2016-10-10-T-045-S-00723
2016-10-10-T-045,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"CPFIS was introduced in 1986 to give CPF members an option to invest and manage their CPF savings. CPF members are made aware that they must understand and accept the risk of their investment choices. There are over 700 products to choose from under CPFIS. They should, therefore, choose CPFIS investments that match their risk tolerance and investment objectives. There is now $24 billion invested through CPFIS, of which the majority are from the Ordinary Account.",1,724,2016-10-10-T-045-S-00724
2016-10-10-T-045,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"In the past five financial years, about 16% of CPFIS-OA investors were able to realise higher returns than the risk-free OA interest rate offered by CPF. However, the other 84% of CPFIS-OA investors did not. In other words, the majority of CPFIS-OA investors would have been better off leaving their savings in their OA to earn the default interest rate, currently at 2.5%.",2,725,2016-10-10-T-045-S-00725
2016-10-10-T-045,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"The CPF Advisory Panel made a similar observation in its report that was released in August 2016. Hence, the Panel has recommended that the Government review the current CPFIS to better target it at knowledgeable CPFIS investors who feel confident of managing their investments on their own and have the time to do so. Along with the review of the CPFIS, the Panel also recommended that the Government introduce the Lifetime Retirement Investment Scheme, or the LRIS for short, as a simpler investment option. The LRIS will cater to CPF members who wish to invest their CPF savings but find the CPFIS too complex and onerous or find it too time-consuming to actively manage their investments.",3,726,2016-10-10-T-045-S-00726

Their employment practices are now comparable to their industry peers. They have taken proactive steps to participate in career fairs and training programmes organised by WDA and e2i. Some have taken the further step to develop in-house programmes for knowledge transfer to their Singaporean staff. On the recommendation of TAFEP, MOM no longer subjects these firms to closer scrutiny and their EP applications are being processed as per normal.",3,731,2016-10-10-T-046-S-00731
2016-10-10-T-046,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"The remaining four in five have shown some progress but MOM will continue to scrutinise their EP applications.

2016-10-10-T-046,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"In addition, we have identified around 180 more firms to be placed under closer scrutiny. This will bring the total number of firms under closer scrutiny to about 250.",5,733,2016-10-10-T-046-S-00733

2016-10-10-T-048,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Town Councils should manage their finances carefully and take appropriate measures to ensure that they have sufficient funds to carry out their statutory responsibilities.

As announced in September 2016, MND intends to raise the minimum contribution rate into the Sinking Funds and to require Town Councils to set aside more funds for future lift replacements through a new Lift Replacement Fund. The new Lift Enhancement Programme (LEP), estimated at $450 million over the next 10 years, will also give Town Councils significant help by co-funding about 90% of their lift modernisation costs.

We have seen a steady decline in the number of foreigners found to be working illegally, from around 1,300 in 2014 to 550 in the first eight months of this year.",1,763,2016-10-10-T-054-S-00763
2016-10-10-T-054,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"The illegal workers were found working mainly in the construction, food and beverage and other services sectors, in occupations, such as construction workers, cleaners and stall assistants.",2,764,2016-10-10-T-054-S-00764
2016-10-10-T-054,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,All foreigners working in Singapore must have a valid work pass. Failing to do so is a breach of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act. MOM has a multi-prong strategy to reduce such illegal employment.,3,765,2016-10-10-T-054-S-00765
2016-10-10-T-054,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"First, MOM educates work pass holders and employers on their employment responsibilities, as well as the consequences of not complying with our laws. These messages are reinforced in MOM’s advisory letter to employers, guidebooks, newsletters and roadshows for foreign workers, including at their dormitories and in their native languages.",4,766,2016-10-10-T-054-S-00766
2016-10-10-T-054,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Second, we take a risk-based approach and conduct proactive inspections on businesses suspected of hiring foreigners illegally. In addition, we also respond to tip-offs from members of the public. Foreigners found working illegally will be barred from future employment in Singapore.",5,767,2016-10-10-T-054-S-00767
2016-10-10-T-054,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Third, to deter the demand for illegal workers, the penalty for illegal employment was enhanced in 2012. Employers who hire illegal workers face a minimum fine of $5,000 per charge for first-time offenders. Repeat offenders face a minimum fine of $10,000 per charge and a minimum imprisonment term of one month.",6,768,2016-10-10-T-054-S-00768

2016-10-10-T-055,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing,"asked the Minister for Transport with regard to the MRT train incident on 22 March 2016, whether it is premature for SMRT to take disciplinary action against staff before the conclusion of investigations and the coroner's inquiry.",1,770,2016-10-10-T-055-S-00770
2016-10-10-T-055,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"It is SMRT’s prerogative to take disciplinary action against its staff in accordance with its established procedures. However, as the Member has pointed out, investigations by LTA, MOM and Police are still ongoing. An argument can, therefore, be made that, in this case, it would have been better to wait till these investigations come to some conclusions. I note that NTWU has lodged an appeal on behalf of the two staff, and SMRT has convened an Appeal Panel to review the case. I am sure that the Panel will give full consideration to all the relevant factors and reach a fair decision.",1,771,2016-10-10-T-055-S-00771
2016-10-10-T-056,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry has asked SMRT for the full grounds for dismissal of the two employees who have been sacked over the fatal accident on 22 March 2016 near Pasir Ris MRT station; and (b) if so, what were these grounds.",1,772,2016-10-10-T-056-S-00772
2016-10-10-T-056,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"On 22 March 2016, two SMRT trainees were hit and killed by an oncoming train near Pasir Ris MRT station. On 13 September, SMRT dismissed two employees who were involved in the accident – one of the employees was the train driver and the other was an Assistant Engineer.",1,773,2016-10-10-T-056-S-00773
2016-10-10-T-056,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"The National Transport Workers' Union (NTWU) filed an appeal to SMRT on 19 September. In response, the company convened a panel to review the appeal. On 27 September, NTWU also filed an appeal to MOM under the Industrial Relations Act (IRA) on behalf of the two union members.",2,774,2016-10-10-T-056-S-00774
2016-10-10-T-056,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"MOM has called for information on the grounds of dismissal from SMRT. We will try to help the parties involved to come to an amicable settlement through conciliation. If it fails, an inquiry will be conducted to determine if the company has just cause to dismiss the workers. In the meantime, the union is engaging the two workers and is helping to secure employment for them.",3,775,2016-10-10-T-056-S-00775
2016-10-10-T-057,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider making it mandatory to educate prospective or current residents of ""nature-inspired"" developments on the appropriate response to wildlife sighted in their areas and why members of the public should not feed wildlife.",1,776,2016-10-10-T-057-S-00776
2016-10-10-T-057,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"It is important to carefully manage human-wildlife interactions. In this regard, agencies like NParks and AVA are already taking active measures to do so.",1,777,2016-10-10-T-057-S-00777
2016-10-10-T-057,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"First, NParks organises biodiversity programmes like the Festival of Biodiversity and Community in Nature initiatives. Taken as a whole, these programmes help to generate public awareness of, and appreciation for, our native wildlife.",2,778,2016-10-10-T-057-S-00778
2016-10-10-T-057,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Second, agencies disseminate guidelines on how residents can minimise potential human-wildlife conflict, particularly in residential districts close to nature areas. For example, the guidelines touch on proper methods of securing trash bins and keeping food out of sight. Moreover, AVA officers conduct walkabouts in areas where residents have faced issues relating to animal nuisance. AVA officers also attend meetings to address residents’ concerns in these areas.",3,779,2016-10-10-T-057-S-00779
2016-10-10-T-057,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Third, NParks conducts specific outreach activities to discourage animal feeding. These include distributing advisory pamphlets to residents, conducting workshops for school children and displaying prominent signages against wildlife feeding in parks and nature reserves.",4,780,2016-10-10-T-057-S-00780
2016-10-10-T-057,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"That said, there will always be a small minority who persist in inappropriate behaviours like feeding. In these cases, a more targeted approach which may include official warnings or enforcement action is necessary.",5,781,2016-10-10-T-057-S-00781
2016-10-10-T-057,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Most residents who live close to nature areas behave very responsibly, have made adjustments and appreciate wildlife as part of their living environment. The Government will continue with its efforts to engage the broader community in public education initiatives and to work constructively to address problems related to wildlife that might arise. With tolerance, understanding and a spirit of compromise, most human-wildlife issues can be resolved.",6,782,2016-10-10-T-057-S-00782
2016-10-10-T-058,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the intended benefit of noise barriers that are constructed along MRT tracks has been achieved; (b) whether the Ministry will consider covering more areas in which residents' quality of life has been adversely affected; and (c) whether the qualifying threshold can be lowered to less than 67 dBA.,1,783,2016-10-10-T-058-S-00783
2016-10-10-T-058,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,The noise barriers installed along MRT tracks have reduced the noise level from passing trains by around five decibels.,1,784,2016-10-10-T-058-S-00784
2016-10-10-T-058,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"However, the installation of noise barriers incurs resources and takes up precious engineering hours that are needed for maintenance and improvement works. LTA is, therefore, focusing its attention on residential areas where the noise level exceeds NEA's recommended threshold of 67 decibels averaged over an hour.",2,785,2016-10-10-T-058-S-00785
2016-10-10-T-058,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"LTA is also working with train manufacturers and operators to mitigate noise in other ways. These include fitting trains with noise-dampening wheels; using ballast and concrete sleepers on the elevated tracks, which are better able to absorb vibration and noise compared to the concrete slab track used in the underground tunnels; and servicing train wheels and tracks even more frequently.",3,786,2016-10-10-T-058-S-00786
2016-10-10-T-059,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the plans to augment LTA's capabilities due to its expanded role covering the new bus contracting model, new rail financing framework and the future Singapore-Malaysia high-speed rail; (b) whether there are plans to restructure LTA to better execute its role as a regulator, asset owner and industry developer; and (c) what new capabilities will be put in place to ensure better governance and service delivery of rail and bus services under the new structure.",1,787,2016-10-10-T-059-S-00787
2016-10-10-T-059,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The new public bus and rail financing models and the future Singapore-KL High Speed Rail will indeed, require new resources and capabilities on the part of LTA.",1,788,2016-10-10-T-059-S-00788
2016-10-10-T-059,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"LTA has increased its headcount steadily since 2013 by about 35%. This growth was largely in engineering and asset management. In the next two years, LTA will add another 900 new engineering positions.",2,789,2016-10-10-T-059-S-00789
2016-10-10-T-059,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Second, LTA has been tapping the experiences of other jurisdictions. Amongst others, it has been studying the public transport tendering and contract management approaches used in the UK, Sweden, Australia and Germany. It has been in discussions with and conducted visits to the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway, Taipei Metro and London Underground to understand their asset management and maintenance processes. LTA has also established platforms, such as the Rail Excellence Advisory Panel and the High Speed Rail International Advisory Panel, so as to be able to discuss the issues directly with experienced practitioners who have faced similar challenges in their work abroad.",3,790,2016-10-10-T-059-S-00790
2016-10-10-T-059,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Third, LTA has undergone reorganisation to be able to better deliver on its expanded mandate. Four new specialist teams have been formed a rail asset management team, a bus asset management team, a bus service tendering and contract team and a High Speed Rail group. As the projects progress, in particular, as and when there is further agreement with Malaysia on the High Speed Rail, LTA will further restructure and reorganise itself as needed.",4,791,2016-10-10-T-059-S-00791
2016-10-10-T-060,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"asked the Minister for Transport what measures are in place to ensure that private hire car drivers, including Uber drivers, have adequate insurance coverage to cover injuries and damage to passengers, road users and private property.",1,792,2016-10-10-T-060-S-00792
2016-10-10-T-060,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act requires all motor vehicles, including private hire cars, to be insured against third-party liability risks. These include death or bodily injury to passengers and other road users. In addition, private hire cars are required to procure insurance that covers the use of the vehicle for hire and reward purposes, which is more than the basic coverage of third-party liability risks required of vehicles in general. This means that passengers in a private hire car who are involved in a motor accident can claim compensation from the owner of the private hire car or its insurer.",1,793,2016-10-10-T-060-S-00793
2016-10-10-T-060,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"It is an offence to use or permit a person to use a vehicle without the appropriate insurance.

2016-10-10-T-061,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the reason for the Certificate of Entitlement (COE) renewal period to be fixed at five years and 10 years; and (b) whether the Ministry will allow flexibility for vehicle owners, in particular motorcycle owners, to choose the period of renewal of their choice.",1,795,2016-10-10-T-061-S-00795
2016-10-10-T-061,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The validity period of COEs, whether first-time COEs or renewal COEs, was originally set at 10 years.",1,796,2016-10-10-T-061-S-00796
2016-10-10-T-061,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"However, in response to appeals from vehicle owners, including motorcycle owners, whose COEs are expiring but feel that their vehicles might not last beyond another five years, we changed the policy in 1992 to allow them to renew their COEs for five years, as a concession. The vehicles must then be deregistered at the end of the five years. If, however, the vehicle is deregistered before five years, the amount paid for the remaining COE validity period will be refunded. In that sense, the vehicle owner already has some flexibility to keep the vehicle for less than five years.",2,797,2016-10-10-T-061-S-00797
2016-10-10-T-061,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Allowing vehicle owners to renew their COEs for any number of years they choose favours, in effect, existing vehicle owners over those who wish to buy a new vehicle. We have to strike a fair balance between the two groups and, therefore, are not inclined to extend such a concession to existing vehicle owners. Such a move could also give rise to more uncertainty over the supply and demand of COEs, and introduce more volatility into the prices, compared to the current situation where the validity period is fixed at five or 10 years.",3,798,2016-10-10-T-061-S-00798

2016-10-10-T-062,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"To reduce the risk of incidents, new buildings are designed with concrete ledges or steel casings to hold the air-conditioning units. In addition, the installation of air-conditioning units on the building exterior can only be performed by trained installers. This is to ensure that the work complies with safety requirements and that it is carried out in the manner stipulated under the Building Control Regulations. MND also worked with Town Councils to disseminate flyers informing residents of their responsibilities for maintaining their air-conditioning units.",3,802,2016-10-10-T-062-S-00802
2016-10-10-T-062,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"While the occurrence of falling air-conditioning units is rare, we cannot be complacent. The Government will continue to engage homeowners and remind them of the role that they play in creating a safe living environment.

2016-10-10-T-078,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Early detection and prompt treatment of active cases is key to controlling the spread of tuberculosis (TB) in Singapore.

2016-10-10-T-078,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We also work to prevent the spread of TB. Doctors are reminded to look out for cases of possible TB. Once cases are diagnosed, the doctors are required to notify MOH. The Tuberculosis Control Unit (TBCU) then identifies those who had prolonged and close contact with the TB patient, such as household members and workplace colleagues, to undergo screening for TB, as they have the highest risk of contracting the disease. Those found to have latent TB, which is TB without any symptoms and is not infectious, may be placed on treatment to prevent development of active TB. This practice is aligned with the World Health Organization’s recommendations, and practices in other developed countries. In addition, to better understand the spread of disease and to identify clusters, TBCU conducts DNA fingerprinting studies.",3,866,2016-10-10-T-078-S-00866

2016-10-10-T-083,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,We have used the 2007 to 2009 marriage cohorts as we can more meaningfully compare dissolution rates before the fifth anniversary from date of marriage onwards.,2,892,2016-10-10-T-083-S-00892
2016-10-10-T-083,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The population is defined as ""resident marriages""; that is, marriages involving at least one Singapore Citizen (SC) or Permanent Resident (PR). In addition, educational qualification is used as a proxy for income, as income is not a compulsory field when couples file for marriage locally.",3,893,2016-10-10-T-083-S-00893
2016-10-10-T-083,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"For couples who married in 2007 to 2009, the number of dissolved marriages before the fifth anniversary for resident marriages remained relatively stable at around 1,500 to 1,600 per year of a dissolution rate of 6.4% to 6.8%. In general, the number of dissolved marriages was lower for marriages involving grooms with higher educational qualifications attained as shown in tables 1A to 1D below. The number of marriages between a Singapore Citizen (SC) and a Non-Resident (NR) was around 6,000 to 7,000 for the three marriage cohorts from 2007 to 2009. Of these, around 400 to 500 marriages of each marriage cohort or 7.1% to 7.9% dissolved before the fifth anniversary. Based on the three marriage cohorts from 2007 to 2009, there appears to be an upward trend, but more data points are required to confirm the trend.",4,894,2016-10-10-T-083-S-00894
2016-10-10-T-083,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The Ministry recognises that SC-NR marriages face unique challenges. As such, we have introduced marriage programmes in December 2014 to help these couples manage cross-cultural differences as they settle down in Singapore and to strengthen their marriages. These programmes include the Marriage Preparation Programme offered before marriage, the Marriage Support Programme for newly-weds, and the Friendship Programme, which comprises family bonding activities, support group sessions and pairing of volunteers to foreign spouses as ""buddies"".",5,895,2016-10-10-T-083-S-00895

Couples marrying on and after 1 October 2016, where at least one party is below 21 years old will be required to attend a Marriage Preparation Programme conducted by MSF-approved organisations before a marriage licence can be issued. This requirement is in addition to prior parental consent.

2016-10-10-T-084,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"With upfront conciliation by the Commissioner, there have been fewer maintenance applications filed at the Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents. This has also reduced acrimony and discontent between parties. Prior to 2011, the three-year average number of new applications at the Tribunal was 170. It fell to an average of 67 per year for 2012-2014. In 2015, the number was 36 and, from January till August 2016, 51 applications have been filed.",3,904,2016-10-10-T-084-S-00904
2016-10-10-T-084,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"At the heart of most cases is poor family relations. This could be caused by irresponsible parenting, deep-rooted conflict in the family or a lack of filial piety. The Ministry will continue to promote filial piety and responsible parenting and, in particular, encourage fathers to be actively involved in raising their children. Such efforts aim to strengthen family bonds and reduce the need for elderly parents to resort to legal recourse for maintenance. In addition, in instances where the children cannot maintain their parents, for example, they themselves are on social support or are incarcerated, the Tribunal and the Commissioner would refer such elderly to the SSOs. The aim is to ensure that the elderly's basic needs are met, but it does also reduce the number of cases officially filed.",4,905,2016-10-10-T-084-S-00905

As an additional safeguard, any request to increase their expenditure limit will only take place the next day, while requests to reduce their expenditure limit will be effective immediately.",6,912,2016-10-10-T-085-S-00912

2016-10-10-T-086,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"First, it will depend on the economic viability of the project. This takes into account the potential for redevelopment of the site, the cost of acquisition and related costs, and rehousing benefits and grants.",2,919,2016-10-10-T-086-S-00919

There were too few 2-room resale flat transactions for a meaningful comparison. However, direct comparisons between BTO and resale flat prices may not be appropriate or meaningful, as these flats would differ in terms of age, design features and proximity to infrastructure and amenities within the town.",2,925,2016-10-10-T-087-S-00925

Nevertheless, HDB is working with SPRING to review these recent reports in relation to the IEC standards.",2,955,2016-10-10-T-094-S-00955
2016-10-10-T-095,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin,asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (a) how do schools handle discussions with students after one of their peers has committed suicide; (b) how do schools work with experts and organisations to support students struggling with suicide; (c) whether every school has access to professionals trained in mental health awareness for students to understand youth suicide; and (d) whether the Ministry can prototype a mindfulness programme that sets aside time for students to have personal and peer-to-peer reflection on how they are dealing with life's troubles.,1,956,2016-10-10-T-095-S-00956
2016-10-10-T-095,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Every school has a trained school counsellor.

2016-10-10-T-095,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Students who are assessed by school counsellors to be at high risk of suicide or severe mental health disorders are referred to multidisciplinary Response, Early Intervention and Assessment in Community Mental Health (REACH) teams and other social service agencies to provide additional professional support for the students and their families.",2,958,2016-10-10-T-095-S-00958
2016-10-10-T-095,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"When a student suicide occurs, MOE immediately activates the CARE (Caring Actions in Support of an Emergency) teams to help staff and students cope with the psychological distress caused by the incident. These CARE teams comprise teachers and school counsellors in the school and MOE HQ who have been specially trained to handle sessions with affected students and to monitor and strengthen their coping skills. Students are reminded to be supportive of one another and to encourage their friends to seek help from a trusted adult when they feel overwhelmed. Parents are also provided with relevant information and resources to support their children.",3,959,2016-10-10-T-095-S-00959
2016-10-10-T-095,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"MOE has stepped up efforts to nurture the social and emotional competencies of students. From Primary school through to Secondary school, students are explicitly taught time management, relationship management, coping strategies and ways to maintain good mental well-being, such as deep breathing exercises and relaxation techniques. They also have opportunities to practise and reflect on their social and emotional learning during camps and co-curricular activities. Form teachers are provided with time to foster positive teacher-student relationships and all teachers are equipped to provide the first line of care and support. Twenty-four-hour helplines supported by agencies, such as SOS and Singapore Children's Society, are printed in all school handbooks.",4,960,2016-10-10-T-095-S-00960
2016-10-10-T-096,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) what research was conducted amongst teachers and how were their inputs taken into account in the decision-making process for the new PSLE scoring system.,1,961,2016-10-10-T-096-S-00961

2016-10-10-T-096,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Our engagements first started during the Our Singapore Conversation (OSC) exercise in 2013, which touched on changes to the PSLE, amongst other education issues. Since then, MOE has run several rounds of focus group discussions and dialogues with our educators and other stakeholders, to test various proposals on PSLE scoring and Secondary 1 (S1) posting with them. The PSLE scoring system review was, therefore, well-informed by the feedback from educators, as well as the professional advice from our education and assessment specialists, including the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board. These professional inputs help ensure that our policy recommendations for the revised system are robustly tested to be educationally sound and meaningful.",2,963,2016-10-10-T-096-S-00963
2016-10-10-T-096,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Apart from policy design, our educators have provided useful feedback on implementation issues, which MOE will be taking into consideration. This includes feedback regarding school-based assessments in our Primary schools, as well as ways in which students and parents can be supported in choosing Secondary schools that best meet each student's learning needs and interests.",3,964,2016-10-10-T-096-S-00964

2016-10-10-T-097,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,asked the Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) how many Singaporeans have utilised their SkillsFuture credits so far; (b) what is the total amount of SkillsFuture credit that has been utilised; (c) whether the Ministry intends to provide a top-up to the SkillsFuture credit in light of rising unemployment and the prospect of a skills deficit among some Singaporeans; and (d) on what basis will the Government decide on a SkillsFuture credit top-up for Singaporeans.,1,966,2016-10-10-T-097-S-00966

2016-10-10-T-097,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We are still in the early stage of rolling out the SkillsFuture Credit. Most Singaporeans have yet to utilise their credits. Nonetheless, the Government will make periodic top-ups to the SkillsFuture Credit and review when to do so, taking into account various factors, including the utilisation rates and the Government’s fiscal position. However, far more funds are dedicated to subsidising course fees at the supply end to make them affordable, so that there are avenues for workers to reskill or upgrade.",2,968,2016-10-10-T-097-S-00968
2016-10-10-T-097,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The issue of rising unemployment cannot be addressed through SkillsFuture Credit top-ups alone. For this, we have a wide range of initiatives to help job-seekers, including those run by MOM under the Adapt and Grow umbrella, and other skills training programmes supported by MOE and SkillsFuture Singapore.",3,969,2016-10-10-T-097-S-00969
