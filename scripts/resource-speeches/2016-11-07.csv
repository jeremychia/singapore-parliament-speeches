They were in impressive form at the Games and beat the teams from Greece and Portugal, the Gold and Silver medallists respectively from the 2012 Paralympic Games.

In the lead-up to the Paralympics, Syahidah trained six hours per day, six times a week. Her result in the Women's Individual Compound event was testament to her hard work and determination. Her round of 16 match pitted her against an athlete ranked 4th in the Ranking Round. Despite some problems with her stool which affected her stability, she held her nerve and went on to beat her opponent. She also put up a tremendous fight in the quarter-final match. Facing the eventual Bronze medallist in unpredictable wind conditions, she lost the match by just two points (135 to 137).

She has shown us that age is certainly not a barrier to sports and excellence. Despite taking a break from wheelchair racing in 2011 and returning only last year, Sila made tremendous progress to qualify for the Paralympics. Besides her pet event – the 100-metre T52, she was also extended an invitation to participate in the Women's 400-metre T52 Finals so that the race could proceed with the minimum of five competitors.

These were unforgettable moments as the Singapore flag was hoisted and the Majulah Singapura was played in the Olympic Aquatics Stadium in Rio. Pin Xiu now has three Paralympic Golds, making her the most decorated Team Singapore athlete at the Olympics and Paralympics.

After watching his idol Theresa Goh clinch the Bronze medal, he is now filled with hope that one day, he too can swim in the Paralympics.

In my many years watching and supporting sports, I have never seen such levels of interest and support for our para-athletes. It is amazing and not only will this will be the new norm, I believe that the support will grow from strength to strength. Last year's ASEAN Para Games was instrumental. Not only did you compete and flew our flag with pride, you opened our eyes to show us what a ""never-say-die"" attitude is all about, both in the arena and outside of it.

All it takes is consideration, in the buildings that we build, in the workplaces that we establish, in the community that we live in and in our everyday lives. Just simple actions, like giving way while on the MRT, providing assistance to board the bus, not parking in accessible lots meant for persons with disabilities. And most importantly, it is in our hearts and minds that we need to just embrace our fellow Singaporeans of any ability for who they are. It can be done.

They must have also persevered through muscle fatigue, injuries as they built up physical and mental stamina among the team. All these in preparation for the ultimate sporting experience that the Paralympic Games gives.",1,43,2016-11-07-T-002-S-00043
2016-11-07-T-002,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"It was already a victory that our Paralympians got to their start lines. Why? Because each Paralympian converted adversity into a will to excel and in so doing, made Singaporeans very proud. Your sturdy will in Archery, Athletics, Boccia, Equestrian, Sailing, Swimming is what we are celebrating today. What you did out there at the Paralympic Games also spoke of the value of participation and training hard to better one's own personal best. Yes, you had excelled to get to the start line. Yes, you were already joyful in achieving that. Yet, not quite satisfied, you pushed yourself further and further to improve. That extra push was in and of itself, remarkable, perhaps arising from a divine discontent. Yet, you the Paralympians displayed the personal integrity imbedded in the very meaning of sportsmanship  to strive to outdo one's own limits for a cause greater than oneself.",2,44,2016-11-07-T-002-S-00044
2016-11-07-T-002,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I learnt that meaning of sportsmanship from Chaoyang School students about 20 years ago. The school which provides education for children with special needs required assistance with its sports programmes. I was playing Hockey at the time and the school asked if I could help coach its Hockey team made up of young students between 8 and 12 years old. That team was preparing for its own tournament amongst special needs students. Some of the children found it difficult to run. For some, it was not easy to hold a stick, yet they played their hearts out, learnt from one another, improved their skills and celebrated whenever a teammate scored because it meant Chaoyang School was doing well.",3,45,2016-11-07-T-002-S-00045
2016-11-07-T-002,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"That group of young Singaporean students reflected the very spirit our Paralympians displayed on the world stage at Rio 2016. The value of participation, the value of outdoing one's own limits and the value of doing so for a cause greater than oneself. There is much we can learn from that, especially in education, especially in our schools where achievements should be celebrated when the child has done that child's best.",4,46,2016-11-07-T-002-S-00046
2016-11-07-T-002,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In fact, double-gold medallist Yip Pin Xiu shared how doing one's best and pushing beyond their limits is key and should be celebrated. Before Rio 2016, Pin Xiu shared, ""I decided that I should really excel as much as possible when my body still allows me, by pushing myself to the limits for Singapore"". How inspirational. You were already victorious at your start line.",5,47,2016-11-07-T-002-S-00047

We don't know if today's a good day for our bodies. It was really just a lot of mental strength to go at my fastest ever, and to compete against myself and my previous times"". Rejoicing in accomplishments already achieved, yet not quite satisfied, and so, wanting to push for a cause beyond oneself.

She said, ""I had a lot of moments where I thought of giving up. But it took a lot of mental skills and encouragement from people telling me that I could do it and to be positive.

Indeed, many of us can only read about it but never really know the terrain of the arduous road to Rio – the gruelling trainings and the sacrifices behind a sporting career on the world stage. Take the feat of Norsilawati who trained six times a week while working as a freelance web designer; who entered the Rio games at the age of 39, undaunted. Or archery athlete Nur Syahidah, born with cerebral palsy, who similarly trained six days a week and spent most of her non-working days on practice.

Like the proverbial bumblebee which aerodynamically is not supposed to be able to fly, but it flies anyway. You are not disabled athletes. You are our very own Singaporean athletes with disabilities – disabilities which instead of tripping you, have helped the rest of Singapore, open their eyes and see your true and powerful abilities. You face greater challenges than typical athletes and deserve recognition similar to or even beyond them. We salute all of you. From you, we learnt the lessons of mental toughness, true grit, optimism and self-control.",3,64,2016-11-07-T-002-S-00064

I know that many of you do not want to be defined by your disability and want to be seen first as athletes. But it is the unique identity that packaged that you come in, abilities and disabilities combined, that enrich, humble and inspire the rest of us Singaporeans. If you can do it, then perhaps the rest of us can rise above our daily ailments, grievances and complaints and take on life the way you do, against the odds; making lemonades of the lemons we are handed in life.",4,65,2016-11-07-T-002-S-00065

Last weekend, despite the rain, we had about 10,000 Singaporean residents from all abilities, all walks of life, join us in the city district to support inclusion and celebrate abilities in a movement known as The Purple Parade – a ground-up movement that gained the support of many, including our top country leaders.",9,70,2016-11-07-T-002-S-00070

Is there enough support, beyond awareness, to cause a change in our behaviours towards those who are different? Do we know persons with special needs only when they become celebrated Paralympians? Do we, in our social network, have any true friends with special needs? Do we, at our workplace, treat those with special needs with dignity and not pity?",10,71,2016-11-07-T-002-S-00071

Theresa told me she is a spice girl club fan. She and Pin Xiu just travelled to Europe, London, Burmingham, on their own, public transport, without any special help from the State. Many of them simply want to have access to opportunities in life, like the rest of us. So, let us go beyond compassion and adjust our lenses and behaviours to create schools, workplaces, public places of interest where persons with special needs are not just talked about, but seen, heard and their presence felt daily.",11,72,2016-11-07-T-002-S-00072

2016-11-07-T-005,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak,asked	 the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) what is the current cost of training a teacher; (b) what is the average number of years that a qualified teacher stays in the teaching service; (c) what are the three main reasons for teachers leaving the profession; and (d) what is being done to motivate teachers to stay and make teaching their lifetime career.,1,125,2016-11-07-T-005-S-00125
2016-11-07-T-005,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong,asked	 the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) whether the annual resignation rate of teachers over the last five years compared to a decade ago from 2% to 3% is a cause for concern; (b) what is the resignation rate of new teachers within five years of teaching in 2015 compared to a decade ago; and (c) whether the non-teaching workload is a significant factor in teachers' resignations nowadays.,1,126,2016-11-07-T-005-S-00126

Salaries are also paid to trainee teachers during their NIE training.",1,130,2016-11-07-T-005-S-00130

2016-11-07-T-005,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The overall resignation rate for the entire teacher population has remained low at around 2% to 3% a year over the past decade. Over the first five years of service, we see a slightly higher overall resignation rate of around 3% to 4% a year, on average. Typically, there would be an uptick in the resignation rate to about 5% for teachers when their bond ends.",3,132,2016-11-07-T-005-S-00132
2016-11-07-T-005,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The main reasons for resignations range from family considerations such as childcare, to a desire for a change of job. Workload is not commonly cited as a reason for teachers leaving the service.",4,133,2016-11-07-T-005-S-00133
2016-11-07-T-005,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"MOE recognises that teaching as a profession is demanding and requires significant commitment and deep skills. Many teachers have decided to make teaching their lifetime career and contribute to the development of our next generation.

2016-11-07-T-005,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"First, teacher remuneration is regularly reviewed to ensure it remains market-competitive.

2016-11-07-T-005,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The Ministry also provides strong support for the professional development of teachers. The Academy of Singapore Teachers, professional academies and language centres, put together many programmes and courses that help our teachers develop professionally. We also have various financial and leave provisions to support teachers who wish to deepen their professional mastery.",8,137,2016-11-07-T-005-S-00137
2016-11-07-T-005,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Third, the well-being of our teachers is important to us. MOE is mindful of the high expectations of teachers. To address this, we have put in place measures to support and guide schools in work allocation. Schools also regularly review work areas that can be stopped if they are no longer relevant or meaningful, simplified to reduce duplication and optimise efforts, as well as share good practices to improve work management.",9,138,2016-11-07-T-005-S-00138
2016-11-07-T-005,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister of State, with 5% attrition or resignation rate after the bond when it ends, whether in analysing all these cases, is there any way that we can improve our selection process to make sure that at least the candidates that we choose to be admitted to this career are the ones that will truly stay on. Are there any ways, after you have analysed data from those who are leaving at the end of five years, whether we can improve the selection process?",1,139,2016-11-07-T-005-S-00139
2016-11-07-T-005,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for that question. The potential teachers coming into NIE have a significant amount of orientation and counselling as to the demands of the job.",1,140,2016-11-07-T-005-S-00140
2016-11-07-T-005,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"But the reality is that the person that they are at the point of enrolment is going to be significantly different after perhaps another seven to eight years of their life. They may want to start a family; they may have different aspirations. The reality is that it has to be possible and acceptable for people to change careers as their aspirations change, as the needs of their family change, what they want to do with their life changes. So, to have zero resignations and zero people moving on to a different career would not be tenable or possible. We want to have as good a matching as possible, and the key point would be to ensure that people who choose a career in teaching have a good understanding of what it involves, and provide them the professional development necessary so that they can cope with the rigours of the job, which are demanding.",2,141,2016-11-07-T-005-S-00141

2016-11-07-T-005,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"I was in the teaching service for about five years. I contribute to that 2%-3%. Even though my ex-colleagues and I would frequently complain about workload, about students, but that really was not the impetus for any one of us to leave the teaching service. Most of my colleagues who complain a lot are still there teaching. Nonetheless, I would like to ask if the Ministry would look into the employment and deployment of more teaching assistants, teacher aides or allied educators to assist our full-time classroom teachers to help them better manage the demands of teaching, particularly in terms of carrying out administrative duties, providing student learning support, and even in classroom management.",1,146,2016-11-07-T-005-S-00146
2016-11-07-T-005,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Madam, I thank the Member for the comment.

2016-11-07-T-005,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Minister of State, there is a teacher satisfaction survey that is done every year. May I know what are the main points of dissatisfaction from teachers and whether this concerns the workload?",1,148,2016-11-07-T-005-S-00148
2016-11-07-T-005,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Some of the teachers are particularly concerned about the workload and it is not unreasonable to be concerned, given that they are demands on their time. There are concerns with respect to the amount of administrative overheads, and MOE is trying to put in place some IT solutions that should be able to address some of those needs.",1,149,2016-11-07-T-005-S-00149
2016-11-07-T-005,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The concerns of teachers also include the opportunity to have regular on-going professional development, and that is something that we do have a significant amount of work going into ensuring that every teacher has at least 100 hours of professional development every year.",2,150,2016-11-07-T-005-S-00150
2016-11-07-T-005,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Other concerns  one of the striking points in the survey was actually the perception of how they are valued and respected within society, and there was, interestingly, a big group of teachers within the survey who recorded that they felt that the value and the respect that they were accorded were reducing and yet this would not stop them from continuing with the teaching profession as they found this a very meaningful profession. Those were some of the deeper analyses that we found.",3,151,2016-11-07-T-005-S-00151
2016-11-07-T-006,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked	 the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) how has the Ministry incorporated educational material on the effects of problem gambling into the school syllabus; and (b) whether educators are equipped with the necessary training to counsel students who may encounter problem gambling in their homes.,1,152,2016-11-07-T-006-S-00152
2016-11-07-T-006,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Education (Schools)),"Madam, our Character and Citizenship Education and Cyber Wellness lessons teach our students the dangers of online gambling and other addictive behaviours. Students learn to exercise self-control and to turn away from distractions and temptations. They learn how to lead balanced lives and explore outdoor and healthy leisure activities. They also learn how to support their peers who may need extra help.",1,153,2016-11-07-T-006-S-00153
2016-11-07-T-006,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Education (Schools)),"Teachers who are aware of students facing problem gambling personally or at home will refer them to the school counsellors. Our school counsellors are trained by the National Addictions Management Service which is supported by the Ministry of Health. They are equipped with the skills and knowledge to work with parents to provide appropriate intervention and support for their children in managing addictive behaviour. For more complex cases, schools will refer the students to mental health professionals from the Institute of Mental Health. The school counsellors will also work with the students on coping strategies if any of their family members have problem gambling issues.",2,154,2016-11-07-T-006-S-00154

2016-11-07-T-006,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his answers. Just a few supplementary questions. I was just wondering, with the recent exemption of remote gambling, how will the current MOE syllabus be adapted to include the higher risks and warnings against remote gambling?",1,156,2016-11-07-T-006-S-00156
2016-11-07-T-006,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"My second question is, in 2012, the then-Minister for Education who said that MOE is developing a core Character and Citizenship Education syllabus where key elements of problem gambling awareness and prevention programmes would be given due emphasis in the new syllabus. So, I would just like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary  how will this core Character and Citizenship Education syllabus be effective in combating problem gambling in their homes, especially with online gambling?",2,157,2016-11-07-T-006-S-00157
2016-11-07-T-006,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Finally, I believe that teachers are already overloaded with their various responsibilities and work burdens. What are the Ministry's plans for additional help for teachers to ensure that due assistance is rendered to students with problem gambling in their homes?",3,158,2016-11-07-T-006-S-00158
2016-11-07-T-006,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for the question. As I mentioned in my answer earlier, the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) programme, as well as the Cyber Wellness Programme, has been able to reach out to our students not only about gambling or online gambling, but also in other aspects of addictive behaviour. The Member is right to say that we have enhanced our CCE over the years. We have been able to reach out to students not only via one module but different modules at different stages. I think it is important for us to ensure that it is not only limited to the modules that we offer in school, but also to the society via the external organisations.",1,159,2016-11-07-T-006-S-00159
2016-11-07-T-006,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"In essence, we are providing holistic engagement of our students in school.

2016-11-07-T-006,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"So, when the Member mentioned about teachers already having a heavy work load, I think it is not being undertaken by the teachers alone, but also by the school counsellors. Nevertheless, the whole society is responsible to ensure that our children have a balanced life. And it is important for us to have protection for all the different aspects of our life.",3,161,2016-11-07-T-006-S-00161
2016-11-07-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked	 the Minister for Foreign Affairs what are the guidelines applicable to (i) permissible public speeches and writings undertaken by senior officials including accredited ambassadors and ambassadors-at-large of Singapore (ii) distinguishing between speeches and writings done in a private capacity and in an official capacity by such individuals and (iii) addressing situations where speeches and writings by such individuals may negatively affect Singapore's national interest.,1,162,2016-11-07-T-007-S-00162
2016-11-07-T-007,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Diplomacy is a very labour-intensive exercise. Even in this era of emails and video-conferencing, there is still a need for human beings to meet, to assess the warmth of the handshake and sincerity in their eyes. However, in the case of Singapore, because we are so small and the limits of our talent pool, we have found the need to induct talent from both within and outside the Civil Service.",1,163,2016-11-07-T-007-S-00163
2016-11-07-T-007,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Consequently, we supplement our pool by appointing outstanding persons with relevant skills from society at large, including successful businessmen, senior executives and retired senior civil servants, and they may serve as our Non-Resident Ambassadors, Ambassadors-At-Large or Special Envoys. In fact, we also have distinguished foreign businessmen, non-citizens of Singapore, who have volunteered to be our Honorary Consuls General in a number of countries and these gentlemen or ladies will provide assistance to Singaporeans who are travelling overseas in countries where we do not have a Mission. All these individuals, that means, the Non-Resident Ambassadors, Ambassadors-At-Large, the Special Envoys or the Honorary Consuls General are all expected to discharge their duties of safeguarding and advancing Singapore's national interests, explaining and defending Singapore's policies, as well as upholding the integrity and reputation of Singapore at all times.",2,164,2016-11-07-T-007-S-00164
2016-11-07-T-007,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"However, I want to make this very important differentiation. Non-Resident Ambassadors, Ambassadors-At-Large and Special Envoys are not civil servants. They are engaged for a specific role only. Beyond their specific MFA commitments and role, we do not restrict their private engagements, and this includes giving speeches or contributing articles in their personal capacities.",3,165,2016-11-07-T-007-S-00165

2016-11-07-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Minister for his reply. I just have a few supplementary questions. I would like to clarify that in the case of Non-Resident Ambassadors who are technically not civil servants, in the event that they make statements about the internal politics of other countries that may or may not be prejudicial to Singapore's national interests, would that be viewed as permissible by the Ministry or would that be discouraged and action taken in such cases?",1,167,2016-11-07-T-007-S-00167
2016-11-07-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Specifically ‒ I think the Minister is well aware ‒ there was an instance last year when one particular Ambassador-At-Large did actually make a statement about the internal politics of another country. My aim is not to highlight the case of that individual, but more of a general point. Would that sort of intervention ‒ even if it is made in a different capacity, not in the person's ambassadorial capacity ‒ would that be considered permissible and, if so, then how would the Ministry manage the reaction or the impact to Singapore's diplomacy which might result, because I think in that particular case, politicians in another country did actually respond in a hostile fashion to that particular Ambassador's intervention?",2,168,2016-11-07-T-007-S-00168
2016-11-07-T-007,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,Would the Member like to be more specific as to which particular case and which Ambassador-at-Large he is referring to?,1,169,2016-11-07-T-007-S-00169

2016-11-07-T-007,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Let us go back to the basics. He is not a civil servant. He is a retired civil servant. He is not our ambassador to Malaysia or to any other specific country.

There could be that impact and it would appear that there was some degree of impact in the particular case I cited. What is the Ministry's strategy for dealing with such a case, should it happen?

In total, 13,440 workers were retrenched last year. We expect the number this year to be higher due to on-going business restructuring and slowing economic growth. There is no clear evidence that irresponsible retrenchment is on the rise.",1,178,2016-11-07-T-008-S-00178

2016-11-07-T-008,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Even so, based on the last survey conducted in 2013, nine out of 10 companies with at least 25 employees did pay retrenchment benefits. The prevailing norm at that time was two weeks to one month of salary for each year of service. We are now conducting another survey and findings will be ready by end of the year. Workers who feel that they have been treated unfairly during any retrenchment exercise can report to MOM for investigation.",3,180,2016-11-07-T-008-S-00180

Out of which 15 appeals were from employees who were dismissed but felt they were retrenched and thereby deprived of retrenchment benefits. In the first three quarters of this year, out of 63 retrenchment-related cases, the number of appeals is 14. So, on the whole, these cases account for a small proportion of the total number of local employees retrenched in 2015 and 2016 so far.",4,181,2016-11-07-T-008-S-00181

To enable us to reach more retrenched workers and offer more timely assistance to them, MOM is now in consultation with unions and employers to strengthen our framework for retrenchment reporting. We are aware of the different positions of the unions and employers on this, but MOM believes that we can find a way forward for the interest of the retrenched workers.",7,184,2016-11-07-T-008-S-00184
2016-11-07-T-008,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"I thank the Minister for the answer. I would just like to seek a few clarifications. First, based on the first three quarters, we already see an almost 33% increase in retrenchment numbers. Based on this rate, I think we can expect for the last quarter, probably over 2,000 more retrenchments. So, my first supplementary question is  is the rate of retrenchment on the increase? And are we concerned about these numbers? What steps should we take going forward, and in anticipation of the worsening economic climate, what steps can we take to preserve more jobs for Singaporeans?",1,185,2016-11-07-T-008-S-00185
2016-11-07-T-008,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Mdm Speaker, the Member asked whether the rate of retrenchment is on the increase. For the first three quarters of this year compared to the same period last year, certainly the number is higher and will be higher for the whole of this year. MOM does not make any attempt to forecast. There is no formula for forecasting retrenchment. But what we do is to track the number. As the Member mentioned, based on the first three quarters of this year, it is higher than last year. For the whole of this year, we believe it will be higher than the whole of last year. Now, what can we do? At the last Sitting, the Minister for Trade and Industry has already stated his position that, if need be, when the time comes, we will provide support assistance either at the sectoral level or broad-based level. But we are monitoring the situation.",1,186,2016-11-07-T-008-S-00186
2016-11-07-T-008,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"For MOM and its tripartite partners, we accept that retrenchment will continue to happen because in Singapore, we have always believed in continuous restructuring. In good times or in bad times, retrenchment has always been there. Therefore, on-going restructuring is not necessarily bad, in fact it is good for our economy and good for the workers as well, so that they can continue to hopefully take on better jobs.",2,187,2016-11-07-T-008-S-00187
2016-11-07-T-008,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Having said so, we recognise that retrenchment will be a very difficult experience for our retrenched workers. This is the reason why the tripartite partners have put in place a special task force, since early this year. As and when there is a retrenchment exercise, our task force will engage the employer, engage the workers and together with the union, we will ensure that the retrenchment is carried out in a fair manner. For example, if it is a unionised company, we will ensure that the union will negotiate for the retrenchment benefits. For companies that are not unionised, we will try to do mediation as well.",3,188,2016-11-07-T-008-S-00188
2016-11-07-T-008,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"But more importantly, is that having gone through the retrenchment exercise, we will collate information on the profile of the workers affected by retrenchment, in terms of their skill profile, education profile as well as their job preference. In some cases, with the support of the employers and the union, we are even able to conduct career fair on-site with the company for the retrenched workers. In cases where they do not have a critical mass, we organise off-site job fairs for them.",4,189,2016-11-07-T-008-S-00189
2016-11-07-T-008,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"In the first nine months of this year, we have assisted more than 3,000 retrenched workers under this special arrangement. So, the moment they are retrenched, we move in, we work with the companies to help the workers. We assisted about 3,300 of them. Of the 3,300, we were able to help close to 2,000 secure new jobs and new employment. So I would say that on the whole, let us support the retrenched workers the best that we can.",5,190,2016-11-07-T-008-S-00190
2016-11-07-T-008,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Our main objective is to ensure that the retrenched workers will be able to go back to work as quickly as possible. Because I think the longer they stay out of a job, the harder it would be for them to come back to work. And that is the reason why MOM is now exploring with the unions and the employers to strengthen the retrenchment reporting framework. Because we believe that with more timely reporting, we will be able to reach out to these retrenched workers earlier so that we can help them even more.",6,191,2016-11-07-T-008-S-00191

We are going to gather more employment information regarding workers – either self-employed or as part of the gig economy – because we believe that there will be implications for the workers, Within the gig economy, the relationship between employer and employees have changed. And I think what we are concerned about would be if we see more workers becoming portfolio workers without the employer-employee relationship, then how would their welfare, their well-being be taken care of, including skill-upgrading, employability, retirement planning and so on.

I have asked whether we can consider allowing work permit holders to do part-time work but I understand this might already be happening on the ground, but under the radar. The reality is workers want to work; companies need the workers. These are jobs that they cannot find Singaporeans to work in, especially at that particular shift. So, rather than ban, can we consider regulating, so that we can protect the workers?",1,201,2016-11-07-T-009-S-00201

2016-11-07-T-012,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But aside from upgrading schemes, HDB has implemented a co-payment scheme for Facade Finishes Repair with Town Councils. Under this co-payment scheme, HDB will pay 50% of the repair cost incurred by Town Councils to repair external facade finishes of HDB buildings. The Town Councils, in fact, all Town Councils, can make use of this scheme for their facade works.",9,229,2016-11-07-T-012-S-00229
2016-11-07-T-012,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. My question really has to do with the structural integrity of high-rise protrusions. In the cyclical review, would there be a prioritisation for high-rise protrusions, for example, like balcony ledges and their structural integrity? Thank you.",1,230,2016-11-07-T-012-S-00230
2016-11-07-T-012,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, the Member has highlighted what I think is a very relevant point. There are two different issues. One is structural integrity of the building, meaning the key components within the building to ensure the building is safe. And the integrity of facades – external facades which particularly could have the risk of being dislodged and these may fall. It may not impact on the integrity and safety of the building but it may have a risk on people who are walking at the street level. So, this is a separate matter which, as I mentioned earlier, we are looking at the inspection regime to see if more focus and more emphasis needs to be placed on facade inspection and faÃ§ade checks, particularly with building facades and areas where safety may be at risk.",1,231,2016-11-07-T-012-S-00231
2016-11-07-T-012,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Thank you, Madam, and I thank the Minister for the reply. I have clarifications to make. May I clarify what would be the frequency for the additional checks that the Minister has articulated earlier that will be done by HDB? Secondly, for older blocks, there will be greater priority as well as greater frequency in terms of the checks given that since it is older, I would naturally assume that it will also suffer the effects of ageing as well.",1,232,2016-11-07-T-012-S-00232
2016-11-07-T-012,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, as I mentioned earlier, the PSI, which is a regulatory requirement is required once every 10 years. On top of that, HDB will do its own checks for older blocks – and this is voluntary because HDB is a good developer. If you buy a condominium, the developer, I assure you, is not going to do this for you. The MCST has to bear the responsibility. But HDB, being a good developer, will do its own checks. So for older blocks, HDB will do five-year checks on top of what the Town Council is supposed to do. And HDB will also selectively do annual inspections for the older blocks for building facades. So these are the additional checks that HDB does currently.",1,233,2016-11-07-T-012-S-00233
2016-11-07-T-012,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On a separate matter, as I have mentioned earlier, we are reviewing the regulatory regime.

2016-11-07-T-012,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, as I mentioned earlier, I would not want to comment on the specifics of the cases that were highlighted because these are still under investigation. I would just say that in the investigation that is on-going by the Professional Engineer (the PE), they are looking not only at the impacted building but they have also given a priority to check on similar buildings of similar design done by the same contractor to make sure that these are safe. So they have given that priority even as they look at the specific cause of the incident building.",1,236,2016-11-07-T-012-S-00236
2016-11-07-T-012,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"Madam, the Minister said the HDB is a good developer. I would like to ask whether HDB is also a good designer. In designing building facades, what are the guidelines that HDB has? And whether or not they take into consideration the safety of the design of certain building facades and whether or not it is just for design sake and whether or not the materials used are durable enough, and whether the structural integrity of the faÃ§ade is taken into consideration?",1,237,2016-11-07-T-012-S-00237
2016-11-07-T-012,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"For instance, brickwall facades, when you use brickwalls to clad a building, whether enough details and specifications have gone in to make sure that they are properly adhered to and do not crack and fall off over time? For sunshades as well. So my question is  what are the guidelines, whether there are guides for materials used that the material will be lasting? And the construction details to make sure that facade features will not fall off the building.",2,238,2016-11-07-T-012-S-00238
2016-11-07-T-012,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, part of the requirements of being a good developer is to be a good designer, too. So, HDB, of course, will always try its best. I would not say that we are perfect, and some of these buildings were done many, many years ago but, continuously, year after year, HDB will always look at improving its design, its guidelines, the way it builds and make sure that it uses quality materials, it uses building methods that are reliable and safe. And if you look at the way this has been done progressively over the years, I can say for sure that the methods have improved and the materials are more reliable and our buildings are safer than before.",1,239,2016-11-07-T-012-S-00239
2016-11-07-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I thank the Minister for his replies to earlier questions. The first question  the Minister referred to older blocks. Can the Minister clarify what is the age cut-off before a block is defined as an ""older block""?",1,240,2016-11-07-T-012-S-00240
2016-11-07-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second question, with regard to the 50-50 cost sharing scheme with regard to faÃ§ade repair, in view of the fact that there will be some town councils which host a larger number of older blocks, as a result of which the prospect of faÃ§ade repair may be more frequent than blocks that are not as old, would MND consider increasing the quantum of its contribution to the cost-sharing scheme with regard to faÃ§ade repair?",2,241,2016-11-07-T-012-S-00241
2016-11-07-T-012,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, on the age cut-off, I would say that I do not want to stipulate a specific cut-off because that is not the basis in which we look at older blocks. HDB will look at risks and will look at materials in that particular building, how they were used, and the materials have changed over the years. In the past, we did not use pre-cast concrete, now we do and, so, if you look at older blocks, generally, say, those built in the 1980s, 70s, certainly, the materials used then, not just by HDB, by any developer then, are very different from the materials used today. And, so, rather than have a specific year and say everything before that qualifies, everything after that does not qualify, we will look at building materials, we will look at the conditions and, naturally, we would give greater focus on the older blocks. As I think all town councils should, within their own risk-based assessment and inspection, HDB does this and, as I mentioned earlier, town councils should also bear the responsibility for external faÃ§ade checks and they should take that same risk-based approach.",1,242,2016-11-07-T-012-S-00242
2016-11-07-T-012,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On payments, I understand that town councils would certainly like to have higher co-payments from HDB, particularly if you have a greater proportion of older blocks, but we would, first of all, encourage the town councils to do what they need to do first  look at how much they have set aside within their sinking funds, provisions that they need to do, and the responsibility that the town council needs to bear. The scheme has been in place for some time. We are always prepared to review and update our schemes and our upgrading programmes. We do that periodically and we do that from time to time. But with this, with lifts, with many other maintenance issues, I think, first and foremost, we would ask all town councils to abide by their requirements and their responsibilities and make sure that adequate provisions are put in place to maintain their estates well.",2,243,2016-11-07-T-012-S-00243
2016-11-07-T-013,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,asked	  the Minister for Transport (a) whether the termination of the Park and Ride Scheme runs contrary to encouraging Singaporeans to take public transport; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider encouraging and incentivising motorists to park their cars at the Sports Hub and Kallang surface carparks during days with no major events and take train rides to the CBD.,1,244,2016-11-07-T-013-S-00244
2016-11-07-T-013,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,asked	 the Minister for Transport if he can explain the rationale for stopping the Park and Ride Scheme and what are the alternatives available to motorists using this scheme.,1,245,2016-11-07-T-013-S-00245
2016-11-07-T-013,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Madam, can I take Question Nos 14 and 15 together, please?",1,246,2016-11-07-T-013-S-00246
2016-11-07-T-013,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,247,2016-11-07-T-013-S-00247
2016-11-07-T-013,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The objective of the Park and Ride Scheme is to reduce traffic congestion in the Central Business District (CBD) by encouraging motorists to switch to public transport just before entering the CBD. It was introduced long ago in 1975, before our MRT system was built, and when the public transport network was also much less extensive. Today, many commuters are able to take the MRT and buses directly to the city from their homes which, therefore, makes the Park and Ride Scheme much less useful.",1,248,2016-11-07-T-013-S-00248
2016-11-07-T-013,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Indeed, over the past few years, the take-up rate for the scheme has been consistently low, very low. There are fewer than 2,000 regular users, most of whom do not take public transport after parking their cars. This suggests that a good number of motorists are using the Park and Ride scheme as cheap, subsidised destination parking. I think this defeats the purpose of the scheme.",2,249,2016-11-07-T-013-S-00249
2016-11-07-T-013,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Motorists who wish to drive for a part of their journey before switching to public transport can still park their cars at any car park near public transport. It will still be cheaper than parking in the CBD, even without the subsidy from the Park and Ride scheme. Motorists who park at the Sports Hub or at Kallang, for example, and take public transport, could see savings of up to a few hundred dollars monthly, as they do not have to pay the much more expensive season parking in the CBD nor ERP charges. There is no need for taxpayers to provide further subsidies.",3,250,2016-11-07-T-013-S-00250
2016-11-07-T-013,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"I thank the Minister for the comprehensive reply. I noted that half of the regular users of the Park and Ride Scheme do not take public transport after parking their cars. But there still remains about a thousand users who will still park their cars and take public transport. Is it easier to maybe enforce the action against abusers rather than you let another thousand people lose their benefits? On top of that, we also noted that, as you said, Kallang carpark and the Sports Hub have many parking lots and are very much under-utilised. Could we not have a more aggressive scheme to encourage people to park their cars there and take the public transport to the CBD area,or is the PPP arrangement with the Sports Hub hindering such an arrangement to encourage more people to park their cars at the Kallang carpark?",1,251,2016-11-07-T-013-S-00251
2016-11-07-T-013,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"I think the number of actual users of the scheme, numbers by the hundreds, should be seen against the daily commuter traffic of more than two million, and whether Kallang or whichever carparks, motorists can still park and ride. Many motorists that I know of, including myself, do park and ride, except that we park and we pay for the carpark, without having to ask for more subsidies because there are already significant savings, as I said, of a few hundred dollars per month by parking at the fringe rather than going into the CBD and trying to look for a carpark.",1,252,2016-11-07-T-013-S-00252
2016-11-07-T-014,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan,asked	 the Minister for Transport (a) how often are taxi fare evasions reported involving cases where the fare evader is not identified; and (b) whether the existing process by which taxi companies refer taxi fare evasion cases to PTC/LTA for investigations handles such cases.,1,253,2016-11-07-T-014-S-00253
2016-11-07-T-014,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan,asked	 the Minister for Transport whether the rate of recovery of unpaid fares in taxi fare evasion cases referred to PTC/LTA for investigations is satisfactory.,1,254,2016-11-07-T-014-S-00254

Sixty-five percent of fare evasion cases involved unidentified fare evaders, which are very challenging to resolve. So, that is about two-thirds, that means about 100 such cases per month. Because they are not identified, we do not know the identity of these evaders.",1,257,2016-11-07-T-014-S-00257
2016-11-07-T-014,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"LTA was able to recover fares for about half of all cases referred to it for investigation.

2016-11-07-T-014,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"To further deter fare evasion, we introduced higher penalties for fare evaders in May this year. If found guilty, fare evaders are liable to a fine of up to $1,000 for first-timers, while subsequent offenders may be fined up to $2,000, or jailed up to six months, or both. It is also mandatory for offenders to make restitution payment to taxi drivers.",3,259,2016-11-07-T-014-S-00259
2016-11-07-T-014,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"Thank you, Madam. I thank the Minister for sharing those statistics. I think the concern that I have is that for taxi drivers, unlike other forms of public transport, they do not have as large an infrastructure to support them in a situation like this. I think the Minister mentioned a very important point about the increase in penalties for fare evaders. But given that a large number of fare evasion cases involved unidentified fare evaders, is it possible for PTC and LTA to consider maybe helping the taxi drivers who actually suffer from such fare evasion cases directly, so that it reduces the risk that they face in the course of providing a very important public service?",1,260,2016-11-07-T-014-S-00260
2016-11-07-T-014,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Madam, we are most sympathetic to the taxi drivers who experience such incidents. But if the taxi driver could not tell us the identity of the person, other than saying that the person is of a particular race, or gender, it is very hard for us to track down the person. So, I think common sense requires the taxi drivers, when they encounter such an incident, to get as much information as they can from the fare evader  basic information like name, address and so on. There are instances we know of where they could not get the information, they will try to report to the Police, fetched the passenger all the way to the police station and let the Police step in. The primary duty or responsibility of helping the taxi drivers resides with the taxi operator and the operator should be the first to help out, which must also include sharing with their taxi drivers tips on how to reduce such incidents and, as I said, some of which are common sense, which is that you must get the basic information.",1,261,2016-11-07-T-014-S-00261
2016-11-07-T-014,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"I think taxi operators can also take a look at how some of the new players in this field, for example, Uber and Grab, how do they handle such cases. And there are obviously good best practices which they can pick up from these new players. But my message to commuters who cheat on taxi drivers is this  taxi driving is tough work and they need the money, the revenue, to feed their family. Please do not cheat on them.",2,262,2016-11-07-T-014-S-00262

2016-11-07-T-014,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Madam, as I said, the primary duty or responsibility lies with the taxi operator. Certainly, ideas like these are things that they should consider and, I think, some already do. But sometimes if you just get the image but without much other information and the fellow just runs away, it is not easy to track down. Where the identity is known, our success rate in tracking down and getting the money back for the taxi driver is pretty good. Where it requires us to go all the way to the court, success rate is about 85%. But we do need to know the identity.",1,264,2016-11-07-T-014-S-00264

As we look at these nine cases, as I mentioned earlier, due to ongoing investigations, we are really not at liberty to go into the details of these nine cases. But suffice to say, as I have mentioned earlier, that the nine training organisations have been suspended with immediate effect once we know that there is a possible misuse of SkillsFuture Credit. At the same time, their claim submissions have been withheld. So, we will let the investigation process proceed and, other than that, we are also looking at how such learnings from these cases would help us to strengthen our enforcement measures and also strengthen our criteria as far as SkillsFuture Credit is concerned.",1,270,2016-11-07-T-015-S-00270

We would not hesitate to take tough actions against such individuals or organisations, especially if they are also trying to defraud elderly citizens who may not really understand the criteria and the use of the credit. In fact, misusing the SkillsFuture Credit may result in criminal penalties. For instance, under section 58 of the SkillsFuture Singapore Act, any person who provides false or misleading information to SSG when claiming the SkillsFuture Credit is liable to a fine of up to S$10,000 or imprisonment of up to 12 months or both.",2,271,2016-11-07-T-015-S-00271

SSG, if they establish that, indeed, there is misuse, we will recover the disbursed monies from the training organisation that has abused the SkillsFuture Credit and we will also withdraw SSG funding support, as well as delisting them from the SkillsFuture Credit directory. Any Singaporean, if it is established that because of the misuse of the SkillsFuture Credit they are cheated of the credit, we will look at reinstating their SkillsFuture Credit. So, in addition to all these rigorous processes, to check and deter against any fraud, we will also alert and educate the general public to be wary of such activities.

2016-11-07-T-017,Chee Hong Tat,The Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Health),"Mdm Speaker, the Ministry of Health had earlier received feedback from medical professionals on their concerns with the charging practices adopted by some Third Party Administrator (TPA) companies. In doing the review, MOH has consulted professional bodies, such as the Singapore Medical Council, the Singapore Medical Association, the Academy of Medicine Singapore and the College of Family Physicians Singapore, as well as industry associations like the Life Insurance Association. There is agreement amongst stakeholders that the charging practices must not compromise patient safety and well-being, and should not lead to escalation of healthcare costs.",1,280,2016-11-07-T-017-S-00280
2016-11-07-T-017,Chee Hong Tat,The Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Health),"Managed care companies (MCCs) and TPAs provide a wide range of intermediary services, including management of employer medical benefits and claims administration.

2016-11-07-T-017,Chee Hong Tat,The Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Health),"To provide clarity on how doctors should engage MCCs and TPAs, the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) has recently revised its Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines (ECEG) to state that doctors must not allow financial arrangements to lead to any compromise in the care of patients. Any charges which doctors pay to MCCs or TPAs should be commensurate with the actual administrative work done by these intermediaries in processing the cases, and not based primarily on the fees charged to patients. The revised guidelines will take effect from 1 January 2017.",3,282,2016-11-07-T-017-S-00282
2016-11-07-T-017,Chee Hong Tat,The Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Health),"To enhance transparency of TPA fee arrangements, the revised ECEG indicates that doctors should disclose any such arrangement and referral fees to their patients, if these fees are passed on to the patients. MOH is assessing if these disclosure requirements should be further reinforced through our regulations. We are also working with the Life Insurance Association (LIA) and the Integrated Shield Plan (IP) insurers to ensure that their appointed TPAs do not have any conflict of interest. In addition, the insurers should disclose to their policyholders any financial arrangements they have with the doctors.",4,283,2016-11-07-T-017-S-00283

2016-11-07-T-017,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"I thank the Minister of State for his reply. There are two points of clarification. One, is there a need for MOH to regulate the practice of percentage-based fee arrangements? Two, how do we mitigate against TPAs from resulting in undue medical fee increases for patients; and, three, has there been any breach of the disclosure requirements by MOH?",1,285,2016-11-07-T-017-S-00285

2016-11-07-T-017,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,"The Minister of State clarified earlier that there will be timing requirements for the insurers to disclose to improve transparency of fee arrangements.

2016-11-07-T-017,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for his supplementary questions and the clarification as well. First, as I explained in my answer, we need to regulate such fee arrangements to protect the well-being of patients and to prevent conflict of interest. We do not want the TPAs to end up driving up healthcare costs and affecting patient care. These are the primary considerations for MOH and SMC when the SMC issues its guidelines. On the breach of disclosure requirements, I do not think that is currently a breach because the requirements have not taken effect. After the requirements have taken effect, we would certainly monitor the compliance and make sure that TPAs who have such arrangements, and doctors who are in such arrangements with TPAs, the information would be disclosed appropriately to patients.",1,288,2016-11-07-T-017-S-00288

2016-11-07-T-018,Chee Hong Tat,The Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Health),"Mdm Speaker, Singaporeans enjoy subsidies of up to 70% for outpatient medical services and diagnostics at Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOCs) and up to 75% at polyclinics.

Based on 2015 data, the median post-subsidy bill size for MRI was $260 while the 90th percentile bill size was $560. So, the median was $260; the 90th percentile bill size was $560. For CT scans, the median and 90th percentile post-subsidy bill sizes were $140 and $440 respectively.",2,291,2016-11-07-T-018-S-00291

In 2015, more than eight in 10 patients who used Medisave for outpatient scans did not fully utilise their withdrawal limits. Elderly Singaporeans who are 65 years old and above also have the flexibility to use up to $200 of Medisave every year to pay for their outpatient treatments at public healthcare institutions and participating CHAS GPs. This $200 is on top of the Medisave limits for non-cancer scans and cancer scans.",3,292,2016-11-07-T-018-S-00292

2016-11-07-T-019,Chee Hong Tat,The Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Health),"MOH will regularly review the scope of MediShield Life's coverage, but the focus should remain on protecting Singaporeans against large hospital bills. It is important to bear in mind that expansions in MediShield Life coverage will lead to higher premiums for all policyholders.

2016-11-07-T-026,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Order. Before we proceed to the Second Reading of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill, I wish to inform Members that I have on 2 November 2016, received a message from the President addressed to Parliament. Pursuant to Standing Order 16(1), I will now read the message to hon Members.",1,343,2016-11-07-T-026-S-00343
2016-11-07-T-026,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"""Hon Members, the Constitutional Commission tasked to review specific aspects of the Elected Presidency recently concluded its study. It was a landmark review drawing on 25 years of operating an important and unique institution in Singapore. The objectives of the review are clear – to ensure that the institution of the Elected Presidency stays relevant with time and our local context, and that the Singapore Constitution as a living document is aptly refreshed. The Commission, comprising nine eminent and well-respected leaders in both the private and public sectors, took a consultative and inclusive approach in gathering ideas for its review. Many of these views of Singaporeans were thoughtful and constructive, and the Commission took them on board when it submitted its final report to the Government.",2,344,2016-11-07-T-026-S-00344
2016-11-07-T-026,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"During this sitting, Parliament will be debating the Constitutional Amendments to give effect to those changes accepted by the Government. To date, I have refrained from commenting publicly about the Commission's report or the Government's White Paper. There is no legal necessity for me to present my views on the proposals, nor is it in the Constitutional powers of the President to endorse or oppose any specific recommendations pertaining to the Elected Presidency. These are decisions for the Government to make. But the Government has made it a practice to seek and consider the President's views when amending the Constitutional provisions which affect the President's discretionary powers, and to make known these views to Parliament when moving the Constitutional amendments.",3,345,2016-11-07-T-026-S-00345
2016-11-07-T-026,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"In this case, my five years as President have given me a personal perspective on the role of the Elected Presidency and how the Elected President serves the nation and all Singaporeans. I have therefore agreed with the Prime Minister that I should send this message to Parliament to share my views on the proposals that are being debated.",4,346,2016-11-07-T-026-S-00346
2016-11-07-T-026,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Prior to 1991, Presidents were appointed by Parliament to perform ceremonial functions, usually associated with the Head of State of a Westminster system of government. The President represents the State in engaging other statesmen overseas. Metaphorically, the President is the flag-bearer of Singapore. Based on how he carries himself or engages his counterparts, other countries will form a view on Singapore's position in the global community. Often, this requires the President to be well read, strategic in views and sensitive to geopolitical developments.",5,347,2016-11-07-T-026-S-00347
2016-11-07-T-026,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"The symbolic role of the President also extends domestically, with the President engaging the different communities and segments of Singaporeans. In my five years in office, it has been my personal mission to rally Singaporeans towards building a caring, cohesive and inclusive society. In Singapore, an important dimension of this role is working with the different ethnic groups that make up our multi-racial composition.",6,348,2016-11-07-T-026-S-00348
2016-11-07-T-026,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"It was not a coincidence that Singapore's first four appointed Presidents – Mr Yusof Ishak, Dr Benjamin Sheares, Mr Devan Nair and Dr Wee Kim Wee – represented, in turn, the Malay, Eurasian, Indian, and Chinese communities respectively. As the President remains a symbol of the nation's unity, it is important that the Office of the Presidency upholds multi-racialism, a core value of Singapore that underpins the social cohesion and harmony we have enjoyed thus far.",7,349,2016-11-07-T-026-S-00349
2016-11-07-T-026,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Of course, our long-term aspiration should be for minorities to be elected into the Office without the need for any intervention. But we also need to recognise the current realities. After the Elected Presidency was instituted, all, but one of the Elected Presidents have been Chinese, including myself. The role of the President as a titular Head of State representing our multi-racial society is important and we should have a system that not only allows but facilitates persons of all ethnic groups to be President from time to time.",8,350,2016-11-07-T-026-S-00350
2016-11-07-T-026,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendation for a mechanism of reserving a Presidential election for a specific ethnic group if a member of that group has not held the office of the Elected Presidency after five terms. I agree that this is a balanced approach. The mechanism ensures that Singapore is assured of a minority Elected President from time to time, but does not kick in if one is elected in an open election.",9,351,2016-11-07-T-026-S-00351
2016-11-07-T-026,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Another key role of the Elected President today is his custodial functions over two key assets built up by generations of Singaporeans – our national reserves and the integrity of our public servants. Constitutional amendments in 1991 enable the President to play a custodial role in safeguarding Singapore's reserves and the appointment of key public officers. Through elections, the President is vested with the democratic legitimacy to disagree, if need be, with the Government on these matters.",10,352,2016-11-07-T-026-S-00352
2016-11-07-T-026,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Because of this important custodial role, a decision was also made by the Government in 1991 to include competency requirements for Presidential candidates. The aim was to ensure that only persons with the necessary attributes be considered for the Office of Elected President. Having made that decision, the requirements should be updated and fine-tuned over time.",11,353,2016-11-07-T-026-S-00353
2016-11-07-T-026,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"In recommending the enhancement of eligibility criteria for Presidential candidates, the Commission has cited many pieces of data, including the growth of Singapore's GDP and size of official foreign reserves since 1991. Indeed, from my own experience, the scope and complexity of the Presidential oversight on Singapore's key assets have increased significantly, even in the span of five years of my term. My finance background was useful in helping me understand the technicalities of the Government's proposals, but the decisions often also require good policy acumen and a sound judgement on what is right for Singapore. I am therefore of the view that the Government's acceptance of the Commission's recommendations is in the right direction.",12,354,2016-11-07-T-026-S-00354
2016-11-07-T-026,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"I have spoken at length about the custodial role of the Elected Presidency. While the custodial role is important, we need to distinguish between the President acting as a custodian and the President acting in opposition to the Government. The two are not the same. The Elected Presidency cannot be a second centre of power. He must act in accordance with the roles prescribed in the Constitution, and not hold back the Elected Government of the day from performing its executive role.",13,355,2016-11-07-T-026-S-00355
2016-11-07-T-026,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"The Council of Presidential Advisers was therefore set up to provide expert advice to the President and to moderate the President's custodial powers. While it is clear that the President has the right to accept or reject the Council's recommendations, a mechanism to allow for parliamentary override ensures that the President does not make arbitrary decisions. In practice, up till today, the Presidents and the Council have worked well together. There has not been any need to subject any decision to the parliamentary override mechanism, because decisions have been well considered for the long-term good of Singapore. And in line with its stature and the principle of collective responsibility, the Council of Presidential Advisers as a non-elected body, has remained above any political fray. We should maintain that.",14,356,2016-11-07-T-026-S-00356
2016-11-07-T-026,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Nevertheless, while the President should not be unbridled in the exercise of his Constitutional duties, it is not practical to remove all possible scenarios of gridlock and yet expect the Elected President to remain an effective custodian. We cannot hamstring the Elected Presidency just to guard against a worst case scenario of a populist or power-hungry President. We must rely upon the wisdom of our electorate to elect a President who is able to work with the Government of the day for the proper and effective governance of Singapore.",15,357,2016-11-07-T-026-S-00357
2016-11-07-T-026,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"As President, my working relationship with the Government has been harmonious. The Government keeps me informed of all its major decisions. On a regular basis, the Prime Minister and I meet over lunch and on other occasions, for him to brief me on his preoccupations and intentions, and to exchange views on the strategic direction in which Singapore is heading. Our relationship is built on mutual trust and respect. This, to me, is key to the effective functioning of our system.",16,358,2016-11-07-T-026-S-00358
2016-11-07-T-026,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Hon Members, the Rio Olympics and Paralympics have just concluded. Team Singapore did extremely well, with Joseph Schooling winning Singapore's first Olympics gold medal, Yip Pin Xiu bagging two gold medals at the Paralympics and Theresa Goh being duly rewarded with a bronze medal after decades of hard work. Let me therefore use a sporting analogy to conclude.",17,359,2016-11-07-T-026-S-00359
2016-11-07-T-026,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"The President has previously been described in this House as a goalkeeper. Indeed, if he fails to do the job well, no matter how good our strikers are, more goals will be scored against us and Team Singapore will be set back. We need a capable goalkeeper who works with the other players. Only then will Team Singapore continue to do well in the global league, against competitors who may be bigger, stronger and more intimidating.",18,360,2016-11-07-T-026-S-00360
2016-11-07-T-026,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Constitutional changes should never be undertaken lightly. For half a century, our Constitution has served us well, with periodic adjustments to bring it up to date and keep Singapore on course. The institution of the Elected Presidency was one such adjustment. I encourage all Members of this House to consider the current proposed changes to it with an eye on the next half century and beyond. Thank you.""",19,361,2016-11-07-T-026-S-00361

2016-11-07-T-028,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"Let me begin with a brief history of our Presidency. When colonial Singapore attained self-government in 1959, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara was the Head of State. He represented the British Crown in Singapore. Upon Independence in 1965, his constitutional title was changed to the ""President"". Encik Yusof bin Ishak was our last Yang di-Pertuan Negara, and our first President.",6,373,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00373
2016-11-07-T-028,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"Like the British Monarch, the President was the ceremonial Head of State. He had no executive role, and acted on the advice of Cabinet, save in respect of several historical constitutional functions such as appointing the Prime Minister and dissolving Parliament. His ""central and defining"" role was to be a symbol of national unity and a personification of the state, representing all Singaporeans, regardless of race, language or religion.",7,374,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00374
2016-11-07-T-028,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"The Elected Presidency was first conceptualised in the 1980s, to guard against the risk of a profligate government squandering the nation's reserves.

2016-11-07-T-028,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"The United States, for example, experienced this very recently in 2013.

2016-11-07-T-028,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"When the system of Parliament appointing the President was replaced by direct elections in 1991, a pre-qualification approach was established to ensure that ""voters are given qualified and suitable candidates to choose from"". This was necessary because the Elected President had to be a person who ""fulfil[s] exacting standards of competence, experience and rectitude"". In his custodial role, he can prevent access to past reserves and veto budgets, transactions and key appointments. He cannot simply rubber-stamp the Government's proposal or pass off the CPA's recommendation as his own. He must make his own decision in the exercise of his discretion. That means he must have knowledge, competence and discernment to assess whether proposals are in the national interest. He must have the courage, conviction and confidence to disagree, where necessary, with the CPA and the elected Government. If he does not perform his role well, he may allow hard-earned money – the hard-earned money of all Singaporeans – to be frittered away needlessly, or prevent the Government from acting in a time of need to avert a crisis.",3,405,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00405
2016-11-07-T-028,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Several contributors to the Constitutional Commission argued against the imposition of stringent eligibility criteria by comparing the Presidential eligibility criteria with the apparently less exacting eligibility criteria prescribed for the Prime Minister. However, as many of these contributors subsequently conceded, this is a false comparison.",4,406,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00406
2016-11-07-T-028,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"A person only becomes a Prime Minister after passing through ""many stringent tests of leadership"". He must be elected as a Member of Parliament in the general elections. He will generally lead and be endorsed by the political party which wins a majority of Parliamentary seats. He must command the support of a majority of elected Members of Parliament. These Members of Parliament would have had the opportunity to scrutinise his abilities and values closely. These requirements mean that there is a multi-layered filtering process where a person's abilities are tested before he is likely to become Prime Minister.",5,407,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00407
2016-11-07-T-028,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,The President comes into office by a different route. He is elected into office directly by the public. There needs to be eligibility criteria that set a baseline for the experience and qualities which a candidate ought to possess.,6,408,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00408
2016-11-07-T-028,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"If eligibility criteria are necessary for the Presidency, then the question is whether the current criteria serve as effective thresholds for Presidential candidature.

In 1993, there were only 158 companies, or about 0.2% of Singapore-incorporated companies then, which met the $100 million paid-up capital requirement. Today, there is a much larger base of Singapore companies, and the smallest of the top 0.2% has a paid-up capital of approximately $431 million, and if you go back to the 158th largest Singapore-incorporated company that – today – has a paid-up capital of approximately S$1.6 billion. There is, therefore, a need to update and refine the eligibility criteria. Clause 7 of the Bill amends Article 19 for this purpose.

The first way is by holding the key public offices set out in Article 19(3)(a). And this list remains identical to the existing limb (i). It is a ""tightly drawn"" list of senior officeholders who have handled ""complex matters with a wide-reaching public dimension"". There is no current need to modify the list because the demands of these offices are self-adjusting over the years.

As compared to the existing limb (ii), Article 19(3)(b) narrows the qualifying offices to only the ""chief executive"" of the Fifth Schedule entity. ""Chief executive"" is defined in Article 19(10) as ""the most senior executive who is principally responsible for the management and conduct of the entity's business and operations"".",8,420,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00420

These companies are key institutions that manage significant amounts of the national reserves. Indeed, they are so important to the national interest that the appointment of their chief executives and their annual budgets are subject to Presidential oversight. To ensure that Fifth Schedule entities are of sufficient size, clauses 13(b) and 14(b) of the Bill update the qualifying threshold for adding entities to the Fifth Schedule, from $100 million to $500 million. Clause 34 of the Bill removes Ministry of National Development (MND) Holdings from the Fifth Schedule, as it is now defunct.",10,422,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00422

Each of these terms must be at least one year in length. For example, a person who has served as a Chief Executive of a Fifth Schedule entity for two years and as a Permanent Secretary for one year will qualify, provided that each of those terms falls wholly or partly within the 20-year window.",13,425,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00425

While the increase in the quantitative threshold may sound large, significantly more companies fulfil the updated size requirement today than companies which fulfilled the existing criteria in 1993.",18,430,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00430

It is necessary to continue emphasising this role, particularly because once we have direct elections, it is difficult to ensure that the Presidents will continue to collectively represent the different racial groups. This is a real concern – that members of minority groups may not be elected to the Presidency for long periods of time. This will undermine the President's vital role as the symbol of our multi-racial nation.",56,468,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00468

2016-11-07-T-028,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Furthermore, as the Commission put it, ""the most meritorious candidate may not always be the most electable"", because race ""has an impact on at least a portion of the electorate"". Indeed, the CNA-IPS survey I referred to earlier showed that a significant proportion of respondents were not willing to accept a President from a race other than their own. Therefore, a candidate's race may work against him in some situations, and may have a decisive impact in moderately close elections.",59,471,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00471

However, a careful balance has been built into the CPA's composition and processes as a safeguard. Let us assume that the President appoints one of his three appointees as the CPA Chairman.

There is a risk that a Government bent on raiding the reserves or compromising the public services could remove the Elected Presidency to get rid of that check. This was the initial rationale for entrenchment  to protect the Elected Presidency and its core custodial powers against easy removal. By contrast, it would be much more difficult to remove well-established institutions such as this Parliament or the Judiciary.",86,583,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00583

2016-11-07-T-028,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"However, referendums do have inherent limitations. They generally lead to binary outcomes, even though the issues that underlie the vote may be complex. Communicating these complexities to voters to make an informed decision is often not easy. Emotions and misinformation can have a big influence. For example, studies on the Brexit referendum show that a significant percentage of people who voted to ""leave"", subsequently regretted their vote.",90,587,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00587

Early polls suggested that it would be comfortably ratified, but a vocal anti-ratification campaign, led by a former Colombian President, engendered a shock result  50.2% of voters voted against the deal.",91,588,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00588

2016-11-07-T-028,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,The Article 5C mechanism is necessary because circumvention or curtailment of powers can occur without textual amendments being made to the power-conferring provision.,122,619,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00619
2016-11-07-T-028,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,Let me illustrate this with an example.,123,620,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00620
2016-11-07-T-028,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"The Government's spending limit depends on the expected long-term real rates of return (ELTRROR) on the ""relevant assets"" pool. Under Article 142(1A)(a), the President's concurrence must be obtained for the ELTRROR proposed by the Finance Minister. In this way, the President has a say over the Government's spending limit.",124,621,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00621
2016-11-07-T-028,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Assume that a bill purports to remove certain assets from the definition of ""relevant assets"". Article 5B does not catch this amendment because the power-conferring provision – Article 142(1A)(a) – is not textually amended. However, the President's custodial power over the ELTRROR and the Government's spending limit is diminished by such a change. This may therefore amount to a circumvention or curtailment that will be caught by Article 5C.",125,622,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00622
2016-11-07-T-028,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,I should emphasise that this is only a hypothetical illustration. Whether there is any circumvention or curtailment is ultimately a question of law on the facts of every case.,126,623,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00623
2016-11-07-T-028,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Article 5C(4) stipulates the circumstances under which the President's withholding of assent may be overruled. Where he withholds assent with CPA's support, he may be overruled if the bill is supported by a simple majority at a referendum, or a three-quarter parliamentary majority affirms the bill. Where he withholds assent contrary to the CPA's recommendation, a two-third parliamentary majority may affirm the bill.",127,624,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00624

If the tribunal rules that Article 5C does not apply to the Bill, the President will be deemed to have assented to the Bill. But if the tribunal rules that Article 5C applies, then the President has basis to withhold assent.

2016-11-07-T-028,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Prior to the establishment of the Elected Presidency, the system for appointing the President by this House allowed Parliament to take into account a fine balance of considerations in appointing a President to office. It allowed for consideration of qualities, such as profound learning, good character, high reputation and strong moral fibre. The ethnicity of a candidate was also important, given our multi-racial composition.",136,633,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00633

2016-11-07-T-028,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Today, it is no longer this House that balances all the considerations when appointing a President to perform the President's unifying and symbolic role. We therefore need another framework to achieve and maintain this fine balance. The proposed five-term hiatus mechanism helps, where necessary, to facilitate the periodic election of members of different racial groups to the Presidency. This ensures that even though Presidents are now directly elected, they will, over time, continue to collectively embody the multi-racialism that symbolises us as a people and as a country.",139,636,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00636

2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Mdm Speaker, the Constitutional Amendment Bill that we begin debating on today needs to be seen in the context of strengthening our system and our country. From a third-world country that suffered from a weak economy and racial strife in the 1960s to the first-world nation that we are so proud to declare as our home wherever we go today, it is our incorruptibility, meritocracy and multiracialism that saw us through. These values would be nothing but mere words if we only expounded them in forums or paper, but it was through Singaporeans' support, continuous social improvements and conscientious system and policy design that we could truly embrace them. Therefore, any amendment must be made in the spirit of further entrenching our values of incorruptibility, meritocracy and multiracialism within Singapore, so that we can continue to ensure continued peace and progress for our nation.",1,648,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00648
2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"When studying the amendments set out in this Bill, there are two key components that stand out to me and which I would like to talk about in this debate.",2,649,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00649
2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Firstly, Elected Presidency is necessary. We had introduced in 1991 an elected presidency with reserve powers to safeguard our reserves. However, there have been calls to revert the Presidential system to the appointed system from the current elected one.",3,650,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00650
2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Some are concerned about Singapore becoming inevitably fragmented as segments of the population take sides. Some were concerned that candidates will make unrealistic but populist promises that are not provided for in the Constitution and, therefore, cast ridicule on the system. Some members of the Opposition have even argued for an abolishment of the Elected Presidency, reverting back to the former system of Appointed Presidency, as they say that an elected President, whom they assumed as the ruling party's nominee, may abet in squandering away our reserves together with the Government!",4,651,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00651
2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),But I have different views. Allow me to share.,5,652,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00652
2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"First and foremost, and the most important, the custodial role of the President is to safeguard our reserves should the Government of the day go rogue and, hence, the metaphor of the President as holding a ""second key"". And because the Government of the day is formed by the Party that had won Singaporeans' mandate, it would be almost impossible for the President to challenge the Government if the President has no electoral mandate to back him.",6,653,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00653
2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Our founding Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, articulated this point very clearly in 1984. He said, and I quote, ""[If] President were to block the spending of any reserve which the government in office has not itself accumulated, the newly elected Prime Minister will be furious to be thwarted. Therefore, it may be better for the President to be elected by the electorate, instead of Parliament, so that he can have the moral authority to intervene, preferably with the agreement of a Presidential Committee for the protection of reserves.""",7,654,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00654
2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Second, the argument that an appointed President is better than an elected President in preventing a rogue Government from squandering away Singapore's reserves is unconvincing. Assuming Party X won the mandate and forms the Government, but it turns rogue and, since it is in power, decides to reward its political allies through high value contracts without tender and when the finances go south, decides to draw on the reserves to fill the fiscal hole. And now, let us assume the President is an appointed one – appointed by moving a Motion in Parliament by the Prime Minister, who would be from Party X. Clearly, with Party X's members forming the majority of the House, the candidate favoured by Party X will become President. Such a President is in no position, and may have no intention, to block any unwarranted draw on the reserves.",8,655,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00655
2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"In contrast, with an elected Presidency system, eligible candidates who have no political leaning and truly have a heart to serve Singapore can contest against the so-called establishment candidate.

2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Third, the Presidential Election is unlike a General Election. The roles of a President, what can or cannot be done, are clearly set out in the Constitution. There should not be a contest of different political directions and values, which can be divisive. The Presidential Election will instead focus on choosing the candidate best suited to assume the custodial role and in representing Singapore.",10,657,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00657
2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Finally, if the candidate does not understand what can or cannot be done as a President and makes wonderful election promises that cannot be fulfilled under the Constitution, then this candidate's wisdom and abilities are in question.

2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Therefore, I am supportive of having an elected President because he or she must have the moral authority to stand against a government that has gone rogue.

2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Second, multiracialism is key to Singapore. Prior to today's debate, I was part of a panel discussion organised by Zaobao in September.

2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Seventy-five percent of Singapore's population is ethnic Chinese. It is easy to mistake us as a Chinese society and this is not a figment of our imagination. In the not-so-distant past, many people in the West had either not heard of Singapore or often mistook Singapore as part of China. Even today, after years of hard work in fostering multi-racialism and positioning ourselves as a multi-racial society, Singapore is still nicknamed as ""坡 县"" amongst some groups of PRC nationals, referring us to being a county, not even a province, of China. Whether it is a term of affection or not, it is clear that Singapore in some quarters is seen as a Chinese society and a distant county of a larger China.",15,662,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00662
2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),China is an old friend of Singapore. We should and we must continue strengthening Sino-Singapore relationship.

2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"That the majority of our population is ethnic Chinese is a fact. But we must make sure that our Head of State – an important national symbol – reflects our multi-racialism. The imperative of doing so goes beyond fulfilling our ideal of a multi-racial society, even though this is absolutely desirable. There is a need for us to assert our independence and multiracial complexion because of the geopolitical realities we face. Non-Chinese Singaporeans are not a ""by the way"" – we are all an integral part of Singapore.",18,665,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00665
2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Therefore, what if we do not have a President of a particular race for a prolonged period of time? What if it is not because the candidate of a particular race is less capable or less experienced or has less stature, but because voters simply prefer someone they feel they identify with more?",19,666,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00666
2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Some argued that by having a reserved election, we will be sacrificing meritocracy for multi-racialism. I disagree. Both are equally important and this amendment Bill helps to ensure this. I will set out my reasons as follow",20,667,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00667
2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Firstly, the eligibility criteria, which really is the first filter, will ensure that all candidates have the required competency and experience, regardless of whether it is a normal Presidential Election or a reserved one. With the amendment to the candidates' eligibility, most would agree that it is a highly stringent set of criteria. Under the updated criteria, far less than 1% of the total number of registered companies in Singapore will have Shareholder Equity of $500 million. At this level, I believe their CEOs would have the competence, experience, credibility and stature needed to stand as the Head of State of Singapore.",21,668,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00668
2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Second, prejudices are real. IPS Study on Race & Religion in Singapore by Dr Matthew Matthews released in 2014 revealed that racial prejudice continues to be present in modern Singapore. And 62.8% of respondents think there is about the same or more racial prejudice in Singapore today compared to five years ago. Non-Chinese are four times more likely to feel racially discriminated against regarding a job or job promotion compared to Chinese. And even though 95% of respondents feel that Singapore is important to their sense of identity, still a 88.7% also feel that race is integral to their sense of identity as well. And if we really walked the ground, one would know that within certain segments of our population, there is a racial preference for President and in a specific order. My point is, having preferences is a human tendency and even if we studiously tried to be race-blind, race preferences can still manifest unconsciously. The person having these preferences may not even be aware of it. Therefore, if a talented individual fails to be elected because of his or her race, it would truly be very sad.",22,669,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00669
2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Third, the President must personify our Singaporean character and values. Before the current elected Presidential system, the convention in the appointment system had been to appoint Presidents from different races. In this amendment that we are debating today, the reserved election ensures that a particular race, defined as ""community"" in the Bill, will not be neglected over an extended period of time. And this applies to all races, not just the so-called minority races. Meaning, even though the Chinese forms the majority of our population, but if for some reason, there is no Chinese President for five terms, the sixth term will be reserved for the Chinese. Therefore, I do not see this as a discriminatory rule, since it applies to all races. Madam, allow me to continue in Mandarin.",23,670,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00670
2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] In Singapore, the President is the Head of State and our ""second key"".

Be it domestically or internationally, our President must have certain powers and dignity so as to personify our Singapore spirit.",24,671,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00671
2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"At today's debate, I would like to talk about the importance of the attributes of the Presidential candidates and the importance of maintaining a multiracial society.",25,672,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00672
2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Firstly, the quality of the candidates must be high. Hence, it is necessary to raise the criteria. Times have changed. In the 1990s, there are less than 200 qualified companies in Singapore. Today, qualified companies based on the same criteria have increased to more than 2,000, more than 10 times as much. If we do not raise the criteria to reflect our current situation, how can we ensure that the candidates are truly capable, thus, his words carry weight and will not be looked down upon?",26,673,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00673
2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Moreover, the candidates selected based on these more stringent criteria, whoever he or she may be, we can be assured that he or she has the capability and confidence to control the ""second key"" and that our reserves will not be squandered away.",27,674,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00674
2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"If we look at this issue from another angle, raising the qualifying criteria can avoid certain situations, say, there are several Presidential candidates and one of them does not possess the relevant experience and capability. However, he is a charismatic speaker and even promises things that he cannot possibly deliver. He managed to persuade the people and is eventually elected. After the election, we then realise that he actually does not have the relevant knowledge and cannot discharge the Presidential duties well. To make things worse, he does not possess sufficient knowledge and holds a different view from the Government, yet he insists on doing things in his own way. This will result in a gridlock. Such a situation will definitely lead to more problems than benefits. Hence, it is necessary to raise the qualifying criteria to make sure that every candidate is competent.",28,675,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00675
2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Secondly, to maintain a multiracial society should not only be limited to our attitudes and words and how we treat our compatriots. It must be seen to be so.",29,676,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00676
2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Earlier in my English speech, I talked about the sensitivity of our geographical politics. It is not difficult to see that this ""little red dot"" with a dominant Chinese majority is rather unnatural in this region and among our neighbours. On the other hand, Some Chinese netizens refer to Singapore as ""Singapore county"" which seems to regard Singapore as part of China. Although some people think that this is an endearing term and shows that Singapore and China are old friends, it will inadvertently affect Singapore's international image and undermine its independence.",30,677,2016-11-07-T-028-S-00677
2016-11-07-T-028,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Multiracialism is the foundation of our country and it is the secret of our success. It cannot be taken for granted.

To understand this is to put yourself in the shoes of the minority community, especially the Malays, and see it from our perspective over the 50-year trajectory of nation building. We have frequently been in the spotlight for the last 50 years. After separation from Malaysia, there were difficult questions for all communities, and more so for the Malay community, in this new nation. At the same time, we faced socio-economic challenges. We lagged behind in education. Higher divorce rates, higher crime rates and, more recently, Islam has been associated with the terrorism threat. The situation, of course, has been improving because of the hard work by the community and the Government's support, and we must continue to forge ahead.

Our first President, the late Mr Yusof Ishak died in office on 23 November 1970. An entire generation of Malays has grown up without ever having a Malay president. Furthermore, the younger generation has grown up with meritocracy as the basis of how our society is organised. And, hence, among younger Malays, there seem to be a bit of reluctance to have the circuit breaker. Yet, in closed door discussions, many would raise their hands in wanting to see a Malay president.

2016-11-07-T-030,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Mdm Speaker, once upon a time, 60 years ago, our Founding Generation of leaders, led by Mr Lee Kuan Yew – they had a dream. A dream of a multi-racial nation. A dream full of audacity and hope. It was the era of post-World War Two, of decolonisation. Communal forces in newborn nations. The American Civil Rights movement had not even run its course.",1,735,2016-11-07-T-030-S-00735
2016-11-07-T-030,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Today, looking around the world, in so many nations, that dream is still very far from reality. We see the lessons of Ferguson, Missouri – deep divides between races, a tinderbox set alight in the burning violence that followed. We see the lessons of the banlieues in France, where children can grow up isolated, seeing a ceiling above them almost from the time they are born, wondering if they will ever have a place in the broader society. We see the lessons from countries much closer to home. Because all too often, when societies are left to natural workings alone, human imperfection can lead a society to a less than perfect outcome.",2,736,2016-11-07-T-030-S-00736
2016-11-07-T-030,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),Economists know this. This is why the laissez-faire approach is now moderated to recognise the human externalities within ourselves.

If that happens, that is a retrograde step. Rather, I see Article 19B as a signal and a safeguard. Singaporeans should continue to vote for the Presidency on the basis of who they feel is the best person for the job regardless of race, language or religion.

2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, I am speaking on this adjournment motion as a result of the debate that took place during the Second Reading of the Remote Gambling Bill in 2014. I noted in my speech then that terrestrial and online gambling are two very different realms that would require different approaches to address the problems associated with gambling in general.",1,798,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00798
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To this end, I would like to refer to a section of the speech made by the then Minister of Social and Family Development, Mr Chan Chun Sing on online gambling and I quote  ""This is an evolving challenge. It is a difficult challenge. We need to stay vigilant to stay ahead of the threat and the challenges. We need to stay ahead and be prepared to strengthen our safeguards as necessary proactively and creatively. And we need concerted efforts by all – individuals, family and society – to keep our eyes on this issue. And we need to make sure that our measures are multi-pronged – upstream, midstream and downstream.""",2,799,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00799
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"During the last session of Parliament, I directed some supplementary questions at the current Minister of Social and Family Development about these multi-pronged measures that the Government had sought to introduce to check online gambling. The answers did not suggest any specific initiatives introduced by the Government since the debate on the Remote Gambling Bill in 2014 to tackle the online gambling realm any differently from terrestrial gambling, even though the Government has acknowledged that its methods of outreach between terrestrial and online gambling have to be different.",3,800,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00800
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"So, I would like to ask the Minister again, what new upstream, midstream and downstream measures has the Government instituted to prevent the scourge of online gambling since the passage of this Bill in 2014? One would have thought that it ought to have been imperative for the Government to go public with these new initiatives well before granting exemptions to Singapore Pools and the Turf Club to offer online gambling services starting from October 2016.",4,801,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00801
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, the choice of the usage of the word ""scourge"" in my speech fulfils a specific purpose. Why do I call online gambling a scourge?",5,802,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00802
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The American Psychiatric Association places pathological gambling in the same category as drug dependency and alcoholism in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). It says that gambling ""activate(s) the brain reward system with effects similar to those of drugs of abuse"" and that ""gambling disorder symptoms resemble substance use disorders to a certain extent.""",6,803,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00803
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Numerous academic studies have found that online gambling is more addictive than other types of gambling, and that online gamblers have higher rates of gambling addiction than traditional gamblers. The Internet has greatly increased the accessibility of gambling. A 2015 study in Spain found a significant increase in pathological gamblers two years after the legalisation of online gambling in that country. The problem was found to be especially serious among young people – online gambling has become the main form of pathological gambling among people below 26 years old in Spain. These results are unsurprising, since Millennials are more comfortable using Internet technologies than their older counterparts.",7,804,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00804
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Online gambling has another dark side. Problem and pathological gamblers can place bets using their smart phones without their friends and family members even noticing, unlike when they visit the casinos or go to the Turf Club. This removes a very important informal safeguard against problem gambling.",8,805,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00805
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"An important part of addiction treatment is for the problem gambler to avoid putting himself in situations which could tempt him to lapse back to his bad habit, for example, by avoiding casinos, jackpot rooms or other physical locations where gambling is available. However, it would be impractical to expect a problem gambler to refrain from using his mobile phone or computer as these are needed for modern day work and personal communication.",9,806,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00806
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"A longitudinal study of gambling and problem gambling in the US between 1999 and 2013 found that problem gambling affects the poor more than the rich. The prevalence of frequent gambling is highest in the poorest one third of respondents and those in disadvantaged neighbourhoods, and it declines dramatically as socio-economic status increases. This could be because some in the lower income group are motivated to gamble so as to improve their financial situation and status.",10,807,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00807
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The most common reaction I have heard from Singaporeans to the news of the issuing of exempt operator licenses is that the Government just wants to ""make more money"". While am sure the Minister will refute this accusation vigorously, the fact remains that a large part of legalised gambling revenue goes into the state's coffers. Is providing for exempt operators a way to redirect gambling spending away from illegal overseas operators to local operators, which are owned by the Tote Board? If so, this only fuels public speculation that the Government simply wants a piece of the huge global Internet gambling pie, and that this is a revenue-raising exercise done at the expense of Singaporeans and their welfare.",11,808,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00808
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Some have argued that the Tote Board gives money to many charities, which help the vulnerable in our society. This is a morally questionable argument that is akin to saying that it is okay to harm some people in order to help others. Since problem gambling disproportionately affects the poor, collecting revenues from online gambling is in effect a regressive tax on the most vulnerable in our society.",12,809,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00809
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),The Minister said that the Government looked at a similar exempt operator regimes in Hong Kong and Norway and found that the problem gambling situation did not worsen. I am not sure what these studies were or what the exact findings were. I hope the Minister will be able to share the details of these studies for Singaporeans to examine.,13,810,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00810
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Did these studies prove that having an exempt operator regime reduces gambling harm more than a complete prohibition of online gambling? If not, was the Government too eager to rush to exempt operators before more conclusive results are found?",14,811,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00811
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Speaker, we should not be gambling with the lives of Singaporean families.",15,812,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00812
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In the aftermath of the National Council of Churches of Singapore (NCCS)'s dialogue with the Government, it was reported the carve out created for exempt operators to legally provide online gambling facilities were based on studies relating to the social impact of gambling that the Government had documented, and its assessment of possible scenarios with and without the ""valve"" of controlled exempt operator. The NCCS noted that the research on this area is still new. To this extent at the very least, the Government should publish its research in this area especially since the Government will reportedly be meeting up with NCCS leaders in three to six months' time.",16,813,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00813
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Minister has argued that exempt operators provide an ""outlet"" for gamblers and allow the Government to manage crime associated with gambling. The assumption behind this argument is that gamblers who were gambling on illegal overseas gambling websites will switch over to the exempt operators' websites or apps.",17,814,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00814
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Has the Government found any studies to show that people will actually switch over to exempt operators? More likely, local gambling apps that have a stamp of approval by the Government will attract people who have previously never gambled online. It may include many young people who may not relish queuing up at Toto outlets or going to the races at the Turf Club, but may experiment with gambling for the first time from the privacy of their phones. The legalisation of online gambling will thus expand the gambling market, rather than provide a safe outlet for existing gamblers. Once started, online gambling, like soft drugs, could be a gateway to more serious gambling addictions.",18,815,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00815
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In its meeting with the NCCS, it was reported that the Government told the NCCS that it was not sending conflicting signals with the partial lifting of the ban on online gambling because the exemptions had already been written into the Bill in 2014.",19,816,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00816
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),It would appear these exemptions were written specifically with Singapore Pools and Singapore Turf Club in mind. A quick review the timeline of events is as follows,20,817,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00817

2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Ten million dollars is no small sum. It would be a huge gamble to sink $10 million into a contract without knowing whether it would pay off. Yet, more than one year before the exemptions were granted, Singapore Pools appeared to have done exactly that. In the eyes of the public, it would seem that the year-long evaluation of the applications was conducted with one outcome in mind – to find a way for Singapore Pools and the Turf Club to carry out online gambling operations. Was the process meant to determine whether or not the applications should be approved, or to determine how they could be approved?",27,824,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00824
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To this end, will the Minister inform this house under what circumstances the Government will review the exemptions granted currently to Singapore Pools and the Turf Club and how it plans to review them in an on-going manner?",28,825,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00825
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"During the 2014 debate, I asked the Minister to put the Bill before a Select Committee so as to scrutinise the exemption clauses. This request was turned down as the House was told that the Government had already engaged in consultations. However, in its recent meeting with the NCCS, the Government cited its consultations with social service leaders and religious representatives as justification for the exemptions. Was the NCCS part of the ""religious representatives"" consulted in drafting the Bill? Did they agree to the exemptions? If so, why have they changed their position and if not, why were they not consulted before?",29,826,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00826
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"While feedback through the Government channels, any Government channel, should not be discouraged and in fact encouraged, we should remember that they are not subject to the same degree of parliamentary scrutiny in terms of the range of opinions consulted and the extent of public scrutiny. On Bills that provoke as much controversy as this one, should we not take the extra step to establish relevant Select Committees to go over the implementation and provisions with a fine-tooth comb? In exchange for a bit more time, we gain the opportunity to deepen public engagement and generate greater support for our laws.",30,827,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00827
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Government says that there are safeguards in place to prevent gambling addicts from harming themselves and their families. These include self-exclusion and third party exclusion. However, self-exclusion is only practical for those who recognise that they have a problem. As for third party exclusion, a family member has to cross several difficult hurdles to get his or her loved one placed on the exclusion list. This includes being interviewed by a panel and having to show proof of the family member's gambling addiction. The surreptitious nature of online gambling addiction means that such proof will be hard to obtain.",31,828,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00828
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"International studies have found that each problem gambler negatively impacts an average eight to 10 family members, colleagues and friends. Also, most problem gamblers do not seek help until they hit rock bottom – for example if they have wiped out all their family savings. These suggest that the numbers affected by problem gambling are much higher than official statistics may show.",32,829,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00829
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Unlike other vices like alcoholism and drug abuse, the costs associated with problem gambling are borne almost entirely by family members, who often end up paying off the debts of the gambler. The embarrassment associated with problem gambling means that the gamblers and their families rarely talk about their problems in public. Because of this, there is a tendency for policy-makers to overlook the real social impact of problem gambling.",33,830,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00830
2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"As part of its on-going review of the exemptions, the Government should look into the implementing more stringent ""circuit breakers"" – for example, tying expenditure and daily funding limits on online gambling to an individual's salary or a scale of that salary, and to deliberately set as a low percentage of one's salary or removing the user-defined funding and expenditure limits.",34,831,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00831

2016-11-07-T-032,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To conclude, Mdm Speaker, there has been a glaring lack of clarity as to how the Government is making preparations to address the scourge of online gambling downstream, midstream and upstream in a directed and committed way. This is in spite of the Government's open admission that the online gambling is, I quote, a ""difficult challenge"". It would logically follow that the issue would demand significant attention from the authorities.",39,836,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00836

2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee),"So, what we have put in place is a broad and extensive prohibition against online gambling, and an Exempt Operator valve that comes with social safeguards and an exclusion system set amidst public education and outreach, and counselling.",19,856,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00856
2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee),"Madam, with your permission, may I ask the Clerk to distribute a one-sheet summary of some of our education and outreach efforts, including some of the new efforts that have been put in place to tackle online gambling.",20,857,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00857
2016-11-07-T-032,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Yes, please. [",1,858,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00858
2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Madam, our concern is that a total prohibition will only drive the problem further underground – harder to detect, problems surfacing too late. Trends and observations show that. This broadly mirrors the approach that we have taken for terrestrial gambling. So, we need a valve – legal, run by non-profit organisations where people have to sign up so we know who they are, with mechanisms to promote responsible gaming for us to intervene early before the problem gets out of hand.",1,859,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00859
2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We also intend to work with the Exempt Operators to study the impact  whether there is displacement; what is the online gambling prevalence after the scheme is put in place; and then whether further tweaks, adjustments and changes to policy need to be undertaken.",2,860,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00860
2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"What has been the Workers' Party's proposals on the online gambling problem thus far? In 2014, during the Second Reading of the Remote Gambling Act, many members of the Workers' Party in this House spoke and opposed the exemption regime but did not offer many details of alternative solutions to eradicate social ills caused by online gambling.",3,861,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00861
2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mr Pritam Singh, in particular, pushed for a total ban on online gambling and he does not believe it will push the problem underground.",4,862,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00862
2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,Mr Yee Jenn Jong made suggestions on how the Exempt Operator regime could be tightened if it was implemented.,5,863,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00863
2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Now, in the 2015 Manifesto, the Workers' Party had one line or a couple of lines on online gambling – prohibit all online gambling; no exceptions, and its aim was, I quote, ""to eradicate the social ills caused by online and remote gambling"". So, we presume, in 2015, the Workers' Party's objective and proposal to Singaporeans was to drive online gambling in Singapore to zero, through a total ban. In its 27 September 2016 press release, the Workers' Party opposed the granting of exemption to any organisation but did not offer a solution to eradicate the social ills caused by online gambling.",6,864,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00864
2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Madam, the Workers' Party says a complete and total ban is the best. No need for a valve with social safeguards. They say that these safeguards generate money. We should not tax. We should not put it to good use. We should not allow it. We should not get involved in having any safety valves, any social safeguards. But, Madam, their position is not clear, for a number of reasons which I shall submit.",7,865,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00865
2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"First, they do not cite any precedent or any country in the world where a complete ban has solved this growing problem of online gambling addiction.",8,866,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00866
2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Second, they do not explain why Singapore's approach, and those, such as in Norway and Hong Kong, which have adapted our system from, and which have valves, are inferior.",9,867,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00867
2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Third, the Workers' Party's rationale is problematic. During the Second Reading of the Act in 2014, Mr Singh said that a total ban will not drive online gambling underground, whereas Mr Png Eng Huat contradicted him in the very same debate where he said categorically that a ban will drive the problem underground, and I quote, ""It is the law of nature.""",10,868,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00868
2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"So, Madam, what is the Workers' Party's true position on this matter? Even after this evening, even after the allegations have been made about the Government's intentions, I do not think we are any wiser.",11,869,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00869
2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mr Singh's explanation, Madam, is that, with a total ban, most gamblers, he says, would just go to the existing land-based outlets, such as authorised 4-D/Toto shops, which are completely legal and regulated. But this is not the view of the professionals, the Police, who have seen the problem go underground and who say that this will happen, and it is happening.",12,870,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00870
2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"So, it is imperative, as Minister Iswaran has said in 2014, for Mr Singh making these assertions, flying in the face of what the Police, the professionals, have observed and said it is happening, to provide evidence instead that a total ban will not drive illegal activities underground but will instead drive it to the land-based Toto shops.",13,871,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00871
2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Fourth, apart from what we have just talked about, there are no details in their manifesto, media releases and speeches on how their proposal of a total and complete ban will solve this real problem inflicted on many Singaporeans, some of whom we have met at Meet-the-People sessions. And this after two years of debate since the Act was enacted in 2014.",14,872,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00872
2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"First, we invite the Workers' Party to make clear what its position is. Is it an objection in principle, against all gambling? If it is a matter of principle, then state that it is so, both land and terrestrial. But if it is against online gambling, then it is an assessment of where the risks lie. And as I have said earlier, we have the views of the Police and the professionals.",15,873,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00873
2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Now, in such a case, it would be good if the Workers' Party can put on the table specific suggestions on how it would enact a total ban to solve the problem and make it drive the problem from online to the land-based terrestrial outlets that Mr Singh had categorically said in 2014.",16,874,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00874
2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For example, do you support a complete ban on VPN and technology that skirts around blocking measures?",17,875,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00875
2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Second, we know, Madam, that law, as a deterrence, is not just about the law and deterrence, but the likelihood of getting caught. Are they proposing to have apps or tracking devices uploaded on computers or smartphones to monitor people and further detect that they are going onto illicit sites and, perhaps, after that, do you propose to make it mandatory for counselling? Or are you proposing to increase penalties and up prosecution rates and to ask for deterrence sentences? If so, what do you suggest? How will you make the prohibition and the enforcement of the prohibition such as to promote the flow of people from the illicit sites online to the Toto and Singapore Pool sites on land? Or are you proposing to expand outreach and education and mandatory counselling and, if so, do you believe that it will solve the problem?",18,876,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00876
2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Madam, we have circulated that flyer with some of the things that we have been doing and, perhaps, the Member can suggest how those can concretely be further improved.",19,877,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00877
2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Madam, the Government is not able to solve complex social problems through making speeches alone, nor by lamenting a problem. We know it is a problem.",20,878,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00878

2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We are expected to put forward workable solutions for consultation and debate, and we have to implement a solution for Singaporeans. It has to be practical. It may not always be popular but we have to try to solve the problem pragmatically, and, most importantly, be prepared to adjust our solution along the way, based on experience and our findings.",1,880,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00880
2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mdm Speaker, in conclusion, online gambling is a global phenomenon. It grows at a very fast rate. It is not a problem outside Singapore. It is right here on our shores, in our homes, in people's pockets when they walk around, when they work, when they are at home. It poses law and order, and social problems, like I said before.",2,881,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00881
2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"And online gambling is associated with syndicates and organised crime. Banning it will help slow the pace of growth. On its own, it is inadequate, because the problem will go deeper and we will simply be burying our heads in the sand. A valve may allow people who intend to gamble online to do so in an environment with some social safeguards, and we can track the size and shape of the problem and implement further policies.",3,882,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00882

2016-11-07-T-032,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mdm Speaker, in conclusion, for those who do not want their loved ones to even visit these regulated sites, speak to them, put them onto the exclusion list. For those of us in this House and outside who have moral objections to gambling, including some of us who are speaking, do not visit, discourage your friends and family, and help NCPG and VWOs who work hard day after day to tackle these social aspects and the scourge of the problem.",1,884,2016-11-07-T-032-S-00884

2016-11-07-T-033,Chia Yong Yong,Ms Chia Yong Yong,asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the Government has studied the trends in increased jaywalking; (b) what are the numbers of jaywalkers over the last five years; (c) how many of them have been warned or penalised for jaywalking; and (d) what are the Government's plans to penalise jaywalking and ensure that jaywalking will be brought under control.,1,890,2016-11-07-T-033-S-00890
2016-11-07-T-033,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"To get a sense of the jaywalking situation, the Police monitor two indicators  the numbers of fatal and injury accidents involving pedestrians who jaywalked. In 2011, there were 25 fatal accidents and 292 injury accidents involving jaywalkers. In comparison, in 2015, there were 22 fatal accidents and 208 injury accidents involving jaywalkers.",1,891,2016-11-07-T-033-S-00891
2016-11-07-T-033,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"While the numbers of fatal and injury accidents involving jaywalkers have fallen, nevertheless, jaywalking remains an issue we are concerned about.",2,892,2016-11-07-T-033-S-00892
2016-11-07-T-033,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We need both enforcement and education to tackle this issue. The Traffic Police (TP) deploys officers at jaywalking hotspots to enforce against jaywalking and educate pedestrians on safe road use. On average, in the last five years, TP issued about 7,400 warnings or summonses for jaywalking each year.",3,893,2016-11-07-T-033-S-00893
2016-11-07-T-033,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"TP regularly engages pedestrians on road safety and good road-use practices, especially the young and elderly, who are more vulnerable. Last year, TP partnered Shell to organise the 35th Shell Traffic Games to educate primary school students on road safety. TP also partnered the Singapore Road Safety Council, Tote Board and Singapore Pools to organise the Road Safety Concert for the Golden Age to educate elderly pedestrians about safe road-use.",4,894,2016-11-07-T-033-S-00894
2016-11-07-T-033,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"TP will also be launching another road safety campaign targeting the elderly later this year. The campaign will provide an easy self-test kit for elderly pedestrians to learn more about their visual, hearing and reflex capabilities, and help them better understand themselves and the risks of jaywalking.",5,895,2016-11-07-T-033-S-00895
2016-11-07-T-033,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Government will continue to implement road safety features for pedestrians. For example, LTA has installed metal barriers along the road or centre divider to discourage jaywalking. LTA will also build more pedestrian crossings to facilitate safe crossing. TP works closely with LTA on the ""Silver Zone"" initiative, which brings senior-friendly road safety features to matured estates with high concentrations of elderly folks. LTA will expand the Green Man Plus Scheme, which allows seniors extra time to cross the road by tapping their senior citizen EZ-Link cards.",6,896,2016-11-07-T-033-S-00896
2016-11-07-T-033,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"It is also the pedestrians’ individual responsibility to ensure that they practise good road safety habits, including not jaywalking. We would like to remind pedestrians to always use proper pedestrian crossings, for example, traffic light junctions, zebra crossings, overhead bridges and underpasses. All road users have a part to play in keeping our roads safe. Other road users, including motorists and cyclists, also need to look out for pedestrians.",7,897,2016-11-07-T-033-S-00897
2016-11-07-T-034,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin,"asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether the Ministry has explored using qualitative indicators versus quantitative performance indicators to determine how funding is allocated for different agencies; and (b) how has the Ministry worked with the Ministry of Social and Family Development, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, and Ministry of Education to measure social and cultural impact.",1,898,2016-11-07-T-034-S-00898
2016-11-07-T-034,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The Government strives to ensure that public monies are well spent to achieve their intended outcomes. In our evaluation of programmes for funding, we are open to considering all forms of performance indicators that help provide a more holistic assessment of their impact. This includes both qualitative as well as quantitative indicators.",1,899,2016-11-07-T-034-S-00899
2016-11-07-T-034,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"While current performance indicators tend to be quantitative in nature, we complement these with qualitative indicators. For example, when looking at public housing, we use both quantitative data, which include home ownership rates and debt servicing ratio for applicants for new flats, and qualitative indicators which include regular surveys of residents on factors such as satisfaction with the living environment. Both quantitative and qualitative indicators are considered to refine our housing policies and programmes, improve town designs and guide how we allocate resources for public housing.",2,900,2016-11-07-T-034-S-00900
2016-11-07-T-034,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Each Ministry is accountable for its respective outcomes. MOF supports each Ministry's work in their development of performance indicators that balance between helping to capture their impact, while not being too onerous to track. These are regularly reported for each Ministry as part of the annual Revenue and Expenditure Estimates released during Budget. In addition, every two years, the Ministry of Finance works with agencies to publish the Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review (SPOR), which takes stock of Government programmes. This includes social and cultural impact, which is measured through a wide range of indicators such as healthcare affordability, the resilience of families, and the incidence of volunteerism.",3,901,2016-11-07-T-034-S-00901
2016-11-07-T-034,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"For instance, to track efforts in strengthening families, the Ministry of Social and Family Development monitors indicators such as social attitudes towards family life from periodic surveys. The Ministry of Education tracks indicators such as the number of students who progress to Secondary and post-Secondary education, and the international ranking of our education system. The Ministry of Health tracks indicators on waiting times, bed occupancy rates and public satisfaction with public hospitals and polyclinics. The Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth monitors volunteerism rates but also qualitative indicators such as the attitudes of youth to helping the less fortunate and contributing to society.",4,902,2016-11-07-T-034-S-00902
2016-11-07-T-034,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"We are mindful that not every policy outcome can be tracked by a single set of numbers. While quantitative indicators provide a measurable and comparable basis for evaluation of an agency's programmes, qualitative indicators can provide further insight into outcomes that are difficult to measure. We will continue to seek assessing programmes from multiple dimensions.",5,903,2016-11-07-T-034-S-00903
2016-11-07-T-035,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin,"asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry is adopting the suicide prevention strategy recommended by WHO and, if so, how has it been adapted for our context; (b) what measures have been taken to reduce the stigma about help-seeking for suicide attempts; and (c) how does the Ministry work with the police to ensure that those arrested for attempting suicide are provided sufficient psychological support especially those who appear mentally unstable.",1,904,2016-11-07-T-035-S-00904
2016-11-07-T-035,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Singapore adopts a multi-pronged approach to prevent suicide, in line with the recommendations under the WHO Public Health Action for the Prevention of Suicide Framework. Government agencies and stakeholders in the social sectors work together to prevent suicides by promoting upstream prevention, encouraging help seeking, providing support to at-risk groups and offering crisis support.",1,905,2016-11-07-T-035-S-00905
2016-11-07-T-035,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"First, in the area of prevention, we seek to build mental resilience in our population and increase public awareness of the importance of good mental well-being. Students in our schools are taught social-emotional skills and coping strategies, as well as how to look out for one another and to seek help from trusted adults if necessary. In the community and at workplaces, Health Promotion Board (HPB) offers programmes to promote mental health literacy. It also conducts workshops to provide our elderly tips on mental wellbeing and resilience.",2,906,2016-11-07-T-035-S-00906
2016-11-07-T-035,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Second, we have various programmes to reduce the stigma about seeking help for mental issues. Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) such as the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), have been active in promoting public awareness on suicide prevention. Silver Ribbon (Singapore) is another organisation that has been combating stigma about mental illness. It reaches out to persons who need help in building mental wellness and encourages them to seek early treatment. In addition, IMH also conducts public education programmes in schools and in the community.",3,907,2016-11-07-T-035-S-00907
2016-11-07-T-035,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Third, we have put in place services and programmes to provide support to those identified to be at higher risk. For instance, students identified to be depressed or are at risk of suicide are typically referred to school counsellors, or the Child Guidance Clinic in IMH for more challenging cases. For young persons between 16 and 30 years old, the Community Health Assessment Team (CHAT), located at SCAPE Youth Park, provides a one-stop centre (CHAT Hub) for mental health help and resources. Within the community, Family Service Centres (FSCs) provide counselling and support services to families and individuals with social and emotional difficulties. Senior Activity Centres organise befriending programmes to reach out to elderly persons who live alone in rental flats so as to prevent social isolation and depression.",4,908,2016-11-07-T-035-S-00908
2016-11-07-T-035,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Schools, FSCs and VWOs are in turn supported by the Response, Early Intervention, Assessment in Community mental Health, or REACH, teams set up by IMH. These are multidisciplinary teams that provide training and support to partners so as to strengthen their ability to identify and manage at-risk youths and children and to make appropriate referrals.",5,909,2016-11-07-T-035-S-00909
2016-11-07-T-035,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Fourth, we have services in place for individuals in crisis who need urgent help. SOS operates a 24-hour hotline to counsel persons in distress. IMH also operates a 24-hour Mental Health Helpline manned by counsellors who are trained to de-escalate situations, assess and triage cases, and activate home visit teams quickly if necessary.",6,910,2016-11-07-T-035-S-00910
2016-11-07-T-035,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"For cases of attempted suicide, the Police may refer the person to SOS for counselling, or engage the next-of-kin to assist in supporting and caring for the person. If there are clear signs indicating possible mental instability, the Police may refer the person to the IMH for an assessment. The person may be warded at IMH for care and treatment if necessary.",7,911,2016-11-07-T-035-S-00911
2016-11-07-T-035,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,The reasons for suicides are often complex and multi-dimensional. Each suicide is one too many. We will continue to improve our inter-agency and multi-prong suicide prevention efforts.,8,912,2016-11-07-T-035-S-00912
2016-11-07-T-036,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Home Affairs in the last five years (a) what is the average wage differential of an ex-offender who secures employment through the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) compared to the median industry wage in the relevant industries; and (b) what is the number of white collar or office-based jobs that SCORE has matched ex-offenders to.,1,913,2016-11-07-T-036-S-00913
2016-11-07-T-036,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Based on the employment facilitated by SCORE in 2015, the median salary of ex-offenders was on average about 10% lower than the median salary for similar occupations in the market.",1,914,2016-11-07-T-036-S-00914
2016-11-07-T-036,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Of the 2,157 inmates assisted by SCORE in 2015, 1% (or 30) were matched to white-collar jobs. This figure has been fairly consistent over the last five years.",2,915,2016-11-07-T-036-S-00915
2016-11-07-T-036,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The employers' support for the acceptance and fair employment of ex-offenders is key in helping them rebuild their lives. As ex-offenders make the effort to turn over a new leaf, we hope that society, including employers and the community, will stand ready to support them.",3,916,2016-11-07-T-036-S-00916
2016-11-07-T-037,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) to date, how many hit-and-run traffic cases remain unsolved; (b) whether the Ministry has an information network which includes workshops to report on suspicious damaged vehicles and immigration officers to do the same for vehicles leaving Singapore; and (c) what other measures are in place to apprehend drivers on the run.",1,917,2016-11-07-T-037-S-00917
2016-11-07-T-037,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Since 2015, there were a total of 233 hit-and-run accidents involving injuries and seven involving fatalities. About one-third of those involving injuries, which comprise the bulk of such accidents, have been solved.

The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (CPFTA) protects consumers against unfair practices by retailers of goods and services, including renovation contractors. The Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) received consumer feedback on about 400 renovation contractors annually from 2013 to September 2016, or about 6% of renovation businesses in Singapore. CASE successfully helped the majority of these consumers to resolve the disputes through negotiation and mediation.

The amendments strengthen the measures that may be taken against errant retailers, including renovation contractors, who persist in unfair practices. This includes appointing SPRING Singapore (SPRING) as the administering agency with investigation and enforcement powers, and additional measures that the courts may impose on errant retailers, such as requiring them to publicise injunction orders, and notify SPRING of changes to their employment status and business entities. This enables SPRING to monitor businesses and individuals who are under injunction orders to ensure that they comply with the orders, and SPRING will take timely action against them if they do not.

2016-11-07-T-042,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Building more roads to improve traffic speeds is not a sustainable option in land-scarce Singapore. Furthermore, studies based on the experiences of other cities have shown that building more roads only relieves congestion temporarily.

We have recently added 15 new trains to increase the capacity of the North-East Line. We will introduce two additional bus services by the end of this year to bring residents living in the Northeast from their homes directly to the city centre. We are also monitoring traffic speeds to see whether there is a need to introduce Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) on the KPE.

2016-11-07-T-044,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The priority of the Police in a hostage situation is to ensure the safety of the hostage, and the people in and around the incident location, such as the public and Home Team officers. Where possible, Police will seek to resolve the incident without any person coming to harm. The tactics employed to achieve this objective would vary according to the incident.",1,955,2016-11-07-T-044-S-00955

In general, Police will engage the hostage-taker to seek a peaceful resolution, even if it could lead to a prolonged stand-off, such as in this case. There are risks involved for the hostage and people in and around the incident, when a storming operation is carried out. The Police did not storm into the flat earlier as it was assessed that the hostage-taker did not pose any immediate danger to the child if he was not provoked. As a result, the ground decision was taken to de-escalate the situation by deploying the Crisis Negotiation Unit to talk to the hostage-taker to persuade him to surrender.",2,956,2016-11-07-T-044-S-00956

This is likely to exert further pressure on market rents. JTC has also improved market transparency by publishing more granular price and rental information on its website. In addition, JTC has developed, and will continue to develop innovative multiple-user ready-built facilities to strengthen the competitiveness of SMEs.

The collection, use and disclosure of personal data in Singapore comes under the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), which is enforced by the Info-Communications Media Development Authority (IMDA). The PDPA is a baseline law that is applicable to all organisations that engage in the collection and processing of personal data in Singapore, regardless of whether they have a physical or online presence.",2,978,2016-11-07-T-049-S-00978

2016-11-07-T-058,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The Public Transport Council's decisions on fare reviews are guided by the fare formula, which was last reviewed by the Fare Review Mechanism Committee in 2013. The decision then was to address the issue of service quality outside of the formula, so that the Government can regulate and work with the operators independently to improve service levels. This approach keeps the fare formula relatively straightforward, without the complication of differentiating fare adjustments on account of service quality.",1,1018,2016-11-07-T-058-S-01018
2016-11-07-T-058,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"More importantly, it does not hinder our efforts to raise service levels. Since 2013, the rail network has been expanded by 20 kilometres and the train fleet for the North-South and East-West Lines (NSEWL), North East Line (NEL) and Circle Line (CCL) has increased by about 25%, significantly alleviating train crowding. As part of the Bus Service Enhancement Programme implemented from 2012, 820 of the 1,000 buses planned for have been deployed on the roads. In line with these service level improvements, the percentage of commuters expressing satisfaction with our public transport services rose from 88.5% in 2013 to 91.8% in 2015.",2,1019,2016-11-07-T-058-S-01019
2016-11-07-T-058,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"With the transition to the Bus Contracting Model and the New Rail Financing Framework, we expect service levels to improve further. However, the cost of improving service levels, and the corresponding extent of Government subsidies for public transport, will also increase. For instance, under bus contracting, the Government will be subsidising about $3.5 to $4 billion in the next five years. Similarly, on the rail side, due to the Government taking over ownership of the operating assets under the New Rail Financing Framework, the Government expects to spend over $4 billion on renewing, upgrading and expanding operating assets over the next five years. These will be on top of the $20 billion that the Government has committed to spend on building new rail lines in the same period. We are also requiring the rail operators to invest more heavily in maintenance to raise our rail reliability substantially. Realistically, it is neither possible nor sustainable to improve service standards without having fares keep pace with the rising costs.",3,1020,2016-11-07-T-058-S-01020

As a guide, HDB intends to implement the LEP for lifts that have been in operation for 18 years or less, as it makes more sense for the older lifts to be fully replaced by the Town Councils themselves. But HDB is still working out the implementation details of the LEP, including the detailed eligibility criteria, and will inform the Town Councils of the details in a few months' time.",1,1039,2016-11-07-T-061-S-01039

2016-11-07-T-062,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will consider (i) making a change in the design and use of lifts to stipulate that only one lift in a HDB block can be used for renovation and moving purposes so that the other lift in the HDB block can be dedicated to resident's daily use; and (ii) pre-installing CCTV cameras in lifts so as to monitor the behaviour of HDB licensed contractors and ensure the safety of residents during the renovation and moving-in period.,1,1043,2016-11-07-T-062-S-01043
2016-11-07-T-062,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Lifts are an integral part of our urbanised, high-rise living environment. With some 24,000 lifts located in public housing estates, all of which are used on a high-frequency and daily basis, HDB takes a serious view of lift safety and reliability. This starts from the beginning at the lift procurement and commissioning stages, where HDB has in place a system of stringent quality control measures.",1,1044,2016-11-07-T-062-S-01044
2016-11-07-T-062,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"First, HDB has a two-stage lift procurement process which takes into account the quality and reliability of lift contractors. At the first stage, lift contractors must meet a minimum criteria set by HDB - including the performance and track record of their proposed brand of lift. At the second stage, proposals are evaluated further with the Price-Quality Method (PQM), in which attributes such as the lift contractor's performance, safety performance, and again, lift performance are taken into consideration.",2,1045,2016-11-07-T-062-S-01045
2016-11-07-T-062,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Second, before a lift is commissioned and turned on for operation, it is put under a series of checks and tests that are supervised by a third party Authorised Examiner. This is a regulatory requirement. To better ascertain the quality of lift installation and performance, HDB also conducts (i) an independent audit of key safety features; and (ii) a stress test of 1,000 start-stop operations. These additional tests are over and above existing regulatory requirements.",3,1046,2016-11-07-T-062-S-01046
2016-11-07-T-062,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Third, after the lift is commissioned, HDB's term contracts provide for a one-year Defects Liability Period (DLP) – during which HDB imposes a requirement of not more than one lift breakdown per 10 lifts per month.

In addressing lift faults, HDB takes a targeted approach to address the root causes of the issue. In the case of Block 17B Circuit Road, the high number of door-related faults in its new lifts abated after the lift company made adjustments such that the door is less susceptible to misalignment caused by lift users.",7,1050,2016-11-07-T-062-S-01050

2016-11-07-T-062,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Ms Sun has also suggested for HDB to consider designating one lift in each HDB block for renovation or moving purposes. HDB had previously conducted a pilot by designating a passenger lift in HDB blocks as a ‘service lift’. However, due to unbalanced usage patterns, the average waiting time for lift users increased significantly. This may bring about more frustration and inconvenience for residents.",9,1052,2016-11-07-T-062-S-01052

2016-11-07-T-073,Lim Swee Say,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Personal loans are usually extended by an employer to the foreign domestic worker (FDW) to help the FDW pay placement fees to the local Employment Agency (EA). Our EA Licence Conditions require EAs to state their refund policies in their contracts with employers, including refunds for loans given by employers for the placement fee. Therefore, if the FDW terminates her employment prematurely, employers should check the contract they signed with their EA. The contract will lay out whether and under what circumstances they can get a full or partial refund.",1,1102,2016-11-07-T-073-S-01102

2016-11-07-T-080,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Police officers are trained to respond to cases of attempted suicide with sensitivity and compassion. Persons who attempt suicide are emotionally and psychologically distressed. When responding to such cases, Police’s priority is to ensure the person’s safety. Police officers will look out for signs of suicidal tendencies, and what actions to take. Police usually arrest persons for attempting suicide in order to prevent them from doing harm, either to themselves or to others. In these cases, the Police officers will make an assessment and apply handcuffs when there is a need to ensure the safety of the person, the escorting officers or members of public in the vicinity; or to prevent the person from absconding.",1,1133,2016-11-07-T-080-S-01133

Police do not maintain data on the number of persons referred to the IMH, or to the SOS. However, only two out of 1096 cases of attempted suicide reported in 2015 were eventually prosecuted. The purpose of arrest is primarily to ensure that the person receives the appropriate help, and not to bring charges. For persons who are brought back to the Police station, Police will not detain them longer than is necessary to investigate the case and to process the necessary referrals. The actual duration of detention depends on the circumstances of each case.",2,1134,2016-11-07-T-080-S-01134

2016-11-07-T-081,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In some situations, payment of ransom, for kidnapping, could be an offence under the Kidnapping Act. Beyond that, payment of ransom, for example, to be free from some other threat, is generally not an offence.",1,1136,2016-11-07-T-081-S-01136
2016-11-07-T-081,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"There is a trend on the internet, termed as ""ransomware"", where a cybercriminal locks the victim’s files, computer system or mobile device and restricts its access, until a ransom is paid.",2,1137,2016-11-07-T-081-S-01137
2016-11-07-T-081,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"While it is generally not an offence to pay ransom to a cybercriminal who deploys ransomware on the victim’s computer or device, victims are nevertheless advised not to pay the perpetrator.

2016-11-07-T-082,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Police believe that the Jurong West market fire on 11 October 2016 was caused by arson. Police have arrested a male Chinese. He has been charged. Investigations at the incident site revealed that fire was set to several styrofoam and cardboard boxes at two different stalls. As a result, the fire spread quickly from these two areas to the other parts of the market. The fire was set probably at about 2.30am in the morning. The SCDF received multiple 995 calls about the fire at 2.42am and arrived within six minutes. By 4.26am, the fire was fully extinguished. The property damage was extensive and three residents who had breathing difficulties were conveyed to hospital.",1,1141,2016-11-07-T-082-S-01141
2016-11-07-T-082,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The SCDF adopts a risk-based approach in prescribing mandatory fire safety requirements for building premises. Automatic fire sprinklers have not been a requirement for all buildings. Such systems are useful in controlling fire spread in higher risk premises, such as those with a large open floor area of more than 4,000 square metres, high-rise enclosed buildings of more than 24 metres in height, or enclosed basements. It has not been mandatory for wet markets like the Jurong West market, which are not enclosed and are designed to be well ventilated.",2,1142,2016-11-07-T-082-S-01142

In Budget 2016, we launched the SME Working Capital Loan (WCL) to help local enterprises access unsecured working capital financing during this period of slower economic growth. Under the WCL, enterprises can access a loan quantum of up to $300,000 for their daily operations. There has been a strong take-up for the WCL, and over $400 million in loans have been given to SMEs to-date.",4,1162,2016-11-07-T-086-S-01162
2016-11-07-T-086,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The 12 SME Centres provide first-stop assistance through one-to-one advice and guidance to SMEs, spanning immediate needs as well as business plans for the medium term. From this year onwards (2016), the SME Centres will focus on enhancing business capabilities and driving the adoption of solutions, to ensure that the assistance provided translates to tangible business outcomes for the SMEs. Through the SME Centres, SMEs have access to support schemes across government agencies. This includes support for capability development and internationalisation. To help more companies with capability development, SPRING introduced a simplified Capability Development Grant (CDG) application process for grants below $30,000 in 2015 to encourage more companies to take the first step to upgrade their capabilities in areas such as productivity, financial management and human capital development. The response to this move has been positive. As at October 2016, more than 2,000 CDG projects have been approved.",5,1163,2016-11-07-T-086-S-01163
2016-11-07-T-086,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Our TACs also play an important role as partners in providing assistance to SMEs. For example, through the TAC-led Collaborative Industry Projects (CIPs), TACs will identify and drive the adoption of solutions to address common industry-specific needs. Since the launch of the programme in 2016, five TACs have embarked on projects which are expected to benefit 600 SMEs.",6,1164,2016-11-07-T-086-S-01164

This is an online application platform for businesses to apply for grants across different Government agencies. Through the BGP, businesses can easily find the relevant grants to support their business needs, without the need to approach multiple agencies. The beta version of the BGP was launched on 3 May 2016 with IE Singapore’s Market Readiness Assistance (MRA) grant and subsequently BCA's Building Information Modelling (BIM) grant, and over 900 applications have been received thus far. The BGP will be launched soon, and businesses can expect more grants to be introduced onto the BGP progressively.",7,1165,2016-11-07-T-086-S-01165

Due to site constraints, HDB is unable to construct more parking lots at these two carparks.
