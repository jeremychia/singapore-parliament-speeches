2017-02-28-T-001,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills)),"Besides discovering one's career interest and identifying skills gaps, individuals can also view and apply for jobs via the Jobs Bank, which will be integrated into the ILP. Jobs listed in the Jobs Bank are regularly updated as each job posting is only valid for a maximum period of 30 days. Employers can renew expired job postings, assuming suitable candidates are not found. Job postings that have expired are automatically removed. This ensures that the list of available jobs in the Jobs Bank is up-to-date.",4,5,2017-02-28-T-001-S-00005

2017-02-28-T-002,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),I thank the Parliamentary Secretary. I would like to enquire what is the process to obtain feedback from the trainees about their experience for the programme.,1,12,2017-02-28-T-002-S-00012
2017-02-28-T-002,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for the supplementary question. The trainers, even the lecturers, have a close engagement with the students and participants, and at the end of it, they would also obtain feedback from the participants. We also work with the companies to see how we can get feedback, and at the same time, to better and improve the service delivery of the training institutes, as well as how we can enhance the learning experience of the participants.",1,13,2017-02-28-T-002-S-00013
2017-02-28-T-002,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I would like to enquire how does the Ministry ensure that what the trainee goes for during the programme, is an add-on to what he or she has learnt in school, that it is really Earn and Learn, in the sense that they are learning on top of what they have learnt in school.",1,14,2017-02-28-T-002-S-00014
2017-02-28-T-002,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"It is a developmental process whereby we make sure what they learn is also linked to what they are doing at their workplace. It is not only about looking at what they have learnt, but also what they are going to do, what they are doing and at the same time, we cannot run from the fact that there are certain basic things that we need to remind them, and to link to what they had learnt before. It is an integral and integrated process whereby we want to manage the whole process of learning seamlessly.",1,15,2017-02-28-T-002-S-00015
2017-02-28-T-002,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his clarification. While ELP has been important to bringing new talent into the industries, but there has been union feedback that the entry pay for some of these industries are not attractive, thereby limiting the attractiveness of ELPs, as a whole. Will the Ministry consider, in the upcoming ELPs, to allow greater parity and for the pay to catch up with market conditions?",1,16,2017-02-28-T-002-S-00016
2017-02-28-T-002,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"I thank Mr Desmond Choo for the feedback. We will take it back. As Members know, the ELP is a new initiative. We will learn along the way and we are committed to improving the arrangements as well as how we can make the ELP more attractive to the participants.",1,17,2017-02-28-T-002-S-00017
2017-02-28-T-003,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked	 the Minister for National Development (a) what impact did algae blooms and the recent oil spill have on AVA's target for locally farmed fish to comprise 15% of local fish consumption; (b) what measures are taken to help coastal fish farmers cope with the aftermath of these events; and (c) what measures are taken to help fish farmers change their production methods so that they are more efficient and less susceptible to algae blooms and oil spills.,1,18,2017-02-28-T-003-S-00018
2017-02-28-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"Mdm Speaker, plankton blooms and the recent oil spill have impacted some local fish farmers. However, these events have not detracted from our push to achieve 15% local production. Local fish production increased from 4,205 tonnes in 2014 or 8% of local consumption, to 4,851 tonnes in 2016 or 10% of local consumption. Having said that, I would add that AVA is currently reviewing the longer term targets for local food production, and working with industry and various stakeholders to develop concepts towards transforming the local farming industry.",1,19,2017-02-28-T-003-S-00019
2017-02-28-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"The Government assisted the affected farms following these plankton bloom and oil spill events. After the plankton blooms in 2014 and 2015, AVA extended subsidies to help affected farms to restock their fish. During the oil spill, AVA deployed oil absorbent pads and canvas to protect our farms. AVA is now assisting affected farmers with their claims against the ship's insurers.",2,20,2017-02-28-T-003-S-00020
2017-02-28-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"AVA has put in place several measures to help our farmers manage longer term environmental risks. First, AVA has developed a real-time online water quality monitoring system that our farmers can access through their mobile phones. This helps them monitor water quality information like plankton counts and dissolved oxygen. AVA also provides SMS alerts to farmers when adverse conditions are detected so that precautionary measures can be taken.",3,21,2017-02-28-T-003-S-00021
2017-02-28-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"Second, AVA continues to assist farmers in tailoring individual contingency plans. To-date, almost 50 farms have worked with AVA to develop customised contingency plans to mitigate adverse conditions.",4,22,2017-02-28-T-003-S-00022
2017-02-28-T-003,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"Third, AVA has used the Co-Innovation Partnership Programme to co-fund the development and adoption of new farming technologies like closed containment aquaculture systems (CCAS). These technologies reduce the vulnerability of fish stocks to environmental risks. Several farms have already adopted these systems and AVA continues to share these technologies with the rest of the industry through briefings and workshops.",5,23,2017-02-28-T-003-S-00023
2017-02-28-T-003,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for his very detailed reply. Just a few supplementary questions. Were there any affected farmers who did not avail themselves to the help that was given, and if so, is AVA aware of the reasons why, and is AVA looking into that? Secondly, in terms of achieving the target for production of fish locally, is the AVA also looking into vertical farming or urban farming, and will that also contribute to the target, and are there some measures in place to have that complement the coastal fish farming and other types of fish farming? Thirdly, is AVA exploring the possibility of deploying insurance products to help in risk-pooling among the farmers? I am not sure if there is a possibility but has that been explored with the insurance sector and with the farms?",1,24,2017-02-28-T-003-S-00024
2017-02-28-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"I thank the Member for his three supplementary questions. For the first, I do not have the details as to who did not avail themselves of help. AVA, in the aftermath of both events, went out to all the farms, and reached out to all the affected farms. As far as the oil spill is concerned, they went to all the farms in the eastern area and offered absorbent pads and canvas to help them screen off their stock. I am not sure if we are in a position to know who needed help and did not ask for it, and why they did not request for assistance. But AVA proactively offered help. If the Member is aware of any farmer who did not seek assistance but requires it, please let us know.",1,25,2017-02-28-T-003-S-00025
2017-02-28-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The second question was on vertical farming of fish. If the Member would be interested to know, there is a Tropical Marine Science Institute (TMSI) on St John's Island under NUS and they work with AVA to explore various technologies and innovations that can help our fish farming industry progress and be more productive. I do not know specifically for a fact whether vertical fish farming is being contemplated. But AVA is exploring with TMSI and other relevant institutes and agencies to explore various options for fish farmers to enhance their productivity.",2,26,2017-02-28-T-003-S-00026
2017-02-28-T-003,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"On the third question of insurance, a couple of years back, I did visit some fish farms and they did raise the issue of insurance to protect their stock. I think we start from measures that the fish farmers can put in place to protect their stock and these measures need to be seen in the light of what AVA offers, for example, close containment of cultured systems, and other measures to help them protect their stock, out at sea, for instance. Once they have put that in place, then, looking at the question of insurance, something that AVA is actively looking at. It is not a straightforward matter because you need to have an adequate risk pool, and insurers need to be assured that the farmers take appropriate self-help measures to reduce the risks. But certainly, that is something that is being actively looked at.",3,27,2017-02-28-T-003-S-00027
2017-02-28-T-004,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked	 the Minister for National Development (a) for each year in the past three years, how much does the Ministry spend on culling dogs, cats and monkeys respectively; (b) whether the Ministry expects an increase in culling expenditure in the next three years; (c) whether the Ministry has conducted scientific research on the effectiveness of culling on population control; and (d) whether the Ministry is conducting scientific research into measures other than culling to address the human-animal conflicts.",1,28,2017-02-28-T-004-S-00028
2017-02-28-T-004,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"Madam, AVA takes a multi-pronged approach, involving various stakeholders, to manage the animal population and mitigate health and safety concerns.",1,29,2017-02-28-T-004-S-00029
2017-02-28-T-004,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"It first undertakes a professional assessment of potential threats that animals might pose to public health and safety. If there are no significant public health and safety concerns, AVA will work with the public to mitigate any potential nuisance issues. If there are significant health and safety concerns, then AVA will have to act. Where feasible, it will work with stakeholders, including the animal welfare groups and organisations like Wildlife Reserves Singapore, to relocate or rehome these animals. Culling is used only as a last resort, a point which my colleague Minister of State Koh Poh Koon had made at the last Sitting.",2,30,2017-02-28-T-004-S-00030
2017-02-28-T-004,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),AVA does not track the expenditure it incurs on culling animals as this is only a very small part of AVA's overall work.,3,31,2017-02-28-T-004-S-00031
2017-02-28-T-004,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"AVA will continue to conduct relevant studies and research to inform its policies and facilitate a science-based approach to animal management. For example, AVA engaged a team of local and overseas academics in November 2015 to start a three-year stray dog study. This study will estimate the stray dog population in Singapore, look at the ecological and biological aspects of stray dogs, and determine the efficacy of various population management options like sterilisation. AVA has also been carrying out similar studies on birds, as well as conducting trials to test the effectiveness of various bird deterrent methods. Our animal welfare groups are also pitching in. For example, conducting sterilisation on Pulau Ubin as well as Jurong Island.",4,32,2017-02-28-T-004-S-00032
2017-02-28-T-004,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"We also need the community to do their part in helping to reduce potential animal-human conflicts in our society. For example, if everyone practises responsible pet ownership and refrains from feeding strays, the number of stray animals will fall and present a much smaller problem. AVA has been and will continue to work with various animal welfare groups on public education for responsible pet ownership.",5,33,2017-02-28-T-004-S-00033
2017-02-28-T-004,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply and I also thank him for starting the study of stray dogs in Singapore. I am looking forward to the results of that study.",1,34,2017-02-28-T-004-S-00034
2017-02-28-T-004,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I have three points of clarification. One, can the Senior Minister of State clarify how much does AVA pay the contractors for each dog, cat or monkey caught? Second, the Senior Minister of State mentioned about the professional assessment. Can I check who does these assessments as well as how they are actually conducted? Thirdly, and a point which is in the Parliamentary Question (PQ), can the Senior Minister of State clarify whether AVA expects an increase in expenditure for culling over the next three years?",2,35,2017-02-28-T-004-S-00035
2017-02-28-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Madam, for the first question, I do not have specific figures for each type of animal that the Member mentioned but I am aware that the total budget for animal management operations for 2016 was $800,000.",1,36,2017-02-28-T-004-S-00036
2017-02-28-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The second question is about how AVA does the assessment. AVA officers will conduct the assessment. They will look at the nature of the complaint or feedback and verify the facts. Surveillance, whether by AVA officers or by the deployment of cameras, is also often used. Information on the population of animals, their activities, their proximity to human habitation and their interactions with humans factor into these assessments. Taken together, this information informs AVA's responses.",2,37,2017-02-28-T-004-S-00037
2017-02-28-T-004,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As for the Member's third question about whether AVA expects expenditure to increase in the coming years, I do not think we are able to project. It depends on the risks and whether human-animal conflicts rise or fall, and whether public education helps mitigate that along with the animal welfare groups' efforts in working with us to rehome animals.",3,38,2017-02-28-T-004-S-00038
2017-02-28-T-005,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"asked	 the Minister for Health (a) in the past five years, how many reports of excessive charging by doctors in private practice have been received by the Ministry; (b) whether there is a trend of doctors abusing their patients' medical insurance coverage by overcharging them; and (c) what measures can be taken to regulate such a practice.",1,39,2017-02-28-T-005-S-00039
2017-02-28-T-005,Lam Pin Min,The Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Health),"Mdm Speaker, MOH receives feedback on a variety of issues, including on doctor fees and charges. Occasionally, there are cases relating to alleged over-charging.",1,40,2017-02-28-T-005-S-00040
2017-02-28-T-005,Lam Pin Min,The Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Health),"Doctors are ethically responsible for charging fair and reasonable fees to their patients. The Singapore Medical Council (SMC) Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines (ECEG) requires doctors to charge reasonably and ensure that their fees are transparent and made known to patients in advance. The SMC can take disciplinary action against errant doctors who do not meet these requirements, and has done so before.",2,41,2017-02-28-T-005-S-00041
2017-02-28-T-005,Lam Pin Min,The Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Health),"MOH is working with healthcare providers on ways to improve fee transparency. MOH has published ""Total Hospital Bill"" data for common conditions and ""Total Operation Fees"" for common surgical procedures for both public and private hospitals. MOH also requires all hospitals to provide patients with financial counselling upon admission. In the outpatient setting, MOH requires all GP and dental clinics under the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) to issue itemised bills to CHAS patients, from January this year. These measures ensure more fee transparency and enable patients to make more informed decisions.",3,42,2017-02-28-T-005-S-00042
2017-02-28-T-005,Lam Pin Min,The Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Health),MOH is also studying the recommendations from the Health Insurance Task Force (HITF) relating to over-charging.,4,43,2017-02-28-T-005-S-00043

2017-02-28-T-005,K Thanaletchimi,Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member),"Madam, I have two supplementary questions. One on the role of community pharmacists. A lot of times in the GP clinics, the highest cost burden for the patient is the prescription cost, medication cost. Is the Ministry considering expanding the role of community pharmacists where pharmacists are given the prescribing rights as well as able are to provide cost effective medication for the patients?",1,45,2017-02-28-T-005-S-00045
2017-02-28-T-005,K Thanaletchimi,Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member),The second question is  will the Minister consider having survey outcomes listed on the website for GPs that provide general common ailments and how much they charge the patients?,2,46,2017-02-28-T-005-S-00046
2017-02-28-T-005,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank Ms Thanaletchimi for the two supplementary questions. On the role of community pharmacists, MOH does study the role of community pharmacists, focusing more on the areas of public education such as educating patients on prevention of certain diseases as well as the proper use of certain medications. However, with regard to prescription rights, this is one area that MOH will have to seriously consider the pros and cons, because we do receive feedback from patients that when they see a doctor and collect their prescriptive medicine from the doctor, it adds to a lot of convenience, rather than to have them to travel to a pharmacy elsewhere to buy the medication.",1,47,2017-02-28-T-005-S-00047
2017-02-28-T-005,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"With regard to publishing the fees of GPs, this is an area that MOH is currently looking into.",2,48,2017-02-28-T-005-S-00048
2017-02-28-T-005,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I have two supplementary questions. I think the Minister of State did not answer on my question of how many reports were received in the last five years for excessive charging by doctors.",1,49,2017-02-28-T-005-S-00049
2017-02-28-T-005,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"The second supplementary question is  besides overcharging them, I also receive feedback from residents that doctors issue non-standard drugs to the Pioneer Generation (PG), which they have to pay out of their own pocket. I would like to ask whether the Ministry monitors the issuance of non-standard drugs, or any substitution can be done, so that it does not cost a strain on residents' pockets.",2,50,2017-02-28-T-005-S-00050
2017-02-28-T-005,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank Er Dr Lee for the two supplementary questions. On the first clarification on the data collected, I would like to inform the Member that due to the change in data collection system and the classification of bill-related feedback, we are unable to compare accurately the figures year-on-year over the past five years. However, for the data collected over the past two years, there was an average of about 160 cases of bill-related feedback from both the public as well as the private medical institutions. In 2016, 23 cases received through emails were specific to overcharging, of which 90% are private medical institution related. Ten percent are public healthcare institutions.",1,51,2017-02-28-T-005-S-00051
2017-02-28-T-005,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"With regard to the Member's second question on the appropriateness of prescribing non-standard drugs, I would just like to remind and also reiterate that doctors should and must prescribe appropriately, and it should be in the interest and well-being of the patients and not for personal financial gains. For patients, especially PG patients who need to be on non-standard drugs and who cannot afford the cost of the medication, there is always the Medication Assistance Fund, which helps these eligible patients to pay for expensive drugs that are not in the standard list. I want to encourage these patients if they do encounter any difficulty in their medication bills, to apply for the Medication Assistance Fund. I would also like to inform the Member that MOH has also set up an Agency for Care Effectiveness (ACE). This agency issues guidelines on the use of cost effective drugs for treatment of common medical conditions, and these will be implemented in time to come.",2,52,2017-02-28-T-005-S-00052
2017-02-28-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Madam, just two supplementary questions. The first is  on the expanded role of pharmacists, I think the suggestion is for the pharmacists to be alternatives to doctors to prescribe simple medicine. For example, in Europe, many pharmacists are confident prescribing medicine for, say, common colds, simple symptoms, as long as you tell them you have no drug allergies.",1,53,2017-02-28-T-005-S-00053
2017-02-28-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The second is a suggestion to also consider, perhaps, expanding the role of nurse practitioners to deal with common complaints, because I suspect a very large part of the GPs' load is with very standard ailments, which an experienced nurse practitioner could also handle, and both of these would probably reduce cost for patients.",2,54,2017-02-28-T-005-S-00054
2017-02-28-T-005,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank the Member for the two supplementary questions. For the one on community pharmacists, yes, currently, pharmacists are already allowed to prescribe certain drugs.

2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Let me first touch on broadening the grace period provision for patent applications. To provide some background, let me briefly describe IPOS' patent search and examination process.",8,87,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00087
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Before a patent is granted for an invention, it must be ""new"" and ""inventive"". An IPOS examiner searches publicly available information at the time of the patent application to understand the current state of technology. This is known as the ""state of the art"". The examiner then examines the invention in the patent application against the ""state of the art"" to determine whether the invention is, indeed, new and inventive. This is the standard practice for all patent offices around the world.",9,88,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00088
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Under this system, if an inventor publicly discloses his invention before applying for a patent, this information will form part of the ""state of the art"". So, when he subsequently applies for a patent, the invention may not be assessed to be new or inventive.",10,89,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00089
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The Patents Act contains a ""grace period provision"" that allows for limited circumstances under which the disclosure of an invention will not be considered part of the ""state of the art"". For example, if the invention is disclosed at one of the international exhibitions on a limited list, or is disclosed in the publication of a learned society, it will not be included in the ""state of the art"" if the application is filed within 12 months of the disclosure.",11,90,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00090
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),This grace period provision encourages knowledge sharing and promotes learning while preserving the inventor's commercial interests.,12,91,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00091
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Clause 2 of the Patents (Amendment) Bill expands the situations covered by the grace period provision.

In other words, the grace period provision will not be limited to disclosures at specific international exhibitions or in a learned society publication.",13,92,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00092
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"This broadening of the grace period provision is in line with practices in the US, Australia, Japan and Korea. It updates our legislation so that our patents regime can be more consistent with modern realities and practices.",14,93,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00093
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Advances in communication technology have connected people across the globe in ways not previously envisaged, and disclosures of technology occur in many situations not contemplated by the current Act. For example, inventors may need to reveal the invention to potential investors, or share it online to reach out to a larger community of experts. It should be emphasised that disclosing an invention before applying for a patent still carries risks. Not all jurisdictions have a similarly broad grace period provision. We would, therefore, strongly encourage inventors to always be judicious about disclosing their inventions before applying for a patent. IPOS will work with stakeholders and IP professionals to ensure that this message is conveyed clearly to patent applicants.",15,94,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00094
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),I now turn to the amendments in clause 3 of the present Bill relating to the closure of the foreign route to obtaining a patent in Singapore.

2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"In 2013, IPOS' in-house patent examination unit commenced operations, marking the first time Singapore had the capabilities to examine our patent applications. In February 2014, we tightened our patent system to only allow a patent to be granted if it meets the patentability requirements in our law.",17,96,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00096
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"However, at that point of time, we allowed patent applicants to rely on foreign examination reports for the same invention to enter our system. We are now proposing to close this route so that all patent applications are fully examined by our examiners against our standards of patentability. This will increase the quality of our granted patents and marks the further maturation of our patent system.",18,97,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00097
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),Let me explain how closing the foreign route improves the quality of patents granted in Singapore. Patent applications undergo search and examination before a patent is granted. There are currently three search and examination routes in Singapore,19,98,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00098
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"First, under the ""local route"", the full search and examination is conducted by IPOS.",20,99,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00099
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Second, under the ""mixed route"", applicants submit the search report issued by the foreign patent office for the same invention, and IPOS conducts only the examination.",21,100,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00100
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Third, under the ""foreign route"", applicants submit the full search and examination report issued by a foreign patent office for the same invention, and IPOS conducts only a limited-scope Supplementary Examination.",22,101,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00101
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The limited-scope Supplementary Examination does not cover the same grounds as a full examination. In particular, the invention is not assessed on the key requirements of being new and inventive. Thus, patents may be granted under the foreign route for inventions that would not have met the standards for patentability under the local or mixed route. This is because these foreign route patents were assessed to be new and inventive by a foreign patent office, whose standards may differ from Singapore's.",23,102,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00102
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Clause 3(a) of the present Bill, therefore, closes the foreign route option. For patent applications filed on or after the prescribed date, they must go through either the local or mixed route. Patents will be granted only after full examination based on Singapore's laws and practices. This will, therefore, ensure the quality of Singapore granted patents and increase stakeholders' confidence in the validity of these patents.",24,103,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00103
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"This amendment aligns our patent system with that of major jurisdictions, such as the US, Japan and Europe, who do not provide for the foreign route mechanism and require all patent applications to be fully examined by their patent offices.",25,104,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00104
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"IPOS has been actively engaging the patent profession on the closure of the foreign route. With this change, local patent agents and IP lawyers will adjust their practice to take on higher value work as all the patent applications they handle will have to undergo full examination by IPOS.",26,105,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00105
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),The Patents (Amendment) Bill will also implement procedural improvements to the application process.

This will make our patent application process more applicant-friendly.,27,106,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00106
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Clause 3(d) will allow IPOS to treat an application as abandoned if the applicant does not, after receiving a search report, request for an examination report within the prescribed time frame.

2017-02-28-T-013,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),This Bill broadly seeks to  (i) ensure the high standard of Singapore's patents by the closure of the foreign route; and (ii) broaden the grace period for the determination of novelty.,8,117,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00117
2017-02-28-T-013,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Firstly, clause 3 of the Bill marks the closure of the foreign route. Under that foreign route, Singapore relies on the search and examination report of other countries and does a supplementary examination. This second, all­foreign, route is based on the reliance on the final results of the search and examination report of a corresponding application, corresponding international application, or related national phase application. It works on the presumption that the reports are reliable and accurate. But, to ensure the quality of patents, it is better, if not much better, if we conduct the substantive evaluation ourselves.",9,118,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00118
2017-02-28-T-013,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Having said this, we should not underestimate the load. Instead, we should approach the task with a large amount of preparation. On this related issue, could the Minister kindly elaborate on what has been done to ensure that even with the closure of the foreign route, Singapore will continue to be an attractive place, and an attractive financial place to file patents.

2017-02-28-T-013,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"A second amendment is to be found in clause 2 of this Bill. That clause seeks to broaden the grace period for the determination of novelty. This allows the inventor to disclose information without jeopardising his patent application. As a result, inventors may very well be able to attract investors or publish scientific papers without needing to wait for a patent. This gives innovation a safe space in which innovators can seek funding without compromising the protection of their inventions.",11,120,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00120

However, this cannot be done without a reliable regulatory framework in the form of IP laws.",12,121,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00121
2017-02-28-T-013,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"This Bill is one such law. It will further consolidate Singapore's position as an IP Hub and, Mdm Speaker, I therefore support it.",13,122,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00122
2017-02-28-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Mdm Speaker, Singapore has come a long way from being described as ""the piracy capital of the world"" in the 1980s, to having an Intellectual Property regime that is consistently ranked in international surveys as one of the best in the world.",1,123,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00123
2017-02-28-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I rise in support of these amendments which balances strengthening the IP rights regime which encourages investment in R&D and innovation, while recognising that excessive protection of products or services that are not truly novel can hinder innovation and entrepreneurship.",2,124,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00124
2017-02-28-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"This Bill discontinues the supplementary examination route and requires at least the examination to be done in Singapore. This creates a more rigorous check on the quality of patents, and ensures that successful patents are truly deserving of legal protection.",3,125,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00125
2017-02-28-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I also welcome the new section 14(4)(e) which broadens the 12-month ""grace period"" exception to determining whether an invention is novel, as this takes into account business needs and practical realities.",4,126,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00126
2017-02-28-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"First, it is entirely plausible for a would-be inventor to disclose details of his invention in reasonable circumstances outside the narrow exceptions listed in section 14(4) to (7). Previous case law has set a high standard that novelty would be ruined as long as even one member of the public has unrestricted use of the information. This is problematic especially where would-be inventors, in their excitement or by slip of tongue, informally discuss details of the invention with family members or close friends. The heavy penalty of unpatentability and the wastage of months or years of working worth large sums of money is unfair, and the law should be flexible enough to allow for such minor disclosures to be excused.",5,127,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00127
2017-02-28-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Second, the two narrow exceptions for prior disclosure, namely display at an international exhibition or by description in a paper read before a learned society, are unduly restrictive. It is conceivable that would-be inventors make disclosures that are entirely reasonable for their professions, especially in the scientific fields. For example, scientists often give journalistic interviews or write scientific journals on laboratory breakthroughs that they have discovered, even before commercialisation of a product from the said discovery. Such disclosures are commonplace in STEM academia, where articles in prestigious journals could determine the standing of a scientist in his community. To have no invention patentable from such a disclosure would unfairly impose a period of silence on the scientist, who may only publicly disclose his breakthrough until after the date of patent filing.",6,128,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00128
2017-02-28-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I wish to raise just one point for clarification. The new section 14(4)(e) refers to ""disclosure of matter constituting an invention to the public"" while existing sections 14(4)(a) to (d) merely refer to ""disclosure"". Can the Senior Minister of State clarify if there is any substantive difference in terms of what amounts to disclosure between the wording in section 14(4)(a) to (d), and that of 14(4)(e)? Do we retain the common law understanding that disclosure even to one person not under an obligation of confidence constitutes disclosure to the public?",7,129,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00129
2017-02-28-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Mdm Speaker, the amendments are welcomed changes, which create a patent landscape conducive for Singapore's transformation into an innovative economy. I look forward to more local innovators taking advantage of and flourishing under our robust intellectual property protection regime.",8,130,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00130
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Members who have spoken, for their support of the Bill. Mr de Souza asked about initiatives to ensure that Singapore remains an attractive place to file patents.

2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"First, there are the various Patent Prosecution Highways (PPHs) that Mr de Souza mentioned. These arrangements cover important markets like China, US, Europe, Japan, Korea and Australia. IPOS is also part of a similar arrangement in ASEAN, known as the ASEAN Patent Examination Co-operation (ASPEC) programme. All in, the PPHs and ASPEC cover more than 30 jurisdictions. IPOS also has an agreement with Cambodia to allow the re-registration of a Singapore patent in Cambodia. Hence, with a Singapore granted patent, a business can access a combined market of over 20 million people.",2,132,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00132
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"In February, IPOS also announced reductions in its patent search and examination fees. The fee for requesting a search and examination report will decrease by 25% with effect from 1 April. A further discount will be given when the applicant chooses to rely on the search report or preliminary examination report issued by IPOS as an International Searching Authority (ISA) and Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA) under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). All these connections to larger markets outside Singapore are aimed at making Singapore an attractive place to file patents.",3,133,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00133
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"In addition, we are also positioning Singapore to capture patent work, even when applicants are looking to file patents in other jurisdictions, and not in Singapore.

2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Besides Singapore, IPOS can do this PCT examination work for applicants from US, Japan, Mexico, Indonesia, Vietnam and Cambodia. Further, given the large Chinese market, IPOS' ability to search Chinese patent documents can be an additional attraction for these PCT applicants. Through these measures, IPOS hopes to attract patent work to Singapore, even in cases where an applicant might decide not to file in Singapore. This will create more work for IP professionals, such as patent agents.",5,135,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00135
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr de Souza also asked whether we are adequately resourced to handle the increased workload from applicants switching to the local mixed routes  yes, we are. There are two aspects to this. First, MinLaw and IPOS will continue to ensure that there is a sufficient pipeline of skilled IP manpower to provide patent agent services. In this regard, IPOS and UniSIM have announced the launch of a Master in IP and Innovation Management this year. Graduates from the patent agent specialisation track of this programme can go on to take the Patent Agents Qualifying Examinations to become patent agents.",6,136,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00136

2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"From PCT statistics, IPOS is the top, out of 21 international authorities, in terms of timeliness to issue International Search Reports.",8,138,2017-02-28-T-013-S-00138
2017-02-28-T-013,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Ng had a point for clarification regarding the new section 14(4)(e) inserted by clause 2(b) of the Bill. Sections 14(4)(a) to (e) each describes different circumstances of disclosure to the public that are to be disregarded during the determination of the ""state of the art"" which the examiner considers in assessing whether the invention is ""new"" and ""inventive"". Section 14(4)(e) is intended to extend the circumstances of disclosure that are to be disregarded beyond those stated in the current section 14(4)(a) to 14(4)(d). For all the grounds in section 14(4)(a) to (e), disclosure even to one person not under the obligation of confidentiality constitutes disclosure to the public.

2017-02-28-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Hence, we need to amend the Architects Act to facilitate our locally registered architects to provide architectural services overseas.

2017-02-28-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"The need for such domestic recognition is a standard feature of the mutual recognition arrangements we have currently with various jurisdictions. For example, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand have a Trilateral Agreement under the APEC Architect Framework. Singapore has also signed the ASEAN Mutual Recognition Arrangement on Architectural Services with other ASEAN member countries. Such a domestic recognition allows for the qualifications and experience obtained by an architect in the country or territory where he or she is already registered to be recognised by the participating overseas jurisdictions. This will make it easier for Singapore-registered architects to practise abroad in a participating jurisdiction and will open up opportunities for them overseas.",9,153,2017-02-28-T-014-S-00153

The new section 15A provides for the recognition of local registered architects who intend to supply or offer to supply architectural services in any participating jurisdiction. For anyone, including foreign architects who are seeking registration under section 15(1)(a) and 15(1)(b) to practise in Singapore, the qualifications recognised by the BOA are already listed on its website. They can refer to that for any clarification.",5,187,2017-02-28-T-014-S-00187
2017-02-28-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Mr Louis Ng sought clarifications on the registration process under the new section 15(2A) for foreign architects from a participating jurisdiction. Let me briefly set out what this process entails.,6,188,2017-02-28-T-014-S-00188
2017-02-28-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"First, a foreign architect will need to be qualified and recognised in his/her own country; the original country or territory of registration for mutual recognition, based on the agreed criteria set out in the mutual agreements between the BOA and the registration authority of the participating jurisdiction.",7,189,2017-02-28-T-014-S-00189
2017-02-28-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Following that, the foreign architect will have to pass the examination set by BOA to ensure that he/she has the knowledge of the practice laws, rules and regulations and other conditions of practising in Singapore, and then pay the prescribed fee, before this architect is entitled for registration under the new section 15(2A).",8,190,2017-02-28-T-014-S-00190
2017-02-28-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The need to pass an examination set by the BOA before the foreign architect can seek registration will hence also apply to ASEAN architects recognised under the ASEAN Mutual Recognition Arrangement on Architectural Services. This was the query that Mr Louis Ng asked. So, yes, ASEAN architects will also have to take the exams. And I think with these examinations, that is the way we can ensure standards are not compromised.",9,191,2017-02-28-T-014-S-00191
2017-02-28-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Louis Ng also enquired about penalties for foreign architects who are registered with the BOA under the new section 15(2A), and how we can offer mutual recognition while protecting the profession in Singapore. Perhaps, I would like to explain this in two parts because there are foreign architects who qualify to practise independently in Singapore under the new section 15(2A). These foreign architects who can qualify to practise independently, will be required to maintain a valid practicing certificate and they will be subjected to the same disciplinary procedures and penalties as anyone who is registered under the existing section 15(1) with a valid practicing certificate.",10,192,2017-02-28-T-014-S-00192
2017-02-28-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"At the same time, the offences committed will be reported to the foreign architect's original country or territory of registration, where the relevant authorities there will also follow up with the relevant penalties. So, this is for the first category of foreign architects who can qualify to practise independently.",11,193,2017-02-28-T-014-S-00193
2017-02-28-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,The second category of foreign architects are those who can only practise in collaboration with a local registered architect on a project basis. They will not be issued a practicing certificate by BOA and so they are not Qualified Persons who can offer architectural services independently in Singapore.,12,194,2017-02-28-T-014-S-00194
2017-02-28-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For this category of foreign architects, in the event of a suspected offence, BOA will write to the foreign architect's original country or territory of registration. The foreign architect will then be subjected to the investigation and disciplinary proceedings and relevant penalties imposed by the relevant authorities there.",13,195,2017-02-28-T-014-S-00195
2017-02-28-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"BOA can also reject future applications from such a foreign architect to register for collaborations depending on the seriousness of the offence committed, because a new registration for practising in collaboration with a locally registered architect is required for every new project. So, if an offence is committed, BOA will take that into consideration before issuing any new registration.",14,196,2017-02-28-T-014-S-00196
2017-02-28-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Next, on the increase in penalty which is something Mr Louis Ng asked about. This increase in the maximum penalty is to ensure that there is sufficient deterrence against any potential wrong-doings. In fact, the higher level of penalty has also been benchmarked and is similar to that imposed by other professional boards in the medical and legal professions.",15,197,2017-02-28-T-014-S-00197
2017-02-28-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Both Mr Louis Ng and Ms Thanaletchimi sought clarifications for the new section 31(K), which empowers BOA to appoint investigators to investigate into the commission of an offence under the Act. I would like to explain how this process will work out.",16,198,2017-02-28-T-014-S-00198
2017-02-28-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Under the current Act, BOA will form an investigation committee which will be chaired by a Board member and comprise of two other registered architects with more than 10 years of practising experience, and a layperson. The investigation committee is in charge of evaluating the findings and making a recommendation to the Board on the investigation.",17,199,2017-02-28-T-014-S-00199
2017-02-28-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The new section 31(K) allows BOA to appoint an investigator or more than one investigator to assist the investigation committee, such as assisting to obtain evidences. Such a person may be a retired police officer who is familiar with our laws and knows how to conduct proper investigation and search for evidences.",18,200,2017-02-28-T-014-S-00200
2017-02-28-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,The Board of Architects and the investigation committee will make their own independent decisions and disciplinary decisions after the hearing. But appeals on the Board of Architects' decisions can be made to the Minister. This is an answer to Ms Thanaletchimi's query.,19,201,2017-02-28-T-014-S-00201
2017-02-28-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, I believe that I have addressed the issues raised by the Members. I would like to once again thank them for their support for this Bill. With that, Madam, I beg to move.",20,202,2017-02-28-T-014-S-00202

2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"As part of the Government's commitment to give every child a good start and to make Singapore a great place for families, we have undertaken various efforts to raise the affordability, accessibility and quality of our early childhood sector. In support of this, the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) was established in 2013 to regulate and develop the sector.",1,210,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00210
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"To be effective, ECDA has to work in close partnership with the operators of around 1,800 childcare centres and kindergartens in Singapore. Today, parents of over 165,000 children entrust their children to these centres each day.",2,211,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00211
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Such trust is possible because of committed and passionate teachers, as well as quality centres − and all this is underpinned by a sound and robust regulatory framework that upholds quality.",3,212,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00212
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Regulatory standards underpin the foundation of a good quality pre-school, much like the stacking ring toy that we played with when we were young. The one with the concentric circles, increasingly smaller. We find that in pre-schools today, it is a toy that helps children to develop their fine motor skills, it comes in different colours and so on. The biggest ring is at the base, and it forms a foundation.",4,213,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00213
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The Early Childhood Development Centres (ECDC) Bill seeks exactly to be that strong and reliable base for the sector − to consistently provide good quality programmes that give our young parents peace of mind when it comes to the safety, well-being and development of their children. In short, this Bill will ensure higher and more consistent quality standards across the early childhood sector.",5,214,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00214
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Before I go into the key provisions of the Bill, I wish to thank Members of this House, the early childhood sector and the public for your support and valuable suggestions.",6,215,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00215
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The proposals in the Bill were made through extensive consultations over the past two years with operators, parents, teachers, early childhood experts, industry partners and the general public. Parents that came for ECDA's focus group discussions − I think they came to appreciate and realise the amount of effort that operators and teachers have to put in to ensure that their pre-school is safe and conducive for their children's development. ECDA received strong support on the need to raise centre quality, and we also calibrated our proposals based on the feedback received from the different stakeholders.",7,216,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00216
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, let me now move on to the key provisions of the Bill.",8,217,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00217
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"You will notice that the Bill focuses on early childhood development − we emphasise holistic care and education as an integral part of our children's growth. In this regard, childcare centres and kindergartens will be collectively regulated as ""early childhood development centres"" under a common licensing framework, which this harmonised Bill is better able to support, rather than being separately regulated under the Child Care Centres Act and Education Act, as they are today.",9,218,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00218
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"What this means is that, instead of the current ""lifetime subscription"" model for kindergartens, where they are registered one-off under the Education Act, all centres will now run on the ""renewal subscription"" model, which is already the practice for childcare centres today under the Child Care Centres Act. Centres essentially will be approved to operate for a period of time, and will be re-assessed when they renew their licence tenures. This requires centres to consciously put in effort to maintain their standards to continue their operations for another tenure. Key areas of focus include physical space norms and design, environment safety and hygiene, programme staff quality and of course staff-to-child ratios.",10,219,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00219
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Under the new framework, we will increase the maximum licence tenure to three years, up from the current two years for childcare centres. Better quality centres will be awarded longer licence tenures, and this will incentivise them and encourage them to perform better. The new three-year licence tenure recognises the strong core of centres with consistently good regulatory track records of at least two consecutive two-year licences − this is a substantial portion of childcare centres, at over 500 centres today. ECDA officers will continue to conduct unannounced visits to centres periodically to ensure that centres maintain their standards.",11,220,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00220
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The focus of this Bill is to regulate what we currently define today to be childcare centres and kindergartens. The Bill therefore provides for the exclusion and exemption of premises where specialised services are provided to a niche group. It also excludes centres regulated under other legislations for distinctly different purposes, or operated by or on behalf of the Government, and hence directly accountable to this House. Examples include enrichment centres, standalone foreign system kindergartens, kindergartens affiliated with foreign-system primary schools, or kindergartens by the Ministry of Education. Such entities are currently not under ECDA's purview, and will similarly not come under this new Act.",12,221,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00221
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"As many of us can agree, people, especially teachers, are at the heart of every early childhood development centre. Parts 3 and 4 of the Bill have provisions to enable better and more consistent quality of staff who interact with children, especially early childhood professionals, given their important role during children's formative years.",13,222,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00222
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"For example, the Bill will ensure that all principals and teachers meet the prevailing professional qualification requirements before assuming their appointments.",14,223,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00223
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In addition, all persons working in centres will also need to be approved by ECDA for their suitability before they can start work at centres. This will cover, for example, principals and teachers, cooks and cleaners, as well as enrichment vendor staff. All individuals will be assessed on their track record, especially pertaining to children's safety.",15,224,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00224
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"One benefit of a common regulatory framework across the early childhood sector is a common administrative process to register staff. This facilitates our teachers' movement between childcare centres and kindergartens, which many teachers had called for earlier. I also believe that this regulatory framework will further enhance the professional standing and standards of our early childhood educators.",16,225,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00225
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Nevertheless, my Ministry is very mindful of the manpower and other ground constraints faced by operators. They have given us feedback, and we do understand them. As a regulator, ECDA will strive to ensure that its administrative processes are efficient and that its regulatory requirements are responsive to operators' needs, while ensuring sevice quality and the safety of our children.",17,226,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00226
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"For example, ECDA is exploring allowing non-teaching staff, such as cooks and cleaners, to support trained teachers in supervising outdoor play time. The constant dialogue that we have with the sector must continue, so that the feedback can come back to us and this allows us to calibrate these proposals.",18,227,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00227
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"As with any enterprise, good governance and management are critical success factors for early childhood development centres. Under clause 19, ECDA will continue to prohibit unsuitable persons, such as those with poor regulatory track records, from managing the centre's business as board directors or chief executive officers, et cetera. The new Bill will further prohibit recalcitrant operators, whose licences had been revoked, from operating centres under another proxy. This allows ECDA to prevent such persons from continuing to misdirect centres. ECDA will also penalise licensees for knowingly allowing such unsuitable persons from managing their centre's business. As the operating environment of the early childhood sector is dynamic and needs to be updated from time to time, clause 51 of the Bill will provide for subsidiary legislation to effect more specific operational requirements. This will provide more clarity on the responsibilities of operators and centres.",19,228,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00228
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Under the subsidiary legislation, we intend to enhance some requirements and introduce new ones to raise quality standards. We will continue to consult the sector on this. We will take reference from sector best practices and ECDA's prevailing guidelines. For example, as announced by the NurtureSG Taskforce last week, centres with full-day programmes will need to conduct at least one hour of physical activities daily, up from half-hour currently, and half-hour of which has to be conducted outdoors. Exposure to the outdoors will be beneficial for our children in preventing the early onset of myopia.",20,229,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00229
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Even as we raise standards in the sector, we will streamline certain requirements which are no longer applicable, for greater efficiency − especially those that place unnecessary administrative burden on our teachers. The sector warmly welcomed these proposals when we consulted them earlier this month.",21,230,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00230
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Just as how the Bill provides requirements for the set-up of centres, the Bill also provides requirements for the orderly closure of centres, under clauses 14 and 18. This is in view that, in the past, there had been cases where centres abruptly close. While this has been few, the impact on parents and children involved can be quite significant. Thus, to minimise such occurrences, ECDA will be empowered to require centres to put in place measures to ensure orderly closure. These include giving parents and teachers advance notice of the upcoming service disruption and ceasing the enrolment of new children to the centre.",22,231,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00231
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Operators have worked hard to build the trust of parents by meeting the baseline standards. Today, errant operators form a small minority of the sector but they undermine the hard work of the rest of the sector.",23,232,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00232
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"ECDA takes regulatory breaches seriously and a more comprehensive and graduated penalty framework will enable ECDA to effectively and swiftly enforce requirements to safeguard the safety and well-being of our young children. That is our foremost priority. More importantly, it serves as a deterrence against errant practices and behaviours.",24,233,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00233
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"With this new penalty framework, administrative lapses will be decriminalised and replaced with administrative regulatory sanctions. This will allow us a wider suite of regulatory sanctions ranging from public censures, administrative financial penalties of up to $5,000, a security deposit, remedial measures and a shortening of licence tenure. The type of penalty imposed eventually will depend on the severity of the breach and whether it was a repeated occurrence. The penalty will be proportionate to the breach. At the same time, I would like to reassure operators that ECDA will continue to adopt a measured and developmental approach in enforcing requirements by advising centres to rectify problems.",25,234,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00234
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"One new regulatory sanction I would like to elaborate on is the requirement of a security deposit. I am aware that operators are concerned about this requirement. The current intention is for the security deposit to apply only to the small number of centres with poor track records, such as centres with two consecutive six-month licences, which is the lowest licence standard. This security deposit is intended to spur such centres to raise their standards.",26,235,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00235
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We are also mindful that the security deposit amount should be calibrated appropriately, and not be overly onerous on the centres. We are looking at a $10,000 amount, which is twice the administrative financial penalty amount for contraventions. I encourage centres with a six-month licence to take their regulatory gaps seriously, and to rectify their breaches quickly, so as to avoid being required to put up a security deposit.",27,236,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00236
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"At the same time, the Bill provides for criminal penalty for contraventions which pose more serious risk to the safety and well-being of our children. For example, the operation of unlicensed centres. Under the Bill, such contraventions will incur a fine of up to $10,000 and/or an imprisonment term of up to 12 months. The maximum fine amount has been adjusted to align with recent legislations like the Private Education Act. Certain offences will be made compoundable at up to half of the maximum fine amount under clause 42.",28,237,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00237
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Before ECDA determines any contraventions, its officers will investigate the cases thoroughly and establish the facts from a variety of sources. Very often, a child may be involved in a case, which makes investigations more complex. Hence, ECDA officers will need enhanced investigative powers to effectively carry out their duties under the Bill.",29,238,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00238
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Beyond the current powers to inspect centres, ECDA officers, under clause 37, will be empowered to search centres, interview persons, take photographs and videos of the centre, and obtain the necessary documents from the centre. These are powers similar to those available to other regulators in Singapore. As we put these powers in place, we will establish internal processes to ensure that ECDA officers carry out their investigations fairly.",30,239,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00239
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I have just outlined the broad regulatory framework.

2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"As kindergartens are less familiar with a licensing regime, under clause 54 of the Bill, kindergartens will be given one year from the commencement of the Act to obtain their licences. Since 2015, ECDA has also been conducting sector briefings to explain and consult on the new requirements, as well as conducting customised on-site guidance for kindergartens.",32,241,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00241
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In fact, I understand that actually many kindergartens have already been making adjustments to prepare for the new framework. From my interactions with the sector, I am confident that almost all our operators would be able to meet these requirements.",33,242,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00242
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I believe that clear and appropriate regulatory requirements are crucial in raising standards in the early childhood sector. For example, during my visit to Creative Thinkers Kindergarten in August last year, the principal, Ms Sakinah Dollah shared that a clear, common understanding among the principals, teachers and support staff of ECDA's regulatory requirements will help centres to organise themselves better and to improve.",34,243,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00243
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, to summarise, the Early Childhood Development Centres Bill is an important milestone in raising the quality of early childhood care and education in Singapore, so that we can give every child a good start. It will provide parents with greater confidence that we are making Singapore a great place to raise families.

2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The Bill proposes, first, a common licensing framework for childcare centres and kindergartens. Second, all persons working in centres will need to be approved by ECDA to ensure their suitability to work with young children. In addition, there will also be clearer and more consistent requirements to guide centres in their operations. Finally, the requirements will be enforced through a more comprehensive and graduated enforcement framework with enhanced investigative powers to strengthen ECDA's oversight of the sector. ECDA will also work with centres closely to facilitate a smooth transition.",36,245,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00245

2017-02-28-T-015,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"One of the key provisions in this Bill is for all centres to be licensed. Licensing should improve quality. But we should be mindful of compliance costs. How will ECDA mitigate against centre operators from passing on compliance costs to parents? Right now, the fee variation is significant − from over $600 per month to $2,000 per month in high-end childcare centres. Both Anchor Operator and Partner Operator (POP) schemes are useful in moderating fees. However, fees of others outside of such schemes might continue to rise. Will further steps be taken to moderate the costs by having more centres involved in these schemes? Or should centres justify significant fee increases to ECDA?",2,249,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00249
2017-02-28-T-015,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Mdm Speaker, let me continue in Mandarin.",3,250,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00250
2017-02-28-T-015,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mdm Speaker, many young families have to cope with the high cost of living − anything from daily living expenses, maintenance of parents and expenses to take care of their young children. The cost impact can be quite high for the young parents. Both husband and wife must work to maintain the cost of living. Childcare centres, therefore, have become a necessity for young families. Currently, Singaporeans can enjoy a $300 basic subsidy. From April 2013, the Government provided an additional subsidy for families with income below $7,500. This is at the 40th percentile. From 2011 to 2015, the median fee of a full-time childcare centre has increased 25%, but the subsidy given to middle-income families has remained at $300 since 2008. I urge the Government to give a higher subsidy during this period of economic downturn to mitigate the financial burdens of young parents.",4,251,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00251
2017-02-28-T-015,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"There are also women who cannot take up full-time jobs due to family needs. However, current policies only allow non-working mothers to receive a subsidy of up to $300. While the intention to encourage mothers to go back to work is good, many mothers have no choice but to stay at home, especially those who have to take care of their parents and young children. What is more, there isn't much flexible work in Singapore. These mothers may face even heavier financial burdens. I hope the Government can increase the basic subsidy for non-working mothers, a gesture which can be seen as ""sending coal amidst snow"".",5,252,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00252
2017-02-28-T-015,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"(In English)  Mdm Speaker, let me resume in English. Another aspect of this Bill looks at ensuring holistic care and education of our children. This is critical and laudable. Recent studies show that obesity in school children has risen from 10% in 2000 to 12% in 2014. Our war on obesity and diabetes must start with our young children. The NurtureSG taskforce has given thoughtful and important recommendations. They include ensuring that children have adequate exercise, sleep and healthier food. I hope these recommendations can be adopted widely because healthy lifestyles need to start at a young age. I hope that ECDA will require operators to provide healthy and well-balanced meals for the children under their care.",6,253,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00253
2017-02-28-T-015,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Madam, I would also like to better understand how ECDA intends to support centres in improving their curriculum or standardising core components. Having a ""better"" curriculum certainly goes beyond preparing for primary school education. It is also about life values and developing a love for learning. Because of the centricity of early childhood education to a child's future learning, there would be value in ensuring certain core components are taught in the curriculum. Would ECDA consider such limited standardisation?",7,254,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00254
2017-02-28-T-015,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Improving the curriculum also means that teachers will have to be properly trained and equipped. Since this Bill also provides for teachers to have greater professional standing, what kind of support will ECDA offer to smaller centres that are lacking in manpower and may face challenges in getting their teaching staff to go for courses and further training? Will centre operators also be required to review the salary of their teachers and staff, and consider increasing their salaries as they become more professional?",8,255,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00255
2017-02-28-T-015,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Notwithstanding the above suggestions, the Bill is important and critical for nurturing the next generation of younger Singaporeans. I support the Bill.",9,256,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00256

I am thus speaking from the point of view as a parent and I support the Bill. I support the Bill for two reasons.",1,257,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00257
2017-02-28-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"First, the proposed legislation would formalise many of the existing good regulatory practices that are already in place and tweak some to maintain a good balance.",2,258,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00258
2017-02-28-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Second, and more importantly today, the proposed legislation opens up the possibilities of developing the pre-school sector. In this regard, I will speak of the three potentials of enhancing innovation, professionalism and affordability in the pre-school sector.",3,259,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00259
2017-02-28-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"But before I do so, I want to clear a nagging issue with the Minister, which has been bothering me since I read the Early Childhood Development Agency's response to the specific feedback back in November 2015. The explanation given by ECDA to the exemption of Ministry of Education (MOE) Kindergartens from the regulatory framework is that this is in line with the fact that the Council for Private Education regulates private education institutions under the Private Education Act, while all national schools, Polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education come under MOE.",4,260,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00260
2017-02-28-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Now, this argument is rather weak. On what grounds should the regulation of the pre-school sector be organised in a similar way as the education sector? The two sectors are very different in purpose and pedagogies. The pre-school sector entails the application of childcare skills as well as holistic education approaches that recognise the difference between early childhood development and late childhood education.",5,261,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00261
2017-02-28-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Furthermore, in the education sector, the national schools serve as the primary and centralised arbiter of standards and allocation of public resources, with private schools only playing the role of augmenting public-led education to raise our young people to become productive workers, enterprising leaders and good citizens. Since the November 2015 response by ECDA, the Council for Private Education has been turned into the Committee for Private Education and absorbed into SkillsFuture Singapore.",6,262,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00262
2017-02-28-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"There is no equivalence in the pre-school sector. The pre-school sector is a lot more diverse and decentralised. Even as the Council, the CPE was no equivalent to the ECDA, which regulated almost the entire pre-school sector except the few MOE kindergartens. It is certainly no equivalent now as the Committee. ECDA, not MOE, sets the standards. MOE is only one of the players in the pre-school sector. Symmetry may be beautiful, but it is wrong in this application.",7,263,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00263
2017-02-28-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"What we need to ask instead are the role and function of MOE kindergartens in the pre-school sector, and whether the role and function, therefore, justify the exemption. If MOE kindergartens cater to a specific constituency, say, low-income families, but seeks to be consistent in standards with the ECDC Act and SPARK, then there is no justification for the exemption.",8,264,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00264
2017-02-28-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"There is also the strange suggestion in the ECDA public consultation response that since MOE is directly accountable to Parliament, there is no need for the inclusion of the MOE kindergartens under the regulatory framework. Surely, Parliament cannot be expected to perform the role of ECDA, since it is a legislative body and cannot play a regulatory function to closely hold MOE kindergartens to consistent standards.",9,265,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00265
2017-02-28-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),Let me turn now to the three potentials. The first is the potential of enhancing innovation. It is good that ECDA will be empowered to regulate the curriculum of childcare centres and kindergartens under the licensing regime. It is also a positive thing that ECDA said in its public consultation response that broad guidelines would ensure the programmes are developmentally appropriate while giving centres the flexibility to customise lesson plans.,10,266,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00266
2017-02-28-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"I believe this is a crucial stance to maintain and I would urge ECDA to keep this openness to the diversity of early childhood education models. I also hope ECDA would consult widely with stakeholders, professional bodies and educational experts before rejecting any particular curriculum, so as to protect the diversity as much as possible.",11,267,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00267
2017-02-28-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The pre-school sector is poised to be a field of innovation. There are some interesting innovations on this front spearheaded by the Lien Foundation. There is an inclusive pre-school set up by Lien Foundation and the Asian Women's Welfare Association for typically developing children and children with special needs to learn and play together. There is also the collaboration between Lien Foundation and NTUC First Campus to develop model pre-schools for the heartlands, and for training teachers and conducting research on early childhood education.",12,268,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00268
2017-02-28-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The Lien Foundation examples are well-publicised examples. They are not the only examples of innovation. Many smaller pre-schools are quietly innovating. The regulatory framework must remain broad-based and not primed for consolidating and centralising the pre-school sector, and ECDA must remain open-minded and consultative to continue to encourage the innovation.",13,269,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00269
2017-02-28-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The second potential is the potential for enhancing the professionalism of early childhood educators. It is good that ECDA will be overseeing the registration of early childhood professionals and the accreditation of early childhood training programmes for now. I believe it is right that ECDA gently rejected the call for an independent professional body to register the programme staff, as there is no such body that can properly perform such a task at this point in time.",14,270,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00270
2017-02-28-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"However, having said this, I believe there is scope to aim to increase the participation of professional bodies in the registration of professionals and accreditation of the programmes, so as to develop the overall professionalism of the pre-school sector.",15,271,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00271
2017-02-28-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"It is a positive thing that ECDA develops the standards for registration and course accreditation in consultation with stakeholders, representatives of the professionals and the education experts. But taking input for implementation is not the same as opening up the process to participation by the professional bodies so that these bodies could grow and develop.",16,272,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00272
2017-02-28-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The development of these professional bodies should not be neglected by ECDA. These bodies play an important role in providing platforms for the sharing of expertise and innovation, and the exchange of knowledge and best practices. In the spirit of Budget 2017, ECDA would do well to aim to forge and deepen partnerships with these professional bodies, so that the pre-school sector could also prepare for the future economy so as to prepare our children for the future economy.",17,273,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00273
2017-02-28-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The third potential is the potential for enhancing the affordability of early childhood education. Research has shown that pre-school education is crucial for reducing inequality. Children who are ill-prepared and lacking the foundation for formal schooling tend to do badly in school, while putting a child in pre-school improves her chances of graduating from college. Affordable quality pre-school education is, therefore, the great leveller, improving the odds of low-income families to break out of the poverty trap.",18,274,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00274
2017-02-28-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"One of the main fears related to this legislation is the increase of regulatory and compliance costs that would be passed on to parents through increased fees. In its public consultation response, ECDA reassured the public that regulatory costs would be low for operators who have been complying with existing regulations. This is fair enough, since much of the regulatory framework is already in place and this legislation is a formalisation and consolidation of the existing regulations.",19,275,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00275
2017-02-28-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Nevertheless, there will be some regulatory costs and knock-on effects on fees. This, therefore, presents the Government with the opportunity to review its subsidy schemes, especially with the view of ensuring low-income families can afford pre-school education for their children.",20,276,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00276
2017-02-28-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"In this respect, I would like to call for two things. The first is for the per capita income eligibility criteria for the Additional Infant and Child Care Subsidies and the Kindergarten Fee Assistance Scheme to be based on four or more family members in the same household, including at least two dependents, rather than on the existing five or more family members with more than two dependents. The four family members with two dependents demographic is more aligned with the low-income family profile. This will allow more low-income families to benefit from more subsidies in a context where fees are under cost pressures to go up.",21,277,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00277
2017-02-28-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The second is to open up KiFAS subsidies to eligible parents of children enrolled in kindergartens operated by Partner Operators and Voluntary Welfare Organisations. The Partner Operators complement Anchor Operators in keeping fees affordable while ensuring the quality of the programmes. Likewise, kindergartens operated by VWOs are non-profit institutions and help keep fees affordable. I do not see any reason to keep Partner Operators and VWO operators out of KiFAS. The subsidies would not benefit the operators, only the low-income families who would have a greater selection of kindergartens to choose from.",22,278,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00278
2017-02-28-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Mdm Speaker, I hope this Bill will set the stage for enhancing the innovation, professionalism and affordability of the pre-school sector.

2017-02-28-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mdm Speaker, I stand in support of this Bill for it is much needed and timely. In order for parents to have the added possibility of the mother returning to the workforce, the quality of the care of their children is, understandably, extremely important. Hence, the enhanced regulatory framework to ensure excellence in care and education is crucial.",1,280,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00280
2017-02-28-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Through an enhanced regulatory framework, this Bill seeks to ensure and advance the quality of care and education in the pre-school sector. This is important as more young parents in Singapore look to pre-school centres for care management. As pre-school centres are geographically spread out across Singapore, centre-based care becomes more convenient and attractive to parents. Furthermore, as more women and seniors participate in the workforce, the need for quality pre­school services has increased. There is a real need to increase the support for young parents who may prefer centre-based care over care given by domestic workers or nannies.",2,281,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00281
2017-02-28-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"This need to ensure quality is especially important as more parents require longer hours of care for even younger children. What I am referring to is the shift in enrolment numbers from kindergartens to childcare centres. Kindergartens are normally half-day, while childcare centres provide longer hours. Last year, it was noted that over the past three years, kindergarten enrolment dropped by about 6% and the number of kindergartens dropped from 500 to 480. On the other hand, childcare enrolment shot up by about 50%, from 76,000 to about 100,000. Furthermore, the demand for infant care for children under 18 months has increased. Since 2012, the number of infants enrolled in infant care has increased by 60%, now accounting for about 10% of the infants. This trend is projected to increase in the next few years, especially since increasing centre-based infant care featured in the Budget Statement last week. These changes necessitate an enhanced regulatory framework to ensure continued excellence in a growing and important service sector.",3,282,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00282
2017-02-28-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"This Bill seeks to maintain and advance the quality of care and education by pre-school centres through various angles, with the child's well-being as a priority. For example, clause 6 of this Bill introduces a licensing framework for both kinds of pre-school centres. This furthers the accountability with regard to kindergartens, which were previously able to come under a one-off registration process. Another example is found in clause 10(3)(e), which may require licensees to undergo an audit.",4,283,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00283
2017-02-28-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Further, clause 12 provides that a security deposit may be required and may be calibrated according to the licensee's track record and its likelihood to attract regulatory action proceedings. This adds another accountability mechanism ‒ this time, a financial one.",5,284,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00284
2017-02-28-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The Bill also deals with the leadership of the early childhood development centre. Under clause 8(3), it places importance on the key appointment holder's character and the fitness to operate in an application for a licence, while clause 19 ensures that this is continued by a possible disqualification of a key appointment holder.",6,285,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00285
2017-02-28-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Besides safety, quality education is ensured at multiple stages and levels, including grant of licence under clause 10(3)(b), and the educators deployed and employed under clauses 23 and 30.",7,286,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00286
2017-02-28-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"This Bill also provides for measures to help protect the children's wellbeing.

2017-02-28-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Another key aspect of this Bill which I support is to ensure the reliability and continuity of the care centre. It is imperative that parents are not stuck in stressful limbo when a centre closes. Therefore, the initiative under this new law to mandate that assistance be provided to parents for alternative care placements and education arrangements, when a centre closes, is key. It is for this reason that clause 18(4)(g) is to be supported.",9,288,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00288

Section 3 states that the Act does not apply to certain centres. Why does this Act not apply to pre-schools run by the Government, such as the Ministry of Education Kindergartens? Should it not be that standards be applied to both the Government and privately-run pre-schools? Section 17 spells out the directions concerning the safety and well-being of children. Thus, the licensee who fails to comply will be imposed a fine of up to $10,000 or not exceeding 12 months' imprisonment. How does an agency make sure that every licensee complies with the directions and not wait until someone whistle-blows or complains?",3,292,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00292
2017-02-28-T-015,K Thanaletchimi,Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member),"Section 23 states the approval for performance of and deployment of individuals to perform prescribed duties. Pre-school teachers play an important role in detecting developmental issues among children. Will there be training for teachers in caring for children with special needs? Also, the Bill does not provide much reference or guide on the qualifications and experience required for such teachers. What other fees or charges are to be paid in respect of the services and other areas mentioned in section 51 under ""Regulations""?

The interest of children should come first, ahead of industry considerations. But at the same time, if we foster an industry landscape which is effectively an oligopoly of the AOPs, POPs and MOE kindergartens, that may pose some risks in terms of losing an element of diversity and of competition. Diversity is important, particularly in respect of centres catering to children with special needs, as I mentioned.",3,296,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00296
2017-02-28-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"In fact, the year 2000, Dr Aline Wong, then Senior Minister of State for Education said and I quote, ""Today, different pre-school providers with their different philosophies and approaches to child development offer a wide range of pre-school education models in Singapore. There is merit in this arrangement as it promotes healthy competition and provides a futile arena or innovative practices."" I would like to ask the Ministry  does it expect a major consolidation in the industry as a result of this Bill? And if so, what will be done to ensure that this takes place in a way that protects diversity and choice while also safeguarding the interests of the children? For example, will other Government agencies like SPRING, reach out to the sector to provide advice and the systems in respect M&A or alliance possibilities?",4,297,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00297

Will ECDA demonstrate flexibility on a case-by-case basis in line with the spirit of the regulations? The case in point may be where individual teachers may possess good qualifications from institutes abroad or at home and could be required to undertake an abridged or accelerated form of the current PQAC accredited advanced diploma that is required. Will ECDA practise flexibility and accept different pathways to accreditation of personnel, taking into question individual professional qualifications and their experience, or will it rigidly require all professionals to conform to the same PQAC accredited pathway?",5,298,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00298
2017-02-28-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Next, will the Ministry consider setting up an independent advisory body to inform policy formulation? This was the recommendation from a study authored by Dr Lynn Ang for the Lien Foundation in 2012 referring to the pre-school sector. And I quote from the study, ""While the increasing Government involvement to regulate the sector is generally welcomed by most participants in the study, there is a concern that the overwhelming influence of Government may stifle the independent voices of pre-school teachers and other stakeholders. As such, a consultative approach to policy development and implementation is seen as key in galvanising support and moving the sector forward.",6,299,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00299
2017-02-28-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"One example of a consultative approach could entail the setting up of an independent advisory body comprising representatives from different key stakeholders such as pre-school teachers, service providers, teacher training providers, health professionals, family educators, community workers, social workers, parents, voluntary welfare organisations (VWO) and other relevant agencies and experts who are involved in the care and education of young children.""",7,300,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00300
2017-02-28-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Madam, such a consultative approach to policy formation recommended by experts as I quoted above is advisable given the rapid pace of research and innovation in this field.",8,301,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00301
2017-02-28-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Since the Opening of the Thirteenth Parliament in January 2016, the Government has stated that one of its key themes is partnership. Such consultative policy formation and implementation would demonstrate that such commitments are being honoured in practice and not only in rhetoric.",9,302,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00302
2017-02-28-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Next, as my colleague Assoc Prof Daniel Goh has argued, the exemption for MOE kindergartens is hard to accept. In its consultation paper of 20 November 2015, ECDA said that the MOE kindergartens are exempt because of strict oversight from MOE headquarters and because MOE is accountable to Parliament. This seems to conflict two functions − broad oversight on the one hand and operational inspection responsibility to ensure quality standards and service delivery on the other.",10,303,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00303
2017-02-28-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"If indeed MOE's regulation of MOE kindergartens is more strict than the standards required under the ECDA Act, that is problematic from the standpoint of equity. If it is on par with the standards required under this Bill, will it not be more reasonable and efficient to transfer supervisory oversight over MOE kindergartens to ECDA, thus alleviating the oversight burden on the part of MOE headquarters and levelling the inspection and enforcement playing field.",11,304,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00304
2017-02-28-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"And lastly, Madam, I would like to make a very exploratory suggestion. The quality of pre-school education has been shown to be a critical factor in determining educational success downstream. This was argued by an EIU report entitled ""Starting Well"" commissioned by the Lien Foundation in 2012. The same well-known report placed Singapore 30th in the global ranking of pre-school education quality, and 21st in terms of affordability. We do face a challenge of inequality in Singapore with Gini coefficients above the forty level. These have been coming down which is a positive development, but they are still very high by the standards of other developed countries.",12,305,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00305
2017-02-28-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Madam, breaking the poverty cycle should be a priority for Singapore. Not only is this right thing to do from the standpoint of social justice, not only will this help cement social solidarity and protect us from the divisive politics that is being seen in some other countries in the world today, it will also help unlock talent that could power our economic future, fire our imagination and inspire our spirits. One of the children in a large poor family living in an HDB rental flat today could be the next Ron Sim or Sim Wong Woo, the next Joseph Schooling, Yip Pin Xiu or Theresa Goh, the next Iskandar Jalil, the next Catherine Lim.",13,306,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00306
2017-02-28-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"We know how important it is to ingrain good learning habits at a very young age. Children who miss the boat because their families lack the money or understanding to invest in their pre-school years, will struggle in Primary school and are likely to become demoralised, widening the gap with their peers. This could be why the director of a social service centre I spoke to shared that he is now seeing cases which are the children of the at-risk clients he served over 20 years ago.",14,307,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00307
2017-02-28-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),It is well-accepted that programmes that reward poor families for keeping their children in school can play a helpful role in breaking the poverty cycle. The pioneering programme globally in this respect was the Bolsa Familia programme in Brazil which has inspired many similar programmes around the world.,15,308,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00308
2017-02-28-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The Bolsa Familia basically incentivises, and I am saying this at the risk of some over-simplification, but the Bolsa Familia basically incentivises poor families to keep their children in school. It is also well-known that many other developed countries offer or partly free pre-school education. In Sweden, all children receive at least 525 hours per year free of charge, beginning from when the child reaches the age of three.",16,309,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00309
2017-02-28-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"In the longer term, and as a first step, will the Ministry explore the idea of making a more aggressive financial intervention to provide free, good quality kindergarten and childcare to all at-risk children in poor families, perhaps tied to certain conditions? There is already an initiative which the Minister launched previously − KidSTART − that can serve as platform for a more expansionary vision here.",17,310,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00310
2017-02-28-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Moreover, there is anecdotal evidence that children from many poor, low-income families, sometimes attend kindergartens or childcare centres only a few times a month which is the minimum to continue receiving the KiFAS or CFAC subsidies. In other words, absenteeism by children from poor families may be very high. Will the Ministry conduct a study of this absenteeism phenomenon and also consider policies to address this? Such policies could include making pre-school compulsory or providing some conditional benefit to parents from such families to ensure high attendance rates which is the idea behind the Bolsa Familia policy. Thank you.",18,311,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00311

I welcome this Bill as it seeks to ensure higher and consistent standards across the early childhood care education sector.",1,312,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00312
2017-02-28-T-015,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"As the number of young families having both parents working become increasingly common, the need for childcare or infant care becomes more urgent. I am glad that this Bill will give young parents assurance that the safety and welfare of their children will be protected and that the childcare centres their children attend will be professional and of high quality. Apart from the various monetary incentives the Government has provided, I think this is a right step towards providing a more holistic approach to encourage and help young couples start their family.",2,313,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00313
2017-02-28-T-015,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to offer three suggestions for consideration. First, I would like to suggest that the Early Childhood Development Agency, or ECDA, works with the Ministry of Education to co-locate primary schools and childcare centres. The main benefit will be that young parents who send their elder child to school need not make a separate trip to send their younger child to a childcare centre. These parents will also have the option of engaging the school bus service to send both children.",3,314,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00314
2017-02-28-T-015,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"My second suggestion is regarding training. Early childhood educators must attend an ECDA-recognised course or diploma programme conducted at ITEs, Polytechnics or ECDA-accredited training agencies such as SEED Institute or MMI Academy. To further alleviate the shortage of childcare staff, can the Ministry consider setting up a new institution to train more early childhood educators?",4,315,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00315
2017-02-28-T-015,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"My third suggestion is also regarding staffing, which is a big issue as many childcare centres have trouble hiring staff. I observe that currently, childcare staff is relatively young. I would like to ask ECDA if it can consider doing a HR study to see how to reach out to those who have been retrenched or may be considering a mid-career change to join this industry. This will be a win-win situation as it will help alleviate manpower shortage faced by childcare centres as well as help our middle-age workers.",5,316,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00316
2017-02-28-T-015,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"To conclude, we need to do everything we can to provide the high quality early childhood care and education that every child deserves. With that, Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.",6,317,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00317
2017-02-28-T-015,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Mdm Speaker, early childhood education takes place during the formative years, a time when a child is most receptive to learning. It is crucial to their development and sets the cornerstone of their adult years. It is good that the Government is constantly reviewing the needs of this sector. I support this Bill which I feel will help to improve the learning experience and development of the children in their pre-school years.",1,318,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00318
2017-02-28-T-015,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"I am pleased to note that relevant authorities are now empowered with more investigation powers. It also should be a requirement across the board that a robust system be in place to screen all staff who work at the centres. Background records must be accessible and up to date. Certainly, anyone with a history of hurting children or have pedophilic tendencies must be weeded out. I hope the Ministry will share the measures taken to do this.",2,319,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00319
2017-02-28-T-015,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"I would like to raise some potential issues with these rules. As with all changes, transition is often a matter of concern, especially for the smaller centres where they could be facing manpower and resource constraints to cope with the change. Can the Minister share with the House how this transition period can be best managed, such that the provision of childcare and education will not be disrupted in any centre? We are already facing childcare shortages, especially in new BTO areas where families are younger. This Bill should not make the shortages worse.",3,320,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00320
2017-02-28-T-015,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Under this Bill, for a centre to engage a third-party education provider, it is mandatory to apply to the Chief Licensing Officer (CLO). I propose that third-party education providers should also be licensed, and the centres can then take their pick from a list of the licensed providers at any given time. This would be more efficient when a centre needs to engage providers on an ad-hoc basis.",4,321,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00321

2017-02-28-T-015,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"In light of the current staff shortage in the industry, those who are undergoing training should be allowed to function as relief teachers or teaching assistants.

Why are MOE pre-schools and kindergartens exempted? Is this double standards? Is it that they are unable to meet the KPI? I think there should be more uniformity across schools catering to the same type of education level. This means subjecting MOE pre-schools and kindergartens to the same Act, or else subjecting the private pre-schools and kindergartens to the same requirements as the MOE's. In fact, I think it is good to subject MOE pre-schools and kindergartens under this same Act. This can ensure that whatever requested by ECDA is practical, is something that can be done. In fact, if there is anything that is not practical, something that needs to be fine-tuned, MOE can then whisper to ECDA.",7,324,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00324

At the union, we, too, received complaints against the management of childcare centres by early childhood educators.

These incidents serve as reminders on the need for a rigorous system to ensure that lapses in management can be detected early or prevented.",4,333,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00333
2017-02-28-T-015,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"I feel that we do need to avoid some unintended consequences and strengthen work in other areas. Firstly, with tighter compliance, some early childhood educators are concerned that operators may unfairly pass on all responsibilities to them in cases where non-compliance or gaps are detected. It is disconcerting to the educators if it is perceived that operators command the rights and can transfer all or a majority of the responsibilities to their staff. Hence, I urge the Ministry and the trade association to take a firm stance against operators who do so. We, in the union, stand ready to work with the Ministry and trade association to work out proper guidelines when operators conduct checks and inquiries.",5,334,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00334

Can the ratio of non-teaching staff be increased to assist the teachers from the workload of having to care, teach and manage the administrative tasks? An appropriate balance can be made in accordance to the classes of licence that will be issued.

In this Bill, there is no mention on the frequency of audits and whether a standard checklist will be made available for the centre's staff to have information documented and prepared on an on-going basis.

As much as we hope this will not happen to any of the centres, but pre-emptive measures must be taken to safeguard the children and staff.

Sometimes, the classes are held within the centre, and other times at external locations. The issue is that not all families can afford their children for additional classes. These children often have to sit out or take rest breaks while seeing their friends continue to be engaged and learning. It is unknown to us what psychological effect this may have on a young child. Furthermore, we should not be practising differing standards on the children at that tender age. Thus, I urge the Ministry to reconsider if there is a need to have additional classes conducted by third-party service providers, unless the learning opportunity is given to every child enrolled.",10,359,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00359

However, it appears that an audit of an Early Childhood Development Centre (ECDC) may not be compulsory. Can the Minister clarify under what circumstances would an audit be required?

2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Clearly, it is without a doubt that many of us recognise the importance of early childhood development, not just because we are parents but a lot of studies have shown the impact that good development work can have on children. The Member of Parliament, Mr Louis Ng, reminded all of us that it is not just from the early childhood development centres, but really, at home as well. This is something important for us to remember.",2,417,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00417
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"A fair number of points raised here that do not pertain to the Bill, but they are important points with regard to the importance of the early childhood effort. I will address some of these subsequently in a few days' time during the Committee of Supply debates; others, I will address them on other occasions. But I will take the opportunity to make some general points to address some of the perspectives highlighted by some Members.",3,418,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00418
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"What is clear is this − the early childhood component for our children is vital, which is why we set up the Early Childhood Development Agency. It is an independent agency but jointly overseen between the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF). Both Ministries are very intimately involved. As I will illustrate later, MOE plays a very significant role in developing the curriculum and learning pedagogies and the rest of the industry take reference from it.",4,419,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00419
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"It is also important to note that this whole set-up is not just driven from the top. There is a lot of effort in engaging the various stakeholders. We cannot do it without that, because it is a very varied space and there are many different schools of thought. Some of the examples that Mr Leon Perera highlighted, for example from Lien Foundation and the many different trials that are on-going, these are strongly supported by ECDA. We do want to explore the different ways of education. You may not want a single approach, because there are many different schools of thought. They are effective in different ways, and they are effective for different children. We want to see how these different curricula can play out how we can implement it, and how we can scale it, not necessarily across the board. In some instances, we want to scale it across the board; in some instances, in very boutique areas where it addresses the needs of specific children.",5,420,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00420
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We work with different stakeholders. For the special needs sector, one of the concerns highlighted was whether, as a result of these moves, it would impact some of the smaller players. From a purely intellectual and theoretical basis, I would agree that it would sound sensible to allow a thousand flowers to bloom and to have many different players. But having a very practical perspective on this, from dealing with the industry with many different players, I will say that the reality is not quite the same. There are very good small players. I visited a number of them - very interesting programmes but unfortunately, probably not able to scale up because a lot of its success is centred around the person who is driving the programme. It is very manpower intensive, which may be difficult to scale. We want to be able to encourage some of these centres to continue. But there are also child care centres which leave much room for improvement and really do need to level up.",6,421,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00421
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"So, I would agree that we want to encourage experimentation, but we also want to ensure that our children receive a good standard of education and care, which is the main objective of this effort. It is an important sector, which is why we are doing what we are doing. It is important to engage all the different players. It is also important for us to explore but, at the same time, have a certain structure and approach, and that is the way we have taken it.",7,422,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00422
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I am very heartened and encouraged by the strong recognition by all of you on the importance of this Bill. Notwithstanding the various comments, Members clearly recognise that there is that need to ensure higher and more consistent quality standards across the early childhood sector. This can be done without necessarily squeezing out some of the smaller players.",8,423,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00423
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I am sure that many of our early childhood professionals and operators are similarly encouraged. The process has taken over two years, because it is a very involved process. We did not want to drive it down from the top; many different stakeholders have been consulted. Where there were areas of concern, we have gone back and forth for a slightly longer period of time to take on board their feedback. What I am encouraged by is, like many Members, many of the stakeholders are strongly supportive of us taking this step.",9,424,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00424
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I believe that this Bill is a step in the right direction, because we do need to give every child a good start and to make Singapore a good place to raise families. On a point raised by Assoc Prof Daniel Goh with regard to lower income children, I would completely agree with that early childhood is important for all children, but for children who come from particularly challenged backgrounds, it becomes even more critical. That is also why we set up ECDA. We realise that in those early years, for those of us who are able to provide our children with exposure and development, our children are able to grow and develop well before they reach Primary school. But we realise that there is a gap.",10,425,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00425
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"For some of the children who come from more disadvantaged backgrounds, they enter Primary 1 with a fairly significant gap from the rest of their peers. Some are able to bridge that and carry on and run, but others struggle and might not be able to bridge that gap. Hence, it is important to impose, to some degree, a level of standard in terms of affordability, accessibility and quality of pre-schools, to make sure that as many children are levelled up as much as possible.",11,426,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00426
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The way we have structured subsidies which also seeks to ensure that lower-income families will not end up not sending their children to pre-school because they cannot afford it. Even down to a couple of dollars, children will be able to attend some of these establishments. Importantly, KidSTART is aimed at working with children from this segment. It is in a pilot stage with 1,000 families but we intend to see it through and expand it; this is where it is not just in terms of the early childhood development centre itself, but actually an all-encompassing approach to see how we hand-hold and work with the families along the journey.",12,427,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00427
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"So, I want to assure the Members of this House that there is very little doubt in our minds about the importance of this effort, and especially the work to be done with the lower income families.",13,428,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00428
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mr Christopher de Souza remarked that the Bill is much needed and timely. It is definitely so. A sound and robust regulatory framework guides centres and safeguards the sector against errant practices and behaviours. This sets a strong foundation for the sector to further innovate teaching and learning practices and to develop higher quality programmes. Many of the smaller centres appreciate the fact that some of these guidelines and some of these parameters are set, as these allow them to bring themselves up to a higher standard, because they do not have the scale or the resources necessarily to level themselves up on their own.",14,429,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00429
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I thank the Members very much for all the various suggestions. Let me address some of those in the manpower sphere. For instance, Miss Cheryl Chan suggested considering alternatives to paper qualifications when determining staff suitability. Assoc Prof Daniel Goh suggested increasing the participation of professional bodies in the registering of professionals and accreditation of programmes. He also suggested that it is important for us to consider those who have qualifications from overseas. Mr Yee Chia Hsing suggested a new training institute to ensure sufficient teachers in the sector.",15,430,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00430
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Indeed, we share our Members' concerns on the manpower constraints and this is one area we are paying very close attention to. In recent years, ECDA has rolled out a range of initiatives to attract, retain and develop good early childhood professionals. Many of these initiatives have been co-created with partners, such as SkillsFuture Singapore, pre-school operators, industry and professional associations and the union.",16,431,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00431
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,We note Assoc Prof Daniel Goh's suggestion for greater participation of professionals in the process of accrediting training courses and qualifications. This is already done in the development of teacher registration and course accreditation standards where our early childhood professional representatives and subject matter experts are invited to provide their expertise.,17,432,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00432
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"With regard to recognising those who have qualifications from overseas, we do encourage the respective childcare centres and kindergartens to put forward the names of these individuals so that we can evaluate them on a case-by-case basis.",18,433,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00433
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Through the ramping up of subsidised training places, including the work-and-study arrangements for mid-career entrants and ECDA's Training Awards for aspiring teachers, we are seeing a very encouraging response, such as higher enrolment numbers in the early childhood Polytechnic courses and more mid-career entrants joining the sector. To echo Mr Darryl David's emphasis, in fact, many are mid-career entrants. No matter what we do in this sector, frankly, without people, this is not going to work. Some of these steps have been taken. The response has been encouraging, but we are not letting up on that front. We need to keep up at making sure that we not only bring in numbers but ensure the quality of the people who are coming in as well. Many of them are very passionate, the mid-career ones especially, because they have reached a stage of their lives where they are looking at doing something different. Some of them are parents themselves who recognise the importance of early childhood development, and we really welcome them on board the sector.",19,434,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00434
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"For the teaching staff, including infant educarers, ECDA has, in recent years, moved to open alternate entry pathways for them to upgrade professionally. When in-service educators apply for training courses, ECDA recognises their prior learning and working experiences beyond their paper qualifications. That is something that Miss Cheryl Chan raised, and we will continue to move in this direction.",20,435,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00435
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We will touch more on these efforts to support the manpower needs of the sector, to provide more accessible, affordable and quality pre-school places at the upcoming Committee of Supply debates.",21,436,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00436
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"On curriculum requirements, some Members, such as Mr Desmond Choo, noted that our pre-school sector provides a diverse range of programmes for parents to choose from, so as to best cater to their preferences and the different needs of their young children.",22,437,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00437
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Under the Bill, we will continue requiring centres to have programmes that are age-appropriate and holistic. Assoc Prof Daniel Goh would be glad to know that within the regulatory framework, centres will continue to have the flexibility to innovate and customise their specific curriculum to suit the needs of the children. In fact, this is to be encouraged. For good practices we will be more than happy to take them onboard and see how best to introduce them to more establishments.",23,438,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00438
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In the examples cited, ECDA has certainly supported many of these ideas, and we will continue to do so. As a reference, centres can refer to MOE's Nurturing Early Learners Curriculum Framework when designing and implementing their kindergarten curriculum. Learning through play is a key component for the framework. For those who are concerned that we are over-schoolifying the whole process − no, we are very mindful that play is a very important part of early childhood development.",24,439,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00439
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In fact, MOE is a very important player in this whole effort. They are driving the curriculum framework development; again, not only on their own, but also leveraging on the experiences of other subject matter experts on this. And certainly play is a very key component of their emphasis as well, which is why MOE has stepped in to look at MOE Kindergarten as well. And I will address the issue later with regard to their exemption.",25,440,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00440
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"For the early years, of three years old and below, centres can refer to ECDA's Early Years Development Framework. This framework also takes a strong alignment with the MOE framework.",26,441,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00441
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"With regard to nutritional and outdoor physical time requirements highlighted by some Members, I agree with Mr Desmond Choo that increasing access to healthier food options for pre-school children will help them develop good dietary habits for life. We should do that at home, and not just depend on the pre-school. We do what we can at pre-school, but home is where it all starts. It is very important to remember that I do not need a Bill for good parenting to take place, and, frankly, the best influences come at home. So, let us not forget that.",27,442,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00442
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I also second Mr Louis Ng's point that we should provide more opportunities for children to play. As mentioned earlier, play is a very central focus in the curriculum, especially playing outdoors. Studies have shown clearly that having outdoor activities makes a lot of difference in terms of preventing myopia, and in developing a more resilient and hardier population; this is something that we welcome.",28,443,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00443
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"As announced by the NurtureSG Taskforce last week, ECDA will specify more detailed nutritional requirements to ensure that children receive nutritious, balanced and varied meals. We urge families to also look out for these guidelines to follow them at home. This includes not allowing centres to serve sugary drinks and deep-fried food, and catering for the regular provision of fruits and calcium-rich food. The physical activity time for full-day programmes will also be increased to an hour daily, up from half an hour today, and half an hour at least to be conducted outdoors and more, if you can.",29,444,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00444
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"As I have earlier explained, this Bill will also provide for subsidiary legislation to be gazetted. Members have highlighted  ""how do we do this, that or the other?"" A lot of these will come in the form of subsidiary legislation that will be gazetted. Certainly, the suggestions that have been put forward today will be taken on board as we finalise some of these detailed requirements.",30,445,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00445
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Of course, there are concerns that many Members have raised, and I am fully aware that there will be challenges. It is not straightforward. When you put in place new measures, it is not an effortless process. But it is an important one and stakeholders recognise it; centres recognise that it is necessary, and they have also flagged out their concerns to us. This was expressed by many Members, including Ms Thanaletchimi, Miss Cheryl Chan, Ms Joan Pereira, Mr Darryl David, Mr Desmond Choo, Mr Yee Chia Hsing, Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Mr Ang Hin Kee, Mr Louis Ng and Mr Leon Perera.",31,446,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00446
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,Many of these concerns have also been expressed during our many different consultation sessions with the public and operators. Let me briefly summarise these concerns.,32,447,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00447
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"One, which Mr Leon Perera specifically highlighted, was whether the higher cost will impact on the continued operations, and whether this is compelling a consolidation of centres, and forcing some of the smaller players to close, especially those catering to children with special needs.",33,448,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00448
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Secondly, there is a potentially higher cost to operators, especially the smaller ones. Does it in turn translate to higher fees for parents and administrative burden on operators and teachers?",34,449,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00449
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"With regard to the closure aspect, we expect most kindergartens would smoothly transit to the new Act. We have reached out to many different players, including the smaller ones. They recognise the importance and some of the challenges. Since 2015, many kindergartens, with the support of ECDA, have already started making preparations to meet the new licensing requirements. We have been in constant dialogue. Our whole effort is not about penalising and weeding out the smaller players. It is actually about helping those in the industry who are passionate about educating our children. How do we help them to level up? It is very much, as I have mentioned earlier, a developmental approach that we are taking.",35,450,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00450
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In addition, kindergartens will be given up to a year after the gazetting of regulations under the new Act, which is expected to be about late 2017 or early 2018, for them to obtain their licences. That said, there will be closures because, every year, we do have a number of kindergartens and child care centres that will close or have a change in licensees for various business reasons. Some kindergartens also convert to child care centres to better serve the needs of parents.",36,451,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00451
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Just a very quick note ‒ we work very closely also with the special needs sector. So, we are very mindful. We are working very closely with many of the special needs centres, and many of them do not have a huge concern in transiting to this new regime. In fact, many of the very progressive and interesting child care centres and kindergartens are trying out different types of approaches. In fact, many of them are fairly well-run, which is why, in many ways, they are doing what they are doing. These establishments do not have a problem transiting to the new regime under this Bill.",37,452,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00452
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"These are all very important concerns. ECDA is also undertaking many other initiatives to support the sector in this whole transition process. To continue, as we have mentioned, affordability remains a key cornerstone of our whole approach. So, ensuring quality and affordable early childhood development services for parents remains paramount.",38,453,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00453
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Apart from broad-based support that ECDA has been providing to the sector to meet the new requirements, I would like to assure Members that we will take a gradual and calibrated approach.",39,454,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00454
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Some Members have raised the issue of potential fee increases arising from the higher requirements, and their impact on families. Indeed, common wisdom would highlight that there is a trade-off between being cheap, good and fast. In fact, some Members have also asked, ""Why are we doing inspections once a year? Let's do it twice a year?"" So, there is a balance needed. We recognise a need to ensure standards and to level up the sector. At the same time, how do you balance that against onerous requirements? As can be seen from Members' inputs, there will be tensions, and trade-offs will invariably be done.",40,455,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00455
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Firstly, let us look at how we can make the regulations that are important, flexible and streamlined at the same time. How do we do it? As we have highlighted in the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE), it is about the doing. How do we actively do this? We have been practising that in terms of ECDA's engagement with the sector, and we have been able to put this into practice as far as we can and, at the same time, not compromising on quality.",41,456,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00456
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"ECDA has field-tested the requirements on a variety of centres, both large and small, to see how it can be operationalised. I would like to assure this House that the requirements in the Bill and the regulatory framework are calibrated with that in mind, to meet some of these higher order requirements but, at the same time, try not to increase costs unnecessarily by making requirements flexible, so that it is not onerous. We are quite assured that it should pretty much unfold in that direction. For those who do have challenges, we will work closely with them.",42,457,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00457
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"For example, we have a new longer three-year licence tenure which is intended to reduce the administrative costs of centres with consistently good regulatory track records. Mr Louis Ng highlighted that centres will need to undergo regular assessments before their licence renewals to demonstrate that they have maintained their standards. We encourage centres to meet the standards, and if they do, they can have a three-year licence. In addition, ECDA will continue to conduct unannounced audits. Mr Gan Thiam Poh suggested we should do more audits. For those who have challenges, we will pay closer attention, and we will visit them more often to help them level up their standards. But we do need to strike a balance and I think Members appreciate that.",43,458,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00458
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"As I have mentioned earlier, many of the new requirements have already been implemented as part of the sector's best practices. Hence, it is not as if with the introduction of this Bill, a whole new slew of initiatives is coming in. Actually, many of these have been unfolding in various forms in the past couple of years.",44,459,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00459
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"For example, ECDA's advisory recommends centres to have air purifiers during haze periods. ECDA is looking into making this requirement in subsidiary legislation. In fact, as a result of the effort in the past one to two years, many centres are already well-prepared for this, especially as ECDA has earlier provided funding support to centres to procure air purifiers during severe haze episodes.",45,460,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00460
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We also do not plan to increase regulatory requirements around staffing numbers and space allocation, which are the main cost factors for centres. We believe that the prevailing requirements are adequate in our current context.",46,461,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00461
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Some flexibility has also been catered for these requirements, as new requirements are added. For example, Miss Cheryl Chan suggested allowing non-teaching staff to support teachers more. I mentioned earlier that there is no reason why the operational staff cannot help trained teachers supervise outdoor play time. Centres can also use neighbourhood playgrounds to fulfil their outdoor space requirements. In fact, ECDA has even gone down to help centres look at how to manage their costs. For example, for the requirement on first-aid kits, ECDA has looked into the items and the quantity of each item. While the first-aid kit items are not going to drive costs up in a significant way, ECDA has gone into details to work with various centres, especially the smaller ones who are reaching out because they do not have the resources and the set-up to look at some of the good practices in detail. ECDA's advantage is that, because of their oversight over the rest of the sector, ECDA can bring into play many good practices which can be imparted to other players.",47,462,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00462
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,We have also extended funding support to the not-for-profit kindergartens to help them defray staff immunisation and also minor renovation costs.,48,463,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00463
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In addition to these, given that affordability is a concern to many parents, ECDA has also ramped up the supply of more quality and affordable places. This is something I have been talking about regularly, and this includes more places offered by Anchor and Partner Operators. We have also made subsidy enhancements in recent years, and we note Assoc Prof Daniel Goh's suggestion to expand the support given, especially for lower-income families. That is something that we completely agree is important. A lot of it will come under the KidSTART effort, which is something that I have mentioned before. We intend to make sure that it succeeds and takes off on a more extensive basis.",49,464,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00464
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mr Desmond Choo asked for the Government to have some degree of control over fees to ensure that fees are affordable to parents. Today, there are quality targets and fee caps on the Anchor Operator and Partner Operator centres, which serve nearly half of the sector. For the remaining operators, we see the need for operators to determine their own fees, as their programmes may have different cost structures, and they may need to adjust their fees from time to time to ensure business sustainability.",50,465,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00465
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"While the Bill will not determine the fees of different pre-schools − this will be addressed separately − we will continue to require centres to provide sufficient early notification of any plans to increase fees and explain the fee increase to parents. This will help to ensure that fee increases are done in a transparent and fair manner. With regard to the affordability of fees, that will be dealt with separately and I will talk about that in the Committee of Supply debates.",51,466,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00466
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Following feedback from parents, ECDA is also looking into requiring centres to publish incidental charges − these are the finer regulatory details − such as field trips, supplementary enrichment activities and to make enrichment activities optional, which means centres must continue to provide classes for children who do not opt for these programmes. This approach creates greater flexibility and fee transparency for parents, allowing parents to make informed choices and manage their costs better.",52,467,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00467
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Administrative workload is something that many of us are concerned with. It is a valid concern and that is something that we are very mindful of as we embark on this journey with this Bill. We certainly want teachers to spend more quality time on our children than on administration. When you speak to teachers, what they want to do is to teach, not to spend time doing administration. But we also realise that to run a system in a systematic way, where you not just teach well but are also able to replicate that on a sustainable basis, you need structures and processes. Hence, it is important for us to not run away from that, but to make sure that it is not onerous.",53,468,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00468
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"ECDA has taken a focused effort to streamline administration and make it flexible as I mentioned earlier. For example, over the past year, we have been working with the sector to streamline the new regulatory standards checklist for operators' own preparatory self-assessments, so that they know what to look out for.",54,469,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00469
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"To Mr Gan Thiam Poh's query, we do not require operators to employ designated administrative or compliance staff. Most operators should be able to manage the new framework with their existing resources. We have spoken to many of them, in terms of how they envisage themselves adapting to address the needs of this Bill. Besides streamlining the regulatory standards checklist, ECDA has also released a series of very useful templates that centres can use to guide and track their day-to-day operations. ECDA will also be enhancing its IT systems to allow centres to interface with ECDA more seamlessly on regulatory matters. Technology can go some ways to make this more efficient and easier for centres.",55,470,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00470
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We agree with Mr Ang Hin Kee's suggestion on the value of tapping on technology to keep costs down and free up teachers' time for our children. Beyond streamlining requirements, ECDA has collaborated with the Association for Early Childhood and Training Services and the Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore to identify smart solutions to help teachers with their daily administrative duties, such as temperature and attendance taking. As we embark on the journey towards Smart Nation, it should encompass all manners of activities that we are undertaking. These solutions were showcased at the Early Childhood Conference in September last year, and many operators have signed up since.",56,471,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00471
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"With regard to the exclusion of MOE kindergartens, Ms Thanaletchimi, Assoc Prof Daniel Goh, Er Lee Bee Wah and Mr Louis Ng raised the question about why MOE is excluded. I can understand the concerns raised. Let me make a couple of points. ECDA is an agency that is overseen by MOE and MSF. Both Ministries take a very active interest and role in shaping this space. This is the reason why ECDA was set up. We are very clear that the formative years are vital. Education is a long journey. We have in place our Primary, Secondary, Tertiary education, and so on. That continues to be improved. What we have prior to ECDA was a space which was left to the market. We thought it was important for us to step in. This is why it is not just an MOE effort, but both MOE and MSF are stepping into that space.",57,472,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00472
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"MOE continues to drive the curriculum in very significant ways; MOE is not just focused on Primary school education. There is a need to look at the pedagogy that is involved leading up to that stage. As a result of being involved in MOE kindergartens, MOE is also looking at how that whole continuum extends into the early Primary school years, including how to harmonise this whole effort and how that streamlines into longer-term development effort for education.",58,473,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00473
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"MOE is not a fringe player coming in, or one of those small establishments that has no background.

2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The ECDC Act is intended to regulate the standards of private kindergartens and childcare providers. The MOE kindergartens are run directly by the Government, and they have an Act that governs it, similar to the way MOE runs Primary schools, Secondary schools and Junior Colleges. This is not to say that MOE runs their kindergartens the same way that Primary schools are run. They should be run differently − the approach is different.",60,475,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00475
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The MOE Kindergartens will continue to be regulated under the Education Act along with other national schools. This is an approach similar to how we approach the other parts of the education space. MOE maintains strict oversight of the MOE Kindergartens and will be directly accountable, as they are accountable to this House, with regard to broader education. On the one hand, Members feel that by bringing them on board under the Early Childhood Development Centres Bill would be sensible − and I can understand that − on the other hand, there is another Act that is already governing them. MOE is also intimately involved, and they will meet the requirements that are demanded of the rest of the other centres as well.",61,476,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00476
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"With regard to Miss Cheryl Chan and Mr Louis Ng's questions on closure arrangements, ECDA is studying the advance notification period for centres who intend to cease their operations, which will happen from time to time for various reasons. We agree that sufficient time is needed for parents to look for alternatives. In determining the notification period, ECDA must strike a balance with the feasibility of the time period for centres - because there are real practical concerns from their perspective as well, and centres would not wish to prematurely alarm parents - and at the same time balance with the need for early warning. We will see how we can work that out.",62,477,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00477
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"To Ms Thanaletchimi's question, we will maintain prevailing professional qualification requirements and this information is available on ECDA's website for all to refer to. As I mentioned earlier, for those who have other qualifications that do not quite fit, if the centre feels that they want to put the person forward, the centre can do so and we can look at it on a case-by-case basis.",63,478,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00478
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"To clarify on Mr Darryl David's point on third-party enrichment vendor staff suitability, we will start by making simple assessments of these individuals' track record. We do not intend to specify any professional qualifications required of these individuals, since these enrichment classes are optional and encompass a very wide range of niche activities from sports, drama to cooking to whatever it may be. It will not be addressed within this Bill, but it is something that we will look at and work with the sector to see to what degree we want to define the requirements for some of these individuals concerned.",64,479,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00479

As such, it is a criminal offence for any non-compliance, liable up to a fine of $10,000 and imprisonment of 12 months as determined by the Courts.",65,480,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00480

2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"With regard to the security deposit, this is something that Mr Louis Ng raised, I have also touched on the application of the security deposit as well as the proposed amount. We are applying the security deposit on a small number of centres with poor regulatory track records as a form of assurance from them on their commitment to improve, while recognising that the majority of our sector by and large is performing well. Should there be a need in the future, this approach can be reviewed and we are open to it. The security bond may be forfeited as a form of regulatory sanction against breaches as provided for under clause 16.",67,482,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00482
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"I note some of the other issues in the early childhood sector that were raised by Members. As I mentioned, some of these are beyond the scope of the Bill. Regarding more support for centres and early childhood teachers caring for children with special needs, as raised by some Members, ECDA and my Ministry will continue to work with training institutes and educational providers to equip pre-school teachers with the necessary skills to support children with developmental needs, such as rolling out professional development courses for in-service pre-school teachers who want to enhance their skills in this area.",68,483,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00483
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We are quite assured that for centres that are operating in this space, transiting to the new arrangement should not be a problem.

2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"This Bill will complement the many initiatives that the Government has introduced to enhance the quality, accessibility and affordability of early childhood development services. This will ensure that every child, regardless of his or her background, can have a good start in life. It is important for us to ensure that every child has that good start. It will also further strengthen our commitment to make Singapore a good place to raise families.",74,489,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00489

It takes a whole nation to play a part. I think if we are able to put our hearts and soul into this, both at home and in the sector, we have every reason to be optimistic for our future. Because once you lay a strong foundation, there is a high probability and a good chance that our young children can grow up to be responsible citizens and contribute back significantly to our nation.",75,490,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00490

2017-02-28-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Thank you, Madam. Just two brief clarification questions to the Minister. The first is just to be a bit more specific on the requirements for licensing of personnel within the early childhood sector. For those individuals who have strong qualifications either from abroad or locally, would the Ministry actually consider an abridged or accelerated version of the PQAC-accredited advance diploma to allow them to serve?",1,493,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00493
2017-02-28-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"The second clarification is really in regard to the point raised I raised about absenteeism. If such a system is not already in place, will the Ministry consider requiring early childhood centres to flag out to the Ministry, children who are persistently absent as potential candidates for KidSTART when that programme is expanded in the future?",2,494,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00494
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Member for his two supplementary questions. With regard to the first, indeed, we will look at the individuals' qualifications that may not fit our criteria today, especially qualifications from overseas. We will look at whether in their case, is a more truncated programme or a more accelerated programme possible. There is a balance that needs to be struck. But it is something that we are open to look at.",1,495,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00495
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"With regard to the second question, it is a very important one. It is important for us to realise that part of the challenge is that while we may make some of these schemes and subsidies available, the challenge is with the children's attendance. Because you will find that for some families, and for a range of reasons - there is not one reason particularly - intermittent attendance is actually worrying. The opportunities for the development and exposure is there for the children, but for whatever reasons, the children do not attend. We do know some of the factors that are involved. In fact, this is something that I am quite particular about personally. As part of our effort with KidSTART, working with the families, it is not just about the children, it is about the family too. So, addressing absenteeism, ensuring the children have regular attendance in pre-schools will be a very important component of this effort. Once we are able to do that, it will hold a very long way. It is not just about working on the children part. We need to work with the family. So, I completely agree with that.",2,496,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00496
2017-02-28-T-015,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Mr Dennis Tan, please keep your clarification short.",1,497,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00497
2017-02-28-T-015,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Thank you, Madam. Just a quick clarification for the Minister. Will the new regulations lead to increased compliance cost which may in turn lead to increased fees payable by parents? I am asking this because, currently, I think the existing fees are already a burden to many parents and I would like to know how the Ministry will manage this.",1,498,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00498
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, I have attempted to address this at length during my speech but it is worth repeating. From a perspective, one could naturally imagine how this could lead to higher compliance cost, and so on.",1,499,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00499
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We do not anticipate there to be significant cost increases as a result of this Act. Why do we say this? In the process of coming up with this Act, we have been working very closely with the industry on how to unfold this, how these various measures would kick-in in very practical terms. Child care centres today, for example, already operate under a licensing regime. We are not starting from ground-zero. We have already embarked on that journey, and many of these players are already quite far in that journey. We are now, in some sense, formalising it. ECDA is also streamlining its regulatory requirements. We are very mindful as we implement this new Act. Even as we implement this, the requirements are not cast in stone now. Along the way, there may be push-back from the industry as certain unknown processes may turn out to be more cumbersome than they need to be and they add to costs, for this, we will look at it and see how to best calibrate it.",2,500,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00500

We do not expect the compliance cost to be onerous, and therefore, we are not expecting the Act to translate to higher fees.",3,501,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00501
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"It is important and I would say this, because I also do not want centres to then say, ""Oh, there is a new Bill; so no choice we have to increase fees."" Just a message to everyone, the new Bill should not lead to fee increases.",4,502,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00502
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Generally, the main cost drivers for pre-schools are rental and teachers' salaries. And we have no plans to change our space and teacher per child requirement as they are currently satisfactory. It is very important to take note of that. This, hopefully, is also for centres to take note that the main cost drivers are not changed under these requirements.",5,503,2017-02-28-T-015-S-00503
2017-02-28-T-015,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"ECDA is also studying other ways to lower cost of operations, for example, providing more flexibility in manpower deployment, something that we will be looking at to support the sector, by allowing operational staff to assist trained teachers, and so on. This space continues to evolve and we intend to strengthen it in many different ways not addressed under the Bill.

2017-02-28-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I did some quick homework to satisfy myself as to whether this barrage of criticisms by the businesses are fair and justifiable, or whether the Finance Minister is indeed doing the right thing from an economic management and, of course, from a prudence standpoint.",4,519,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00519
2017-02-28-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"So, let us start with the most recent economic numbers to see if the economy is indeed in a dismal state.",5,520,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00520
2017-02-28-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In the latest fourth quarter GDP numbers, the economy grew 12.3% quarter-on-quarter. It is the strongest quarterly growth recorded in six years and it translates into a 2.9% year-on-year growth for the fourth quarter. Granted that the key driver from the surge in growth came mainly from two manufacturing sectors; namely the semiconductor and the pharmaceutical sector, but we can expect spill-over effects to other sectors supporting these two sectors such as precision engineering, transport, warehousing, financial and other supporting services.",6,521,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00521
2017-02-28-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Importantly, we have also seen credible growth from the services sector which account for about two-thirds of the economy. The sector grew by 8.4% quarter-on-quarter and 1% year-on-year.",7,522,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00522
2017-02-28-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"So, clearly, from a data standpoint, we are not seeing the sort of sharp contraction similar to what we saw in recent downturns. And hence, it may not warrant the Government to roll out a massive rescue package to save the economy but rather to continue with and enhance existing schemes to assist businesses which include the cash schemes, like the Wage Credit and the additional SEC. These are in addition to the other assistance measures in the Budget, some of which were recommended by the CFE. So, in my view, the Finance Minister has struck the appropriate balance here.",8,523,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00523
2017-02-28-T-016,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"However, it is worth noting that we are seeing the new realities of our economy setting in. Firstly, the uneven nature of the growth and secondly, the overall low and flat growth trajectory. This probably explained why some businesses are feeling downbeat. In particular, businesses are beginning to feel effects of life under a slower 2% growth environment; compare to what used to be a 3% to 5% growth a few years ago.",9,524,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00524

In this new fast-pace ever-changing landscape, having a well thought out strategy and clear directions as to where we should go will put us in a pole position.

There is no other more enterprise-centric way to carry this out than to go one-on-one with enterprises, offering step-by-step advice on the technologies to use at each stage of the growth, roping in resources from IMDA, SPRING and other lead agencies, giving some funding to those that are ready to pilot emerging ICT solutions and starting with sectors that are in greatest need to improve productivity.

Often, decisive actions are needed to fast track or build such capabilities ahead of time. Private sector may not always be commercially aligned to the ultimate National objectives and may have other nuances or take longer to mobilise, for example. A case in point is the setting up of the National digital payments system, which was suggested by the GPC to CFE, where leaving it to the private sector may take ages to happen, given the multiple commercial stakeholders involved.",27,542,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00542

Through the ITM platforms, more R&D support such as RIE2020 can be made available to promising local enterprises to develop breakthrough and trendsetting products and services. Currently, most of our R&D resources are being utilised by very large companies.

Indeed, this is one of the bold ideas of the CFE. Under this initiative, the Government will commit capital through a Temasek-linked fund to co-invest with a Singapore-based company. Such equity injection, which tends to be longer term in horizon, would be a good source of patient capital as well as a confidence and rating boost for the company. It also gives the Government a greater handle in keeping the company's HQ and core operations rooted in Singapore. And should the company's owner decides to cash out and sell their stakes, the Government's equity stake in the company would better able to help retain the value in Singapore. These requirements should be clearly stated in the investment mandate.",35,550,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00550

So, while I can appreciate the need to make training more accessible via e-learning platforms, I am not sure that a modularised and technology-enabled training programme can achieve the right depth and rigour to meet needs of the market place. But I fully agree we need to strengthen on-the-job skills utilisation and to urge employers and TACs to take the lead in the design and structuring of skills upgrade.

Matured students with their rich life and workplace experience can bring useful perspectives to the classroom, even as they learn new skills there.

That was in 2009 when the economy contracted by 17% the quarter preceding and a negative growth of 2% to 5% was forecasted for that year.

Rather we must take some bets directionally, and that enables us to be ready but be prepared to adjust and adapt to the changes that will unfold.

2017-02-28-T-016,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Another area I would like to touch on is driving transformation and growth need strong leadership. As we know, successful reinvention, business change and innovation require strong leadership. The introduction of the SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative is definitely welcomed. But I do see that the emphasis of the programme seems to be on developing these leaders to support companies expanding overseas and going global. And I think that is important, but it is also important to stress the need that this initiative gives similar attention to building capable leaders to lead and drive businesses in Singapore. In order for our businesses to expand and scale, they need strong leaders to make decisions, transform and grow the businesses locally. There are good examples of MNCs already doing this. There are those examples today, but we need more. Because with the pace of change, this needs to be done.",13,580,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00580

2017-02-28-T-016,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"I am not going to speak about the specific measures but I like to touch on one segment of the workforce, that is the middle income and middle-aged. While there are other segments of the workforce impacted by the disruption, this is a talent base that is significantly impacted by the transformation of businesses. With an ageing population, a highly-educated workforce and PMETs forming more than 50% of our workforce, this group will need attention to manage the transition in work to different roles, or across industries or from employment to becoming entrepreneurs. Across several economies, we are already seeing a growing discontent amongst those in the middle income. We must ensure that the measures are effective in enabling this segment to deepen their skills and adapt and grow. Driving innovation will require deep skills.",16,583,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00583
2017-02-28-T-016,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"I want to also share a point that we need to ensure that this group continues to see that the opportunities that they have are not about transitioning, and not just about finding employment, but that they can find fulfilling jobs and see opportunity to improve their lives and that of their families. The then US Vice-President Joe Biden in a keynote address at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2016 told participants ""the middle class is about possibilities − the possibilities for anyone willing to work hard to achieve a decent life"". He said that a thriving and growing middle class has been the main reason for social stability in the world's democracies.",17,584,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00584

I strongly believe that if we strengthen the Singapore Core, and give our people confidence and hope in the future, we will have a culture of growth and learning, but we must continue to remain open.

On the point of definition of who needs help and how the help is extended. When distributing rebates and subsidies given, we do all understand the finite resources and budgets. I do agree that there must be criteria for qualification. Our current approach uses size and value of housing type as the primary factor for qualification. The criterion is also not based on ownership, but on the type of housing you live in. While logical, this may no longer be as valid or accurate. There are some living in HDB flats who may not be worse off than someone living in a private property.",19,586,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00586

But I do feel that we need to relook at our approach. I am not asking that we grow the size of the number of people getting help as it will not be fiscally sustainable to do so. What I am requesting is that we relook at the distribution to ensure that those who need help do receive it.,20,587,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00587

We do already have many platforms of recognising people from all walks of life and professions and we must continue to do so. I recall NS50 is a recent example of a platform to recognise the efforts of National Servicemen past and present including bringing them together and sharing their experiences.

Low headline unemployment belies deepening insecurity in the job market, with rising redundancies, reports of under-employment and more people taking up jobs in the less secure gig economy, not all from choice.

The Government has decided to raise water tariffs to ensure the sustainability of our supply, and to defray the costs of building NEWater and desalination plants, as well as the operational cost of water supply. But businesses feel that infrastructure is part of public service, and the Government should not compute this on a commercial basis.",4,633,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00633
2017-02-28-T-016,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"The major concern of businesses is operating costs, while the Government's concern is the nation's mid- to long-term competitiveness. How to strike a balance can be challenging. Currently, Singapore's external business environment is changing. Countries which were previously more advanced than we were, are now becoming less expensive; countries which were less expensive than us, have become more advanced. Our Singapore companies have to innovate in order to adapt to this new business environment.",5,634,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00634
2017-02-28-T-016,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"The Government encourages companies to innovate and internationalise. This is the right approach. At the same time, businesses also hope that the Government could apply a new mindset to plan its expenditures. Going forward, there are still many areas that need expenditure, such as social development, healthcare, environmental protection, defence and foreign affairs. In order to increase revenue, the Government is likely to continue to adjust other taxes.",6,635,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00635
2017-02-28-T-016,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"Let us look at some numbers. In 2011, the Government's total expenditure was $46.6 billion, and by 2017 it had increased to $75.1 billion, which is more than 60%. Government revenue comes from two sources, one is taxes and fees, and the other is Government's investment returns. The economic outlook will not be rosy in the days ahead. If businesses cannot raise their competitiveness and increase their profits, tax revenues will not increase. Similarly, the Government's investments are inextricably linked to the economic situation. If the economy is weak, there would be no magical formula to turn stone into gold.",7,636,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00636

One is ""broaden the sources of income and cut costs"" and the other is ""live within our means"". The meaning of the first idiom is to increase income and save on spending; the second idiom means to spend based on one's income.

Now, should not we begin to review if this is the right way of spending? Just because it was correct before does not mean it is correct now. Our thinking should not be based on what we are used to.

Many MNCs have set up their regional headquarters in Singapore. Our own companies should also use Singapore as their regional headquarters and venture overseas boldly. The Government should give support to those local companies which have the gumption and willing to go do so, be they traditional industries or emerging industries.

At the same time, businesses should also review the internal factors which could contribute to their operation problems to see whether it is their product quality and service standards that are not up to the mark, or it is their business model that is outdated. During this economic transformation period, companies, especially Chambers and trades associations, should play a more proactive role. They should work closely with the Government, based on their industry's specific circumstances.

I like the fact that the Government is trying to prepare Singapore for the future economy and to sustain employment for the seniors.

It is a clear indication that the Government cares for our younger generation. I hope that younger Singaporeans hoping to start a new family will consider the option of buying a resale flat with the increased housing grant. I also want to say that I appreciate the increase in GST Voucher, U-save rebates, the cash special payment and the increase in S&CC rebates. All these would provide much needed relief for the average Singaporeans who face a higher cost of living expenses.",2,643,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00643

The feedback which I have received is that many of the budgetary measures in this year's Budget would only help a specific segment of the business community. The focus of the Government is to strengthen capabilities for the future. Thus, for some of the smaller businesses, this year's Budget may not be a major event. It has little positive impact for them. And instead, some of the measures taken to protect the environment and the water price increases may hurt them more.",5,646,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00646

What they are appealing for is a business climate which is less costly and friendlier to businesses. As it stands, property related costs is still very high. I urge the Government to consider some additional measures, for example, a rental rebate for all tenancies where JTC or HDB is the landlord, or a property tax relief which landlords of private properties must pass on to their tenants.",6,647,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00647

There is also the perception that it is not easy to get such loans. How can the Government do more to reach out to the many SMEs who are looking for a lifeline for their businesses? Can the Government elaborate on their plans to conduct more outreach to the SME on all the available help? Would the Government also consider a one year stay on all foreign workers' levy (FWL) hike until the economic situation has stabilised?",7,648,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00648

They feel penalised simply because they were trying their best to live their aspirations in the past.

If they stay in HDB flats, they may receive a smaller S&CC rebate.

There is never a good time to raise prices for utilities. However, increasing the price of water in times of economic uncertainty is definitely not a good time. Let me stress that I totally agree with the Finance Minister that water is critical to our survival and we need to take adequate measures to conserve water. But sadly, the 30% increase in water prices seems to have distracted from the main intent of the Budget. And due to rumour-mongering, many people seem to have been so caught up and so concerned over this 30% water price increase such that they seem to have forgotten or ignored the various other measures that the Government has introduced to help Singaporeans mitigate the price increase.",14,655,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00655

On the flip side, high-income earners will be receiving the full $500 tax rebate.

On the other hand, because service-based leaders are committed to the personal and professional growth of their workers, growth will benefit everyone.",28,686,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00686

For five consecutive years, total growth in revenue has outstripped growth in operating revenue, and our Budget is getting tighter every year. This is the third consecutive Budget that reflects a basic deficit. We expect only a modest overall surplus of $1.9 billion after taking into account the significant Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) of $14.1 billion from past reserves. Additional funds that were afforded by the inclusion of Temasek in the NIRC starting year 2016, not too long ago, appears to have been exhausted quickly − this is worrying.",2,706,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00706

This has rekindled fears of new and higher taxes, including GST hikes. There are those who would advocate tapping our reserves further, and others like myself who would call for a cap on how much we should take from NIRC to fund our expenses.

I would like to ask the Minister what other budget mechanisms are in place to encourage savings across the Ministries, including rationalising roles and functions of agencies as well as extracting cost synergies from cross-agency collaboration.

I am encouraged by the efforts of the Committee of Future Economy (CFE). The seven strategies put forward by CFE form a comprehensive plan to capture the opportunities of the future economic landscape. But it is one thing to strategise, but quite another to execute. The 22 sets, I counted, of recommendations spelt out in the CFE report all seem to be the right things to do. But, taken together, I cannot help but felt a little overwhelm with the long list of tasks ahead to reposition Singapore. From deepening our knowledge of markets, acquiring better skills, strengthening innovation ecosystems, to developing and implementing 23 Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs). These lofty objectives demand significant change and adaptation involving Government agencies, companies and people, working in unison. How Singapore executes as a team, with each pulling its own weight, will make the difference.",5,709,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00709

In this context, I commend the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) for leading the way. To meet their ambition of building a Smart Financial Centre, MAS instituted the concept of ""regulatory sandboxes"" to enable fintech experiments and trials of promising innovations, to be tested in the market with appropriate safeguards.",6,710,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00710

MAS intends to simplify the venture capital regime, introduce dual-class share structures, strengthen the role of finance companies and develop private market platforms. It is also actively laying down technology infrastructure to drive innovation, including an electronic trade finance platform, infrastructure to enable the pervasive use of e-payments and an industry know-your-customer utility, the first of its kind that I know of, that will greatly improve productivity of banks when on-boarding clients and managing money laundering risks. These wide-ranging policy measures set a great example of forward-looking regulations which creates a dynamic ecosystem that enables growth and innovation.

With the development of ITMs for 23 sectors, covering 80% of our economy, the Government has offered support to all sectors, not just selected ones, to seize growth opportunities and make the necessary transition. Through ITMs, industries with good growth prospects can take advantage of global opportunities and technology whilst domestically-focused industries, such as food services, will get support to increase productivity and upgrade jobs.

It is heart-breaking to encounter stories of families impacted by retrenchments, and my sense is that increasing numbers of PMEs, especially older ones, are being displaced. Whilst I appreciate that Adapt and Grow has launched an extensive set of programmes to help workers take on new jobs, I call on the Government to consider some short-term measures to help families cope during this transition. For example, during periods of unemployment, would the Government consider suspending the retrenched workers' payment of income tax instalments and allow some flexible use of CPF to pay mortgages, so as to help them keep their homes?",12,716,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00716

It is apparent that if 21st century economies are not to create a massive underclass, policymakers need to urgently work out how to help their citizens learn while they earn. The need for new and constantly updated skills in the new economy is universal, and many countries are ill-equipped to do so. Unfortunately, lifelong learning in most societies is undertaken by those who are already doing well, and is therefore likely to widen the gap of inequality rather than narrow it.

My worry is that not enough of us accept this as a personal risk and do not proactively seek to future-proof ourselves. Some of those who lost their jobs may have found relief as Uber drivers − itself a fortuitous result of industry disruption − but I fear this too could be a short-lived job, with the advancement of self-driving technologies.

In recent years, water reservoirs, desalination plant and water supply from Malaysia and other water issues have been better resolved. We already have more choices when it comes to water supply.

2017-02-28-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Yes, there are several ""pain points"" in this year's Budget where the prices of some goods and services have to be adjusted to reflect the cost of providing those services or to increase social awareness about environmental sustainability. But these ""pain points"", however, are also mitigated by the various grants and subsidies that that Government will implement. These policies will ensure that those in our society who need an extra helping hand should not be in a significantly worse off position after the adjustments. I would like to elaborate on some initiatives in the Budget that I think will help to continue to steer Singapore on this right path to keep us going as that ""nimble"" Seal Team Six.",7,739,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00739
2017-02-28-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"First of all, helping SMEs. We all agree that SMEs form the bulk of the number of businesses in our economy. Despite their significant contributions to our economy, however, our SMEs do face serious challenges moving forward.",8,740,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00740
2017-02-28-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"First, many continue to lack in their digital capabilities and the ability to tap on newer technologies to improve productivity and service delivery. Second, they lack the resources and expertise to truly internationalise. Finally, there are few, if any, holistic industry-wide initiatives to help them transit their businesses to the new economy. I am glad that the Government is cognisant of these challenges and the Budget has targeted programmes to help our SMEs overcome them.",9,741,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00741
2017-02-28-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"It is crucial that we help our SMEs scale up their digital capabilities in the era of e-commerce and ""click 'n' mortar"" businesses. While it is unlikely that digital platforms and online business models will completely supplant traditional modes of business, our SMEs cannot afford to assume that they can continue to operate the way that they have been operating. So, the implementation of the Industry Digital Plans and the setting up of the SME Technology Hub will provide our SMEs with the much needed baseline assistance to digitalise their businesses, and I am eager to hear more details from MCI during the COS debate.",10,742,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00742
2017-02-28-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"We should, however, go beyond this baseline assistance. The crux to a successful digital transformation is to have a talent pool that businesses can tap into. This is especially important for SMEs since SMEs are traditionally not the first choice of employment for many of our graduates. While the Government can help to nurture a pool of digital talent, I believe SMEs themselves need to ensure that they can provide a good career path for these talents.",11,743,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00743
2017-02-28-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"The career paths in SMEs can be increased by potentially increasing their level of internationalisation. An SME with regional or global presence is definitely in a better position to offer attractive careers to digital talents and also other professionals, as the scope and nature of their operations will offer the requisite job challenge and development opportunities. The International Partnership Fund proposed in the Budget will help catalyse the regionalisation of our SMEs. The devil, of course, is in the details of implementation.",12,744,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00744
2017-02-28-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"The Government is not in the business of picking winners and losers, so guidelines and assessment processes must be put in place to ensure that the funds that are set aside are used to support SMEs that have the best potential to internationalise. The assessment criteria and methods must be appropriate and transparent, and support must be given to high-potential SMEs regardless of their size.",13,745,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00745
2017-02-28-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to speak a little on supporting families in housing. The Government has, in recent years, implemented a number of different measures to help Singaporeans own their own homes. I am glad that this year's Budget has continued on this trajectory by providing greater financial support to Singaporeans who wish to purchase a flat in the resale market. This group of Singaporeans are typically those who wish to start their family and also want to live near their parents for the supportive network.",14,746,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00746
2017-02-28-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"The current CPF housing grants for both 4- and 5-room flats are similar at $30,000. The new grant structure, however, would provide those who purchase a 4-room flat a higher grant than those who purchase a 5-room flat. While I appreciate the rationale that the Government would not want to subsidise those who purchase bigger flats too much, as they are likely be from a higher income group, I think we cannot ignore that some consumers might choose to purchase a 4-room flat due to the fact that it is more expensive than a 5-room flat because of its location, age and other factors. Conversely, some consumers with a lower income might have to purchase a 5-room flat, as opposed to a more expensive 4-room flat in other locations, due to their family requirements as well.",15,747,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00747
2017-02-28-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"In view of these idiosyncrasies, would the Government consider providing a percentage-grant based on the purchase price of the flat? But this amount would be subject to an absolute ceiling amount, and whichever amount is then higher would be given to the qualifying purchaser as the housing grant.",16,748,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00748
2017-02-28-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"On to household measures, Mr Deputy Speaker. The recent Budget saw increases in the prices of water and diesel, and soon, Town Councils will be increasing their S&CC rates to meet rising costs, especially with regard to servicing and eventually replacing lifts.",17,749,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00749
2017-02-28-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Singaporeans are concerned that that is too many bullets to bite at a go. Although Singapore has experienced modest GDP growth over the past few years with real median wage growing by 2.6% per annum, from 2009 to 2016, the impact of these growth figures has not be felt equally across all sectors of the economy and strata of the society. Indeed, some segments of the population are concerned that the recent increases would pose additional constraints on their finances, and these concerns are somewhat justified.",18,750,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00750
2017-02-28-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"I am thus heartened to know that the Budget has provided various avenues of support through the form of GST Vouchers, S&CC rebates, and personal income tax rebates. As Singapore's economy enters a period of low growth and more employees are at risk of losing their job due to structural changes in the economy, I hope that the Government will review its existing assistance schemes from time to time so that it remains responsive to the needs of the people.",19,751,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00751
2017-02-28-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this year's Budget is unique in its approach in laying the necessary foundations to support Singapore's growth for the next five to 10 years. Rather than having a broad-based Budget that hopes to raise all boats by lifting the overall level of the tide, the Budget is measured and its initiatives are targeted at giving specific help to those that need help the most.",20,752,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00752
2017-02-28-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"More importantly, it reflects the Singapore ethos of fiscal prudence and the belief that the future of Singapore depends on the strong partnership between Government, business and people. And I stress again, we are people that are not cowering in the dark or in the cold and the wet, we are people that are getting ready and preparing ourselves, whatever may come next. It is not so much wait and see but being prepared.",21,753,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00753
2017-02-28-T-016,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"I believe that implemented well, this year's Budget, together with the recommendations of the Committee on the Future Economy, will form a roadmap that will help us to navigate the global uncertainty and possible economic headwinds that Singapore will face. With that, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I conclude my speech in support of the Budget.",22,754,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00754

2017-02-28-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"First, in connection with the Government's measures to support businesses, I wish to highlight the cash flow problems faced by some SMEs arising from big companies holding back on prompt settlement of their invoices.",2,756,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00756
2017-02-28-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"From feedback received, some big companies leverage on their economic power against SMEs by delaying payment on invoices for goods and services. If the shoe was on the other foot, these big companies may not hesitate to impose interest for late payment in addition to the principal amounts.",3,757,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00757
2017-02-28-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Micro SMEs are in particular vulnerable because, on one hand, they do not want to upset the commercial relationship with the big companies. Yet, on the other hand, especially in a period of slow economic growth, the delay in payment may tip the SMEs to cash flow difficulties, higher litigation risk and even insolvency.",4,758,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00758
2017-02-28-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"To ameliorate the effect on these SMEs, I have two suggestions.",5,759,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00759
2017-02-28-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"First, I wonder if the Government could consider extending the scope of the SME Working Capital Loan, under which the Government assumes the risk for loan defaults, to allow SMEs to collateralise their receivables owed by big companies for loans at low interest rates. This would give SMEs more flexibility in managing their cash flow. Whilst factoring arrangements may be available to SMEs, this comes at a cost and means a further erosion of their profit margin.",6,760,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00760
2017-02-28-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Second, I suggest that the framework in the BCA Security of Payment Act for the building and construction industry, which allows the employer to make payments directly to a subcontractor when the main contractor fails to do so, be extended to other industries where such multi-tiered relationships also exist. In this way, SMEs may, in appropriate situations, utilise the framework to obtain payment on overdue invoices.",7,761,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00761
2017-02-28-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The next point I wish to make concerns the Wage Credit Scheme. Under this Scheme, the Government co-funds 40% of wage increases for Singaporean employees earning gross monthly salaries of $4,000, which is roughly about the 50th percentile of wages in Singapore, and below. This Scheme is extended by two years under the Government's plan to continue supporting businesses.",8,762,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00762
2017-02-28-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"As may be recalled, the Wage Credit Scheme was introduced in Budget 2013. The purpose behind the Scheme is to help businesses cope with rising wage costs in a tight labour market. The idea is to encourage businesses to invest in and make productivity gains. These gains are to be shared with the employees.",9,763,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00763
2017-02-28-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In light of the Government's decision to extend the Scheme, may I please ask if the assessment in this economic climate is still that the businesses are continuing to face a tight labour market vis-Ã-vis employees at the 50th percentile of wages and below?",10,764,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00764
2017-02-28-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Also, I would be grateful if the Minister could please let us know whether the effort to improve productivity amongst the businesses participating in the Scheme is paying off. I do appreciate it may be difficult to get details or data on a specific industry basis but, perhaps, at least at the general level.",11,765,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00765
2017-02-28-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Without the linkage to productivity and sharing of the gains with the employees, we run the danger of providing just a wage subsidy which, given the second extension of this Scheme, may become a crutch for the Government. This is something we should avoid.",12,766,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00766
2017-02-28-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Finally, I refer to the Government's plan to implement a carbon tax at a rate of between $10 and $20 per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions from 2019 on upstream emitters. I note that the industry consultation on the proposed carbon tax will take place from March 2017 with the final carbon tax and exact implementation schedule decided thereafter.",13,767,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00767
2017-02-28-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In principle, I support the premise behind the imposition of a carbon tax; that Singapore should do her part to address climate change, to create a sustainable environmental future for our children and generations after.",14,768,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00768
2017-02-28-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Indicating a carbon tax range, as opposed to a specific rate, however, may create some uncertainty as companies would not be in a position to properly make business decisions in anticipation of the precise carbon tax rate which can be anywhere between 10% and 20% per year. This may have knock-on effects, for example, companies prematurely passing costs to consumers in advance of the implementation of the tax, something we must certainly guard against, or not provisioning or investing sufficiently to mitigate the effects of the carbon tax on their businesses.",15,769,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00769
2017-02-28-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"As a comparison, with respect to Goods and Services Tax (GST), the Government issued a White Paper on GST on 9 February 1993, in which the 3% rate was stated. Thereafter, the GST Bill was introduced later in the same month with the rate of 3% also stipulated in the Bill itself. Further, during the debate of the GST Bill in Parliament the following month, the Government gave an undertaking that the GST rate of 3% would not be changed for at least five years.",16,770,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00770
2017-02-28-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"For the above reasons, I respectfully suggest that the consultations be speeded up and a decision be made as soon as practicable on the precise carbon tax rate, the implementation schedule and the measures to ease the transition for affected companies. With the uncertainty removed, the companies will be able to focus on the improvements they need to make to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",17,771,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00771
2017-02-28-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Notwithstanding the points that I have made, I support the Budget. In my view, the hon Minister for Finance has, in his speech, properly identified the main economic challenges that we face as a country and clearly outlined a rigorous plan to strengthen our economy and allow us, as a nation, to continue to move forward together.",18,772,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00772
2017-02-28-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In this regard, I respectfully disagree with the hon Non-Constituency Member of Parliament Assoc Prof Goh's categorisation of this Budget as a minimalist Budget. A cursory review of these Budget details will reveal otherwise. Just for an example, $600 million is being set aside for the Wage Credit Scheme to allow companies to use this Scheme to pay wage rises for Singaporeans. In particular, the serious investment in relation to helping Singaporeans deepen their skills, companies to deepen their partnerships, and to basically look out for opportunities in the digitalisation space.",19,773,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00773
2017-02-28-T-016,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"So, this is far from being a static Budget. It is a Budget that would allow us to reposition ourselves and focus on the opportunities for the future.",20,774,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00774
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have your permission to use some slides in the course of my speech.",1,775,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00775
2017-02-28-T-016,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,776,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00776
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate. In the week of the CFE report and also the Budget Statement delivered by the Finance Minister last week, there has been much discussion on the economy in the lead-up to this particular debate.",1,777,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00777
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"There are three central questions that we need to think about. The first is where the opportunities are; the second, how do we position ourselves to seize them, and the third, what do we need to do to deal with some of the short-term challenges. These involve important policy decisions and trade-offs. These are questions that several Members have echoed today. I would like to share my views on this.",2,778,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00778
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"First on the economy as a whole. Last year our economy grew at 2%, with growth picking up in the final quarter. Between 2011 and 2016, we averaged 3.1% which is comparable to other advanced and regional economies, as Members can see from the chart. The Committee on the Future Economy (CFE) expects annual growth of 2% to 3% over the next decade. This may be less than what we have been accustomed to in the past, but it is totally consistent with our stage of economic development, our demographic profile. So, we need to ensure that within the context of where we are today, we continue to emphasise productivity and innovation as part of the basis for our continued growth. Because even at these levels of economic growth, which are not insignificant by international comparisons, it will continue to allow us to create opportunities for our businesses and jobs for our people.",3,779,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00779
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"This point is further enhanced when we consider the context that we are in, that is the region. We are in the heart of a region that is an important driver of global economic growth. ASEAN, China and India are bright spots, with the ASEAN-5 countries expected to grow at 4.9% this year, China at about 6.7% and India at about 6.6%. Their growth emanates not just from the key regions and main cities or metros that we are all quite familiar with but, in fact, they come from the next tier of cities and regions with which we might be less familiar. In China, from the Central and Western regions; in India, from secondary cities like Coimbatore, Pune and Jaipur; and in Indonesia, cities like Semarang and Medan offer interesting opportunities.",4,780,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00780
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In fact, the recent data that the Singapore Tourism Board put out on visitor arrivals, which was strong last year, were actually significantly supported by the efforts that STB made in the secondary markets and regions with the consequential response from the markets. So, we need to go beyond traditional spaces and we need to deepen our knowledge and acquire a more nuanced understanding of these new markets.",5,781,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00781
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In tandem with this growth in the region, we are seeing rapid urbanisation and the rise of the Asian middle class with greater disposable incomes and sophisticated demand in sectors like retail, lifestyle, F&B, education and healthcare. These opportunities play to our strengths, those that we have developed over the years.",6,782,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00782
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"One example I want to cite is in the area of infrastructure and urban solutions. McKinsey estimates that the demand for infrastructure in emerging Asian markets, particularly China, Southeast Asia and South Asia, will grow by about US$20 trillion between 2016 and 2030. China's Belt and Road initiative has heightened interest in regional infrastructure projects, whether it is road, rail, ports, airports. India's plan to build 100 smart cities needs adaptable and high quality urban solutions. Our infrastructure and urban solutions companies are generally held in very high regard and they can participate in these opportunities, in partnerships with their Chinese, Indian and Southeast Asian counterparts.",7,783,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00783
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"This is not just an opportunity for the big players in this space. In fact, it extends to SMEs like Memiontec and WaterTech Private Limited, who tapped into the demand for small-scale water and energy solutions in the region, and there are many of these that are emerging. This is one of the reasons why in this Budget, in particular, there was an effort to enhance the measures that we have already taken to support infrastructure. If Members would recall, when the ESC concluded its findings, this was about six, seven years ago, one of the initiatives was to set up the Clifford Capital which is just to finance many of our infrastructure projects. In this Budget, a key initiative is really the extension of our IFS Scheme to Non-Recourse Financing. I will elaborate on that but, essentially, it is aimed to help our smaller businesses who are in this space to go regional, to seek out new opportunities.",8,784,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00784
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The other area I want to emphasise is the digital economy which also presents unprecedented opportunities. Think about it. The smallest company can now seek out customers in the furthest markets as long as there is digital access. What it means also is that through the digital platform, they can transact with their business partners, they can coordinate logistics and they can effect payment systems. This is literally transformative and it is transforming industries and offering new ways to overcome our constraints and seek out new opportunities.",9,785,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00785
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"That is why in the CFE, we have emphasised the importance of enabling our companies to harness digital technologies and platforms. Some companies have already made the move. I can just give Members one example from a somewhat traditional sector − HipVan. It is a company in the furniture business but they have inverted the traditional furniture business model by going online. Customers transact with them over the Internet and then they work through logistics and delivery, and this is a new model for this company, quite different from what we understand to be furniture businesses.",10,786,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00786
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, companies are already moving and similarly, we are seeing good collaborative initiatives from big players and others coming on board. For example, just today, Singtel, which is a co-founder of the 99% SME movement, announced a partnership with Lazada to set up an SME e-marketplace. That will help SMEs step into a wider online customer base.",11,787,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00787
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I can go on and give Members many other examples, whether it is in advanced manufacturing and Internet of things, and so on. But my key point is this. There are significant opportunities available to us. Our challenge is ensuring that our companies, especially our SMEs, are geared up for the longer term, so that they can seize these opportunities. This is especially important if we are to sustain our competitiveness because others around us have also seen this and are also adapting. It is a race. But we think it is a race that we can compete in quite effectively. So, a key focus of the Government's economic efforts is, indeed, in how we bring about such transformation. Hence, the Industry Transformation Maps. They are the key modality with three broad areas.",12,788,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00788
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"First, to grow top-line and scale, through support for companies and internationalising and financing.",13,789,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00789
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Second, to stay competitive by supporting capability development, both to innovate and to raise their productivity.",14,790,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00790
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Third, to develop deep skills in our workers.",15,791,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00791
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In all of these efforts, the primary focus and beneficiaries are our SMEs. I want to emphasise that. They are the primary focus and beneficiaries. And this is for good reasons.",16,792,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00792
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Firstly, they are of a significant part of our economy. They account for about half of our GDP, two-thirds of employment. If you are really going to effect change and transformation in industry in the economy, the SMEs are key change agents. They have to accept the reality, embrace the change and be change agents.",17,793,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00793
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Secondly, individually, SMEs often lack the scale to make the investments that are necessary to cope with the changes taking place and to benefit fully from the technologies that we are talking about.",18,794,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00794
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Finally, we also believe that SMEs are a key engine of growth for the future in Singapore, and integral to the competitiveness of our economic clusters. As they scale, SMEs will create more opportunities and jobs for Singaporeans.",19,795,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00795
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, the Government is resolute in our commitment to help our SMEs make this transformation successfully. Large companies do not necessarily need this breadth and depth of support. In fact, it is the small companies that need them.",20,796,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00796
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,Let me outline five areas in which we are actually delivering this support.,21,797,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00797
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Firstly, internationalisation. If you are a company taking the first steps towards internationalisation, you can tap on IE's Market Readiness Assistance and Global Company Partnership Scheme, and so on. It has about $40 million in grants. Essentially, the aim is to help our businesses go international. Some are taking tentative steps, others are a little bit more experienced. But they have to go into newer and more risky markets. In general, we are trying to help them to take that move forward. I want to stress here that the Government can be an enabler, but we cannot make the decision for the company. But once a company makes the decision ‒ the leadership and the people ‒ we can support them in the effort.",22,798,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00798
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In this Budget specifically, there is a $600 million International Partnership Fund. It is a co-investment effort with firms as they expand overseas. In other words, beyond loans and financial assistance and grants, the Government is prepared to come in through equity as well. This is an important commitment on the part of the Government, and we are putting our money where our mouth is, quite literally.",23,799,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00799
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Secondly, financing. The Government has a suite of loan programmes which will collectively catalyse $5 billion in loans up to 2020. I do not want to get into a laundry list, but it includes, for example, the SME Equipment and Factory Loan, which is for expansion overseas. So, if you are going overseas, you have done your market studies, you have decided you want to go, but there is capital expenditure (capex), this scheme helps you. You have got to make the move. The MAS has also recently reviewed regulations that will enhance the ability of finance companies to provide financing to SMEs.",24,800,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00800
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I mentioned earlier the infrastructure sector. In this Budget, the specific announcement was on the Internationalisation Finance Scheme (IFS) for Non-Recourse Financing to help SMEs participate in these opportunities. This scheme is designed to encourage financial institutions to provide non-recourse loans to SMEs once projects move into the post-construction stage, so that SMEs can free up their balance sheets to take on new projects. The constraint today is that, if you are a small business going in for a $50 million or $100 million project in the region, you will have to tie up your resources either through personal guarantees or corporate guarantees, and it limits your ability to take on new projects. This scheme is targeted to help our businesses do more and do it in an effective way. Over the next five years, we expect to catalyse $600 million dollars in loans, which will probably correspond to about $1 billion in infrastructure projects. And I am talking here about the small businesses, not the big players.",25,801,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00801
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Thirdly, on innovation. We want SMEs to create new products and services ‒ that is what they want to do as well ‒ to differentiate themselves in the market, but they are constrained by resources that are available. I think several Members talked about this earlier. So, we have a range of schemes. One is to help SMEs commercialise intellectual property through our network of Centres of Innovation, and a substantial amount of funding has been committed, about $100 million for this. And to help them build up their innovation capabilities, we also have the secondment of our public sector researchers through our SMEs. They go there, they help them come up with their R&D blueprint, and they also, in many cases, end up joining the SMEs, sometimes to the chagrin of the research centre's director. But, in general, we are supportive of this because it is an important productive flow of talent between the public and the private sectors.",26,802,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00802
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In this Budget, there are two specific ideas which have been mooted and pushed out. One is A*STAR's Tech Access Initiative. Basically, it is to help SMEs access the more costly specialised equipment and to also get training and advice. In other words, this may be in our research institutes, and SMEs cannot afford to have it on their own, but they can go in there and use it under certain arrangements. The Headstart Programme, where A*STAR allows SMEs to enjoy royalty-free and exclusive IP licences for up to 18 months until recently. With this Budget, it has now gone up to 36 months.",27,803,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00803
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The fourth point is on capability development. The SMEs can tap on this grant ‒ Capability Development Grant (CDG) ‒ for larger scale projects. So, if it is automation, there is the Automation Support Package, and I think Members are familiar with the scheme that was introduced last year. There is also the Innovation and Capability Voucher (ICV). Importantly, the point I want to stress is, we have what we call the Partnerships for Capability Transformation. This is where SMEs collaborate with big companies in order to develop new capabilities. This is key, because many of our SMEs are an integral part of a cluster. They work with the core company ‒ a big player ‒ international, local or foreign. And the SMEs' capabilities reinforce the competitiveness of the cluster as a whole and its sustainability in our environment.",28,804,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00804
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Many Members have talked about the Go Digital Programme. I do not propose to elaborate on it other than to observe that this is, again, a key plank. Big companies do not need a Go Digital Programme. It is the SMEs that need it, and that is why we are doing it. In total, we have about $1.5 billion of grant support for such capability development of SMEs.",29,805,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00805
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Finally, a word on skills. We are making significant investment in developing the skills of our people. Members are very familiar with this through SkillsFuture. The SMEs can tap on these, whether it is SkillsFuture initiatives like the SME Talent Programme, SkillsFuture Mentors Scheme, and the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn programme.",30,806,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00806
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I have taken Members on a tour of the kind of things that we are doing with our companies. Sometimes, the criticism is ""Oh, it is all too complicated and so on"". It is not so much that there is too little, but there is too much and too variegated. Even on that score, our agencies have worked on how we can make Government support more accessible to SMEs. So, they have got the Business Grants Portal, SME Digital Technology Hub and the new IP Master Agreement.",31,807,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00807
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But let me cut to the chase. If you are an SME, you have a need in these areas, go to an SME Centre or go to one of the economic agencies. There is no wrong door. They will help you navigate and sort it out. That is a backend issue. The key point is we have this plethora of support.",32,808,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00808
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, I am surprised when Mr Leon Perera earlier said that we have missed an opportunity to strengthen local enterprises. I have just given Members a complete ‒ and this is not an exhaustive ‒ list of the various initiatives that we have undertaken. So, how is it a missed opportunity? Perhaps, the key point the Member was trying to make is that the Government should get into the business of picking more winners, because I think the Member described it as a bold initiative. Go in there, back a company. If it fails or does not meet up to expectations, pull out. It is an interesting idea, but Mr Perera has omitted important details and how we would execute this and why the Government would be the right party to do this. Because if the Government backs a company, it goes with whatever initiative, and then the initiative goes south, and then Government decides that it is going to withdraw the support, I think we can anticipate the kind of debate we would have and, indeed, the kind of questions that Mr Leon Perera will then pose on ""Why did you do it in this way? Why did you waste your funds here?"" or ""Why did you withdraw your support?""",33,809,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00809
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, I think we have to have a sense of perspective and balance. The Government is an important enabler. The Government is taking a view on certain industries and directions that we want to go. But, fundamentally, what we are trying to say is this  you are in an inherently more uncertain environment. Therefore, the emphasis on the broad range of capabilities that I have outlined and the broad scheme of measures that we have, are going to be the key platforms to raise the industry as a whole. Sure, the companies that are prepared to move further and go faster will receive more support. But that does not mean that we are picking winners. The winners are picking themselves and adapting to our schemes.",34,810,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00810
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,I want to emphasise that the impact of such schemes is really significantly amplified when we can get a collaborative effort going. That is why we have stressed the role of trade associations and chambers. We do not want to substitute business judgement or trade associations' and chambers' assessment of market conditions with bureaucratic views. We want it to be a complementary exercise.,35,811,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00811
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"One example I want to just share with Members is the logistics industry. Container Depot Association (Singapore) (CDAS) − probably not something that many Members are familiar with. But they have been involved in a major effort in terms of launching electronic container trucking system and they want to track the movement of their trucks, and it is going to enhance their supply chain and how they introduce efficiencies and the way they deploy their fleet and so on. This is an initiative that the CDAS came up with. They worked with SPRING Singapore and they got this executed. We want to see more of this because they understand the need, their members tell them what their issues are, we can appreciate that there may not be enough resources, but that is where we come in and may complement.",36,812,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00812
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Similarly, Singapore Logistics Association (SLA) has made initiatives in terms of going into a new market overseas and how they can help smaller businesses do that and also in the training of our workers.",37,813,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00813
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, I hope Members would agree with me that there is actually no lack of Government resolve or resources that are available to support our companies, especially our SMEs, make the transformation. But I know that there is a view ‒ and I think many of us have echoed that sentiment here ‒ that the current reality is the issue. We have challenges because of the cost and the pain and so on. The reality is also that the economic situation is variegated. You have sectors like electronics that grew at 15% last year. You have a sector like transport and storage that grew by 2.3% last year. You have a sector like marine and offshore engineering that has contracted for nine successive quarters. How do you come up with a programme that is supposed to help SMEs in all of these, beyond the measures that we have already undertaken?",38,814,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00814
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, these variations are there because the different sectors face diverse cyclical and structural challenges. For example, lower oil prices ‒ and some might argue that this might be a permanent shift ‒ have changed the demand patterns for the marine and offshore industry. It does not mean that they cannot do business, but they may have to adapt and also look at new opportunities.",39,815,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00815
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The retail industry is going through a major change because of disruptive technology, in particular, e-commerce. In fact, the adoption of e-commerce in Singapore is at a lower rate, compared to many markets around the world. So, if anything, the challenge is going to get greater, not lesser. It would really be quite futile for us to argue that we should resist such an overwhelming system level change, which, in fact, in aggregate, will bring benefits to consumers through businesses that respond to it and adapt to it and to the economy as a whole.",40,816,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00816
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Having said that, I think we are very clear that we recognise that there are immediate challenges that our SMEs are facing and we will continue to provide certain forms of short-term relief where they are necessary and through the system of broad-based support that we have built up over the years. One example is the Wage Credit, the Special Employment Credit and the extension of the additional SEC in this Budget to end of 2019. Collectively, this is about $1 billion in cash pay-outs to businesses in March this year. It is no mean sum. It is a significant outlay from the Government to alleviate some of the cost pressure on our businesses.",41,817,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00817
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Also, in terms of liquidity, we have introduced the SME Working Capital Loan in 2016, which has basically catalysed about $700 million in loans to about 4,300 SMEs. If you go beyond that, and you look at the broader pattern, I think there was some reference to rental and other business costs. I know that this is an area of concern. It comes up in many of our industry engagement exercises. But the reality also is that industrial, retail and office rentals have all deep fallen, and they fell in 2016 as well. And we, on our part, will continue to maintain a steady pipeline of industrial land and space to ensure that there is competitive pressure in the market and rentals remain affordable.",42,818,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00818
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, let me put it together to say that we have not introduced further broad-based measures because they are not quite warranted and properly not even appropriate for the circumstances that we are in. But have sustained what we already do − in some cases, extended down − and at the same time, put in place additional customised support for specific industries because of the circumstances that are quite divergent. As many Government leaders have said, we will continue to track the situation closely and to intervene where necessary.",43,819,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00819
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, if I can just give you an example − Marine and Offshore Engineering sector. Last December, we introduced the bridging loans and international finance scheme. It is not a panacea; it is not going to prevent consolidation which will occur to some extent in the industry. But what it will do is help address some of the liquidity issues that some of the strong companies are facing and potentially, also help them get financing for expansion when they go for new projects overseas because there was a general tightening for financing in the sector.",44,820,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00820
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,Another example is in the construction industry. It has been weighed down by the property market slowdown and economic uncertainties but we are bringing forward $700 million of public sector infrastructure projects which will start in FY17 and FY18.,45,821,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00821
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"These measures are an illustration of the Government responding with a more targeted response and support for SMEs and other businesses. It is a complement to the broad-based measures we already have in place, in response to the varied needs in the economy. And importantly, it is one aspect, even as we look at the longer term challenge and how we need to gear up for that.",46,822,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00822
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if I can summarise, we have significant opportunities before us. But to seize them, we have to invest in the capabilities of our economy, of our people and our enterprises, and especially so, with our SMEs. The most durable solution really lies in moving up the value chain, innovating, offering products and services that others are not offering, and adopting methods and techniques that will allow us to close some of the big gaps in productivity that we see when compared to international best practices.",47,823,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00823
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"As for the Government, we are resolute in our support, through broad-based and targeted programmes, to help our SMEs make the transition successful. We do not engage in the art, or perhaps, Mr Perera thinks it is the science of picking winners, but we will support companies that are prepared to make these important transitions because they see the benefit and they are prepared to take the important steps to move the organisation. In all of these efforts, the SMEs would be our central focus.",48,824,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00824
2017-02-28-T-016,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Ultimately, creating a vibrant, competitive industry with strong capabilities is the surest way of ensuring success of all our businesses, including the SMEs. And so we look forward to working closely with the trade associations and chambers, and the unions to ensure that we have a diverse enterprise eco-system, from start-ups to SMEs, to large local enterprises, to multi-nationals − we have a thriving SME community, and an economy that is rich with opportunities. Thank you, Deputy Speaker. [Applause]",49,825,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00825
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Deputy Speaker, this year's Budget has brought the focus on cost of living issues by way of an increase in water prices amongst other things. This increase comes on the back of a 15%-odd increase in HDB car park charges, higher electricity and gas charges and the announcement of higher Service and Conservancy rates all in the space of about three months. The Straits Times noted that the Government feedback channel REACH had identified cost of living as a key pre-Budget concern among Singaporeans.",1,826,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00826
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I have a few questions for the Government to understand the decision-making processes around the latest round of increases in water prices. The last time an announcement was made to raise water prices in 1997, prices were raised by 120% for households and 30% for industrial and commercial users over a four-year period.",2,827,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00827
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Government has stated in previous parliamentary replies that it prices water according to its Long-Run Marginal Cost or LMRC. To this end, the water tariff, water conservation tax and used water charges or waterborne fees are priced to reflect the cost of producing the next drop of potable water, which is, I quote, ""is likely to come from desalination and NEWater.""",3,828,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00828
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In announcing the opening of the fifth NEWater plant last month, the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources noted that there has been upward pressure on costs because of increases associated with asset replacement, energy and manpower. Can the Government share details on how the components of Long-Run Marginal Costs for water pricing are computed by the Public Utilities Board (PUB) and how it assesses when to increase the price of water?",4,829,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00829
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Can the Government also clarify if the maintenance and upkeep, and the associated manpower costs of current PUB assets, including thousands of kilometres of transmission networks and so forth, would have already been factored into the calculation of LRMC before the latest round of price hikes? Even so, it would be helpful to understand which variables of LRMC have changed from 1997 when the last price hike was announced, what is the range within each variable, and how often is the LRMC determined or re-determined?",5,830,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00830
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Can the Government also share how much it costs each desalination and NEWater plant to produce water today, especially since some of these plants operate on a private-public partnership basis? How do they compare with plants directly run by the PUB?",6,831,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00831
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Finally, when the PUB refers to the long-run in LRMC, what sort of time horizon is used for projection purposes and what are the population parametres for these projections? Are we looking at 2061 when the Water Agreement with Malaysia comes to an end, or is it when the PUB expects a doubling of Singapore's consumption in absolute terms for a much larger population and when 85% of our needs are projected to be met by NEWater and desalination? If this is so, what are the projections for expected water price hikes as the population grows?",7,832,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00832
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"It is noteworthy, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the PUB was able to bring down the cost of NEWater production from 2002 to 2004 from $1.30 to $1.15 per cubic metre as a result of more competitive membrane technologies. In 2003, a Straits Times article quoted then Prime Minister Goh assuring Singaporeans that, and I quote, ""the price of PUB water, which now costs $1.52 a cubic metre, would stay below $2 for some time, reversing all earlier projections. The sums were redone because desalinating sea water was cheaper than thought; and NEWater, even cheaper to produce.""",8,833,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00833
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The same year, it was reported that the Tuas desalination plant desalinates water at the cost of $0.78 per cubic metre. This compared very favourably against about $0.90 per cubic metre produced by the Ashkelon desalination plant in Israel, considered in 2003 to be the one of the cheapest producers of desalinated water. In 2008, Sembcorp, which secured the bid to design, build, own and operate the fifth and largest NEWater plant, submitted a first-year price of about $0.30 to produce a cubic metre of NEWater. A 2011 Business Times' report also noted that Singapore would produce the world's cheapest desalinated water by 2013. How does the PUB adjust its Long-Run Marginal Cost projections with the advent of new technology so as to keep water prices affordable and to keep its profits within reasonable limits, on an on-going basis?",9,834,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00834
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"From parliamentary replies in the past, it would appear that energy is the real cost variable that can be difficult to track with a sufficient degree of accuracy. In view of the lower cost of producing water over the years, can the Government reveal how much NEWater and desalination costs have fluctuated over the years as a result of energy prices?",10,835,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00835
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In 2008, the Siemens Water Technologies Team was awarded a $4 million grant from the Environment and Water Industry Development Council (EWI) for successfully designing a more energy efficient desalinisation technique which produced a cubic metre of drinking water on 1.5 kWh of power as compared to PUB's current desalination method using 3.5 kWh per cubic metre. In addition, the 2015 PUB annual report highlights PUB's collaboration with a US water technology company which has piloted electro-deionisation technology which has achieved reductions in energy consumption in the desalination process by more than 50%, and this pilot would be expanded in 2016. Can the Government share details of this project and its prospects going forward?",11,836,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00836
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Separately, Mr Deputy Speaker, the announcement of an increase in water tariffs bookends a two-odd year period when Singaporeans were repeatedly reminded of water scarcity issues as a result of very low water levels in the Linggui reservoir in Malaysia, a water supply source five times the size of all of Singapore's reservoirs. At the start of each respective year, the water levels were at 84% in 2015, 49% in 2016 and 27% in 2017. We have been informed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in response to a Parliamentary Question in January this year that there is a significant risk of the water levels in the Linggui Reservoir falling to 0% this year should there be a dry spell in Johor.",12,837,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00837
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In view of the low water levels in the Linggui Reservoir from 2015 onwards in particular, how often has Singapore drawn less than the 250 million gallons a day it is legally entitled to under the 1962 Water Agreement and what has been Singapore's average daily rate of abstraction from the Linggui Reservoir since 2014? To that end, what role, if any, have the low water levels in the Linggui Reservoir played in the latest water price revision especially since the Government's position as late as 2013 confirmed no need to raise water prices?",13,838,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00838
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In the middle of last year, on the back of the Singapore International Water Week, a PUB official stated that should the Linggui Reservoir fail, there ought to be no cause for panic in Singapore as there were new and indigenous capacities in Singapore to meet such a contingency in the form of NEWater and desalination. However, the Minister of Foreign Affairs only last month stated that the failure of the Linggui Reservoir would cause severe problems for Singapore and Malaysia. Can the Government elaborate what are its contingency plans in the event of such an eventuality? Do these contingencies include the possibility of another rise in water prices, especially the water conservation tax since its policy rationale is aimed at reminding the taxpayer about the importance of saving water and separately, to account for the Long-Run Marginal Cost of desalination and NEWater? That would also prompt a corollary question as to whether the latest water price revision was set with a view to account for the complete failure of the Linggui Reservoir.",14,839,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00839
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Even so, in the middle of 2016, it was reported that Johor was studying plans to divert water from two rivers into the Linggui Reservoir. The first proposal was to build a low wall to channel about 50mgd of water from the Sayong River catchment area at the cost of about RM$250 million. The second plan called for the building of a dam at the Ulu Sedili Besar River to transfer about 110mgd to the Johor River at the cost of RM$660 million.",15,840,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00840
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"At the end of the last Leaders Retreat between Prime Ministers Lee and Najib in December last year, it was reported that Malaysia was looking at measures to increase the supply of water at the Linggui Reservoir.",16,841,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00841
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Can the Government comment, in the event Malaysia successfully diverts water to the Linggui Reservoir allowing Singapore to draw its full entitlement of 250mgd or more, would such an outcome end up reducing the price of water for consumers in Singapore? And if so, would Singapore consider co-funding the diversion of the two rivers or re-negotiating some aspects of the Water Agreement with a win-win prospect in mind especially since Singapore has not hesitated to supply Malaysia with more treated water than it is required to in its time of need particularly in times of drought and over the Ramadan period last year?",17,842,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00842
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"This brings me to my final point about the public messaging on water conservation policies and the outcomes the Government seeks from the water conservation tax and how these outcomes can be improved. About a month before the 2015 General Elections, the Prime Minister said, ""In Singapore, water will always be a precious resource. Never take it for granted or waste it.""",18,843,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00843
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In the middle of last year, on the back of the Singapore International Water Week in a piece entitled ""How Singapore Will Never Go Thirsty"", the PUB CEO announced that Singapore, in spite of being water-poor, had ""significantly overcome the challenge of water scarcity"" and later that ""Singapore is not short on water"".",19,844,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00844
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"While I understand the PUB official was showcasing to an international audience the good work over many decades of our water specialists, there is a risk that over amplifying self-sufficiency can have a dampening effect on efforts to encourage water conservation. The fact is self-sufficiency comes at a high price for the consumer.",20,845,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00845
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In fact, Singapore's per capita water consumption rates have been dropping steadily from 2005 when it was 162 litres per day to 151 litres per day today. It would appear that the answer to the question of whether we can reduce consumption without price increases is a yes − perhaps not as resounding a yes as the experts would wish for − but a yes nonetheless. Even with our hot and humid climate and cultural practice of not using dishwashers, perhaps as a result of the spices, sauces and seasonings in Asian cooking, progress on water conservation has been steady and continuous. Rather than to look solely at water pricing to promote conservation, the Government should look at new policies further tightening regulations on the sale of sanitary appliances such as mixers and shower heads which discharge excessive water, so as to nudge consumers to use more water-saving appliances.",21,846,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00846
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),Some experts have also proposed pricing strategies used elsewhere like in Spain which hosts a price structure that provides for a 10% rebate should a household's water consumption pattern show a 10% decrease compared to the year before.,22,847,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00847
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),What these creative pricing strategies suggest is the prospect of a different approach towards water conservation taxes to promote a more efficient usage of water. We already see PUB nudging Singaporeans in this direction by informing consumers of the consumption patterns of their neighbours and the national average in our monthly bills. What may truly push a renewed commitment to a water conservation drive is to significantly alter a consumer behaviour towards a tax regime that differentiates between efficient and inefficient usage of water by lowering taxes for consumers who use less water.,23,848,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00848
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"For example, a household of four which meets the national average consumption can have their water conservation tax remain at the current 30% of the tariff rate. Depending on additional usage, PUB could establish an ascending or descending scale relative to consumption. This has better prospects for water conservation as real savings would be given to individual households, building on the current two-tiered approach between households that consume more or less than 40 cubic meters of waters. This approach would also be more targeted and would cohere with the objective of saving water as opposed to the Budget announcement which bluntly increases the water conservation tax from 30% to 50%, and 35% to 65% for all households.",24,849,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00849
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To conclude, Mr Deputy Speaker, a piece in The Straits Times last week argued that the water price only reflected the reality of increasing water stress worldwide and that bigger hikes were needed to curb wastage. The comments to that story were unexpectedly, rather animated. I believe a deeper explanation from the Government about how it prices water and its long-run cost imperatives would enable the public to better understand and rationalise this water hike in addition to improving public understanding on this issue.",25,850,2017-02-28-T-016-S-00850
2017-02-28-T-016,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),This would be important as the water price hike occurred on the back of many other municipal prices increases which could arguably have been better phased to reduce the impact on the average Singaporean for whom cost of living concerns are an increasing issue. There remain concerns among Singaporeans who fear the knock-on effect of the water price hike on daily necessities and I hope the Government will address this point too.

2017-02-28-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,I would like to make some clarificatory points to the Minister for Trade and Industry.,1,855,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00855
2017-02-28-T-018,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,You are asking to raise a clarification about the Minister's speech?,1,856,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00856
2017-02-28-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,Yes.,1,857,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00857
2017-02-28-T-018,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Okay. Please note that you are not supposed to raise new matters in the speech.,1,858,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00858
2017-02-28-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Sure. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for giving me a chance to make a few points. I would like to thank the Minister for Trade and Industry for his detailed and comprehensive talk on the schemes available to SMEs. My first point is really on the results of these schemes. There are many and various schemes and some of these schemes have had precursors, for example −",1,859,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00859
2017-02-28-T-018,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Mr Leon, I need to interrupt you. You are not supposed to raise new matters. If you want to raise a clarification about the Minister's speech, raise the clarification but do not make another speech, please.",1,860,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00860
2017-02-28-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Okay. So, my clarificatory point would be  does the Government actually track how many SMEs take advantage of these schemes and grow, and stop becoming SMEs and actually become global companies? Is there a number to that? Are those results being tracked? And if in fact those results are tracked and those results are not good, then would that not suggest that there is a role for the Government to take a more active stance in grooming these companies?",1,861,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00861
2017-02-28-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"The second point is relating to funding. I would like to ask the Minister whether there is any data from SMEs through surveys and other means to suggest that the funding needs that they have are being sufficiently met by existing schemes and by other funding providers within the funding ecosystem. Because I certainly do hear feedback that the funding needs are not fully met. And would the Minister not acknowledge that if so, would there not be a role for the Government to actually be more interventionist to provide funding at higher levels of caps for those SMEs which have self-selected themselves by demonstrating a track record of results as opposed to SMEs who remain SMEs for decades.",2,862,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00862
2017-02-28-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"My third point is really on the issue of long-termism, which I raised. People will not become entrepreneurs if they feel that, structurally and culturally, the environment is not conducive to SMEs. There are many schemes, there have been in the past. But some of these schemes have limits. Some of these schemes will be phased out in the future, in the way that the PIC is being tapered down, for example. Some of the current schemes will be phased out. That may affect the willingness of the people to become entrepreneurs because there may be many schemes on the table now, but in 10 years, those schemes may be phased out.",3,863,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00863
2017-02-28-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"It is in that context that I raised land cost, funding and the overall culture. So, what would be the Government's strategy to address that fundamental structural impediment to entrepreneurship? Thank you.",4,864,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00864
2017-02-28-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for his range of questions. If I may take the last one first. If somebody becomes an entrepreneur because he wants Government schemes and support, then that is probably the wrong starting point, if I may respectfully suggest. I think the starting point for any entrepreneur is really in deciding that he or she has a strong value proposition, a passion to grow something, and then they go out there and make it happen. Indeed, we have many outstanding examples of entrepreneurs who have done exactly that. Along the way, yes, they benefit from certain Government support schemes. But I think we should not put the cart before the horse. The Government cannot mandate entrepreneurship. We cannot force entrepreneurship. It has to come from the individuals who have the motivation to make it happen. Our schemes can enable but they can never be a fool-proof support system for this.",1,865,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00865
2017-02-28-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I think the other points that the Member has made − what are the results of the various schemes? We track them. If there is one thing that we do rigorously is that we track the take-up rates, the outcomes, the KPIs associated with any programme that we introduce. But I would say that the Member raised the point − how many take up the scheme, how many globally competitive companies were created, and so on. So, let me take a couple of those points.",2,866,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00866
2017-02-28-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"How many take up the scheme? We can initiate the schemes. We can create channels and make it easier for companies to find out about the schemes. We have got SME Centres. Mr Thomas Chua will tell Members that SCCCI has got one of the most active SME Centres in Singapore, and we find a plethora of ways of communicating. But at the end of the day, the take-up rate rests with the individual companies. Minimally, you have to make the effort to find out what it is that is available, what are my needs, where is the match, and how do I get it. And you do not need to do it alone because we have the SME Centres. Even our economic agencies are prepared to work with them.",3,867,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00867
2017-02-28-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"As for the rate at which we get globally competitive companies, if I may draw Members' attention, in the ERC report, there was a goal to have 1,000 companies that cross the $100-million turnover mark by the end of this decade. That was an important directional goal because it is to set a sense of the scale of ambition that we have, and it is something that we continue to monitor. I would say that on balance, we are on track to getting there. Now, whether we will actually hit a thousand or not, I think it remains to be seen because there are many factors beyond our control. But the general directional push is very clear and we have in fact seen that grow.",4,868,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00868
2017-02-28-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But let me make one other point. Ultimately, whether we end up having a local enterprise that becomes a global champion, again, cannot rest just with the Government, because we have many instances where companies grow and when they reach a certain stage, they get a very tempting offer from either a fund or some larger company and they sell out. Do we then say that our effort has failed or do we say then that, well, this is the realities of the market and we have to live with it because there will be some of this development.",5,869,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00869
2017-02-28-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In Israel, for example, they are known as a start-up nation because they generate tremendous amount of knowledge which generate in many start-up companies. But ask yourself the question. In Israel, is it a scale-up nation and how far do they go in scaling up? In fact, I think the Israelis themselves will tell you that this is one of their main focal points − how do we get our companies to scale up − because that creates the next level of depth in the economy and the capabilities that we seek.",6,870,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00870
2017-02-28-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"As for funding needs, my general point would be this. I have never been in a conversation where companies or enterprises tell me that funding is completely met because the need is always there, there are different kinds of needs. You have a spectrum of funding providers in the market, whether it is Government schemes and grants, obviously, and then Government-supported schemes, whether it is venture capital, angel funding and so on. And it goes right through to private equity and then larger scale and, of course, you can then tap public markets, and now we got a lot more crowd-funding platforms.",7,871,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00871
2017-02-28-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, actually, there are a lot of mechanisms available but there will always be mismatches or gaps because the needs and the market situation keep changing. And that is why, ultimately, what is required is not so much about Government intervening by providing the lending solution per se, but it is to keep track of the situation, understanding whether this is a regulatory impediment, or a market failure, or is this because we are not getting the relevant players around the table to understand the issues and then deal with it.",8,872,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00872
2017-02-28-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"A case in point is what we are doing with the infrastructure financing I elaborated on, because for the smaller businesses in the infrastructure space, this was a real issue. Big banks and other funds, when they typically do financing for infrastructural projects, they do project financing, but they need big ticket numbers, they need a billion dollar project and above because it does not justify the level of work. So, the easy way out when you are dealing with smaller companies, or the one way to mitigate the risk, is to say I need personal guarantees and corporate guarantees, which immediately shackles the company in terms of how far it can go.",9,873,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00873
2017-02-28-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, we have tried to come in with this scheme. This is after consultation with all the key players − the banks, the industry, companies and so on.

The typical workforce comprise workers across widening age bands and multiple nationalities.

Su Xian eventually found a position as an accounts officer. She recounted, after getting a job, ""I was alone by myself with friends on different paths.

Going forward, we would need a National Talent Bank where jobseekers and would-be jobseekers can access conveniently, to be headhunted for jobs. This system should also include networking features like those on LinkedIn and Facebook. The National Talent Bank also allows us to analyse the deficit between national skills, competencies and what is required in our economy. As we go global, international companies should now know where a good place is to reach out for Singaporean talent.

These part-time and freelance jobs will increasingly become more prevalent as both employer and employee can react to economic changes better. This ""gig economy"" can be an important feature in managing structural changes in the economy. It also helps in continuous learning and being entrepreneurial. However, it cannot develop without stronger workplace protection and retirement support.

The chances of a good match would be much higher if we have work flexibility built in the system as well. We should start with companies which have vacancies, or even a company whose workers are on temporary leave and need workers for the interim period, for example, employees on maternity leave.

2017-02-28-T-018,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Now, I would like to talk about a separate point − creating a gig economy for our seniors. When I spoke to our seniors about the CFE, they are not sure how they fit in the future economy. Today, we already have forward-looking policies for our senior workers, such as our Senior Employment Credit, and our Retirement and Re-employment Act. Nevertheless, there is room to do more. In fact, I think there is room for our Government to catalyse a gig economy for our seniors, by creating micro-jobs.",19,948,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00948
2017-02-28-T-018,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Despite legislation, it is hard for us to fully remove ageism, especially towards seniors above 67. Many companies, especially in tough times, are not willing to take the risk of hiring, or even retaining senior workers. This issue would be more serious over time as we continue our restructuring, and as our workforce continues to age.",20,949,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00949
2017-02-28-T-018,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"The gig economy can help us combat ageism. Compared to companies, consumers using the gig economy are far less willing to discriminate. What do I mean? A good example is Uber. Through technology, Uber empowers hearing-impaired drivers to work in the car using Uber app. Other examples include delivery services such as Honest Bee, Food Panda, and Deliveroo, show that our consumers are less interested in discriminating, on who shows up on the door, as long as that person can do that one-off ""micro-job"" well.",21,950,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00950
2017-02-28-T-018,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"So, how can the Government create a gig economy for our seniors? By doing three things  one, creating micro-jobs for our seniors starting with those in the social services. Two, creating a national digital platform and app, and three, equipping our seniors to do these micro-jobs through SkillsFuture.",22,951,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00951
2017-02-28-T-018,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Let me use the example of delivery of home-based health care. Today, we sometimes send two nurses to visit patients, many of whom are bedridden or have mobility challenges. Why cannot we cut down to one nurse instead, and then hire a trained senior, living in a nearby block or street, to assist such as carrying the patient and assist in wound dressing.",23,952,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00952
2017-02-28-T-018,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"There are many seniors living in our midst who can qualify to do such micro-jobs. How do we page for these seniors? Simple. Through a gig economy app that the Government creates, perhaps by working with our start-ups. How do we prepare our seniors for these micro-jobs? Through SkillsFuture, of course. How do we ensure quality of service by these seniors? Through the apps that ask for feedback from the nurses, and may be even the patient.",24,953,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00953

What if we certify some of our able grandmothers to provide infant care service for a few infants at their home, or retired teachers to provide after school care for a few students at home?

How many purpose built infant care, after school care centres, and respite care centres can we end up not building?",25,954,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00954

2017-02-28-T-018,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"We can even extend this to the private sector, for example in food service. There is already a company that hires retired prata-makers today, and deploy them to meet shift gaps throughout Singapore. So, we can also help our seniors to find micro-jobs in the food service industry in their own neighbourhoods. We can also even extend this to stay-at-home mothers and special-needs workers to find micro-jobs nearby.",27,956,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00956
2017-02-28-T-018,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Now, what about meeting the practical realities like CPF contributions, or verifying who is eligible for what micro-jobs? These can be easily done, by inserting lines of code, to wire micro-contributions to one's CPF account, and to check out our seniors' SkillsFuture individual learning portfolio. In short, in this digital age, data is the new invisible hand. We should fully tap on data; combine it with our social policies, to orchestrate our economy and society of the future.",28,957,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00957
2017-02-28-T-018,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"In closing, creating a gig economy for our seniors benefits Singapore. It can erase ageism. It can put money directly in the hands of our seniors. It can cut down on unnecessary manpower including foreign manpower. And it can help reduce our social spending. Therefore I call for the creation of a national digital initiative for our seniors involving our social services Ministries, VWOs, and SkillsFuture. It will take a few years to get this done, so I hope we can start soon. With that, Mr Deputy Speaker, I stand in full support of the Budget. Thank you.",29,958,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00958

Meanwhile, right-wing populist parties campaigning on anti-immigration and anti-globalisation are gaining ground in Europe. If EU, the world's largest single market breaks up, world trade will be in disarray.

But I just realised that in this House, it is the topic that every Member has addressed. I think it is perfectly understandable how many people had found the jump of 30% abrupt and drastic. But if we consider the subject in context, that despite the very same dry season brought by El Nino in 2016 sweeping across Southeast Asia, Singapore unlike a number of Malaysian states such as Perlis, Pahang, Malacca, Johore and Sabah, did not have to impose water rationing because of the severe drought. The belated 30% hike, put in context, is a necessary and small insurance compared to the billions of dollars we need to set aside for future new water plants and pipeline infrastructure.

2017-02-28-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Much has been said about how businesses and workers can meet the challenges of the future economy. What I would like stress is that the future may be uncertain but we need to make Singapore's success as certain as we possibly can.,19,996,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00996
2017-02-28-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),Budget 2017 attempts to strike a balance between building for the future and meeting short-term needs. SkillsFuture and Industry Transformation Maps are the two key pillars to help businesses and individuals to meet the challenges of the new economy.,20,997,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00997
2017-02-28-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Budget 2017 focused on ""on the job skills utilisation"" to ensure a better match between training and jobs. Outcome-based training is the right move for SkillsFuture. I suggest that there be regular reviews of the training programmes under SkillsFuture to ensure they indeed generate desired job outcome.",21,998,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00998
2017-02-28-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"For ITM, although industries differ from each other, having a vision of what the industry could look like and thinking through what the parameters for innovation, labour and productivity can be, will guide firms on their next move. I hence suggest that entrepreneurs who are equipped with disruptive technologies and technology pioneers in the overseas market be brought into the discussion on ITMs to help our firms paint the future.",22,999,2017-02-28-T-018-S-00999
2017-02-28-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"With regard to Government revenue, NIRC has helped turn our budget into an overall surplus, contributing a 20% share of the operating revenue. Given our reliance on NIRC, if the outlook of the international market changes, are we still able to fund our budget? Therefore, can we consider binding expenditures with revenues or performance? Be it SkillsFuture, ITM or government projects, can we determine how much we should invest in based on anticipated and quantifiable outcome?",23,1000,2017-02-28-T-018-S-01000
2017-02-28-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"As more individuals are participating in the shared economy or becoming a freelancer, if a company who systematically engage individuals to work for them do not pay CPF or taxes, one leg of the equation in our social safety network will be missing. Hence, I suggest that we include the new economic model into our CPF and tax regime. Facing an uncertain future, we need to make Singapore's success as certain as we possibly can. We need to be daring, but also prudent. This requires leadership and judgment.",24,1001,2017-02-28-T-018-S-01001

2017-02-28-T-021,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder may have needs that range from mild to severe. For those with moderate to severe needs, they are referred to the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC). EIPIC provides learning and therapy intervention for 0 to 6 year olds at risk of moderate to severe disabilities, including Autism. EIPIC services are currently available at 19 Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWO) centres located across Singapore.",1,1010,2017-02-28-T-021-S-01010
2017-02-28-T-021,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"EIPIC centres train and involve parents and caregivers in the intervention for their child. This equips parents and caregivers to better care for their children with special needs, and the child also benefits when the intervention continues at home. In addition, children in EIPIC may also attend pre-school for education, inclusion and childcare. In such cases, the EIPIC centres will work with the child's pre-school teacher on strategies and tips on how best to engage the child in the classroom and in activities.",2,1011,2017-02-28-T-021-S-01011
2017-02-28-T-021,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The Ministry of Social and Family Development, with the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA), has worked with training institutes and educational providers such as Ngee Ann Polytechnic in rolling out specialised training such as the Specialist Diploma in Early Childhood Learning Support (SDELS), and the Advanced Diploma in Early Childhood Intervention (Special Needs) (ADESN), to equip EIPIC teachers, Learning Support Educators (LSEds) and classroom teachers in pre-schools with the necessary skills to support children with a range of developmental needs. Learning Support Educators provide targeted short-term intervention for children with mild developmental needs, and guide pre-school teachers in integrating these children in the classroom setting.",3,1012,2017-02-28-T-021-S-01012
2017-02-28-T-021,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The community has a crucial role to play in supporting children with special needs. Children with special needs should be accommodated in community activities and play settings, so that they can learn and grow together with typically developing children. The inclusive playgrounds in our community are a good example where accommodations enable interaction between children with special needs and their typically developing peers. Such inclusions pave the way for the community to become more open and supportive towards children with special needs and their caregivers.",4,1013,2017-02-28-T-021-S-01013
2017-02-28-T-021,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Corporate and individual contributions, coupled with a grant from the Care & Share Movement, were used to fund the five inclusive playgrounds built by NCSS. These playgrounds were the fruits of a very successful 3P (public, private and people) collaboration. We hope that there will be many more such partnerships and collaborations in building inclusive facilities, or creating inclusive settings.",5,1014,2017-02-28-T-021-S-01014
2017-02-28-T-021,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In the education system, the Ministry of Education seeks to enhance integration between students in mainstream and Special Education (SPED) schools by facilitating meaningful and purposeful interactions between these two groups of students. Under the MOE's satellite partnership model, some SPED schools practise 'social integration' with their mainstream partners. Others like Pathlight School allow their students to join their mainstream peers in class. The satellite partnerships enable students in SPED schools to remain integrated with the larger community.",6,1015,2017-02-28-T-021-S-01015
2017-02-28-T-021,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We will like to encourage corporates and community agencies and groups to actively create opportunities for better integration and inclusion of children with special needs, through the infrastructure or programmes they put in place, or the activities they organise.

2017-02-28-T-022,K Thanaletchimi,Ms K Thanaletchimi,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether a simple guide in various languages has been produced to assist Singaporeans who are in need of a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) to sign up for it; (b) whether a comparative study has been done on the extensiveness of Singaporeans seeking LPAs compared to other developed nations; and (c) what measures are there to safeguard the public from errant lawyers who facilitate LPAs.,1,1017,2017-02-28-T-022-S-01017
2017-02-28-T-022,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Since the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) came into effect on 1 March 2010, the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) under my Ministry has made available various resources to guide interested individuals in making their LPAs. These include a guidebook on the LPA, guidebook for donees and a Step by Step Guide to completing the basic LPA form, which is supplemented by a video guide. Most of these resources are available in all four official languages. I encourage interested applicants to review these resources from the OPG website when preparing their LPA applications.",1,1018,2017-02-28-T-022-S-01018
2017-02-28-T-022,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"As at 31 January 2017, 35,926 LPA applications have been received by the OPG, accounting for about 1% of the total Singaporeans and Permanent Residents population aged 21 and above.",2,1019,2017-02-28-T-022-S-01019
2017-02-28-T-022,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"As Singapore's MCA is modelled after England and Wales, we looked at the United Kingdom for a quick comparison. In England and Wales, about 4% of their eligible population have made an enduring power of attorney or LPA. Similarly, about 3% of Scotland's population have done so. While these figures are higher than in Singapore, it should be noted that these jurisdictions started much earlier than us, some even as early as 1986.",3,1020,2017-02-28-T-022-S-01020
2017-02-28-T-022,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"My Ministry recognises that we still have some way to go in getting more Singaporeans to plan ahead and make an LPA. Hence, I would like to reiterate that the application fee waiver for Singapore Citizens making an LPA Form 1 has been extended till 31 August 2018. We hope that more will take advantage of the fee waiver to pre-plan for ourselves and give our families peace of mind in future. We will also continue to increase awareness on the LPA.",4,1021,2017-02-28-T-022-S-01021
2017-02-28-T-022,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"LPA certificate issuers, who are professionals from the medical and legal sector, perform an important safeguarding role in the whole process. The professional is required to see the donor and has to, in his professional opinion, ensure that the donor understands the purpose and content of the LPA, and that he is not forced to make one under pressure or duress. The certificate issuer does so by signing off on the LPA Form.",5,1022,2017-02-28-T-022-S-01022

2017-02-28-T-023,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Our preference is to build at-grade crossings, rather than pedestrian overhead bridges, as they are barrier-free and more convenient for the elderly, families with strollers and persons with disabilities. However, there are instances where at-grade crossings are dangerous, for example, across major roads with fast-moving traffic, or may cause serious traffic congestion. In such cases, we will provide pedestrian overhead bridges.",1,1025,2017-02-28-T-023-S-01025

2017-02-28-T-024,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The Bus Service Reliability Framework (BSRF) was introduced as a trial for 22 bus services in February 2014, and expanded to another 23 services in December 2015. We observed less bus bunching for these services. In the assessment period from December 2015 to August 2016, bus service regularity had improved for all 45 services. There was a 20% reduction in average additional wait times. A total of $3.4 million was paid out in incentives over this period, and no penalties.",1,1027,2017-02-28-T-024-S-01027
2017-02-28-T-024,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Based on the experience of the trial, we have tightened the baseline standard and decided to incorporate the BSRF within the bus contracting model.

If the ECJ takes the same view, it would mean that the agreement has to be approved by the Council, the EP as well as the 38 national and regional Parliaments of all MS. However, the provisions in the agreement deemed to be under the EU's exclusive competence would be provisionally applied and take effect once the Council and the EP have approved. In comparison, provisions that are under shared competence or MS' exclusive competence would have to go through domestic ratification processes in all MS before they can take effect.",3,1058,2017-02-28-T-029-S-01058

2017-02-28-T-030,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"MCI has many programmes to help our people do this. For ICT professionals, we launched the TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) last year to train and upskill professionals into ICT job roles. We have made good progress, with over 8,000 professionals trained as at end-2016. In fact, the Company-Led Training programme, which encourages ICT companies to provide On-the-Job (OJT) training to individuals beyond what they intend to hire, has seen 100% of trainees successfully placed into jobs after their training period. In addition, for non-ICT professionals who have aspirations to pursue an ICT career, they can consider our Tech Immersion and Placement Programme, which uses short immersive courses to train professionals with essential ICT skills so as to facilitate their placement into ICT jobs. We will continue to step up efforts to train more professionals, and ensure that Singaporeans, including young professionals, are able to seize opportunities in the digital economy.",2,1063,2017-02-28-T-030-S-01063

To interest and prepare school-going Singaporeans in ICT skills, IMDA and GovTech have programmes, such as Code@SG and Hour of Code, to inspire students and develop their coding and computational thinking skills. Starting this year, IMDA will be extending Code@SG's Code for Fun enrichment programme to all primary and secondary school students.

2017-02-28-T-031,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Law enforcement agencies worldwide face the emerging challenge of tackling online drugs sale. Traffickers and drug abusers can trade drugs anonymously on online black market websites. This makes it difficult for law enforcement agencies to detect and apprehend the offenders.,1,1067,2017-02-28-T-031-S-01067
2017-02-28-T-031,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We also face this challenge in Singapore. The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) works closely with partners, such as the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) and courier companies, to detect and take action against online drug trade. In 2016, CNB arrested around 200 persons for buying drugs and drug-related paraphernalia online. The majority of these persons were between the ages of 20 to 39 years old. These individuals are vulnerable to the online sale of drugs as they are tech-savvy and are familiar with online transactions.",2,1068,2017-02-28-T-031-S-01068

Close to two-thirds of all new abusers arrested were under the age of 30. This is an area of concern. The two-year recidivism rate for drug abusers between the ages of 20 to 29 has been around 34-36% in the last three years",3,1069,2017-02-28-T-031-S-01069
