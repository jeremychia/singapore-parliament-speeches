2017-10-02-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Order. I wish to inform Members that pursuant to Standing Order No 102, I have on 12 September 2017 nominated the Minister for Social and Family Development and Second Minister for National Development Mr Desmond Lee to be a Member of the Public Petitions Committee, to fill a vacancy that has arisen in that Committee.",1,1,2017-10-02-T-001-S-00001
2017-10-02-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair,"asked	 the Minister for Defence following the two recent incidents of ship collisions in our territorial waters, what is the Maritime Security Task Force's assessment of (i) our capabilities for surveillance of maritime traffic and (ii) our ability to respond to scenarios where commercial vessels that are in or entering Singapore waters can be used by terrorists.",1,2,2017-10-02-T-002-S-00002
2017-10-02-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Mr Speaker, ensuring maritime security for our ports and surrounding waters is of high priority to Singapore. This is because disruption to sea traffic along the Singapore Strait will impact not only our local economy but also globally as half of the world’s total annual sea-borne trade and 70% of Asia’s oil imports pass through our waterway. As the Member also highlighted, terrorists can target ships in our waters or attack from the sea, as they did in the Mumbai incident in 2008.",1,3,2017-10-02-T-002-S-00003
2017-10-02-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"In dealing with terror threats at and from the sea, Singapore adopts a Whole-of-Government (WoG) approach to ensure a comprehensive coverage of varied scenarios as well as coordinated responses. This approach led to the setup of the Singapore Maritime Crisis Centre (SMCC) in 2011, which brings together the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN), the Police Coast Guard (PCG), the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA), the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), and the Singapore Customs. The SMCC maintains a comprehensive maritime situation picture, shares information between agencies and coordinates responses to deal with potential threats.",2,4,2017-10-02-T-002-S-00004
2017-10-02-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"The SMCC leverages technology to analyse information, detect suspicious patterns, and cue relevant agencies to investigate and take action. Let me provide two examples. In 2015 for example, the SMCC detected a potential ISIS sympathiser who was on-board a tanker calling into Singapore. That individual was barred from entering Singapore. In another case in 2016, SMCC received information about a hijacked tanker. This information was shared with the Indonesian authorities as the vessel was in their waters. This led to the ship’s rescue, and in that case, the hijack was not linked to any terror intent.",3,5,2017-10-02-T-002-S-00005
2017-10-02-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Also as part of WOG efforts, the RSN's Maritime Security Task Force (MSTF), which the Member asked specifically about, feeds its information to the SMCC. This information is obtained from monitoring close to a thousand ships passing through the Singapore Strait each day, through a network of sensors such as coastal surveillance radars, electro-optic devices and RSN ships on patrol. This surveillance is continuous both in the day and at night.",4,6,2017-10-02-T-002-S-00006
2017-10-02-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"The MSTF's key focus is on potential threats to Singapore. This is what Mr Vikram Nair alluded to, while the MPA watches over the navigation of ships in our waters. For both purposes, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) mandates the use of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) to identify ships at sea. This AIS, however, does not apply to warships. For ships that are not required or have not complied with vessel identification, their presence can still be detected via our network of coastal surveillance radars and electro-optic devices.",5,7,2017-10-02-T-002-S-00007
2017-10-02-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"On a daily basis, MSTF conducts threat evaluation for every vessel calling into Singapore's ports or transiting through the Singapore Straits. MSTF does this by deploying analytic tools to build profiles of each vessel based on attributes such as their voyage, owners, crew and cargo, as well as additional data shared by Government agencies. MSTF would then decide the appropriate operational responses, which include for example, closer monitoring, escorting or even boarding the ship to mitigate the threat.",6,8,2017-10-02-T-002-S-00008
2017-10-02-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Let me now move on specifically to the two recent incidents asked about by the Member. With regard to the two recent incidents which resulted in collisions, our sensors had detected and identified the vessels involved in the both collisions. In the case of the USS John S. McCain and the Alnic MC, both were detected in our waters off Pedra Branca. The RSN vessel RSS Gallant, which was patrolling our waters, had also established communications with the foreign warship as part of standard procedures. Likewise, for the case of the dredger JBB De Rong 19 and tanker Kartika Segara, both were detected and identified prior to their collision that took place within Singapore waters off Sisters’ Island.",7,9,2017-10-02-T-002-S-00009
2017-10-02-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"In both these incidents, none of the ships were designated as potential threats to security and correctly so. As such, in compliance with standard protocols, they did not require close monitoring by the MSTF. And by the rules of navigation under the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS), the master and crew of the vessels involved were responsible to guide their ships safely through. The various parties involved with the collision will now have to investigate what went wrong and what remedial actions to take, if necessary. The Transport Safety Investigation Bureau (TSIB) is also conducting an investigation and has announced that it will make the findings public.",8,10,2017-10-02-T-002-S-00010
2017-10-02-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I thank the Minister for the reply. In relation to the two collisions, I understand that we were able to detect the ships, but they were not subjected to a higher level of security, and therefore, additional steps were not necessary. What would the measures be, if for example, there was hostile intention detected on the paths of one of the vessels? Would that have been different?",1,11,2017-10-02-T-002-S-00011
2017-10-02-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Those are very pertinent questions and not theoretical at all. We saw what happened in the Mumbai attack, and there are many scenarios. If we had, for example, pre-emptive information that a particular ship was carrying either illegal cargo or had malignant intent towards Singapore, it could amount to boarding the ship, or keeping it in close surveillance.",1,12,2017-10-02-T-002-S-00012
2017-10-02-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"There are various scenarios played out. This is what the MSTF does in its exercises – if you have kept up with the number of exercises that we have had at sea – various scenarios are played out, whether it is cruise ship, whether it is cargo, and what kind of scenarios may result, including hostage-taking. They are varied to the extent possible. The planners, our security agencies, and together with the other agencies under the SMCC do play out these scenarios.",2,13,2017-10-02-T-002-S-00013
2017-10-02-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"We have, over the years, stepped up the level of exercises, and there is a certain level of competency. I do not want to give the false impression that all attacks can be mitigated. If there are suicide attacks, sometimes, it is difficult to stop them. But this is a situation where we continue to look at the scenarios, continue to exercise, continue to anticipate.",3,14,2017-10-02-T-002-S-00014
2017-10-02-T-003,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,asked	 the Minister for Transport with regard to the two recent collisions of ships in our territorial waters (a) whether there will be reviews carried out on our Vessel Traffic Information System to enhance the navigational safety and security in our waters; and (b) whether the Ministry will be checking for weaknesses in our sea defence against potential attacks by terrorists in this area.,1,15,2017-10-02-T-003-S-00015
2017-10-02-T-003,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Transport),"Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to answer part (a) of the question, as part (b) has been earlier addressed by the Minister of Defence in his reply to Question No 1.",1,16,2017-10-02-T-003-S-00016
2017-10-02-T-003,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Transport),"The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) operates the Vessel Traffic Information System (VTIS), which integrates data from various sources including radars, the Automatic Identification System, Closed Circuit Television System, Very High Frequency Communications System and ship databases, to provide an accurate and comprehensive understanding of the traffic in the Singapore Strait and Singapore port waters. With the capability to concurrently track more than 10,000 vessels, the VTIS enables MPA to provide timely information and advice to help vessels transit safely through the Singapore Strait, as well as manage traffic within our port waters, where there are some 1,000 vessels at any one time.",2,17,2017-10-02-T-003-S-00017
2017-10-02-T-003,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Transport),Enhancing navigational safety is an important priority for MPA. MPA carries out regular enhancements to its VTIS which was installed in 2011 and upgraded early this year.,3,18,2017-10-02-T-003-S-00018
2017-10-02-T-003,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Transport),"Beyond technical capabilities, MPA also seeks to improve the practice of good seamanship and advocate a safety-first culture at sea. MPA established the National Maritime Safety at Sea Council to drive such efforts. MPA also organises conferences, workshops and briefings on navigational safety under its Safety@Sea campaign.",4,19,2017-10-02-T-003-S-00019
2017-10-02-T-004,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,asked	 the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Bukit Panjang LRT system was built as an afterthought; and (b) what were the political pressures faced by the Government when it decided to build the Bukit Panjang LRT system.,1,20,2017-10-02-T-004-S-00020
2017-10-02-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng) (for the Minister for Transport),"Mr Speaker, in the 1990s, LTA was exploring a pilot Light Rail Transit (LRT) network to bridge the last-mile gap from the MRT system and ease vehicle congestion within housing estates where population growth had stretched the road capacity. Bukit Panjang was identified in 1994 for the pilot, even though it was planned and built without LRT in mind.",1,21,2017-10-02-T-004-S-00021
2017-10-02-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng) (for the Minister for Transport),"To accommodate the existing developments, the LRT had to take sharp turns over undulating terrain. Over time, we discovered that this made the LRT prone to faults, especially power trips at the sharp bends where the trains' collector shoes often dislodge from the power rail. LTA and SMRT have put in significant efforts to improve system reliability, including detailed power rail checks, hotspot replacement and installation of an additional power source. They are also exploring extending engineering hours to address these additional works.",2,22,2017-10-02-T-004-S-00022
2017-10-02-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng) (for the Minister for Transport),"As the LRT is coming to the end of its design life, we will be calling a tender at the end of this year to overhaul the LRT.",3,23,2017-10-02-T-004-S-00023
2017-10-02-T-004,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I thank the Second Minister for the reply. I know it does not answer the question; I can understand why because the Minister is not here. But just to confirm  this issue of the topographical constraints of Bukit Panjang was raised by the former Minister for Transport Mr Lui Tuck Yew in 2015 as a reason why it is not feasible to rebuild the entire line, because of these constraints. The former CEO of SMRT Ms Saw Phaik Hwa was also quoted as saying, ""LRTs are meant to be simple lines and are not meant to make many turns and go up and down hills.""",1,24,2017-10-02-T-004-S-00024
2017-10-02-T-004,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"It would appear that a design issue is at the heart of the problems affecting the Bukit Panjang LRT Line. And to that end, can I just ask, would this be a correct characterisation of the problem with the Bukit Panjang LRT Line and if so, who was responsible for the design of that particular Line? Was it LTA or the winning tenderer?",2,25,2017-10-02-T-004-S-00025
2017-10-02-T-004,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second question I have is with regard to tender selection when the Line was awarded to Keppel Integrated Engineering (KIE). It was reported that KIE was the lowest bidder and its price worked out to about $35 million per km. This was significantly lower compared to similar LRT Lines made around that period or tendered around that period in Malaysia and Thailand. So, was that an issue?",3,26,2017-10-02-T-004-S-00026
2017-10-02-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Mr Speaker, the primary issue with the Bukit Panjang LRT is that the LRT design was adapted from an airport system, primarily, to a housing estate. As I have stated in my reply, this straight-line design of the LRT was adapted to undulating terrain and sharp turns, and this caused the power collector shoes to dislodge from the power rail. We have taken a look at the design considerations and this will be addressed in the upcoming tender to improve the reliability of the whole system.",1,27,2017-10-02-T-004-S-00027
2017-10-02-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"So, in the initial implementation of the LRT, we adapted a system that is usually for straight-line travel, into a housing estate. This had caused some of these power dislodge problems.",2,28,2017-10-02-T-004-S-00028
2017-10-02-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,asked	 the Minister for Transport what are the Government's plans to improve the medium- to long-term term reliability of the Bukit Panjang LRT system and what are the immediate to short-term plans to improve commuter service and experience when there are breakdowns and stoppages in the LRT system.,1,29,2017-10-02-T-005-S-00029
2017-10-02-T-005,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng) (for the Minister for Transport),"Mr Speaker, the Bukit Panjang LRT (BPLRT) is our next oldest rail line after the North-South and East-West Lines. The system is nearing the end of its design life and is due for renewal.",1,30,2017-10-02-T-005-S-00030
2017-10-02-T-005,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng) (for the Minister for Transport),"Most of the disruptions on BPLRT have been due to power-related faults. In the immediate term, LTA and SMRT are carrying out detailed checks of the LRT's power rails and performing hotspot replacement works where needed. LTA will also install a new power source at Ten Mile Junction substation to provide a back-up to the existing system at Choa Chu Kang. Both exercises will be completed by year end. In the meantime, LTA and SMRT are looking to extend engineering hours to cater to these additional works. This would mean shorter operating hours and we hope to have commuters’ understanding on this.",2,31,2017-10-02-T-005-S-00031
2017-10-02-T-005,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng) (for the Minister for Transport),"In addition, SMRT is forming a quick response team to rectify train faults and shorten service recovery times. The proximity of the new Bukit Panjang Integrated Transport Hub will also allow SMRT to deploy buses rapidly to ferry commuters during a service disruption.",3,32,2017-10-02-T-005-S-00032
2017-10-02-T-005,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng) (for the Minister for Transport),"In the first half of 2018, LTA will be awarding a contract to renew the BPLRT. When completed, reliability will improve substantially.",4,33,2017-10-02-T-005-S-00033
2017-10-02-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I thank the Second Minister for his commitment to fix the LRT problem with both long-term and short-term solutions. The feedback I have received from my residents in Bukit Panjang Town is that while they are unhappy with the frequent disruptions of the BPLRT, they still find that the LRT serves their commuting needs and hope that the LRT will continue as another mode of transport in Bukit Panjang Town.",1,34,2017-10-02-T-005-S-00034
2017-10-02-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"My first question to the Second Minister is  with this revamp, is there any indication of the timeline, what are the different phases involved and whether there will be disruptions in the process as the operator tries to fix the longer term problems?",2,35,2017-10-02-T-005-S-00035
2017-10-02-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Secondly, in the meantime, when these are in progress, can the bus resources be increased to serve as a back-up whenever there are stoppages, and also to provide alternatives, especially during the crowded peak periods?",3,36,2017-10-02-T-005-S-00036
2017-10-02-T-005,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Mr Speaker, there were good engineering lessons learnt from the BPLRT over the years and we are intending to up the engineering hours to provide LTA and SMRT to have more time on the tracks. Though this will cause short-term disruptions, we will be providing bus services to bridge any of the inconveniences for the commuters.",1,37,2017-10-02-T-005-S-00037
2017-10-02-T-005,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"In the upgrading process, there will be requirements to secure different parts of the BPLRT. Likewise, where we can, SMRT will provide the bus services to alleviate commuters' inconveniences. But because Bukit Panjang is a relatively mature estate, there are limits to how many buses we can put on the roads without causing further congestion. So, we ask for commuters' understanding while we do the short-term and the longer term upgrades.",2,38,2017-10-02-T-005-S-00038
2017-10-02-T-005,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I have two supplementary questions. The fact that there will be another tender called to revamp the Bukit Panjang LRT means that it is useful. My question is  will there be an LRT plan for Yishun Town?",1,39,2017-10-02-T-005-S-00039
2017-10-02-T-005,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Secondly, Yishun is served by the North-South Line, which is the oldest, even older that Bukit Panjang LRT. What plans does the Ministry have to reduce the breakdown rate because, recently, there are still a lot of breakdowns?",2,40,2017-10-02-T-005-S-00040
2017-10-02-T-005,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Mr Speaker, as usual, I thank Er Dr Lee Bee Wah for the question. I regret to inform the hon Member that the LRT is not in the works for Yishun Town. But for the North-South Line, there have been a lot of engineering works done on two fronts. One, on the maintenance front, we have upped the reliability to almost 400,000 km before failure. This is for the maintenance regime upgrade on the North-South Line. In parallel, we have been doing a signalling upgrading on the North-South Line. Things have gone on relatively well, short of a couple of major breakdowns in June and July. But we are fixing the software issues and, by year-end, we hope to have the new signalling system operating on the North-South Line. That will bring better service and conveniences to the hon Member's residents.",1,41,2017-10-02-T-005-S-00041
2017-10-02-T-006,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,"asked	 the Minister for Finance based on the findings in the Report of the Auditor-General for FY2016/17, whether AGO will direct all the entities in the Report to investigate all improper payments made and determine the amount of money to recover.",1,42,2017-10-02-T-006-S-00042
2017-10-02-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"Mr Speaker, the Auditor-General's Report reflects its findings in respect of two types of audit conducted every year on Government agencies. The first concerns whether the accounts of the Government are reliable and prepared in accordance with the law. The second concerns the rules and procedures in individual public agencies, for example, whether the rules and processes are adequate and have been complied with.",1,43,2017-10-02-T-006-S-00043
2017-10-02-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"On the former, the Auditor-General's Office (AGO) has given the Government's Financial Statements this year an unmodified audit opinion, as has been the case in previous years. In other words, in the AGO’s opinion, the Financial Statements have been presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. This means that the accounts of the Ministries, Departments and Organs of State have all been found to be reliable and prepared in accordance with the law. On the latter, the AGO has highlighted in its Report some areas in which there have been procedural lapses and where the Government agencies can do better. We take these findings seriously.",2,44,2017-10-02-T-006-S-00044
2017-10-02-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),Let me address Mr Png's question on investigating all improper payments and its recovery.,3,45,2017-10-02-T-006-S-00045
2017-10-02-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"I should clarify at the outset that there is no indication in the AGO Report of any payments due to fraud, misfeasance or dishonesty. The cases highlighted by AGO this year largely concerned overpayments and payments made without prior approval, arising from human error, negligence or failure to follow established procedures.",4,46,2017-10-02-T-006-S-00046
2017-10-02-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"In each of these cases, agencies have been taking prompt actions to recover any monies which might have been erroneously paid out. AGO noted that SCORE has recovered the overpaid amounts. EDB has completed the remedial action for all payment related lapses, including recovery of monies in the two incidences of overpayments. MSF is also taking corrective actions to make good under-reimbursements and to recover over-reimbursements for the Government-paid Paternity Leave scheme. MOH also completed its review of the claims by its agents and service providers. There is no overpayment as the additional sums claimed by its agents have not been paid out. MOH will only be reimbursing its agents for the correct amount due to them.",5,47,2017-10-02-T-006-S-00047
2017-10-02-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),The Government agencies are taking the necessary corrective actions in respect of the lapses highlighted in the AGO Report.,6,48,2017-10-02-T-006-S-00048
2017-10-02-T-006,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"I thank the Senior Minister of State. I have a question because, in the AGO Report, there is also, for example, language used such as ""there is no assurance that the Ministry exercised financial prudence"" and also “there is a risk of fraud”. Can any entity whose lapses are highlighted in the AGO Report come to the conclusion that there is no fraud because the AGO Report is not forensic in nature? That is my question.",1,49,2017-10-02-T-006-S-00049
2017-10-02-T-006,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Png referred to ""the Ministry"" in his clarification. May I enquire which Ministry?",1,50,2017-10-02-T-006-S-00050
2017-10-02-T-006,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,MOH.,1,51,2017-10-02-T-006-S-00051
2017-10-02-T-006,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"MOH. Mr Speaker, I think what the hon Member is really asking is whether an AGO Report can prove a negative. You cannot prove a negative. One does not go around looking to see whether I can disprove or show that there is no fraud. An audit, by its nature, selects samples. It looks at the samples and it considers whether the system as a whole is robust and, if it picks up a point that the system in itself has got inefficiencies or deficiencies, it will highlight it.",1,52,2017-10-02-T-006-S-00052
2017-10-02-T-006,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"An audit, by its nature, also, if it encounters a specific lapse or error, such as overpayment or under-reimbursement, it will also highlight that. So, what an audit does really is that it does sample checks, sees whether the system as a whole is robust and efficient, and it highlights specific lapses that it may encounter. That is the nature, not just of an audit by AGO, but of all audits.",2,53,2017-10-02-T-006-S-00053
2017-10-02-T-006,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,"Mr Speaker, Sir, just one last clarification. Although the AGO or audit is not forensic, so, technically, you cannot detect fraud. But in the aftermath of the Report, when it was released, MOH, in its statement, said that, ""Based on the AGO Report, there was no indication of fraud or corrupt practices"", which the AGO Report did not say. Then the statement went on to say that ""that warrants no further investigation required"".",1,54,2017-10-02-T-006-S-00054
2017-10-02-T-006,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,"Would the Senior Minister of State comment on it because I think no one should take the AGO Report as an endorsement that there is no fraud. The AGO only highlights lapses. Like what the Senior Minister of State said, it is selective audit. As such, the AGO Report, when it came out, the language they used is quite similar to what was also used previously. We have encountered it before. It is not forensic. So, I think no Ministry should take for granted that, because it is not mentioned that there is no fraud, and if there is no fraud, it does not warrant any further investigations.",2,55,2017-10-02-T-006-S-00055
2017-10-02-T-006,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Speaker, the hon Member may have misunderstood the nature of an audit. An audit will highlight or precipitate forensic inquiry if there is reason to do a forensic inquiry. So, if you go in and if you find there is conflict of interests, for example, payments to related third-parties or that your system as a whole enables the same person to approve a payment, submit a request for payment and sign a cheque for payment, that would require a forensic investigation.",1,56,2017-10-02-T-006-S-00056
2017-10-02-T-006,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"But if you go in and you find that there is, in MOH's case, a possibility of an overpayment which actually has not even occurred and you point it out and you can rectify it, and if the nature of that is because − as I have explained earlier − human error, negligence or non-compliance, that, in itself, does not trigger a forensic audit.",2,57,2017-10-02-T-006-S-00057
2017-10-02-T-006,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"What you have to do is you have to look at the nature of the lapse. Is it something that requires a further and deep investigation, or is it something that does not?",3,58,2017-10-02-T-006-S-00058
2017-10-02-T-006,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"In this case, as I have explained earlier, the Financial Statements of the Government are fair and accurate. They are reliable. So, you can take the Statements as reliable. Then, the second part of the audit is you look to see whether or not the rules and processes are adequate and have been complied with. In this case, it would appear that the rules and processes are adequate, but, in some cases, they were not complied with that does not necessitate a forensic investigation.",4,59,2017-10-02-T-006-S-00059
2017-10-02-T-006,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, it is quite correct for MOH to say that the audit did not, in this instance, disclose evidence of fraud.",5,60,2017-10-02-T-006-S-00060
2017-10-02-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked  the Minister for Finance whether the Ministry will regularly review the Government's commitment to reduce socio-economic inequality and publish the results of such reviews in light of recent findings from a study by Oxfam and Development Finance International that ranks Singapore in the 86th placing in the world in this regard.,1,61,2017-10-02-T-007-S-00061
2017-10-02-T-007,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"Mr Speaker, the Government is concerned about inequality and takes serious efforts to address it. Our concern underpins the design of many of our policies and schemes.",1,62,2017-10-02-T-007-S-00062
2017-10-02-T-007,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"Our key strategy for tackling inequality is to ensure that all Singaporeans, especially those who are less well off, are able to access good opportunities, earn higher incomes and enjoy a higher standard of living. We do this by providing the necessary support to our citizens at various stages of life, with more support going to the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.",2,63,2017-10-02-T-007-S-00063
2017-10-02-T-007,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"We invest heavily in education so that every child, regardless of socio-economic background, can have access to a good education and develop to his full potential. A child who attends Primary and Secondary school receives around $11,000 in educational subsidies per year. Children from lower income families receive even more support through MOE's Financial Assistance Scheme and bursaries. Students with more needs receive additional support through various support programmes. These ensure that we preserve social mobility for our next generation.",3,64,2017-10-02-T-007-S-00064
2017-10-02-T-007,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"For workers, we introduced the SkillsFuture movement to support skills upgrading so that they can take on better jobs. We also have the Progressive Wage Model to help lower-wage workers upskill and earn better wages, and Workfare to supplement their income. We have seen encouraging results so far. In the last five years, incomes of lower wage workers have grown in tandem with median income growth.",4,65,2017-10-02-T-007-S-00065

2017-10-02-T-007,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"All these schemes add up to a system that is highly progressive.

2017-10-02-T-007,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"Mr Perera referred to the ranking by Oxfam and Development Finance International. The rankings were based on the absolute amount of social spending, with the assumption that the higher the level of spending, the better will be the situation, regardless of whether the spending leads to effective outcomes. The authors have acknowledged the limitations of their study in representing the different circumstances of individual countries. This is the case for Singapore, where we target our subsidies and assistance to those who are more needy. This focused approach to reducing inequality enables us to keep our tax burden low while ensuring our social expenditure is prudent, fair and progressive.",8,69,2017-10-02-T-007-S-00069
2017-10-02-T-007,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"Our approach has served us well so far. We have kept inequality in check, even as income gaps widen elsewhere. Our Gini coefficient has moderated over the last five years. Our people have also seen good income growth with the lower income seeing their real per capita household income grow by close to 20% over the last five years.",9,70,2017-10-02-T-007-S-00070
2017-10-02-T-007,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"Such indicators are published every year in the Key Household Income Trends report by the Department of Statistics, and every two years in the biennial Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review (SPOR) by MOF.

2017-10-02-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),I thank the Senior Minister of State for the detailed and comprehensive answer. I have two supplementary questions.,1,72,2017-10-02-T-007-S-00072
2017-10-02-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Firstly, in light of the fact that our Gini coefficient – which the Senior Minister of State alluded to – is still among the highest among developed countries in the world, and given the fact that even though the Gini coefficient refers to inequality of outcomes, and the inequality of outcomes can impact inequality of opportunity, how confident is the Government that it is keeping abreast of international best practices in the field of ameliorating and mitigating inequality of opportunity? This is a field where I think the policy is evolving worldwide; there are different innovations. So, how confident is the Government that it is being done?",2,73,2017-10-02-T-007-S-00073
2017-10-02-T-007,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"And to link to that, my second question would be  would the Government consider, publishing at regular intervals, a report which measures the state of equality of opportunity, looking at indicators – not just the indicators that the Senior Minister of State mentioned like absolute incomes – but also measures like social mobility which are more infrequently measured at the current point. Could the Government consider that kind of regular measurement publication and public debate on this issue, given the importance of the issue and how it cuts across so many other areas of policy?",3,74,2017-10-02-T-007-S-00074
2017-10-02-T-007,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Speaker, our approach on this matter has not been to say that once in every few years, we will do a review and do a check, and see where we are on social mobility. For this Government, our entire approach, and in fact, the raison d'être on which Singapore was founded on in 1965 was really to be a place where everybody can progress.",1,75,2017-10-02-T-007-S-00075
2017-10-02-T-007,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"In fact, if we look at the proclamation of Singapore's Independence, it said that this would be a country founded on the principles of liberty and justice, and ever seeking the welfare and happiness of her people in a more just and equal society.",2,76,2017-10-02-T-007-S-00076
2017-10-02-T-007,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"What that means is that from day one, this Government is committed to the progress of its people, and that includes reducing the gap between people who have unequal situations. That is the reason why every year during Budget, we review what we can do better. It is part of each Ministry's duty and responsibility to see where the gaps are. The report is actually – as I indicated earlier – shown in the SPOR report. We also publish the socio-economic indicators and outcomes every year in the Key Household Income Trends report by the Department of Statistics.",3,77,2017-10-02-T-007-S-00077
2017-10-02-T-007,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, in other words, this is not something we do every five years or every 10 years. It is part and parcel of the day-to-day work of the Ministries, and we look at it every Budget as well. Occasionally, we may have bigger reviews but it is really something that is done each and every day of the Ministries' work.",4,78,2017-10-02-T-007-S-00078
2017-10-02-T-008,Ganesh Rajaram,Mr Ganesh Rajaram,asked	 the Minister for Communications and Information what steps has the Government taken to encourage more production companies to utilise the state-of-the-art facilities at Mediapolis@One-North.,1,79,2017-10-02-T-008-S-00079
2017-10-02-T-008,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Communications and Information),"Mr Speaker, Sir, Mediapolis@one-north has grown to be a vibrant infocomm-media cluster, and is home to many media companies, including Lucasfilm, Mediacorp and Infinite Studios. Many of the facilities in Mediapolis are privately owned and the owners are promoting the use of their facilities for media productions. For example, Infinite Studios offers a diverse range of media activities, such as soundstages for filming, visual effects and production services. The soundstages have been well-utilised by local and regional large-scale television productions. Several Hollywood films have also used the soundstages in their filming, for example ""Hitman  Agent 47"", as well as ""Equals"", that were both filmed in 2014. In June this year, Warner Brothers' ""Crazy Rich Asians"", starring Hollywood and Singaporean actors, utilised Infinite Studios’ facilities as well.",1,80,2017-10-02-T-008-S-00080
2017-10-02-T-008,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Communications and Information),"The main facility in Mediapolis under the IMDA’s purview is PIXEL Studios. IMDA launched PIXEL Studios less than a year ago in November 2016 to provide shared content production facilities for online content creators and game developers to experiment with and create innovative digital media content. In addition, development space is available to incubate promising local games start-ups and there are currently 15 of them incubated at PIXEL. IMDA also organises a slate of programmes for content creators to learn from experienced local and international industry leaders. Since the launch of PIXEL Studios, more than 4,200 participants have attended over 150 events. These events range from networking sessions and video production clinics, to workshops and talks on immersive media trends and technologies.",2,81,2017-10-02-T-008-S-00081
2017-10-02-T-008,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Communications and Information),"IMDA has also opened up PIXEL Studios for independent digital content creators to use the facilities for free. Some examples of the facilities available are audio and video recording suites, post-editing suites, thematic areas and backdrops, as well as filming equipment. All these facilities serve to meet the basic production needs of content creators. So far, the response from industry users has been positive. Over the past six months, about a dozen productions by content creators have taken place at PIXEL Studios.",3,82,2017-10-02-T-008-S-00082
2017-10-02-T-008,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Communications and Information),"In addition, the Singapore Film Commission within the IMDA has launched the Filming Friendly Zone at one-north. Obtaining permissions to film at some locations in Singapore may be a challenge for some production companies. Thus, IMDA has established agreements with various building owners in the one-north precinct for a higher level of openness towards production companies who may be interested to use some locations for their filming. This supports small-sized film productions by helping them gain easier access to film at these areas.",4,83,2017-10-02-T-008-S-00083
2017-10-02-T-009,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"asked	 the Minister for Communications and Information whether the Ministry plans to impose on telecommunication and Internet service providers operating in Singapore a requirement to proactively monitor the use of their services for online and phone scams, take all necessary steps to deter such usage and promptly provide all relevant information to enforcement agencies.",1,84,2017-10-02-T-009-S-00084

2017-10-02-T-009,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Communications and Information),"However, scammers' tactics have become more sophisticated. Technological solutions are necessary but not sufficient. Improving public education and individual vigilance are therefore key to combatting scams. To this end, Government agencies, including IMDA and the SPF, work with the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) to conduct public education and outreach programmes, especially to groups who are more likely to fall prey to scams. All of us must also do our part by helping to educate our loved ones about scams so that they will not become victims of scams.",3,87,2017-10-02-T-009-S-00087
2017-10-02-T-009,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Mr Speaker, I thank the hon Senior Minister of State for his comprehensive answer. I have a few supplementary questions. First is  whether the Ministry is contemplating any regulation to be put in place for the telco operators and the infocomm service operators to proactively monitor the space for scammers?",1,88,2017-10-02-T-009-S-00088
2017-10-02-T-009,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Secondly, in relation to the cost of compliance, whether there would be any measure to ensure that the cost of compliance is not passed on unreasonably to consumers?",2,89,2017-10-02-T-009-S-00089
2017-10-02-T-009,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Mr Speaker, managing this issue and managing the space have its challenges, given the many different types of platforms and services that are offered, as well as the fact that many of the scammers operate overseas. And so there is a necessary consideration on how we will interface with other telecommunications regimes and services. We continue to study the matter and there is, at this point in time, no regulations that are being planned.",1,90,2017-10-02-T-009-S-00090
2017-10-02-T-010,Ganesh Rajaram,Mr Ganesh Rajaram,asked	 the Minister for Education (Schools) with regard to nurturing sports excellence in schools (a) whether the Ministry can provide statistics on the success of the Direct School Admission (Sports) programme and the Singapore Sports School; and (b) how many of the students accepted into either of these programmes have represented or are representing Singapore in their chosen sporting fields after they have left school.,1,91,2017-10-02-T-010-S-00091

2017-10-02-T-012,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Mr Speaker, all employers are already expected to adhere to the principles of fair employment practices, as set out in the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP), and that includes recruitment and hiring. For example, the guidelines make it clear that job advertisements should not be discriminatory and interviewers should confine questions to those relevant to the job requirements. The Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP), looks into complaints about unfair recruitment and hiring practices and works with non-compliant companies to improve their practices. Where warranted, cases are referred to MOM for investigation.",1,100,2017-10-02-T-012-S-00100

Jobseekers will also be able to identify progressive companies and organisations which publicly adopt the Standards. Therefore, employers have an incentive to adopt the Standards even if there are no regulations which require them to.",2,101,2017-10-02-T-012-S-00101
2017-10-02-T-012,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Manpower),"One of these Standards is on Recruitment Practices and public sector agencies will take the lead in adopting the Standard when it is launched. One of the specifications in the Standard is for employers to inform all shortlisted applicants who attend their job interviews about the outcome. On the question of whether applicants should be notified even if they are not shortlisted for interviews, the tripartite partners assessed that it would place an onerous burden on some companies, particularly SMEs, which have not fully automated their recruitment processes to deal with the large volumes of online applicants. However, the tripartite partners agree that the Standard can be updated over time as companies make progress.",3,102,2017-10-02-T-012-S-00102

For the acknowledgment of the application, I have I received feedback, particularly for those who are taking up public sector positions through Careers@Gov and so on, one suggestion would be at least provide acknowledgement that they have at least received the application of the curriculum vitae (CV). I have been meeting many of these interested Singaporeans who are wanting to take up public sector positions, applying through online platforms such as Careers@Gov, and they say they do not get a formal reply whether they are even shortlisted for interviews or even rejected. So, I think it would be a good practice for the public sector to take a lead on this.",1,103,2017-10-02-T-012-S-00103

In following up to this question, are there any specific plans to provide more teeth such as regulations with regards to TAFEP over the next five years?

2017-10-02-T-012,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, TAFEP is an organisation that relies on a number of methods to encourage and support employers who are able and willing to adopt progressive workplace practices. One of it, of course, is by making them more aware of the benefits of doing so. Another is that it is able to look into complaints that are levelled against certain employers and refer them to MOM for investigations if warranted. Through this process, TAFEP will either work withthe employers to change their practices and if the employers are not cooperative, to find other means of pushing the employers to change their practices.",1,108,2017-10-02-T-012-S-00108

We are introducing the Tripartite Standards as an additional measure to make the adherence with progressive workplace practices more attractive for the employers to do. So, all of these measures are available to us. It is not always the case that you have to come down hard on the employers.

2017-10-02-T-013,Sam Tan Chin Siong,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Companies are not required to buy Work Injury Compensation insurance for SEPs. This is because their relationship is one of client-contractor and not the employer-employee relationship. However, to help SEPs get adequate insurance coverage, a Tripartite Workgroup has been formed to look into this matter as well as to address other main concerns of SEPs. This was announced by the Ministry in the Committee of Supply debate this year.",3,114,2017-10-02-T-013-S-00114
2017-10-02-T-013,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Minister of State for his answer. I have one clarification. I would like to ask the Minister of State, in respect of the self-employed, how does the study group intend to look into the issue of insurance that the self-employed should take when they take on such jobs, including insurance that provides for third-party claims, for example, when they run into a pedestrian or when they hit another vehicle on the road and possibly when they are in the wrong?",1,115,2017-10-02-T-013-S-00115

2017-10-02-T-013,Sam Tan Chin Siong,Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong,"First, with regards to insurance for the self-employed, this is really not a very straightforward issue because individual SEPs may have contracts with many companies, multiple service buyers and some of which, their contracts may be just one-off and some may just last a few times. So, it is not really prudent to require all companies to purchase the insurance for every SEP because if we were to require companies to do so, then obviously, the cost for the companies will be quite high and eventually, the cost will be passed down to the consumers. So, in our view, this is not the most prudent way of requiring companies to buy insurance for SEPs.",2,117,2017-10-02-T-013-S-00117
2017-10-02-T-013,Sam Tan Chin Siong,Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong,"However, there are other ways that the Workgroup is looking into now. For example, whether it would be useful for the SEPs themselves to buy the insurance since they are already in the service to provide services, programmes and activities to companies.",3,118,2017-10-02-T-013-S-00118
2017-10-02-T-013,Sam Tan Chin Siong,Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong,"As to the third-party insurance claims, if the member of the public is injured by the employees of a company, then the third party can obviously take legal actions against the company for the injury that the third party sustains. But if the third party is injured by a SEP contracted by a company, then the situation is a little bit complicated. The court will have to decide whether the service buyers have taken the necessary practicable measures to ensure that the SEP under their contract has the relevant expertise, has attained the training, has worn a protective gear and also taken all the necessary precautions in carrying out the duties. If the companies, the service buyers have not done this, then there is a reason for the court to rule that the WSH Act was breached.",4,119,2017-10-02-T-013-S-00119
2017-10-02-T-013,Sam Tan Chin Siong,Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong,"However, if the company has taken all the necessary precautions, and it is solely the fault of the SEP, then the company is not liable for the SEP's actions. Then the third party would have to take up the legal action against the SEP themselves or herself. This is currently how the framework works.",5,120,2017-10-02-T-013-S-00120
2017-10-02-T-013,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,I thank the Minister of State. Just a quick clarification. Would the study group be looking into the possibility of making it mandatory for SEPs to have some form of third-party insurance? And a second question would be  how long would this review likely to take?,1,121,2017-10-02-T-013-S-00121
2017-10-02-T-013,Sam Tan Chin Siong,Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong,"I thank the Member for the further questions. Yes, the Workgroup will look into various aspects.

2017-10-02-T-013,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"I would like to seek a clarification from the Ministry whether or not, in your experience, were there cases whereby the self-employed individual deployed by the company or the services purchased by the company were people who were disguised contract-for-service? What I mean is basically that these companies should have hired them. Instead, they purchased their services under this contract-for-service, therefore, making them self-employed. What has the Ministry's experience been like?",1,123,2017-10-02-T-013-S-00123

There are currently 17 ongoing EUP projects from various Batches island-wide, including nine of the most recent Batch 9, projects that have just been approved. We would like to complete some of these ongoing projects first, before calling for new nominations. This will allow us to devote more requisite resources to better manage current projects and to ensure that new projects will be well managed as well.",1,130,2017-10-02-T-015-S-00130

But the exact duration depends on the number of nominations that we receive and the completeness of each application. Using Batch 9 as an example, we received 55 nominations that took us about eight months to evaluate. During this time, MND and agencies assessed the scope of the potential upgrading works, conducted site visits to assess the on-ground conditions, and considered how best to dovetail the works with agencies’ other improvement plans.",2,131,2017-10-02-T-015-S-00131

2017-10-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),"My second question is for EUP Programmes. As the Senior Minister of State knows, the private estates do not have support from either Town Council Upgrading Programmes, CIPC or HDB Upgrading Programmes. So, to that extent, private estates really rely on EUP Programmes to upgrade and renew the facilities, including drains, culverts, sidewalks, roads, and so on.",2,133,2017-10-02-T-015-S-00133
2017-10-02-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade),"Given that the EUP Programme for Batch 9 has been suspended and there is no timeframe for Batch 10, would the Ministry consider accelerating the programme, expediting it and, perhaps, giving more priority to constituencies which are either substantially or wholly private estates?",3,134,2017-10-02-T-015-S-00134

2017-10-02-T-015,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"The Member is right to say that Batch 10 has previously asked for nominations, and I remember we did send a letter to notify the Advisers of each of the wards that have previously been asked to do so, that there has been a review of public sector projects to be implemented, so that we can make sure that the demand for construction workers and also the total number of workers in Singapore can be better managed. In that sense, Batch 10 has been deferred somewhat. But in May this year, we have actually just approved all the Batch 9 projects.

2017-10-02-T-015,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Speaker, the whole concept of the EUP is meant to be largely a ground-up kind of initiative where residents within the estate actually give the inputs as to how they want to see their estates developed. So, regardless of the mechanism, the idea is that the current working mechanism comprising a working committee largely made up of the residents who are staying there, who are members of the Neighbourhood Committee, who know the estate very well, working closely with the implementing agents, as well as the consultants to walk the ground, to give feedback. That is the reason why the whole entire consultation process can take up to several months before actual ground-breaking starts.",1,143,2017-10-02-T-015-S-00143

Some of them, of course, are not very mobile, or they have chronic conditions. Some of them have to take leave from work to do so. So, would the SSOs try to overcome that by, for example, having a phone conversation and exchange of documents some other way, by mail or email, or will they consider even making house visits in certain cases where it is absolutely necessary?",1,156,2017-10-02-T-016-S-00156

Let us, say, in my area, if there are residents who have issues, who even cannot go to the SSO, my grassroots leaders and fellow residents will come and assist in the process.

2017-10-02-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked	 the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) how many Singapore-based companies have cumulatively invested in the Government's overseas industrial park projects that enjoy G-to-G support such as the Suzhou Industrial Park and Tianjin Eco-City; (b) how many of these are GLCs, SMEs and MNCs respectively; and (c) what evidence has been accumulated by the Ministry as to the spin-off benefits to the domestic economy and local SMEs of these Government-supported overseas industrial parks.",1,168,2017-10-02-T-018-S-00168
2017-10-02-T-018,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"Mr Speaker, internationalisation remains an important strategy to sustain Singapore’s growth by helping our companies develop beyond our domestic market. Government-to-Government (G-to-G) projects such as the Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP), Tianjin Eco-city, Chongqing Connectivity Initiative (CCI) and the Amaravati Capital City project in Andhra Pradesh, play an enabling role in paving the way for Singapore companies to enter and scale up in fast-growing markets such as China and India.",1,169,2017-10-02-T-018-S-00169
2017-10-02-T-018,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"Over the years, many Singapore companies have tapped on these G-to-G platforms to go abroad. In the case of SIP, about 340 Singapore companies have established their presence there as at the end of 2016. Of these, approximately 70% are small companies with registered capital of up to S$1 million. Cumulative contractual investments by Singapore-based companies in SIP amounted to S$9.4 billion by the end of last year. The National University of Singapore has also established a Research Institute – the NUS (Suzhou) Research Institute – in SIP which has served as a springboard for Singapore start-ups to incubate and scale up in China. NUSRI is currently incubating 37 Singapore and international technology start-ups.",2,170,2017-10-02-T-018-S-00170
2017-10-02-T-018,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"Just to give Members an example of a company that has benefited from SIP and scaled successfully is called PatSnap. Founded in 2007, a Singapore company that offers innovative patent data analytics solutions. So, to overcome the small domestic market constraints, they scaled up by first going overseas to SIP and today their software has been sold in over 40 countries to more than 1,300 clients. In March this year, the company announced its plans to invest S$22 million in a Research and Development (R&D) centre in Singapore to further develop its intelligence platform. To date, the centre has hired more than 10 data scientists.",3,171,2017-10-02-T-018-S-00171

As of June this year, 42 Singapore companies are registered in the TEC, with a total registered capital of more than S$220 million.

Of the 42 companies, would the Minister have the proportion who are SMEs? And then the second question is really on whether MTI has studied the issue of the impact of these investments on domestic operations and what is the positive feedback loop?

2017-10-02-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I do not have the data on that offhand but I would imagine and indeed our experience in general has been, there is no reason to think it is terribly different to what we have had in SIP and other places which is about 70% or two-thirds. In general when companies go overseas, they do not just do it on their own, they go because there is a larger opportunity arising from whether it is a G-to-G project or some other element that is initiating it such as one of their large clients going overseas and then they go with them. So, I would say it is not unusual to see about two-thirds but I do not have an exact answer for the Member.",1,179,2017-10-02-T-018-S-00179
2017-10-02-T-018,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The larger question, I think, is whether there is a value proposition back to Singapore. This is where what I have emphasised earlier, and which I think is worth repeating, whether it is through G-to-G projects or through other initiatives to take our companies overseas, or FTAs and other initiatives to help our companies internationalise, what is the fundamental objective? First, to help our companies grow beyond our domestic market; second, with that skill, it allows them to undertake a broader range of initiatives and invest more in their capabilities; and thirdly, it allows us to also create good opportunities for Singaporeans, not just in terms of pursuing opportunities in these other markets, but also in developing capabilities here. So, I gave Members the example of the patent company where they are doing R&D in Singapore that creates 10 new jobs which were not there before.",2,180,2017-10-02-T-018-S-00180

2017-10-02-T-019,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"To help companies access assistance programmes more easily, the Government has already been streamlining existing grants to minimise overlaps across agencies and simplify the application process. So, in other words is, we are not waiting for the formation of the new agency to do this. One example of our efforts is the Business Grants Portal (BGP) which consolidates commonly used grants, such as SPRING’s Capability Development Grant and IE Singapore’s Global Company Partnership, on a one-stop application portal. With this portal, which was officially launched in January 2017, companies can now apply for grants without having to approach multiple agencies.",2,184,2017-10-02-T-019-S-00184

Enterprise Singapore will also study how the various schemes and grants can be enhanced to develop integrated solutions that meet the needs of our companies in the new phase of growth. This will put us, we believe, in good stead to grow a strong cohort of Singapore companies for our future economy.",3,185,2017-10-02-T-019-S-00185

2017-10-02-T-019,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his questions. As we have emphasised, I think the formation of the new agency Enterprise Singapore is just one aspect of our overall effort to strengthen our economy and prepare for some of the challenges we anticipate. And in that regard, the role of the Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs), and in this case the specific reference the Member made was to the SME Centres that remains a very important part of the architecture that we have in our economy. So, the answer is yes, companies can continue to approach the SME Centres. In fact, we expect the SME Centres and the TACs to play an even more significant role as we move forward with various initiatives.",1,188,2017-10-02-T-019-S-00188
2017-10-02-T-019,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The second point to an account management, I think as the Member would be aware and indeed for the information of all Members, the accounts are managed by the different agencies today. We have already had an effort to streamline the account management so that there is a principal agency managing a particular relationship with a company whether it is EDB, IE or SPRING, and others will then work through that principal relationship. With the formation of Enterprise Singapore, we expect this process to become even more efficient and effective. Certainly, one of Enterprise Singapore's priorities will be to see how it can better interface with the business community and specific enterprises.",2,189,2017-10-02-T-019-S-00189

Will the Senior Minister of State please elaborate on the considerations which will be taken into account when the authority is making such designation? Will the Senior Minister of State be able to share any examples? Next, why are the considerations not set out expressly in section 86D? And finally, would such a bare provision not affect the consistency and certainty of this application or even be subject to abuse?",7,225,2017-10-02-T-026-S-00225
2017-10-02-T-026,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Next, Mr Speaker, the proposed section 86E requires that if a person becomes a 5% controller of a designated public licensee holder, designated public trust or designated equity interest holder as a result of an increase in the holding of equity interest or in the voting power controlled by that person or any associate of that person, he must notify the authority in writing. Again, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State what is the rationale for this. Would the new provisions in section 86F requiring persons to seek prior approval before becoming a 25%, 50% or 75% controller of designated entities be sufficient?",8,226,2017-10-02-T-026-S-00226
2017-10-02-T-026,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Next, I move on to the regulation of inland craft. This is another important change. What the Bill seeks to do is to have the MPA regulate inland water craft, a role which will be taken over from PUB. Under the new part 13A of this Bill, MPA will take over the regulatory roles relating to construction maintenance, safe operation and navigation and the crew manning requirements and other aspects of inland craft. Permits for use on inland waterways and reservoir remain under the authority of PUB and rightly so. This is a change in the right direction as MPA is the more appropriate authority for water borne vessels and craft.",9,227,2017-10-02-T-026-S-00227
2017-10-02-T-026,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Mr Speaker, I would like to seek some clarifications from the Senior Minister of State. Operationally, how will the MPA ensure that on the ground all vessels or inland crafts operate safely and in compliance with all regulations governing safe operation and navigation in the reservoirs and inland water ways? Will PUB still be working with the MPA in this area? If so, what will be their role on the ground?",10,228,2017-10-02-T-026-S-00228

2017-10-02-T-026,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Can the Senior Minister of State clarify if any regulations on the use of engines for vessels in reservoirs are in the pipeline?,6,235,2017-10-02-T-026-S-00235
2017-10-02-T-026,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"According to Eugene Heng, the Founder and CEO of Waterways Watch Society, “we are currently permitted to operate vessels with four-stroke engines, battery-operated electric vessels, or solar-powered vessels.

2017-10-02-T-026,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Further, many operators do not have access to the required charging facilities at their jetties. Any arrangement for such charging will invariably lead to higher operating costs. He added that changing nine vessels that are of four-stroke engines to battery or solar-powered ones will cost at least $300,000 to $400,000. Installation of charging facilities at jetties, after obtaining the relevant permission from the authorities would cost another $50,000.",9,238,2017-10-02-T-026-S-00238

2017-10-02-T-026,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"They explained that vessels are easily identified in reservoirs since these water bodies are not large. Hence, can the Ministry clarify the rationale for this requirement for vessels in reservoirs or water bodies of similar sizes?",13,242,2017-10-02-T-026-S-00242

2017-10-02-T-026,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"As I mentioned in my speech earlier, our port is a national strategic infrastructure. The Government has made significant investments in developing the port. And we will make even greater investments, especially in building up Tuas Terminal over the next few decades.",2,250,2017-10-02-T-026-S-00250
2017-10-02-T-026,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"The intention of the equity control requirements is not to interfere with the day-to-day operations of the designated entities or restrict its commercial flexibility, but rather to require MPA’s approval to be sought for transactions crossing stipulated significant thresholds in equity interest.",3,251,2017-10-02-T-026-S-00251
2017-10-02-T-026,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Mr Tan also asked how MPA decided on the 5%, 25% and 50% acquisition thresholds, and the 50% and 75% disposal thresholds. Under the Companies Act, a 5% shareholder is considered a substantial shareholder. Although a 5% shareholder typically does not have significant powers to drastically influence the direction of a company, it is still important for MPA to be informed of any new substantial shareholders of its designated public licensees.",4,252,2017-10-02-T-026-S-00252
2017-10-02-T-026,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Shareholders with 25% or 50% interest, however, wield significant voting power in a company’s decisions. A shareholder who has more than 25% equity interest can veto special resolutions under the Companies Act. A shareholder with more than 50% equity interest can pass ordinary resolutions. These are the reasons why MPA should have some regulatory oversight on shareholders seeking to reach 25% and 50% of the equity interest respectively.",5,253,2017-10-02-T-026-S-00253
2017-10-02-T-026,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"On the other hand, a shareholder will lose its ability to control special resolutions if its equity interest falls below 75%. It will lose its ability to control ordinary resolutions if its equity interest falls below 50%. As these are important corporate decisions that could impact the overall direction of the company, MPA should maintain oversight on whether it is in our national interest for any incumbent shareholders to relinquish such voting powers.",6,254,2017-10-02-T-026-S-00254
2017-10-02-T-026,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would like to add that the disposal and acquisition controls are not duplicative. The acquisition controls enable MPA to have oversight of single persons becoming a new major shareholder of a designated entity. The disposal controls grant MPA oversight of existing shareholders from selling interest in a designated entity, whether to a single or multiple persons.",7,255,2017-10-02-T-026-S-00255
2017-10-02-T-026,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Mr Dennis Tan also asked whether the thresholds are set too onerous. But in fact we are at most on par with those with similar legislation for other sectors, and they are not more stringent.",8,256,2017-10-02-T-026-S-00256
2017-10-02-T-026,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Currently, vessels operating in reservoirs of Singapore are regulated and given permits to use the inland water bodies by PUB. MPA is the authority for safety standards for marine vessels and thus has the relevant expertise and experience, and is in a good position to assume the responsibility for setting the safety standards for vessels operating in reservoirs and inland waterways. This will further enhance safety of navigation in these water bodies. PUB will continue to be the authority to issue permits to vessels for use in reservoirs and inland waterways for the purpose of water quality control, protection of reservoir infrastructure, controlling the types of activities in these water bodies and preventing social disamenities.",9,257,2017-10-02-T-026-S-00257
2017-10-02-T-026,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Mr Louis Ng asked whether the Bill will require inland vessels currently fitted with four-stroke engines to switch to other engine types such as battery or solar-powered ones.

2017-10-02-T-026,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,Mr Ng also asked if MPA intends to require inland water vessels to be fitted with AIS transponders. I agree with Mr Ng that there is no need at this point to require inland water vessels to install such equipment.,11,259,2017-10-02-T-026-S-00259
2017-10-02-T-026,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I share Mr Ng’s concern for the environment. PUB already has existing measures to safeguard against the pollution of our waterways from vessels. For instance, PUB’s regulations prohibit inland water vessels from discharging wastewater and other pollutants. These measures have been effective in keeping our reservoirs and waterways clean. Hence, there is no need to amend the MPA Act or the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea Act to preserve the pristine conditions of our water bodies.",12,260,2017-10-02-T-026-S-00260
2017-10-02-T-026,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Lastly, on the question by Mr Dennis Tan about why we are legislating the equity interest holders as well as the business trust. In many instances, it is the parent company that would have the power to control key decisions of the licensee. So, for the legislation to be effective, MPA must have the powers to go beyond just the public licensee to the shareholders as well.",13,261,2017-10-02-T-026-S-00261

2017-10-02-T-027,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"First, on security-by-design. Security-by-design is a process to ensure that security is designed into the building design. It attempts to mitigate security risks through good building design, and incorporates security measures upfront into the building features. Examples of such security measures include  (a) hardening of structural elements, such as walls and columns, to resist bomb blast effects; (b) providing for a stand-off distance using security barriers to prevent unauthorised vehicles from coming close to the building; and (c) combining security technology with operational processes, such as monitoring CCTVs, operating access control systems, or implementing security procedures.",25,294,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00294
2017-10-02-T-027,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),A key benefit of security-by-design is that security is effectively incorporated into the building without overly compromising other factors such as the form and function of the building. It is generally more cost-effective because good design can reduce or even eliminate the need for some security measures. It also avoids costly retrofitting later on.,26,295,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00295
2017-10-02-T-027,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),Security-by-design will be made a legal requirement under the Bill.,27,296,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00296

The owners and occupiers of protected places will want more clarity about the burden and apportionment of costs for enhanced security. I would like to ask if the Ministry will be issuing guidelines on how it will work with businesses to manage such costs.",3,355,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00355
2017-10-02-T-027,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"Next, another equally important component for infrastructure protection is the personnel involved. Besides the security staff, non-security personnel at these facilities should also be trained in how to act to reduce risks and respond in the event of emergencies. All staff should be trained with regular drills, and processes must be in place to ensure that the necessary steps and compliance measures are adhered to.",4,356,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00356
2017-10-02-T-027,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"Last, I would like to request that hospitals be considered for the list of selected protected areas. Hospitals are a very important part of our infrastructure, along with other more obvious facilities, such as our airport, ports, checkpoints and military installations. They provide an essential service and experience high human traffic daily, which make them potential targets for terrorists. In the event of a terror attack, the provision of medical care could be severely disrupted. Furthermore, medical personnel and equipment are very difficult to replace. Therefore, I hope that our hospitals will be accorded greater protection.",5,357,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00357
2017-10-02-T-027,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),I would like to conclude with my support for the Bill.,6,358,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00358
2017-10-02-T-027,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill seeks to protect selected areas and buildings against security risks. These threats are not merely terrorism-related but include threats from crime and accidents. It goes without saying that appropriate security measures can safeguard lives and property, and minimise disruptions to essential services. Thus, this Bill should be supported.",1,359,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00359
2017-10-02-T-027,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Having said that, it should also be borne in mind that we should also not go overboard and have the country in perpetual lock-down mode. We must be able to go about our daily activities efficiently. If we cannot live normal lives, the terrorists have already won.",2,360,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00360
2017-10-02-T-027,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"This Bill has several Parts. While I am in general support of the Bill, I have some queries and concerns to raise.",3,361,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00361
2017-10-02-T-027,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, on Part 3  protected areas and protected places. The Bill repeals the current Protected Areas and Protected Places Act, and re-enacts the same provisions but includes some new provisions as well. At the same time, the maximum fines for offences have been drastically increased, from $1,000 to $20,000. I assume that this is due to the heightened security environment and inflation over the years, but I appreciate the Minister's clarification on this.",4,362,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00362
2017-10-02-T-027,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, clause 29 introduces a new provision to make it an offence to take photographs or videos of protected areas and protected places. While it is perfectly reasonable to prohibit such actions inside or above the protected area or protected place, the section makes it an offence to take a photograph or make a recording from outside the protected area and protected place. Is it reasonable to punish someone taking a picture from outside, when he is standing in a public area, and the photograph is simply capturing what is already visible publicly? Maps available on the Internet, such as Google Earth, already show such information publicly anyway.",5,363,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00363
2017-10-02-T-027,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, I move on to Part 4  special developments and special infrastructures. This Bill introduces new provisions that certain developments and buildings will be required to have security plans approved by the new Commissioner for Infrastructure Protection.",6,364,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00364
2017-10-02-T-027,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"What constitutes a ""special development"" or ""special infrastructure""? According to Ministry's press release on 11 September and also the Minister’s Second Reading speech, these buildings would be those which ""house essential services, are iconic, or with high human traffic"". Clause 34 states that the Minister will be the one designating ""special developments"" and ""special infrastructures"" that need to comply with the Act. Could there be further elaboration on the types and extent of buildings that would need to be designated? For instance, will all shopping malls be designated? What about hospitals? As for HDB estates, clause 2 of the Act states that Town Councils would be considered owners of common property for the purpose of the Act. Which part of HDB estates would be deemed ""special infrastructures""?",7,365,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00365
2017-10-02-T-027,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, as far as developments are concerned, the intention is to have security embedded into the facility at the design stage. Clause 35 makes it clear that key structural works cannot commence until the security plan is approved. From a security management perspective, such early emplacement of security concerns is recommended and likely to achieve better outcomes. At the design stage, security professionals can work with architects, engineers and facility owners to ensure that security features do not disrupt the overall building aesthetics or the facility's operational needs.",8,366,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00366
2017-10-02-T-027,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Clauses 33 provides that the security plans must be prepared by a person approved by the Commissioner for Infrastructure Protection in connection with those works. I would like to know whether it is intended that the Commissioner pre-approves a list of security practitioners who would be acceptable, or would the Commissioner be open to case-by-case approvals of security consultants, depending on the project or the building at hand? Will the Commissioner accept a security professional who is an employee of the owner or occupier?",9,367,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00367
2017-10-02-T-027,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Lastly, Sir, clauses 37 and 44 talk about amendments to approved security plans. The amendments can be initiated by either the building owner or the Commissioner for Infrastructure Protection. In other words, after the Commissioner has approved the security plan, he can change his mind some time later and require additional measures to be included. What if the new measures result in wasted costs, for example, if they require undoing of systems or structures already put in? It seems that, according to clause 80, the owner has to bear such wasted costs. Whether clause 80 is fair will depend on why the amendment to the plan at a later stage was needed. If the amendment was due to the negligence of the authorities in the first approval, should the owner be forced to bear the additional cost?",10,368,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00368
2017-10-02-T-027,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, Singapore has so far managed to prevent a terrorist attack on our soil, but given the extreme ease with which acts of terror can now be committed using a runaway truck or with a knife easily bought from a supermarket, we cannot afford to be complacent. On 1 June 2017, MHA released the Terrorism Threat Assessment Report that highlighted the persistent risk of attack that Singapore faces, and the recent video released by ISIS media centre featuring a Singapore-born terrorist further brings home the point that security is our collective responsibility.",1,369,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00369
2017-10-02-T-027,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"With the launch of SGSecure to sensitise, train and mobilise the community in the event of an attack, it is highly relevant that we now take a hard review at the adequacy of our safety protocols and put in place networks, structures, systems and processes to support our nation's effort in the constant battle against terrorism. While I am most supportive of this Bill, I would like to raise some points for the Minister's consideration. Perhaps, some of these points have already been covered to some extent by the Second Minister in her very thorough opening speech, but I hope that she will be open also to considering the points raised over the next few minutes or so.",2,370,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00370
2017-10-02-T-027,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"I would like to start off with talking about clause 5 which talks about the Commissioner of Infrastructure Protection. The Bill, when passed, will vest the Minister with the authority to appoint, among public officers, a Commissioner of Infrastructure Protection, and a team of Deputy Commissioners and Assistant Commissioners that administer the Act. This reinforces the importance given to securing our key installations and properties against possible incursions.",3,371,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00371
2017-10-02-T-027,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"While the appointment of a coordinating Commissioner and his/her team is a step in the right direction, the question of how coordination can be done across multiple agencies needs to be addressed. For example, what are the criteria for the Commissioner's appointment and what will be the extent of his/her power? Would he or she be vested with authority to coordinate the activities of different agencies that are now responsible for infrastructure protection? And is the Ministry considering setting up a dedicated Agency for Infrastructure Protection to execute the duties of the role?",4,372,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00372
2017-10-02-T-027,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"I would like now to move on to clause 8 which states that the Minister will be vested with wide-ranging power to declare any premises in Singapore as a protected area if it is deemed necessary to control the movement and conduct of persons on the premises. While I appreciate that exigencies might require swift responses from the Government, would the Government consider building in safeguards to protect against potential compromise of stakeholders' interests?",5,373,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00373
2017-10-02-T-027,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"In its current form, the Bill clarifies only the purpose and intent of the protected area but does not specify the criteria that would be used to determine if a premises should come under protection. As opposed to the current broad interpretation that an area can come under protection upon application of its owner and by volition of the Minister, would the Ministry consider publishing guidelines that lay out the framework to determine whether an area will be put under protection, and also, how would the scope of protection relate to the strategic importance of the asset and level of threat?",6,374,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00374
2017-10-02-T-027,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"And, on a related note, if a designated protected area incorporates a mix of residential and commercial interests, such as, say, for example, the Marina Bay Financial Centre, how would the designation of the protected area impact the interest of residents and businesses in that area?",7,375,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00375
2017-10-02-T-027,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Clause 18 of the Bill highlights that only ""authorised officers"" are to be deployed to guard protected places. A closer reading of the Bill reveals that ""authorised officers"" are interpreted broadly to encompass personnel from various divisions of the Home Team and SAF, as well as auxiliary officers and security guards.",8,376,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00376
2017-10-02-T-027,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"I believe, Mr Speaker, that we need to ensure that ""authorised officers"" who are protecting the installations are adequately and adeptly trained to spot, manage and neutralise potential terrorists. While the SPF and SAF have specialised personnel who are trained to protect key installations, it would be hard to reconcile that an ICA officer, though with due respect, or security guard deployed by a commercial security firm would possess that same level of training to be a deterrent for would-be terrorists.",9,377,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00377
2017-10-02-T-027,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),Would the Ministry consider implementing a training curriculum and a certification process to ensure that all personnel deployed to guard key installations have the right level of competence and skill to discharge their duties? This would differentiate a casual security guard from a specialised officer that has been trained and prepared for guarding protected places.,10,378,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00378
2017-10-02-T-027,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Finally, I support the Bill’s provision that new developments can be designated as special developments where developers are legally obliged to construct and build the relevant safety structures to ensure the safety of the building’s occupants. Some of these devices, as mentioned by the Second Minister herself earlier, would include video or surveillance devices in the vicinity of the building, barriers to prevent vehicular threats to crowds or building structures, specially-reinforced concrete walls that do not collapse easily, and fireproof claddings. While these features can be incorporated with relative ease into new developments, they are much more difficult to be implemented in existing buildings.",11,379,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00379
2017-10-02-T-027,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"It was reported in April 2016 that an inter-agencies working team has been put together to study security guidelines for existing buildings and the results of the study will be made available. Can the Ministry shed some light on the outcome of this study? Does the Ministry intend to conduct a safety audit, as it were, on existing buildings to ensure that building owners are compelled to rectify security shortcomings to mitigate collateral damage from terrorist attacks? Also, would there be guidelines for public agencies, such as Town Councils and HDB, on enhancing public safety in HDB estates, as well as guidelines for owners of commercial properties on what they could and, perhaps, should do to deter would-be attacks? The Second Minister talked earlier about ""security-by-design"". I was wondering if this concept could be expanded to include, perhaps, the notion of ""security-by-redesign"" for existing buildings and properties.",12,380,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00380
2017-10-02-T-027,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"The threat of terrorism is real and persistent, Mr Speaker. Recent sectarian violence in Southeast Asia is not only the result of violent extremism and fundamentalism originating from the Middle-East, it also provides the recruitment platform for that extremism and fundamentalism to be fuelled further. This is a vicious cycle that will have potentially grave consequences as returning fighters from the conflict in that part of the world come back to this part of the world in Southeast Asia.",13,381,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00381
2017-10-02-T-027,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"The reading of this Bill is thus timely and we certainly need to strengthen our resolve to combat extremism and terrorism, not only in terms of being more vigilant, reinforcing our social ties, boosting our para-military competencies, but also in protecting our buildings and infrastructure as well.",14,382,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00382
2017-10-02-T-027,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I conclude my speech in firm support of the Bill.",15,383,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00383
2017-10-02-T-027,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Mr Speaker, the 9-11 attacks ushered in an era whereby terrorist attacks are an unfortunate norm. While we have avoided terrorist attacks on Singapore soil thus far, we must not stop enhancing our defence against terrorism.",1,384,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00384
2017-10-02-T-027,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Terrorists evolve their tactics quickly to stay one step ahead of security and law enforcement agencies. Cars and lorries are now used just as effectively as explosives to cause carnage, fear and deadly divisions in many countries. We saw these in Finland, the UK and Spain. The broad-ranging terrorist arsenal meant that our security agencies cannot be the only active agents in preventing terrorism.",2,385,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00385
2017-10-02-T-027,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"This Bill seeks to ensure that our key infrastructures are well guarded against threats. Infrastructure owners will be required to adopt measures against security threats. These will involve additional costs and resources for businesses, and may result in some inconvenience as well. The concern about cost is understandable. Yet, a successful attack involves a far graver cost, and not just for businesses, but for everyone. This Bill is not alone in its bid to strengthen Singapore’s line against terrorism. The Counter-Terrorism Committee under the United Nations has similarly called for greater partnership between public and private sectors to secure critical infrastructure.",3,386,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00386
2017-10-02-T-027,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"We can understand the concerns on costs because there can be a long tail of them. The costs involved will include consultancy, implementation and long-term maintenance and replacement. How would the Ministry better help our businesses to manage these costs effectively so that it will not be passed down to tenants and customers? In fact, the Ministry’s regulatory costs could also increase to ensure that the security measures are in working condition. How can the Ministry itself better manage such longer-term costs?",4,387,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00387
2017-10-02-T-027,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Because the measures that might be needed can be extensive, there is value for a prescribed code, much like a building code. This allows companies to know what is expected of them as part of forward business planning. Yet, this might then become an ironically useful guide for terrorists. We need to strike a balance. Could the Minister share more on how the selection of infrastructure is made, and how many buildings will be affected? What is the timeline given for affected buildings to comply with all the requirements set out in the Bill?",5,388,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00388
2017-10-02-T-027,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Mr Speaker, skilled manpower along the value chain is needed for these measures to work. For example, there must be sufficient consultants and capacity in the Ministry to ensure that building owners are not unduly delayed in seeking approvals. We need to ensure that security officers are kept updated on these new measures. Would new forms of training be required and refresher training be introduced to help existing security officers? There is also a consequential need for a pool of capable and well-trained staff in facilities management who can ensure that the new security measures implemented are in good working order. We will also need the security agencies to have sufficient resources to audit the buildings, the list of which, perhaps, will only grow with time.",6,389,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00389
2017-10-02-T-027,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),The powers to stop unauthorised photography are needed to stem terrorist surveillance and reconnaissance. This is an important first counter-terrorism measure. Do the powers also extend to publishing of such photos? What measures or education efforts will be taken to increase awareness?,7,390,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00390
2017-10-02-T-027,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Mr Speaker, this Bill improves the security in Singapore. However, laws alone will not solve all our security issues. There will still be many buildings holding thousands of people and of iconic and important value but not included within the guidelines. Yet, we know it is unwise to barricade every building and line every street with bollards. We must secure whatever we can, prudently and effectively. This is another ring of defence to complement our SGSecure work. The best defence is still an engaged and resilient citizenry. With this, Sir, I support the Bill.",8,391,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00391
2017-10-02-T-027,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, I stand in support of the Bill. Enhancement of security measures to buildings and provision of powers to security personnel to better protect Singapore’s infrastructure against security risks is timely, in light of the prevalence of indiscriminate terror attacks carried out globally.",1,392,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00392
2017-10-02-T-027,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Further, I applaud the initiative to rope in the business community as part of the shared effort to keep Singapore safe.",2,393,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00393
2017-10-02-T-027,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),There are two clarifications I seek.,3,394,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00394
2017-10-02-T-027,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Firstly, clause 22 describes the circumstances which allow the authorised officers of protected areas or places to use such force as is reasonably necessary, to remove any person or, without warrant, arrest a person who enters or is about to enter such protected areas or places.",4,395,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00395
2017-10-02-T-027,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"These circumstances include a catch-all provision prescribing if that person, in the opinion of the authorised officer, does not have a good and lawful reason to enter or to be in that protected area or place, or is acting in a suspicious manner.",5,396,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00396
2017-10-02-T-027,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The presence of the global threat of terror is very real, and the need to empower our officers is much needed. However, can the Minister clarify if these powers given to the authorised officer in clause 22 are subject to guidelines?",6,397,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00397
2017-10-02-T-027,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I believe there are less concerns when these powers are given to police officers, but there is concern that this Bill indicates that such powers can be given to security officers. The training a police officer receives is very different from the training a security officer receives. Can the Minister provide further clarifications on the need to provide security officers with such powers?",7,398,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00398
2017-10-02-T-027,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In addition, there is now a stronger focus on the role of security officers in our fight against terrorism. Will MHA be devoting resources into developing this industry and reviewing and improving the training provided to these officers?",8,399,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00399
2017-10-02-T-027,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Secondly, I appreciate that ensuring security of Singapore’s infrastructure should be a joint responsibility. This duty ought to be shared by all, including businesses, premises owners and developers.",9,400,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00400
2017-10-02-T-027,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"However, as shared by Members who have spoken before me, there have been concerns by building owners on rising operational costs when additional security measures have to be put in place.",10,401,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00401
2017-10-02-T-027,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"There is less concern for new buildings or those undergoing major renovations since they can factor such costs during the initial stages, but more so when we issue directives or orders for existing buildings. I do appreciate that this is necessary. But, perhaps, the cost of not implementing such measures against terrorist attacks would be greater than the cost of installing CCTVs, deploying security officers and barriers.",11,402,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00402
2017-10-02-T-027,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),But I hope the Minister can address some of the public concerns with regard to the availability of grants in exceptional cases where the building owner is unable to afford the costs of implementing the directives or orders.,12,403,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00403
2017-10-02-T-027,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, I applaud the efforts of the Ministry thus far with the SGSecure movement.

2017-10-02-T-027,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Mr Speaker, I rise to support the Infrastructure Protection Bill. However, to ensure that the desired outcomes of the Bill be achieved, it is important that other aspects related to the implementation of the Bill be looked into as well.",1,407,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00407
2017-10-02-T-027,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Firstly, I think we need to look at the quality of our security officers, especially those engaged by the private security agencies. The effectiveness of the Bill will depend on the capabilities and competency of the security officers which, currently, vary widely. Our ICA and SPF officers are well trained and equipped with relevant training, such as TOPSIS profiling and Red-Team simulations, to ensure that they always maintain their edge in executing their duties.",2,408,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00408
2017-10-02-T-027,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"For private security officers today, the 42,000 of them on the ground are treated as a common group. I seek MHA to review this approach. The 42,000 officers diverge on demographics, education and capabilities. At the risk of over-generalising things, may I propose that we categorise them into three separate groups?",3,409,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00409
2017-10-02-T-027,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"On the one hand, we have officers who are fit and highly competent. Bouncers, event security officers fit into this category, which is not unlike the APO (E) scheme currently available for APOs who do not need to carry a weapon. For this group, we should treat them as APOs and they should command a premium salary. They would have to undergo annual refresher courses and physical fitness tests.",4,410,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00410
2017-10-02-T-027,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"On the other hand, based on our ground engagement, about one-third of the 42,000 officers today are near retirement or post-retirement. For these officers, taking every extra module subjects them to undue stress because of language difficulties. These officers should be allowed to serve as security officers at sites deemed low risk, and we thank MHA and PLRD for taking the first step towards this consideration, as reflected in the proposed Bill. It is important to note that my recommendation does not discriminate this group of workers. Should any of these officers would like to upgrade themselves, by all means they can do so.",5,411,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00411
2017-10-02-T-027,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"In the middle, we have a group of officers who, though not as fit, may be able to take on other duties, like first aid, lift rescue and firefighting. Buyers today already expect them to do so, without properly prescribing them in the contracts, nor paying for it. I would like to propose that for every skillset they are expected to have, these officers must be given an extra pay equivalent to the value of that skillset. This should sit on top of their basic pay.",6,412,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00412
2017-10-02-T-027,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I firmly believe that if we variegate the jobs in the security industry in this manner, we will create a proper career path for our security officers with meaningful pay. After all, none of us would like to work in an industry where everyone has the same job scope. And, afterall, we are talking about 42,000 officers.",7,413,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00413
2017-10-02-T-027,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Related to this is the need to have better working conditions and employment terms and benefits for our private security officers which can lead to a better work performance. Currently, the security industry is plagued by issues, such as long working hours, lack of proper rest areas, and officers are given only basic employment statutory benefits.",8,414,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00414
2017-10-02-T-027,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Unless a decisive effort is made to improve the working conditions and mandating better employment benefits, it will be difficult to attract younger workers into the industry. Hence, I would like to ask MHA on what are the plans to improve working conditions of the security officers and to consider my proposals above to attract younger people to be security officers.",9,415,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00415
2017-10-02-T-027,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Second, I would like MHA to consider having basic security requirements in residential areas, such as condominiums, that will require the use of technology to improve security with less reliance on headcount. Even though a set of guidelines on enhancing building security by MHA and BCA is available, the take-up rate can be further improved if some of these requirements are made mandatory in these residential developments.",10,416,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00416
2017-10-02-T-027,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Some of these mandated security requirements should involve the use of technology, such as next generation visitor management system; using more smart cameras with surveillance software and smart analytics; perimeter detection that would reduce the need for patrolling; cloud-based reporting for incident reports to be sent to key decision makers at short notice and having a remote command centre that could optimise manpower deployment on the ground. All these could reduce the overall demand for private security officers to allow for shorter working hours which are currently at 12 hours a day for six days a week.",11,417,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00417
2017-10-02-T-027,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"As a start, by properly assessing the security needs of a site, suitably hardening first before prescribing security manpower will definitely go a long way in enhancing security outcomes for any site and also increase productivity almost instantly. In short, I would like to propose MHA mandating some of these security risk assessments for residential areas as well. Alternatively, MHA could also allow building owners not under the select building scheme to opt-in to meet the requirement or standard of the security measures under the category of Selected Buildings. Would MHA be able to provide the support they require to conform to the prescribed security standards?",12,418,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00418
2017-10-02-T-027,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"In conclusion, security is everyone’s responsibility.

If so, how is the Ministry planning to address the supply shortage whilst ensuring the quality of new auxiliary police officers? Like my fellow Labour Member of Parliament, Mr Zainal Sapari, I am concerned with the manpower shortage, which does have a negative impact on our security officers, including fatigue. I would, therefore, like to ask how the Ministry plans to attract more Singaporeans into the sector.",2,421,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00421
2017-10-02-T-027,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"The manpower crunch, coupled with the projected increase in demand for security officers, makes it clear that we must turn to technology to fill the gap. For example, the use of smart video technology and motion sensors can help reduce labour-intensive patrol work. Smart video technology and motion sensors can pick up movements at the perimeter and analyse if they present a threat to the building. In my constituency, the Orchard Road Business Association has been encouraging hotels, retail buildings and offices to harness technology, such as AI-enabled facial recognition, when upgrading their security systems. However, the cost of implementing such advanced security technologies may be prohibitive for some building owners.",3,422,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00422
2017-10-02-T-027,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Mr Speaker, as highlighted by Members who have spoken before me, the cost of implementing additional security measures under the proposed Bill, be it traditional or advanced measures, will not come cheap. While new developments can incorporate the new security requirements into their design, older buildings may face a far heftier price tag if retrofitting works are extensive. These costs will be passed down to the tenants, many of whom are Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), and eventually trickle down to consumers. Hence, I would like the Ministry to consider extending co-funding support to older buildings seeking to comply with the Bill and incentivise building owners to adopt more advanced technologies by providing higher funding support.",4,423,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00423
2017-10-02-T-027,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"The introduction of advanced technologies will also mean that existing security officers must upgrade and upskill themselves to remain relevant. I understand that such concerns have already been raised to the Security Industry Transformation Committee, and an Industry Transformation Map (ITM) for the Private Security Industry is due by the end of this year. I would like to propose a review of the mandatory training modules under the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) so that security officers are better equipped to handle the new technologies and the new responsibilities accorded by the new provisions.",5,424,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00424
2017-10-02-T-027,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Mr Speaker, a crucial component of any security plan is the evacuation route once a building is targeted or compromised. I am sure that Members of this House have all taken part in a fire drill before and, indeed, it is essential for all buildings to have their own evacuation plans. However, such evacuations are often planned in insolation by the building’s management. When I was a police commander and asked to see the fire evacuation plans of buildings in the city centre, I was surprised to find that every building had designated the same small grass patch in the vicinity as its assembly area. Surely, the space would not be enough if everyone from every building gathers there at the same time. That is why coordination, sharing of information and joint exercises are important.",6,425,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00425

Therefore, businesses must also contribute.",4,442,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00442
2017-10-02-T-027,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In this high threat environment, building owners and developers recognise that ensuring the security of their buildings is part and parcel of carrying out business. A recent survey by the World Economic Forum found that business leaders in Singapore see terrorist attacks as their top global risk. Their concerns are not misplaced.",5,443,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00443
2017-10-02-T-027,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"They know that if the security of the building is breached, the damage to property could be much more costly. This is why even without the Bill, many buildings today already put in place security measures, like CCTVs and vehicle barriers. Most of these security measures do not involve complex systems and are maintained as part of the buildings’ other facilities.",6,444,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00444
2017-10-02-T-027,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In fact, security-by-design can offer cost savings to businesses in the longer term. When security measures are properly planned and seamlessly integrated into the design of the building, the use of technology, such as CCTV and access control systems, coupled with the appropriate processes, can help save on manpower cost. The flow of vehicles can be designed to reduce the risk of an attack to crowded areas, and minimise or even eliminate the need for bollards.",7,445,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00445

2017-10-02-T-027,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In past projects where security-by-design was implemented, the cost of security measures was between 0.2 and 3% of the total construction cost. But I should add that not all of this cost is attributable to the design process per se, since all buildings have to be fitted with some security measures in any case. Also, given that MHA will try to make known as early as possible which buildings need to undergo security-by-design, developers will likely factor in the cost of security measures in their bid price for the land.",9,447,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00447
2017-10-02-T-027,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Darryl David is right to point out the need to ensure that buildings which are not designated as Special Developments and Special Infrastructures are also protected.

2017-10-02-T-027,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,Let me now provide some clarifications on Special Developments and Special Infrastructures. Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Desmond Choo asked about the kinds of buildings that would be designated Special Developments and Special Infrastructures.,12,450,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00450
2017-10-02-T-027,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"It is fair that building owners and developers know, as early as possible, whether security-by-design requirements will apply in their own cases. This is why we intend to publish the criteria in the Gazette on the types of new developments that will be designated as Special Developments.",13,451,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00451
2017-10-02-T-027,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"What is this criteria based on? Essentially, we look at indicators that signal the high likelihood of public footfall being very large. So, that will naturally include the size, location and the type of the developments. For a start, we will include developments with Gross Floor Area of over 100,000 square metres, are located in specific planning areas, and there is a list which will be identified in the Gazette. And apart from the Gross Floor Area of 100,000 square metres, and also the location being in specific planning areas, these buildings ought to be designated by URA for commercial, community and mixed use. So, it will be quite clear through the Gazette which buildings are going to be designated Special Developments. Existing buildings that meet the criteria will generally also be designated as Special Infrastructures so that security can be incorporated in their design during renovation.",14,452,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00452

2017-10-02-T-027,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Darryl David asked about the Commissioner of Infrastructure Protection. This person would be a senior public servant in the Ministry of Home Affairs who has the necessary professional expertise to make assessments, and to coordinate with relevant Home Team agencies. MHA has been working with selected building owners over the past decade on security-by-design. So, there is already a team in place and we will make sure the team is adequately resourced to implement the new requirements but no new agency needs to be set up for now.",17,455,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00455
2017-10-02-T-027,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Ms Lim also asked about competent persons who need to be approved by the Commissioner to prepare security plans. The Commissioner will make an assessment for each project, after assessing the person’s relevant qualifications, past experience with security-by-design projects, and the nature of the project. There is no pre-approved list, and we will provide broad guidelines on the requirements that competent persons should meet. In-house experts may also be included. But all will need to be approved for each project because some projects may require special expertise, or may be of a sensitive nature.",18,456,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00456
2017-10-02-T-027,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Developing industry capabilities in security consulting and infrastructure protection is also one of our key priorities. There are security and blast consultants, as well as other built environment professionals like architects, who are well-versed with security-by-design. In other words, it is not an idea that is completely new in Singapore. Over the last decade, a number of projects have already gone through this process. As the Bill extends security-by-design to more new developments, we will build up the pool of competent persons with the new scheme for Professional Engineers in Protective Security. We will also work with the security industry to develop security consulting capabilities, as part of the Security Industry Transformation Map.",19,457,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00457
2017-10-02-T-027,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Ms Lim also asked about the Commissioner requiring amendments to the security plan after it has been approved and complied with. This will only be done if warranted by a security risk. Given the evolving nature of security threats, the Commissioner must be in a position to order a review of the security plan so that new risks assessed to warrant attention can be mitigated. I think Mr Darryl David referred to this as security-by-redesign. He is very right. Will there be abortive costs as a result? We will try to avoid this as much as possible, but it may not always be possible. We have to weigh it against the value of the enhanced security protection.",20,458,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00458

Mr Melvin Yong asked whether the demand for security manpower will increase as a result of the Bill. As I mentioned earlier, the key benefit of security-by-design is that it can mitigate security risks upfront in the design of the building and offer cost savings in the longer term. A building that is well-designed for security, with the use of technology such as CCTV and video analytics integrated upfront, will actually require less manpower to guard.",21,459,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00459

For example, authorised officers will have to carry a map showing the specified surrounding area where they can exercise the proposed powers. And because they carry a map, there can be no dispute. Another safeguard  clause 26 provides that if the specified surrounding areas includes private property, powers may only be exercised with the consent of the owner or occupier of that private property.

2017-10-02-T-027,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The purpose of this prohibition is to deter would-be attackers from carrying out pre-attack surveys of their targets.

If photos were taken inadvertently, they would typically warn and ask the person to delete the photos. Further action would be taken if the person does not comply, or if there are security reasons to do so. The Bill will limit the availability of more recent and detailed photographs of Protected Areas and Places. Such photos can threaten public safety and security by facilitating the planning of attacks, making it clear that unauthorised photography is prohibited will also have a deterrent effect allowing security resources to focus on areas that are more likely to be a real threat.",34,472,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00472

2017-10-02-T-027,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Ms Sylvia Lim had asked what were the reasons for the increase in fines, under Part 3. Our consideration is as follows. The Protected Area or Protected Places Act has not been amended since 1959. The existing offence provisioned under section (7) of the Act is a fine of $1,000 and two years' imprisonment or both. That is clearly relevant in 1959. It serves as a sufficient deterrent. But we are now in 2017, and so under the Bill, the fine for offences relating to protected areas and places is increased to $20,000. How is this benchmarked? Well, it is benchmarked to similar and more recent offences such as those in the Public Order Act. For example, remaining in the special event area without authorisation and contravention of move on orders. Those are the benchmarks that have been looked at.",37,475,2017-10-02-T-027-S-00475

2017-10-02-T-028,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mr Speaker, Sir, the way the public sector deliver its services have changed significantly over the years. Besides direct service by public agencies, increasingly, much of the public services and public goods are contracted out to private sectors and to not-for-profit sectors. The Government also disburses a substantial amount of public money in the form of grant and subsidies to a wide range of organisations such as restructured hospitals, VWOs and the Town Councils amongst others. In addition, the Government also provides performance guarantees to help finance infrastructural projects and undertake utility payments in public private partnership (PPP) projects. Going forward, there will be more varied, more complex and more innovative arrangements where public money will go to non-Government sectors; which could be multi-layered and multi-dimensional.",1,505,2017-10-02-T-028-S-00505

In addition, the Government also used its budgetary resources subsidies services and programmes. For example, the Government kept the costs of municipal services affordable by giving cash grants to Town Councils to help keep down the costs of estate maintenance. Another example, MOT also inject funds to the PTOs to help reduce the capital costs of enhancing public transport such as the BSEP. And there are increasingly more of such programmes as the Government intervenes to improve public services, to build economic and security capabilities or to increase its social spending.",2,506,2017-10-02-T-028-S-00506
2017-10-02-T-028,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"This would continue to be the modus operandi in the way the future whole-of-Government would work. We know that as the delivery of services and its accounting on the use of funds are further away from the direct view of Government audit, the risk of improper or corrupt conduct would increase. Under current law, some of the entities that receive such public funding are not accessible for audit by the public auditors.

There may be instances where public money may need to be disbursed to non-Government sectors or agencies to carry out emergency tasks such as in a disaster recovery situation.

2017-10-02-T-029,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),The Bill contains three key amendments to improve tax administration. These are,4,540,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00540
2017-10-02-T-029,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),(a) the extension of customer accounting to prescribed supplies commonly used in GST fraud;,5,541,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00541
2017-10-02-T-029,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),(b) the requirement for electronic record keeping and additional invoice details for selected businesses; and,6,542,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00542
2017-10-02-T-029,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),(c) the provision for the monthly penalty of $200 for late submission of GST returns to commence immediately after the due date for filing.,7,543,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00543
2017-10-02-T-029,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),I will deal with each of these in turn.,8,544,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00544
2017-10-02-T-029,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"First, we will extend customer accounting to prescribed supplies commonly used in GST fraud. Currently, GST-registered businesses charge GST on taxable supplies when they sell to other businesses. This is the output tax. Business which purchase such supplies consequently pay GST on those purchases. This is known as the input tax. They are allowed to offset the GST they pay for their purchases against the GST they collect on their sales and pay the net difference to IRAS.",9,545,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00545
2017-10-02-T-029,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"The way it works is as follows. Let us say we have a GST-registered business ""A"". ""A"" sells taxable supplies at a price inclusive of GST of $8 to another GST registered business ""B"". ""B"" sells the goods to customers like you and I at a higher price because he needs to make a profit and charges us GST of $9. In this situation, ""A"" must pay to IRAS the $8 output tax which he collected from ""B"". ""B"" in turn must pay IRAS the output tax of $9 which he collected from us, but he can offset that againstthe $8 input tax which he paid to ""A"". So at the end of the day, ""B"" only needs remit to IRAS the difference between his output GST, what he charges his customers, and his input GST, which is what he paid ""A"", and that net is $1. So, this means that at the end of the day, IRAS collects a total of $9 GST from the entire transaction  $8 from ""A"" and $1 from ""B"".",10,546,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00546
2017-10-02-T-029,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"However, IRAS has come across cases where ""A"" absconds with the GST collected from ""B"", and businesses like ""B"" further along the supply chain continue to claim the input tax. When that happens IRAS is now short by the amount of tax which ""A"" has absconded with. So, using the example above, if ""A"" absconds with the output tax, but ""B"" continues to offset his input tax, it means that at the end of the day IRAS only receives $1 instead of the $9 which should rightfully have been paid to it.",11,547,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00547
2017-10-02-T-029,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"The proposed amendments seek to avoid this scenario from happening by introducing customer accounting. Under customer accounting, GST-registered sellers like ""A"" will no longer charge GST on the sale of prescribed supplies to GST-registered business customers like ""B"". Instead, the GST-registered business customers, that is, ""B"", will self-account to IRAS for the GST chargeable, as output tax and at the same time claim input tax on these purchases, which will exactly offset the output tax. This will deter fraud schemes such as the scenario described earlier.",12,548,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00548
2017-10-02-T-029,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"Customer accounting will not apply to all goods and services. At this stage, customer accounting will be applicable for supplies of mobile phones sold without mobile subscription plans, memory cards and off-the-shelf software. These goods are commonly used in GST fraud. We will monitor the situation and assess if there is a need to prescribe more goods or services, taking into consideration the impact on businesses. Clauses 2 to 4 of the Bill provide for the changes.",13,549,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00549
2017-10-02-T-029,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"Second, we will amend the Act such that the Comptroller can require selected businesses to maintain an electronic inventory system with details of sales and purchases. The Comptroller can also require additional details, such as the model and serial number of the goods, to be provided in invoices. These additional requirements will facilitate the identification of goods in the event of a GST audit, and apply to selected businesses identified on a risk assessment basis. These businesses will be informed in writing of the requirements, and sufficient time will be given for implementation. Clauses 5 and 7 of the Bill provides for the changes.",14,550,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00550
2017-10-02-T-029,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"Third, to deter late filing, we will provide for the monthly penalty of $200 for late submission of GST returns to commence immediately after the filing due date. Currently, a penalty of $200 is imposed for each completed month that the return remains outstanding. A GST-registered business is not penalised even if it is late in filing its return after the filing due date, as long as it files within one month of the due date. This is unfair to businesses which respect the due date as the due date and file on time. A $200 penalty imposed at the point of the GST filing due date will deter late filing. Clause 9 of the Bill provides for the change.",15,551,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00551
2017-10-02-T-029,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"Another administrative change will provide for the basis to implement an opt-out approach for digital GST notices. As digital tax notices for Property Tax, GST and Income Tax will be rolled out in phases, starting with Property Tax, I will elaborate on this change in my speech on the Property Tax (Amendment) Bill. The remaining legislative changes are intended to ease business compliance or clarify existing legislation. Mr Speaker, I beg to move.",16,552,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00552

2017-10-02-T-029,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Mr Speaker, Sir, easing business compliance is one of the keys towards encouraging business development and start-ups in Singapore, and I am pleased to note that the authorities are constantly trying to clarify and simplify procedures to make the process a smoother one. Additionally, as we strive towards our goal of a Smart Nation, with digitalisation as one of the keys to achieving this, we should encourage and empower businesses to make use of existing technologies for administrative procedures.",1,554,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00554
2017-10-02-T-029,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),The Prime Minister’s National Day Rally speech has sparked much interest and discussion about going cashless.,2,555,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00555
2017-10-02-T-029,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"This reminds me that years ago we started our pursuit for a paperless society, when consumers were encouraged to switch to receiving their bills in digital formats. This was not only to support environmental conservation, but also to make retrieval of records and transactions much easier for both consumers and business entities. Today, numerous apps have been created for the convenience of checking bills and even paying them.",3,556,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00556
2017-10-02-T-029,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"If consumers can benefit from going paperless, certainly, so can businesses. Having tax notices in digital formats will make record-keeping more secure and manageable. Meanwhile, businesses may still opt out of receiving their tax notices in digital formats if they prefer hard copies. This offers flexibility for those who may require time to adapt to the technology. Understandably, making physical copies an opt-out option is a move to push businesses towards the digital format.",4,557,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00557
2017-10-02-T-029,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"However, I have reservations for SMEs and micro-enterprises. Some of these firms hire administrative employees who wear several hats. And, some of these employees are elderly, or even foreigners, and they may not be tech-savvy or know enough English to manoeuvre the digital options, or choose to opt out. With many other administrative matters to cope with, they may then overlook the matter of paying taxes. Another concern is that with the rise of scam and fraudulent activities on cyber platforms, such as emails, this could lead to another problem among those who are less informed.",5,558,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00558
2017-10-02-T-029,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"This then brings me to the next matter – the monthly penalty of $200 for late submission of GST returns. Previously, this penalty was imposed on outstanding returns starting from a month after the filing due date. With the amendment, the penalty will commence immediately after the filing due date. I would like to ask for the rationale behind this enhanced penalty, especially together with the change to an opt-out system? What are the companies that have been falling behind payment?",6,559,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00559
2017-10-02-T-029,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"If they are mainly SMEs and micro-enterprises, this will become an undue burden for them. Aside from higher penalty, we should find out the reasons for the late payments, and see what can be done to help companies improve on this aspect. These companies may be facing financial challenges, for example.",7,560,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00560
2017-10-02-T-029,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Having worked with as well as interacted with employers and employees in many SMEs, it is quite apparent that they have to deal with many challenges in these rapidly changing times. From labour crunch to digitalisation to administrative matters, these companies are facing pressure from multiple angles, and they are struggling to stay afloat, let alone make profit. For all the schemes that are available, some companies continue to be left behind. To create an inclusive and welcoming business environment, we really have to do more outreach and display more empathy. Mr Speaker, Sir, in Mandarin please.",8,561,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00561
2017-10-02-T-029,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] This amendment will make digital notices as the default mode of notification and at the same time, take away the one-month grace period for late submission. As a result, will some SMEs overlook the notices from IRAS and end up being fined? Can the Minister tell us whether SMEs account for the majority of companies that have late submission over the years?",9,562,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00562

2017-10-02-T-029,K Thanaletchimi,Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member),"As such, it is good that the options for physical copies are still made available especially for those who face challenges with the digital medium or unable to catch up with the changes, who can still have the traditional form of notification. For this, I would like to suggest deeper engagement with the community and also with the unions so as to assist in communicating the opt-out plans for less tech-savvy residents to continue to receive hard copy notifications. This may minimise or prevent further administrative delay resulting from late tax returns should the less tech-savvy residents be unaware that the notices had been sent.",3,567,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00567

2017-10-02-T-029,K Thanaletchimi,Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member),"Firstly, if GST treatment for sale of government land is to be based on approved use of land and not building, does this translate into higher cost for businesses and individuals? How would property prices be invariably affected? Is there any mitigating plan if property prices were to rise as a result of this change?",5,569,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00569
2017-10-02-T-029,K Thanaletchimi,Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member),"Secondly, if the Government were to extend customer accounting to counter fraud, particularly for mobile phones’ retailers, would this drive up business cost for such Small Medium Enterprises? Will there be any form of transitional grants to help these companies to ready the adoption of standards/ technology to counter the impact of this change?",6,570,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00570
2017-10-02-T-029,K Thanaletchimi,Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member),"Thirdly, on clause 9 in the GST (Amendment) Bill to amend section 60 – for the monthly penalty of $200 to kick in if GST is not filed within one month after the end of accounting period instead of two months to be equitable to taxpayers who pay on-time, perhaps consideration can be made for the filing period to be two months after the accounting period as Small Medium Enterprises may have lesser resources and more difficulty in meeting the deadline. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, notwithstanding this, I support the Bill.",7,571,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00571

2017-10-02-T-029,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The move towards further digitalisation is also a laudable one, in line with our SMART nation initiative. The changes are also great examples of how the Government should take the lead in going paperless for the environment.

2017-10-02-T-029,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Firstly, the Bill seeks to remove the ""grace"" period of one-month before the $200 penalty is imposed. As Er Dr Lee Bee Wah has raised, this can be a hefty sum for SMEs, particularly as companies may require time to get used to digital notices reminding them to file their taxes. More importantly, I would like to ask for the reasons behind this change, given that tax compliance in Singapore remains high. According to IRAS, tax arrears in 2016 were kept at 0.68% of net tax assessed, and that this was due to a focus on maximising voluntary compliance.",4,575,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00575

Of the 41 suggestions that we received on the Bill, 30 suggestions or 73% were on customer accounting. We accepted 24 of these 30 suggestions.",7,590,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00590
2017-10-02-T-029,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"We understand the disruption and increased compliance cost to businesses, and have studied the practices in other countries before proposing this change. The type of GST fraud that we seek to deter has been encountered in the EU. In response, many EU countries have applied customer accounting or what they call domestic reverse charge to similar supplies of goods.",8,591,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00591
2017-10-02-T-029,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"To help businesses cope with the change, we have postponed the implementation date of customer accounting from 1 January 2018 to 1 January 2019. This will provide more time for businesses to adjust. We also raised the threshold for customer accounting to apply from $5,000 to $10,000. What this means is that the supplier will continue to charge GST to GST-registered customers on sales of prescribed goods that are $10,000 and below, and customer accounting will only apply if these sales are above $10,000. This will reduce the compliance burden on retail businesses including mobile phone retailers to carry out checks on small purchases. Further, mobile phones sold with subscription plans will be excluded from customer accounting to reduce the impact on affected businesses.",9,592,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00592
2017-10-02-T-029,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"IRAS has also published an e-tax guide and will reach out to businesses trading in such goods. To help businesses with system changes, IRAS will work with standard accounting software vendors on upgrading their software to cater for customer accounting.",10,593,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00593
2017-10-02-T-029,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,Ms Thanaletchimi also asked whether the change in the sale of Government land with existing buildings to be demolished would affect property prices and translate into higher cost for businesses and individuals.,11,594,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00594
2017-10-02-T-029,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The change is a minor amendment to clarify existing policy. If a building on a land to be developed is demolished, the GST treatment on such sale should follow the same GST treatment of the vacant land rather than the approved use of the building. There will be minimal impact to businesses and individuals. In cases where such sales of land would now attract GST, GST-registered developers can claim the GST paid from IRAS as input tax.",12,595,2017-10-02-T-029-S-00595
2017-10-02-T-029,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"We note Mr Ng's comments on GST and e-commerce. The Minister for Finance in Budget this year mentioned that with increasing digital transactions and cross-border trade, some countries have taken steps to adjust the GST system to ensure a level playing field between their local businesses which are GST-registered and foreign-based ones which are not.

The amendment will allow the Comptroller of Property Tax, the Chief Assessor and their authorised officers to require persons to attend personally before them, to provide information at a time and place specified by them. The change will allow the Comptroller of Property Tax, the Chief Assessor and their authorised officers to require any person to be examined orally and provide information for investigation, if the person appears to know of the facts or circumstances concerning the person’s or another person’s properties.

The current provisions of the Act require taxpayers to provide specific consent before the Comptroller can issue them with digital tax notices instead of hardcopy notices. The widespread use of computers and mobile devices allows taxpayers to receive digital instead of hardcopy tax notices. The use of digital notices gives taxpayers greater convenience, security and timeliness of alerts. This is part of our move to being a Smart Nation. To enable more taxpayers to benefit from digital channels, the Act will be amended so that digital notices can be sent to taxpayers who have either consented to receiving digital notices, or who have not opted out after having been given notice that they will be issued with digital notices. Taxpayers who wish to continue receiving hardcopy notices can opt out. Taxpayers will thus have the flexibility to manage their preference for hardcopy or e-copy at any time.",8,609,2017-10-02-T-030-S-00609

2017-10-02-T-030,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Mr Speaker Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. However, I have a few concerns. One of these is the use of digital notices by taxpayers. It is on an opt-out basis, meaning people will have to specifically choose to receive paper notices. I foresee several potential hurdles. I presume IRAS will send hardcopy notices to everyone, telling them what is about to happen.",1,612,2017-10-02-T-030-S-00612
2017-10-02-T-030,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"The first potential hurdle is if the notices are not in our four official languages. The second potential hurdle is how to opt out. Surely people will be able to opt out not just online ─ that would be a real catch-22 situation. People should be able to opt out over the phone, counter, snail mail, and so on, and in multiple languages, too.",2,613,2017-10-02-T-030-S-00613
2017-10-02-T-030,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Let us imagine someone ─ let us call her Mrs Lim ─ who does not understand English. If she does not understand the notice or does not know how to go online to opt out, then we automatically stop her hardcopy notices, obviously she will miss her payments. If we then penalise her for it, it will be grossly unfair. I hope IRAS will contact users, maybe those above a certain age who have not used digital notices before, to confirm with them whether they want digital or paper notices.",3,614,2017-10-02-T-030-S-00614
2017-10-02-T-030,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Even for users who use the Internet, there are issues. Where does the onus lie if a Notice for Payment from IRAS lands in the spam folder or the recipient is not aware of it, or just simply did not receive it? Just to give you an example. Recently, an officer from LTA asked me, ""Dr Lee, URA officers sent you three emails, you did not reply at all. Was it because you were not happy with them?"" But when I checked, I really did not receive three emails from URA. Not a single email. That is why I changed my email lately. So, a missed notice can result in a fine. But should the taxpayer be held responsible in this instance?",4,615,2017-10-02-T-030-S-00615
2017-10-02-T-030,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Lastly, how does one know when receiving a notification that it is a genuine notice from IRAS, and not sent by someone to commit fraud? Through the media, IRAS has highlighted attempts by people to commit fraud, to infect computers with virus through fake notices. In fact, this is a problem not only with IRAS, but I think there are many other agencies, too, as well as telcos like Singtel. We want to be a Smart Nation. But we need to have a system in place to be smart enough to allow our computer systems to differentiate the fake from the real. Can the Minister advise on this, please?",5,616,2017-10-02-T-030-S-00616

If IRAS only sends out one letter, or the letter is only in English, some Singaporeans might overlook it. I hope that when dealing with the elderly, IRAS can confirm with them first before changing the notification into digital notices.",7,618,2017-10-02-T-030-S-00618

As Members of Parliament, we all know about the presence of the aged, frail and the vulnerable among our communities. They frequently do not speak English, let alone read English or access the Internet. Some of them are also in a poor state of mental health. And some of them live alone without close family support. They do not form a large part of Singapore, but they do exist. Also as Members of Parliament, from time to time, we sometimes write appeals for residents who face legal issues because they do not pay their bills or fines to the Government in time due to their misunderstanding of the Government's communications, or their inability to use digital channels effectively. Once they get themselves into such difficulties, they face additional fines, and even legal worries.",3,623,2017-10-02-T-030-S-00623

In theory, they could continue to receive hardcopies of the bills if they opt out. But this is only if the opt-out process is properly designed. My concern is if they are asked to opt out electronically or if the opt-out instruction is buried in the small prints in the property tax notices. And worse comes to worst, if the process is not noticed by their caregivers.",4,624,2017-10-02-T-030-S-00624

Will it be implemented immediately to all property taxpayers? Will there be an educational effort to help property taxpayers understand that?

While I share the Government's goal in doing so, it is important we do so in an inclusive way. By inclusive, I hope our Government actively creates alternatives that are cheap, efficient and simple to use. Let us talk about a particular scenario. If a retiree or a low-income individual is expected to use his or her smartphone to do an electronic transaction, then, (1) he or she must be able to afford a smart phone, even if it is a second-hand one. But unfortunately, this cost is not always factored in our social assistance framework; (2) he or she must be able to afford the data-plan, because free wifi signal is not always present in all public places and the sign-on process is currently cumbersome.",6,626,2017-10-02-T-030-S-00626

One way the Government can do so is for the Smart Nation Office to closely consult MSF and the various VWOs during the design phase while embarking on the digitisation process.",7,627,2017-10-02-T-030-S-00627

Digitalisation is not new to businesses. For example, GST registered businesses are already required to e-file the GST returns which is usually filed every quarter through IRAS My Tax Portal. E-filing of corporate tax returns will be made compulsory, again in a phased approach, from the year of assessment 2018 to 2020. All companies including SMEs and micro enterprises also e-file their annual returns to ACRA.

The amendment will enhance the information gathering powers under the Property Tax Act, will align the information gathering powers under the Property Tax Act with existing information gathering powers under the Income Tax Act, Good and Services Tax Act and Stamp Duty Act.

Some employers may not even be aware that there is such an option, or they may be dismissive of it as an additional expense. I hope more can be done to engage employers on this aspect.

If we are true to the values and culture of shared parenting, then the whole-of-Government policies should demonstrate the essence of cultivating such behaviours, attitudes and values of both parents caring for their children with equal responsibilities, both emotionally and financially, and, thus, the tax structure should also support such values to grow.",10,704,2017-10-02-T-031-S-00704

2017-10-02-T-031,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Section 34D has been expanded to clarify how IRAS will determine whether transactions are conducted at arm's length. In practice, such determination may be difficult as there may be different interpretations when applying the principle to specific facts and circumstances of multinational enterprises' operations. There may be legitimate commercial and risk management reasons for conducting business activities within different affiliates. In addition to the guidance provided in the TP Guidelines, will IRAS be providing reasons where it makes the determination that a transaction was not conducted at arm's length?",4,713,2017-10-02-T-031-S-00713

2017-10-02-T-031,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Next, the new section 34F(8) deems the failure to meet certain TPD requirements as offences and provides for a fine of up to $10,000. As the TPD requirement only applies to businesses with gross revenue exceeding $10 million, a fine of up to $10,000 may not represent a significant cost. How was the quantum of the fine determined, and how does it compare to similar provisions on reporting requirements?",6,715,2017-10-02-T-031-S-00715

2017-10-02-T-031,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"We note the various queries raised by Mr Louis Ng in respect of the transfer pricing documentation requirement. Singapore subscribes to the international principle that profits should be taxed where the economic activities giving rise to the profits are done. In line with this, we have adopted the international principle of arm's length pricing in our law. The arm's length principle is not new to Singapore. Under the Income Tax Act, businesses are required to transact with related parties at arm's length.",2,722,2017-10-02-T-031-S-00722

Our Jalan Kayu grassroots have done several community projects with the Kampong residents. One of which is the drain redevelopment project.

The kampong can be integrated within the two schools that are planned under the URA masterplan. The kampong and its residents should be allowed to carry on their lives, but it can play the additional role of a community living lab, for our students to learn about our shared history, culture and traditions, race relations, and experience for themselves values-in-action such as communal living, the spirit of neighbourliness and community activism.",10,756,2017-10-02-T-033-S-00756

The Member may be aware of the work we are doing on Pulau Ubin, together with the Friends of Ubin Network, to enhance the rustic, nostalgic and authentic feel of the island. This includes the heritage and the living community in the kampong. In July this year, we launched the multi-year programme to restore and repair vacant kampong houses on the island, and will be looking into how we can breathe new life into these returned homes.

It is regularly reviewed every five years to take into account the changing needs of Singaporeans, which may affect our future land use. In the 2014 Master Plan, Kampong Lorong Buangkok straddles four land parcels. Two of the land parcels have been safeguarded for a Primary school and a Secondary school. Another land parcel will form part of a park, and the last portion of the kampong site has been earmarked for a major road to Seletar, as the Member has indicated in the map earlier.",4,768,2017-10-02-T-033-S-00768

And this must involve deep engagement with the kampong families living there at that time, to understand and consider their needs and interests. Some may not want to move away from the kampong. But they may also not want their community to be turned into an educational or heritage attraction, drawing crowds of curious visitors. We will also consider the wishes of Singaporeans who want the heritage and educational value of kampong life to be properly documented, retained and celebrated.

2017-10-02-T-042,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"To do so, our AUs actively look out for Singaporean academics who are working overseas. We launched the Singapore Teaching and Academic Research Talent Scheme in 2015 to encourage more young Singaporeans to pursue an academic career. Under this scheme, we have awarded close to 80 undergraduate and postgraduate scholarships to Singaporeans who are interested in the academia. The three AUs awarded 260 PhD scholarships from 1990 to 2014.",3,823,2017-10-02-T-042-S-00823

2017-10-02-T-043,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"All canteen stallholders in schools attend the training commissioned by HPB on the use of healthier ingredients and healthier food preparation methods. The training involves nutrition education, where the food service guidelines are explained by a nutritionist, on food preparation, where a chef demonstrates and provides tips on how popular dishes can be prepared more healthily, and a hands-on segment for canteen vendors to put into practice the knowledge learned. With this training, our school canteen stallholders are well placed to deliver healthy food to the students. Enhancements to the training are being made to include elements of taste, appearance and cost management to further improve the skills of the canteen stallholders.",2,826,2017-10-02-T-043-S-00826

2017-10-02-T-044,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The law requires all business entities that are registered with ACRA to update their registered office addresses through ACRA's filing system. The updates must be made within 14 days of the change in address, except for foreign companies which have 30 days to do so. It is convenient for business entities to update any change in their addresses which can be done online such as through ACRA's filing system or ACRA-On-The-Go mobile app. Filing such updates is also free.",1,829,2017-10-02-T-044-S-00829
2017-10-02-T-044,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The penalty for late filing is up to $350. In addition, if a company fails to update its registered office address, the company and its directors can be prosecuted and be liable on conviction to a fine of up to $5,000 and a penalty for each day of default after conviction of the offence. Furthermore, if a business entity is found to have deliberately not updated its address, or used a false address to avoid contact with creditors or regulators, ACRA will not hesitate to prosecute the business entity and its directors or owners in court. Under the various ACRA-administered Acts, it is an offence to provide false information to ACRA. For instance, an offender is liable on conviction to a fine of up to $50,000 or to imprisonment of up to two years, or to both under the Companies Act.",2,830,2017-10-02-T-044-S-00830

2017-10-02-T-044,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"To encourage compliance by business entities, ACRA has put in place various measures. First, ACRA conducts regular on-site inspections to check the validity of registered business addresses. Second, ACRA will write to a company director or business owner at his residential address if ACRA's official correspondences with the business entities are returned undelivered or ACRA receives feedback on an outdated registered office address. The business entity has to update its registered office address before it is allowed to carry out any other filings with ACRA. Third, ACRA conducts outreach programmes such as ACRA@The Heartlands to inform business owners, directors, and interested members of public of the various obligations of running a business.",4,832,2017-10-02-T-044-S-00832

2017-10-02-T-045,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Deduction of expenses incurred for a car is not allowed for tax, unless the taxpayer is carrying on the business of hiring out cars or providing driving instruction. This treatment is in line with our national policy to curb the car population, and is applied consistently to both corporate and individual taxpayers.",2,835,2017-10-02-T-045-S-00835
2017-10-02-T-045,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Ride-hailing drivers are therefore not allowed tax deduction on expenses incurred in relation to the car, including the purchase cost of the car. These drivers can however claim deduction for other expenses. Such allowable deductible expenses include commission paid to third-party operators, administrative charges imposed by third-party operators, and the proportion of expenses for mobile phones used in the course of providing their services.",3,836,2017-10-02-T-045-S-00836

The conflict has resulted in loss of lives, destruction of homes and the displacement of large numbers of people. The situation in the Rakhine State is a complex inter-communal issue with deep historical roots, dating back more than half a century. There are no quick-fixes. The immediate task at hand is for all the parties involved to cease actions that will further worsen the situation on the ground, so that humanitarian assistance can reach those desperately in need regardless of ethnicity and religious affiliation. We urge the restoration of peace, stability and the rule of law in the Rakhine State. It is the responsibility of every government to protect every civilian and to restore law and order. Comprehensive, long-term and sustainable solutions must also be found to address the underlying challenges and build trust among the different stakeholders and communities, and define the legal status of everyone in Rakhine State.

2017-10-02-T-049,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Consuming large amounts of high GI food is one of the risk factors for diabetes. Common high GI foods consumed in Singapore include refined staple grain products such as white rice and white bread, and sugar-sweetened beverages like soda.",1,871,2017-10-02-T-049-S-00871
2017-10-02-T-049,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"From 2007 to 2016, the Health Promotion Board's efforts to work with beverage manufacturers has resulted in a 30% reduction in the median sugar level of sugar-sweetened beverages sold in Singapore. More recently, seven leading beverage manufacturers whose products comprise 70% of Singapore's beverage market, have committed to limit the sugar content of their beverages sold in Singapore to 12% or less. This is the first time major beverage companies have made such a public commitment, as part of their move towards healthier offerings for consumers.",2,872,2017-10-02-T-049-S-00872
2017-10-02-T-049,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"These efforts are a good start but we are not stopping here. MOH is studying additional measures to further reduce sugar consumption in Singapore, taking reference from experiences in other countries. These include the use of warning labels and advertising restrictions on pre-packaged beverages with high sugar content.",3,873,2017-10-02-T-049-S-00873
2017-10-02-T-049,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"For refined staple grain products, the Ministry of Health (MOH) will invest $20 million over the next three years under the Healthier Ingredient Development Scheme (HIDS) to support food manufacturers to innovate and produce healthier ingredients such as wholegrain noodles and brown rice bee hoon which have lower GI but taste just as nice as the original versions.",4,874,2017-10-02-T-049-S-00874
2017-10-02-T-049,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In addition, HPB's Healthier Dining Programme (HDP) encourages consumers to choose wholegrain, ""Low GI"" and lower-calorie meal options. As of August 2017, there are over 3,100 food and beverage stalls across 67 hawker centres and 450 coffee shops offering at least one healthier option in their menus. Our target is to increase this to 40% of stalls across all hawker centres and coffee shops by mid-2019.",5,875,2017-10-02-T-049-S-00875
2017-10-02-T-049,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,These are part of HPB's efforts to help Singaporeans choose healthier food options and lead healthier lives.,6,876,2017-10-02-T-049-S-00876
2017-10-02-T-050,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether drivers who chalk up demerit points can be made to attend short lectures and undergo tests so that their skills can be refreshed, for the safety of all road users.",1,877,2017-10-02-T-050-S-00877
2017-10-02-T-050,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Drivers who have accumulated demerit points can attend the Driver Improvement Points System (DIPS) Retraining Course or the Safe Driving Course.,1,878,2017-10-02-T-050-S-00878
2017-10-02-T-050,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The DIPS Retraining Course is a two-day course for motorists whose licences have been suspended because they have accumulated a certain number of demerit points. These motorists are required to pass theory and practical tests at the end of the course, whereupon they can have their suspension periods shortened.",2,879,2017-10-02-T-050-S-00879
2017-10-02-T-050,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Safe Driving Course is an early intervention measure that provides corrective education to motorists, even before they become liable for suspension. Participants go through a three-and-a-half-hour classroom session and a 30-minute practical session before taking a quiz. Upon the successful completion of the course, three demerit points will be expunged from the participant’s driving record.",3,880,2017-10-02-T-050-S-00880
2017-10-02-T-050,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"These courses are not mandatory. They offer an opportunity for motorists to come forward to correct their driving behaviour, and refresh their driving skills. This will foster greater ownership of their driving behaviour.",4,881,2017-10-02-T-050-S-00881
2017-10-02-T-051,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for National Development what policy incentives and measures are currently in place to encourage building owners of existing and upcoming private developments to accommodate barrier-free link-bridge connectivity to adjacent HDB precincts, especially precincts with a significant elderly population.",1,882,2017-10-02-T-051-S-00882
2017-10-02-T-051,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) works closely with public and private stakeholders to plan and implement seamless walking networks between housing estates, major facilities, and transport nodes. This is undertaken through various initiatives.",1,883,2017-10-02-T-051-S-00883
2017-10-02-T-051,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"First, since July 2016, developers of large shopping malls, offices, business parks, and educational institutions are required to submit a Walking and Cycling Plan (WCP) to URA and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) as part of their development applications. Through the WCP, developers will be required to provide a mix of elevated, at-grade, and underground barrier-free linkages, so as to facilitate convenient and direct pedestrian access to neighbouring developments like HDB precincts. URA and LTA will work closely with the developers to ensure that the WCP improves residents’ accessibility to surrounding amenities and services.",2,884,2017-10-02-T-051-S-00884
2017-10-02-T-051,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Second, to incentivise developers to construct barrier-free linkages, URA has excluded the floor area of linkages that fulfil minimum width requirements, and remain accessible 24/7, from the maximum permissible Gross Floor Area (GFA) allowed for developments.",3,885,2017-10-02-T-051-S-00885
2017-10-02-T-051,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Third, for developments released under the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme, URA stipulates requirements for developers to provide barrier-free linkages between adjoining developments within the land sales tender conditions.",4,886,2017-10-02-T-051-S-00886
2017-10-02-T-051,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Fourth, since 1990, all buildings must comply with BCA's Code on Accessibility, which specifies the minimum design and construction requirements on basic barrier-free design needs of the elderly and persons with limited mobility. For older private developments built before 1990, building owners may apply for BCA's Accessibility Fund, which provides grants of up to $300,000 for owners to upgrade their buildings with accessibility features.",5,887,2017-10-02-T-051-S-00887
2017-10-02-T-052,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,asked the Minister for National Development (a) how HDB plans for the provision of shared common spaces such as pavilions and void decks in new precincts; (b) whether common space provisions have declined over the years in terms of (i) venues per resident and (ii) area per resident; and (c) how will HDB ensure future adequate venue space for (i) informal interaction (ii) community gatherings and (iii) bereavements or funeral wakes.,1,888,2017-10-02-T-052-S-00888
2017-10-02-T-052,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"HDB actively plans for common spaces where the community can gather in the design of HDB towns and estates. The approach has evolved over the years, along with the design of HDB blocks. Compared with older slab blocks with long corridors, newer blocks are generally taller and more compact, with fewer units per floor. While this optimises land use and provides residents with greater privacy, the trade-off is a smaller void deck space under each block.",1,889,2017-10-02-T-052-S-00889
2017-10-02-T-052,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"With this shift in block design, HDB has embedded a variety of purpose-built facilities and amenities in newer precincts to serve as common spaces, and create opportunities for community interaction and bonding. For example, since the 1990s, precinct pavilions have been provided in new developments to provide space for community activities. HDB has also progressively introduced other amenities in newer precincts, such as 3G playgrounds, sky parks, and gardens on rooftops of multi-storey carparks, to facilitate interactions by residents of all ages.",2,890,2017-10-02-T-052-S-00890
2017-10-02-T-052,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"HDB continues to explore how to maximise community interactions with the smaller void deck spaces in new developments. For example, HDB introduced Community Living Rooms in 2014, which are areas located near lift lobbies and letter boxes, specially provided with seats and tables to facilitate informal small group interactions. Where large Social Community Facilities such as childcare centres are required in precincts, HDB may integrate them in multi-storey carparks or construct them as standalone blocks. This will free up the limited void deck spaces for informal interaction.",3,891,2017-10-02-T-052-S-00891
2017-10-02-T-052,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Surveys of HDB residents have shown that community spaces provided in precincts are generally sufficient, and that residents are satisfied with such facilities. Nonetheless, HDB will continue to review the precinct provisions to ensure they are sufficient and support a variety of community events, in accordance with the changing demographics and needs of each HDB estate.",4,892,2017-10-02-T-052-S-00892
2017-10-02-T-053,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether the online child protection training module to train pre-school teachers in handling child abuse cases can be made mandatory; (b) whether such a module can be made available earlier than late 2018; and (c) whether this training can be provided as part of the NITEC training course for pre-school teachers.,1,893,2017-10-02-T-053-S-00893
2017-10-02-T-053,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Preschool teachers are equipped with basic skills and knowledge to understand and detect child abuse and neglect, during their pre-employment training at the Polytechnics, the Institute of Technical Education or the various Private Training Agencies accredited by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA). In-service preschool teachers can also take up Continuing Professional Development courses related to the prevention and early intervention of child abuse.",1,894,2017-10-02-T-053-S-00894
2017-10-02-T-053,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In addition to this, the Child Protective Service (CPS) of the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has developed a Sector-Specific Screening Guide (SSSG) and a Child Abuse Reporting Guide (CARG) to support professionals who work with children to recognise signs and symptoms of abuse and determine the appropriate course of action. ECDA conducts training sessions for principals and educators in the early childhood sector to use these guides effectively.",2,895,2017-10-02-T-053-S-00895
2017-10-02-T-053,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To make such training resources even more accessible to professionals in the education, health and social service sectors, MSF CPS is working with the Social Service Institute to develop online training modules on child protection. The online child protection training modules are currently in their early stages of development. Further testing and enhancements are required before roll-out, expected in late-2018. My Ministry will study whether the development of the training modules can be brought forward. We will also look at whether these modules can be incorporated as part of the compulsory training components for early childhood qualifications, over and above the existing training that is already being provided to help trainee preschool educators understand and detect child abuse and neglect.",3,896,2017-10-02-T-053-S-00896
2017-10-02-T-054,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development how can the Ministry ensure that the day care centres for residents with special needs will continue to remain affordable for them.,1,897,2017-10-02-T-054-S-00897
2017-10-02-T-054,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,There are currently 26 Day Activity Centres (DACs) that offer day care services to adults with special needs. These are operated by Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs).,1,898,2017-10-02-T-054-S-00898
2017-10-02-T-054,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"While fees are set by the DACs, MSF has put in place several measures to ensure that these programmes stay affordable for those who require them.",2,899,2017-10-02-T-054-S-00899
2017-10-02-T-054,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"First, MSF revises the quanta of operating subsidies to the VWOs at the start of every financial year to keep pace with inflation. Second, subsidies are means-tested so that these services remain affordable to lower-income families. Third, guidelines on fee revisions are issued to the centres to prevent sharp fee hikes.",3,900,2017-10-02-T-054-S-00900
2017-10-02-T-054,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Apart from fees and government subsidies, the operation of these centres are also supported by Government grants such as the Community Silver Trust, which provides dollar-for-dollar matching on donations raised by the VWOs.",4,901,2017-10-02-T-054-S-00901
2017-10-02-T-054,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,We will continue to monitor the fees charged by VWOs for programmes that we fund to support persons with disabilities and their families.,5,902,2017-10-02-T-054-S-00902
2017-10-02-T-055,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources given the ageing population and limited common void deck space available for funeral wakes in some newer HDB precincts (a) whether this has affected the Government's forecast for funeral parlour capacity requirements; and (b) how the Government will ensure adequate funeral parlour capacity in the years ahead.,1,903,2017-10-02-T-055-S-00903
2017-10-02-T-055,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Today, funeral wakes in Singapore are mostly held at HDB void decks and precinct pavilions. A smaller proportion of wakes are held in places of worship, private home compounds and purpose-built funeral parlours. Overall, there are sufficient wake spaces available to those who need them.",1,904,2017-10-02-T-055-S-00904
2017-10-02-T-055,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Housing and Development Board (HDB) has traditionally planned and designed new HDB precincts to ensure that they meet the needs of the community.

2017-10-02-T-056,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The Great Singapore Sale (GSS), which is a marketing campaign organised annually by the Singapore Retailers' Association (SRA) and supported by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB), needs to evolve in response to changes in the retail landscape, where shoppers have many more opportunities than before to obtain deep discounts on attractive merchandise.",2,909,2017-10-02-T-056-S-00909
2017-10-02-T-056,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"To enhance the retail industry's vibrancy, we had worked with industry stakeholders to develop the Retail Industry Transformation Map, launched last September. One key strategy is the need to foster the growth of a vibrant mix of highly-productive retailers, who can reach out to different consumer groups online and offline. With e-commerce becoming an important catalyst of the retail industry's growth, traditional brick-and-mortar retailers need to adopt online strategies to reach out to more tech-savvy consumers both locally and internationally.",3,910,2017-10-02-T-056-S-00910
2017-10-02-T-056,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Likewise, the GSS also stands to benefit if it builds an online presence amidst the shifting retail landscape, complementing its usual offline marketing efforts. It is encouraging that SRA commissioned the GoSpree mobile application for GSS 2017, which connects consumers to exclusive shopping bargains not only from established retailers, but also emerging local brands. Many retailers promoted their in-store deals via the application, which has a geo-tagging function that allows e-coupons and deal alerts to be sent to shoppers near participating stores.",4,911,2017-10-02-T-056-S-00911
2017-10-02-T-056,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Over the years, the GSS has made an impact on the retail calendar, and built mindshare amongst local and international shoppers. STB will continue to work with SRA to update and refresh the GSS. We are considering how to further leverage technology to strengthen consumer outreach. At the same time, the GSS also has potential to be reinvented as a lifestyle event going beyond shopping, through collaboration with the dining and entertainment sectors. Some local attractions and hoteliers had listed promotions on the GoSpree application this year, and we hope to bring more onboard in the coming years.",5,912,2017-10-02-T-056-S-00912

Under the enhanced scheme, the evaluation criteria for global startup founders has been broadened to give due consideration to their entrepreneurial and investment track records, business networks and achievements in their areas of expertise. The founders will also have up to a year to explore opportunities here before setting up their companies. In addition, with the extension of the validity period of each EntrePass from one to two years, after the first renewal, EntrePass holders will have more certainty in their efforts to scale up their businesses.",3,916,2017-10-02-T-057-S-00916
2017-10-02-T-057,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In addition to the EntrePass scheme, SPRING Singapore has undertaken other initiatives to attract and anchor promising global startups. Earlier this year, SPRING launched Startup SG as a brand identity to position Singapore as a leading hub and launchpad for startups to scale and grow, in the region and globally.

2017-10-02-T-060,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),To keep fees at a reasonable level it is important to ensure there is enough competition. Hence we have always insisted on an open architecture system so that e-payment will not be monopolised over time by one dominant player.,9,934,2017-10-02-T-060-S-00934
2017-10-02-T-060,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"MAS worked with the banking industry to develop PayNow. Today, it enables convenient and safe peer-to-peer transactions, and we are now working to extend PayNow to businesses as a cheaper way to make e-payments. PayNow will use the SGQR for e-payment transactions, which means there is no need for any point of sale terminals, or any rental fees involved for these equipment.",10,935,2017-10-02-T-060-S-00935
2017-10-02-T-060,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"NETS has recently announced plans to roll out NETS Pay, which offers a wide range of solutions for merchants to receive payments from consumers at an affordable rate. NETS Pay will add to the range of low cost e-payment solutions available in the market.",11,936,2017-10-02-T-060-S-00936
2017-10-02-T-060,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),The Government has also been engaging various stakeholders to raise awareness of the available e-payment solutions and hence help drive further adoption. Businesses need to be aware of the advantages of various e-payment solutions and identify a solution that would best suit their needs.,12,937,2017-10-02-T-060-S-00937
2017-10-02-T-060,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"As of now, our focus is to ensure these low cost options are available, and spur competition to keep cost affordable to small businesses. It will minimally be cheaper than having to handle cash. As to whether we should regulate the fees for e-payment, we are studying the experience of other jurisdictions, and will study them carefully.",13,938,2017-10-02-T-060-S-00938
2017-10-02-T-061,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Prime Minister (a) how prevalent is the use of cryptocurrency in Singapore; and (b) what measures will MAS introduce to regulate Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).,1,939,2017-10-02-T-061-S-00939
2017-10-02-T-061,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"We are familiar with money, that is, notes and coins, as a medium of exchange – an intermediary instrument use to facilitate transactions. I make a TV, sell it for money, and then use it to buy a pair of shoes. Money becomes a medium of exchange because all of us put our trust in its reliability. The Central Bank issues these notes and coins, and makes them legal tender. Legal tender means that the medium of exchange is recognised by law to be valid for meeting a financial obligation.",1,940,2017-10-02-T-061-S-00940
2017-10-02-T-061,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"With advancement in technology, new virtual means of payment have emerged, such as cryptocurrency, which is a form of digital token secured by cryptography. They are not legal tender. But some people put their trust in them and use them as a means of payment. Hence, Bitcoin and Ether have been adopted by people in some communities to pay one another or to pay for goods and services.",2,941,2017-10-02-T-061-S-00941
2017-10-02-T-061,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"MAS has been monitoring the use of such virtual currencies. Their use is not prevalent in Singapore – about 20 Singapore retailers like restaurants and online shops currently accept Bitcoins. This is unlike places like Japan, where the use is more popular. Likewise, in the Singapore financial industry, use of virtual currencies as a mode of payment is not significant. Trading is generally for speculative investment purposes, and the volume is low compared to other countries such as US, Japan and Hong Kong.",3,942,2017-10-02-T-061-S-00942
2017-10-02-T-061,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Similar to most jurisdictions, MAS does not regulate such virtual currencies per se. However we regulate the activities that surround them if those activities fall within our more general ambit as financial regulator. Let me give two examples.",4,943,2017-10-02-T-061-S-00943
2017-10-02-T-061,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"First, virtual currencies, due to the anonymous nature of the transactions, can be exploited for money laundering and terrorism financing risks. MAS is working on a new payment services regulatory framework that will address these risks.",5,944,2017-10-02-T-061-S-00944
2017-10-02-T-061,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"A second example is fund-raising. Virtual currencies can go beyond being a means of payment, and evolve into ""second generation"" tokens representing benefits such as ownership in assets, like a share or bond certificate. The sale of such ""second generation"" tokens to raise funds is commonly known as an initial coin offering or ICO (""ICO""). A number of ICOs have been structured out of Singapore in recent months.",6,945,2017-10-02-T-061-S-00945
2017-10-02-T-061,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"These are financial activities that falls under MAS’ regulatory ambit. Hence, on 1 August 2017, MAS clarified that if a token is structured in the form of securities, the ICO must comply with existing securities laws aimed at safeguarding investors’ interest. So the requirements of having to register a prospectus, obtain intermediary or exchange operator licences, will apply. These intermediaries must also comply with existing rules on anti-money laundering and countering terrorism financing.",7,946,2017-10-02-T-061-S-00946
2017-10-02-T-061,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"MAS has not issued new legislation specifically for ICOs. We will continue to monitor the developments of such offers, and consider more targeted legislation if necessary.",8,947,2017-10-02-T-061-S-00947
2017-10-02-T-061,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Some consumers may be attracted to invest in virtual currencies and digital tokens due to their recent exponential rise in value. However, as a financial regulator, our focus is securitised interests in assets – such as shares in a company. MAS does not and cannot regulate all products that people put their money in thinking that they will appreciate in value. But recognising that the risks of investing in virtual currencies are significant, MAS and the Commercial Affairs Department have published an advisory alerting consumers to these risks, and are working together to raise public awareness of potential scams.",9,948,2017-10-02-T-061-S-00948
2017-10-02-T-062,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for Education (Schools) whether there is a correlation between students' PSLE performances and secondary school results.,1,949,2017-10-02-T-062-S-00949
2017-10-02-T-062,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"A student who has built a stronger academic foundation at a lower level will be better prepared to access and acquire new knowledge at a higher level. Hence, students' academic performance in secondary school is positively correlated with that in primary school, including their Primary School Leaving Examinations (PSLE) performance.",1,950,2017-10-02-T-062-S-00950
2017-10-02-T-062,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"However, the academic performance of students is simultaneously also affected by many other complex factors. These include student motivation, peer influence, and the support from home, schools and the broader community. Altogether these other factors contribute more to a student's secondary school academic performance than what he or she scored in PSLE four or five years before.",2,951,2017-10-02-T-062-S-00951
2017-10-02-T-063,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Minister for Education (Schools) whether the Ministry will consider introducing quotas for students in the top, middle and bottom performance bands for admission into Secondary One so as to create a more inclusive environment for students and reduce the monopoly of elite schools.",1,952,2017-10-02-T-063-S-00952
2017-10-02-T-063,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Most secondary schools already take in a full spectrum of Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) students. This approach is appropriate and serves the students’ learning needs.",1,953,2017-10-02-T-063-S-00953
2017-10-02-T-063,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"We do not believe that schools need to be identical in student profiles to be inclusive. A diverse school landscape allows for variety in school types and educational provisions, to match different student needs.",2,954,2017-10-02-T-063-S-00954
2017-10-02-T-063,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"For instance, some Normal (Technical) students benefit from a more customised curriculum and pedagogy, as well as additional social-emotional learning support through whole-school activities. This is why we set up the specialised schools Crest and Spectra, which also have facilities customised for their unique curriculum and pedagogy.",3,955,2017-10-02-T-063-S-00955
2017-10-02-T-063,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"We also have Specialised Independent Schools, which cater to students with talents and strong interests in specific fields such as the arts and sports. Integrated Programme schools provide six-year programmes to cater to academically strong students who can benefit from more flexibility in pursuing broader learning experiences.",4,956,2017-10-02-T-063-S-00956
2017-10-02-T-063,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"What is common for all students, regardless which school they attend, is our strong emphasis on values and Character and Citizenship Education. All schools provide their students with ample opportunity to interact and make friends with peers from diverse backgrounds, for example through co-curricular activities and Values In Action learning experiences. This remains core to our education mission, as we aim to nurture our students to be good citizens, who respect others and build an inclusive community and nation.",5,957,2017-10-02-T-063-S-00957
2017-10-02-T-064,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David,asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will collaborate and partner with more organisations and corporations to provide for increased opportunities for health checks and tests that will raise more individuals' awareness of the risk of diabetes.,1,958,2017-10-02-T-064-S-00958
2017-10-02-T-064,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We have been collaborating with community partners, employers and healthcare institutions to encourage Singaporeans to go for health screening. Our healthcare clusters also conduct community health screening programmes and encourage patients to go for screening when they visit polyclinics and GPs. These efforts have benefitted more than 40,000 residents in 2016.",1,959,2017-10-02-T-064-S-00959
2017-10-02-T-064,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Health Promotion Board (HPB) works with businesses and unions to conduct onsite screening for employees. One example is the ""Check Car, Check Body"" programme which offers health screening to taxi drivers while they wait for their taxis to be serviced at the service centres. To date, we have reached out to over 200,000 workers, including taxi drivers and bus captains. We welcome the participation of other corporations in these programmes to benefit even more workers. Besides workplaces, we also tap on networks of the People's Association (PA) and grassroots organisations to educate Singaporeans about the importance of going for regular health screenings.",2,960,2017-10-02-T-064-S-00960
2017-10-02-T-064,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,MOH will continue our partnerships with these organisations to enhance the coverage of diabetes screening. This is a key component of the War on Diabetes.,3,961,2017-10-02-T-064-S-00961
2017-10-02-T-065,Teo Ser Luck,Mr Teo Ser Luck,"asked the Minister for Health in view of recent developments in technology application in the healthcare sector, what is the Ministry's policy and regulation with regard to (i) tele-consultation between doctors and patients and (ii) telemedicine in areas of prescription, treatment and diagnosis.",1,962,2017-10-02-T-065-S-00962
2017-10-02-T-065,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,Telehealth platforms enable patients to receive care in convenient locations of their choice. Patients can receive more timely advice and intervention to manage their conditions without having to schedule an appointment to visit a healthcare institution. This reduces the caregiver burden and empowers individuals to take an active role in their health.,1,963,2017-10-02-T-065-S-00963
2017-10-02-T-065,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In 2015, the Ministry of Health (MOH) issued a set of National Telemedicine Guidelines to guide healthcare providers in the safe and appropriate delivery of healthcare services through telemedicine. This is complemented by the Singapore Medical Council's (SMC) Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines (ECEG) and accompanying Handbook on Medical Ethics issued in 2016 that set out the standards of care required of doctors practicing telemedicine.",2,964,2017-10-02-T-065-S-00964
2017-10-02-T-065,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Based on the guidelines, the standard of care expected of doctors providing telemedicine should be comparable to what patients would receive in a face-to-face consultation. Doctors providing care via virtual platforms have a responsibility to ensure that the remote diagnosis made is accurate and that patients receive appropriate medical advice and management for their conditions. If in doubt, doctors should offer to see the patients face-to-face to conduct a physical assessment or refer the patient to the nearest clinic or healthcare institution.",3,965,2017-10-02-T-065-S-00965
2017-10-02-T-065,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Today, telemedicine is typically offered as an extension of care for stable patients, taking place after a doctor has had an initial face-to-face consultation with the patient and is satisfied that the patient is suitable to be followed up via telemedicine. As telemedicine services continue to evolve, MOH will monitor the developments and review our policies and regulations so as to enable new care models that are beneficial for patients, while ensuring their safety and welfare at all times.",4,966,2017-10-02-T-065-S-00966
2017-10-02-T-066,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Government was consulted regarding the delay in upgrading the North-South and East-West MRT lines that was initially slated for 2002 as announced by SMRT's then managing director in July 1997 but was only proceeded with in 2012; and (b) why did the Government allow the said delay.,1,967,2017-10-02-T-066-S-00967
2017-10-02-T-066,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Under its original licence to operate the North-South and East-West Lines, SMRT owned the rail operating assets and was solely responsible for renewing and upgrading these assets, so long as it met LTA's regulatory requirements for system performance and reliability. Its decision on the intended timing of the replacement of the signalling system was internal and was not in breach of the terms of its licence.",1,968,2017-10-02-T-066-S-00968
2017-10-02-T-066,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"We have since transited SMRT's rail lines to the New Rail Financing Framework (NRFF). Under the NRFF, LTA owns the operating assets, putting it firmly in the driver's seat for asset renewals and upgrades.",2,969,2017-10-02-T-066-S-00969
2017-10-02-T-067,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the usual communication protocol to the public when delays occur on train lines operated by SMRT or SBS Transit; and (b) whether there has been any instances where the operators have eschewed from making any public announcements of such delays in the last two years.,1,970,2017-10-02-T-067-S-00970
2017-10-02-T-067,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"LTA requires the rail operators to inform passengers of any delay exceeding 10 minutes during peak hours and exceeding 15 minutes during off-peak hours, without exception. This is done through announcements in stations, on-board trains, on the operator and LTA websites as well as through mainstream and social media. For delays that require longer recovery times, additional information will be provided to help commuters plan their journeys better. Over the last two years, there have been no cases where LTA has found the operator liable for failing to meet these requirements.",1,971,2017-10-02-T-067-S-00971
2017-10-02-T-068,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak,asked the Minister for Education (Schools) (a) what is the current demand for bicycle parking in schools; (b) whether students are allowed to ride e-bikes to school; and (c) what is the take-up rate of the Safe Riding Programme in schools since its inception.,1,972,2017-10-02-T-068-S-00972
2017-10-02-T-068,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"MOE does not actively monitor the demand for bicycle parking in schools. From schools' observations, the demand is generally low. While schools do not prohibit students' use of e-bikes, students are generally advised not to bring expensive items to school. In addition, for all riders and pillion riders of e-bikes, LTA stipulates a minimum age of 16 years.",1,973,2017-10-02-T-068-S-00973
2017-10-02-T-068,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,Land Transport Authority's Safe Riding Programme will be launched at the end of this year. MOE will work with LTA to offer the programme to students in Secondary Schools who are able to ride a bicycle.,2,974,2017-10-02-T-068-S-00974
2017-10-02-T-069,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the number of infringements for the Bus Lane and Bus Priority Box Schemes in 2016 and 2017; (b) how do the enforcement officers determine an infringement for the Bus Priority Box Scheme; and (c) what efforts has LTA taken to improve public awareness of the schemes.,1,975,2017-10-02-T-069-S-00975
2017-10-02-T-069,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"It is an offence for motorists to drive or leave a vehicle on a Bus Lane during restricted hours or not to give way to buses or stay in a Bus Priority Box. Between January and August 2017, LTA enforcement officers through the help of cameras, detected around 13,000 Bus Lane infringements and 700 Bus Priority Box infringements. This is a 30% and 70% reduction respectively as compared to the same period in 2016.",1,976,2017-10-02-T-069-S-00976
2017-10-02-T-069,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Information on the schemes is regularly broadcasted on LTA Traffic News and presented on the LTA and One.Motoring websites.

2017-10-02-T-070,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) to date, how many Silver Zones have had their adjacent footpaths widened; (b) whether the widening of footpaths along Silver Zones is part of the Silver Zone initiative; and (c) if not, when will LTA implement the widening of footpaths for all Silver Zones.",1,978,2017-10-02-T-070-S-00978
2017-10-02-T-070,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Widening of footpaths is part of the Silver Zone programme, which aims to enhance road safety for the elderly. Of the 11 completed Silver Zones, seven already have widened footpaths or dedicated cycling paths to complement existing footpaths.",1,979,2017-10-02-T-070-S-00979
2017-10-02-T-070,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Going forward, new footpaths will be at least 1.8 metres wide, compared to today’s standard of 1.5 metres.",2,980,2017-10-02-T-070-S-00980
2017-10-02-T-071,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the number of accidents involving e-bikes and personal mobility devices this year; (b) what is the number of injuries or fatalities that have resulted from these accidents; and (c) what are LTA's plans to reduce or mitigate such accidents from occurring.,1,981,2017-10-02-T-071-S-00981
2017-10-02-T-071,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"For the first half of this year, there were about 90 accidents involving power-assisted bicycles (PABs) and personal mobility devices (PMDs), resulting in four deaths and about 90 injuries. The majority of these accidents took place on the roads.",1,982,2017-10-02-T-071-S-00982
2017-10-02-T-071,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"With the passage of the Active Mobility Bill, rules on safe riding behaviour, including speed limits and device specifications, will come into force by the end of this year. There will be stiff penalties for offences such as reckless riding. In the meantime, LTA is stepping up its enforcement efforts and has issued over 1,400 advisories for unsafe riding. LTA has also commenced registration of PABs.",2,983,2017-10-02-T-071-S-00983
2017-10-02-T-071,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,We will continue to complement enforcement efforts with public education and outreach programmes. The Safe Riding Programme will be launched to educate cyclists and PMD users on safe riding practices. More than 800 people have volunteered for the Active Mobility Patrol Scheme and are helping to educate fellow residents on safe riding practices.,3,984,2017-10-02-T-071-S-00984
2017-10-02-T-072,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,asked the Minister for Transport with the increasing viability of the Arctic shipping route and the potential opening of other regional trade and connectivity routes (a) how is Singapore re-positioning itself to meet such challenges; and (b) how will PSA need to transform to thrive in the new trade landscape.,1,985,2017-10-02-T-072-S-00985
2017-10-02-T-072,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"At present, it is too early to determine the long term impact of the opening of the Arctic shipping routes on the port of Singapore. Current commercial viability of these routes is low for a number of reasons. Sailing through the Arctic is still largely confined to the summer months, making it difficult to operate scheduled services, which is critical to container shipping. There are also limited opportunities for shippers to lift and drop off cargo as areas enroute through the Arctic are largely unpopulated. Further, ships sailing through the Arctic require specialised ice-breaking equipment, and have to pay higher insurance premiums due to the extreme conditions. In 2016, only 19 sailings were made through the Northern Sea Route, which is the main Arctic sea route.",1,986,2017-10-02-T-072-S-00986
2017-10-02-T-072,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Regardless of the competition posed by the Arctic shipping routes and other regional trade and connectivity routes, our priority has been to ensure that the port of Singapore continues to improve its competitiveness. We have plans to increase port capacity, so that Singapore has the capacity to meet the long term needs of container lines. To this end, development on the new Tuas Terminal has commenced and when fully completed, this terminal will be able to handle up to 65m twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs).",2,987,2017-10-02-T-072-S-00987
2017-10-02-T-072,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore is also working closely with PSA to build a better port through investing heavily in technology. For instance, PSA has deployed a fully-automated yard crane system at the new berths at the Pasir Panjang Terminal to enhance efficiency, reliability and workplace safety.",3,988,2017-10-02-T-072-S-00988

For instance, recruits in BMTC are issued tablets to access e-learning modules on weapon handling and individual field craft during their Basic Military Training. As these devices are provided, there is no need to use their own personal electronic devices to access the online training materials, and hence no subsidy is provided.

The MFA App is now linked to the Ministry of Home Affairs SGSecure application. We have also collaborated with SATS Ltd to allow Singaporeans to eRegister via SATS' new travel application, and we are open to work with other partners to improve our consular services. We will continue to leverage technology to offer more convenient online platforms. One of our current priorities is to finalise the MFA Chatbot – in collaboration with Govtech – which can interact with users through conversational channels on social media platforms such as Facebook Messenger, and allow users to eRegister. While we continue to explore different platforms for eRegistration, we are mindful that it is essentially a voluntary exercise. As our resources are often stretched and focused on providing assistance to those in genuine need during crises and emergencies, we also urge Singaporeans to do their part by taking precautions and practicing personal responsibility by staying vigilant, observing local laws, purchasing travel insurance, and staying in touch with family and friends when overseas.",1,1025,2017-10-02-T-082-S-01025

2017-10-02-T-092,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As the tightened maintenance regime was only put in place in November 2016, we are still monitoring its effects. Improving escalator safety goes beyond having a robust maintenance regime. Everyone – the authorities, owners, escalator contractors, and the public – has a role to play. BCA has been working with building owners and transport operators to raise public awareness on the safe use of escalators. The public also has to exercise due care when using escalators. This includes safe practices like holding onto handrails and not leaning on the sides of the escalators. Users with prams or bulky items, as well as the elderly and the infirm, should also try to take lifts where possible.",2,1075,2017-10-02-T-092-S-01075

2017-10-02-T-096,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We have seen positive results in participating schools. For example, food waste has been reduced from 18kg to less than 10kg per day in Greendale Primary School, and from 24kg to 18kg per day in Admiralty Primary School. The pilot is expected to last two years. At the end of the pilot, we will evaluate the closed-loop food waste management programme and consider future plans for other schools.",2,1092,2017-10-02-T-096-S-01092
2017-10-02-T-096,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"My Ministry sees potential for greater use of food waste digesters. They could be deployed in hawker centres and coffee shops as the Member has suggested, or other premises such as shopping malls. However, we recognise that there are economic and practical constraints, such as the cost of the digesters and availability of space. Currently, we are conducting a pilot at Block 628 Ang Mo Kio Ave 4 Market to digest food waste generated by stallholders and patrons on-site. Under the contract for Public Waste Collection in the Pasir Ris – Bedok sector, on-site food waste treatment will be made available at two hawker centres – Block 58 New Upper Changi Road hawker centre and Block 16 Bedok South Road hawker centre. We will deploy food waste digesters at other hawker centres where suitable.",3,1093,2017-10-02-T-096-S-01093

2017-10-02-T-097,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"What is more important is that MOE is committed to provide a quality education for our students regardless of their background. All school leaders and teachers undergo quality and continuous professional development and good practices are disseminated across schools, with high quality curriculum resources are centrally provided. MOE also resources schools based on their needs and student profiles. For example, depending on the profile of the school, more manpower may be provided for counselling and student support and levelling-up programmes, such as the Learning Support Programmes and the School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme. Financial assistance has also been enhanced to ensure that needy students can continue to access education. MOE also partners with the community, including Self-Help Groups (SHGs), to reach out to families or students who need additional assistance beyond MOE.",5,1100,2017-10-02-T-097-S-01100

Students are also taught to set personal targets appropriate to their individual ability, with the focus on self-improvement rather than passing the NAPFA test.",3,1105,2017-10-02-T-098-S-01105
2017-10-02-T-098,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"The reduced emphasis on the NAPFA test and test frequency allows students to use the freed-up time for more diverse physical activities. It also encourages them to enjoy physical activities and sports during PE lessons, and develop life-long habits for sustaining health and fitness. As NAPFA test is meant as an educational tool, and not as a national fitness index for students, there is no basis for comparing NAPFA test passing rates nationally over time.",4,1106,2017-10-02-T-098-S-01106
