2018-01-10-T-002,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) in respect of the collision at Joo Koon station on 15 November 2017, what were the control options available to the driver of the second train to stop the train before it collided into the rear of the first train; and (b) what are the usual control options available to drivers of trains on North-South and East-West Lines for manual or emergency braking.",1,6,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00006
2018-01-10-T-002,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) before the collision at Joo Koon station on 15 November 2017, whether the operations control centre and the driver of the second train were aware that the protective bubbles of the first train had malfunctioned; (b) if so, whether there were other options that could have been taken to ensure that the second train remained stationary; and (c) whether there was any previous occasion when a train had continued to operate when its protective bubbles had malfunctioned.",1,7,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00007
2018-01-10-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Sir, may I take Question Nos 1 and 2 together, please.",1,8,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00008
2018-01-10-T-002,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,9,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00009
2018-01-10-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The cause of the collision was a software logic issue with the new signalling system. As a result, the first train at Joo Koon station was operating without a protective bubble that ensures safe distances between trains.",1,10,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00010
2018-01-10-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Subsequent tests and re-enactments confirmed that the failure conditions must occur in a specific sequence for the protective bubble to be deactivated. Thales, the supplier of the system, had not anticipated such a scenario. This was an isolated case with no precedent, even for Thales. The Operations Control Centre staff and the train captains did not know that the protective bubble could be deactivated. Had they been aware of this, the train captain on the second train could have switched from Automatic to Restricted Manual Mode to drive the train manually or, as a last resort, engaged the emergency stop button to keep the train from moving.",2,11,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00011
2018-01-10-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"All North-South and East-West Line trains, including those involved in the collision at Joo Koon station, are equipped with an emergency stop button for the train captain to apply the brakes manually. Based on train logs, the train captain in the second train was unable to engage these emergency brakes in time to avert a collision.",3,12,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00012
2018-01-10-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Thales has since rectified the system to address the failure condition which led to the collision. In addition, Thales is setting up a simulation facility, a simulator, in Singapore to strengthen the testing process. The facility will enable LTA and SMRT to perform additional simulation tests in a controlled setting which is tailored to our local environment and the infrastructural conditions of our rail network before deploying on our train services.",4,13,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00013
2018-01-10-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"As an added precautionary measure, we decided to separate the operations on the Tuas West Extension from the rest of the East-West Line. The separation will continue until the rest of the East-West Line has fully transitioned to the new signalling system. Meanwhile, we are speeding up the re-signalling project, and the extended engineering hours on the MRT early closures and late openings will enable us to complete this transition by the middle of this year.",5,14,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00014
2018-01-10-T-002,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Minister for his reply. I have two supplementary questions. One, I understand from media reports and correct me if I am wrong here, that because of the failure conditions, the bubbles did not take place. I think there was a fixed distance of about 36 m between the first and second trains. I just heard from the Minister that the driver apparently applied the emergency brakes or did he apply the brakes, and they did not work. Is my understanding correct? So, can I just clarify with the Minister on this point, whether or not the driver applied the emergency brakes or the automatic brakes to be used in emergency circumstances like what is available on the East-West and North-South Lines? If that is the case, subject to the Minister's answer, will LTA look into the condition of why the brakes did not come into effect, despite there being a braking distance of 36 m?",1,15,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00015
2018-01-10-T-002,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"My second question is, in light of what has just happened, which I agree could be quite unique, but nevertheless, for safety purposes, will SMRT be required to review its SOPs in contingency situations like what we saw at Joo Koon, so that the OCC or the driver will be alerted to and will be required to apply the brakes when trains start to move in unforeseeable circumstances in order to prevent collisions from happening?",2,16,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00016
2018-01-10-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"I thank the Member. As I had explained, this situation was never anticipated by Thales themselves. I did engineering but that was many years ago. One of my favourite subjects was computer programming. I enjoy writing software.",1,17,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00017
2018-01-10-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Of course, many things have happened during the last 40-odd years. Computer languages have improved and there are many more new languages and more efficiency tools. But the basic principle of writing computer programme, I think, has not changed. Which is you start off by anticipating ""what ifs"", all kinds of possible scenarios and therefore, you compose logic, diagrams and decision trees before you start coding and converting each of the steps into a programme, so that the computer knows what to do. A good computer programme is one that robustly and comprehensively thought of all possibilities so that computers or the robot would know how to react.",2,18,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00018
2018-01-10-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Unfortunately, in this instance, Thales had not anticipated such a possibility and, therefore, the assumption, both by Thales and the operator – the operators were trained by Thales – was that the deactivating of the bubble could not have happened. Had we known, as I had explained in my answer, the driver would have converted it into manual mode, instead of leaving the train to be run by the computer. If it was in manual mode, there would have been an adequate reaction time.",3,19,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00019
2018-01-10-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"In hindsight, one can blame the captain, but I do not. Because he was mentally not prepared and never trained to react under that kind of scenario. Whatever it is, the flaw, Thales has accepted full responsibility and has apologised, and the flaw has been rectified. But as an added precaution, I took a decision  let us not complicate our lives both for the software programmer as well as the operator; just separate the two systems.",4,20,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00020
2018-01-10-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"If I may just describe a little, though highly simplified, what kind of complications we have introduced prior to this incident. East-West Line is a complete line but we were doing the most complicated by requiring the signalling system to run on most part of the Line, on the old system, and then at some point, switch to a new system. Therefore, the trains were being operated by two signalling systems – the old system and the new system. They were required to know when to do what.",5,21,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00021
2018-01-10-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"So, based on the location at the track, the new signalling system could be on ""passive"" mode or ""active"" mode. For the stretch of the East-West Line which is still on the old signalling system, the system is on passive mode. It is collecting and reporting information but not acting. But after clearing a particular station, when it enters the Tuas West Extension, it switched into active mode. These are the complications we introduced.",6,22,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00022
2018-01-10-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"For the deactivation of the bubble to take place, several things must happen. Unfortunately, on that day, all three things happened. First, the train must have developed some problem. Trains carry a lot of computers and the computers' signalling equipment have to communicate with the track-side equipment of the new system. For that particular train that day, it was not able to communicate. When it is not able to communicate, the system, as a safety procedure, activate this bubble so that the trains would comply with the safety distances between trains. That was the first step and in this case, it happened.",7,23,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00023
2018-01-10-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Secondly, this train must pass a stretch of track which is still on the old signalling system and the track-side equipment had not yet been configured to the new train system. Unfortunately, this was the sort of scenario where the programmer had not anticipated. When it occurred, the bubble got deactivated. When it was deactivated, well, the rest is history.",8,24,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00024
2018-01-10-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Now, the flaw has been rectified and corrected. In fact, we could have run this complicated, double system on the East-West Line, plus the Tuas West Extension, but I decided ""no"". Let us separate the two stretches; we run shuttle buses and the service is not too highly compromised and this way, we ensure maximum safety for our commuters.",9,25,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00025
2018-01-10-T-002,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"I thank the Minister. I understand the explanation about the problem which is created by the software logic issue. But my two questions today focused on the driver's access to the braking system of the train. This is important because whether it is a software logic issue that creates any situation or any other kind of glitch, software or otherwise, I would like to ask the Minister, whether in that accident or in ordinary circumstances, whether the train is operating on automatic mode or controlled manual mode, what is the access the driver or the OCC has to apply emergency braking, and what would be that expected reaction time?",1,26,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00026
2018-01-10-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"I would not know enough to know what sort of reaction time is reasonable. But based on the logs and review by the experts, they felt that the train operator was just not able to react in time. Because the driver might have to switch from the automatic to manual mode, and from the manual mode, he could have activated the emergency button.",1,27,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00027
2018-01-10-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"On hindsight, it is easy to say, ""Why did you not do this and why did you not do that?""",2,28,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00028
2018-01-10-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"A few months ago, I had a friend, a corporate lawyer, who called me frantically. He is a very safe, responsible driver. He was driving in Singapore. As he approached a pedestrian crossing, he was quite clear that there was nobody. He slowed down but he did not stop. We do not normally stop in front of the pedestrian crossing unless we know that there is a pedestrian. But the next second, he saw somebody on an e-scooter flung onto his windscreen. The rider must have been speeding right through. But that was when my friend stopped, came down, assisted and called the ambulance. The rider was admitted to the hospital.",3,29,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00029
2018-01-10-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"A few days later, he was informed by the hospital that the victim died. My friend was totally traumatised. He knew he would be charged, he expected to be punished but he was very worried that he would be jailed. Being a lawyer, he checked up the law and asked me for advice. I am not a lawyer; I cannot advise him much. But as a layman, I wonder  when you do not have sufficient reaction time, are you responsible? To what extent are you responsible?",4,30,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00030
2018-01-10-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"I asked him to get a lawyer and a proper forensic to see whether it could ascertain the speed of the e-scooter. I think the Joo Koon situation is something like this, too. At that moment, was the train driver able to respond in time? Thirty-six metres, yes, it is not a short distance, but the speed was 18 km per hour.",5,31,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00031
2018-01-10-T-002,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,I think we move on to the next Parliamentary Question.,1,32,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00032
2018-01-10-T-002,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,I have just one more clarification.,1,33,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00033
2018-01-10-T-002,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Alright, I will just allow the last question.",1,34,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00034
2018-01-10-T-002,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I appreciate that.",1,35,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00035
2018-01-10-T-002,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"I thank the Minister for his answer. Just one clarification on what he just said. Perhaps the Minister could clarify to the public  when a train is on automatic mode, is each driver required to switch to control manual mode, before he can apply the brakes, or he has access to emergency brakes, even in automatic mode?",2,36,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00036
2018-01-10-T-002,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"I think it would depend on the design. I am not perfectly sure of the answer, but I will check. Let me check.",1,37,2018-01-10-T-002-S-00037
2018-01-10-T-003,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry monitors the number of young children injured through accidental burns each year; and (b) what measures are being taken to increase awareness among parents and caregivers of burn risks and how to prevent burns in the home.,1,38,2018-01-10-T-003-S-00038
2018-01-10-T-003,Amrin Amin,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Amrin Amin) (for the Minister for Health),"The MOH monitors the number of young children with burn injuries through the National Trauma Registry. The incidence of notified cases of burns in children below the age of 16 years between 2011 and 2015, averaged 70 cases per 100,000 population. This adds to 580 cases per year, on average. Approximately half of the cases occurred among children under three years old and more than three-quarters of the cases occurred at home. Of the cases occurring at home, half happened in the kitchens.",1,39,2018-01-10-T-003-S-00039

Most critically, parents should avoid allowing young children in kitchens where the risk of getting burns or scalds are high, due to the presence of hot objects.",4,42,2018-01-10-T-003-S-00042
2018-01-10-T-003,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his answer. I was just wondering to what extent does HPB's advice to parents of young children, include the specific reference to burns prevention at home?",1,43,2018-01-10-T-003-S-00043
2018-01-10-T-003,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"The materials are very comprehensive in the Health Booklets Children Safety Checklist.

I mentioned yesterday that there is a major review of the Penal Code. We are looking at whether there should be dedicated laws dealing with activities related to child pornography – from the making of pornographic material involving children, to possession and distribution of such material, and also whether such laws should carry higher penalties to send a stronger deterrent message. Those review proposals will be tabled for public consultation later this year.",3,50,2018-01-10-T-004-S-00050

They submitted it for tests – Bolliya and Bolli-Core FR. Those two models had been issued Certificates of Conformity (CoCs) by local certification bodies, which had certified them to be compliant with Fire Code requirements for use as cladding. The tests, however, found the samples to be non-compliant. The building owner then informed the SCDF about the matter.",2,57,2018-01-10-T-005-S-00057
2018-01-10-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"SCDF had made a further announcement on 8 December 2017. It has identified six other buildings that could have used these two models of composite panel, and investigations on how this came about are still on-going.",3,58,2018-01-10-T-005-S-00058
2018-01-10-T-005,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong,I thank the Minister. A few supplementary questions. I would like to ask the Minister  whether the integrity of the certification system has been compromised; when the review of the system to tighten the processes would be completed; and what remedial steps would be taken in the meantime to ensure public safety?

2018-01-10-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I said investigations are on-going. For example, Alubond. Again, I need to be careful about what I say because the matter is under, not just SCDF investigations, but also Police investigations. SCDF has issued a public statement as to how it believes non-compliant panels came to be put up on the structures. If we go back to MHA's public statement, there was one type of cladding which complied with the certification requirements, another that could not be used on the façade. SCDF believes they had been mixed up in the warehouse.",2,64,2018-01-10-T-005-S-00064

But if you had asked me to speculate in August as to how this came about, I think it would have been difficult for me to have speculated that it is because there was a mixture in the warehouse. One has got to be careful about jumping to conclusions, at this point, as to whether the entire certification system has been compromised. The certification system relies on identifying international institutions of repute, which are recognised worldwide, and also institutions in Singapore, which can either rely on those certificates and make sure that the testing has been done, or test themselves.",3,65,2018-01-10-T-005-S-00065
2018-01-10-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"At this stage, we have no evidence, no reason to suspect that any of them has been suborned. But I think we will obviously be investigating all possibilities, including whether there could be manufacturing defects, and differences between samples and actual material.",4,66,2018-01-10-T-005-S-00066
2018-01-10-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I have answered the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament previously, sampling is the method worldwide. The way of testing is to burn the material. And by definition, if you want to do a 100% testing, there will be no material left. So, you have to do sample testing.",5,67,2018-01-10-T-005-S-00067
2018-01-10-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As to how this will be reviewed in the context of public safety – in all the things that we do, I think that is front and centre. Everything else has got to work around public safety, which is why, for example, let us take this issue of cladding. In contrast with what happened at Grenfell Tower, Cladding is one aspect. How does it compromise public safety depends on a variety of factors.",6,68,2018-01-10-T-005-S-00068
2018-01-10-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"For example, is the entire building clad with this material? If we say 5% of the building façade is clad with this material, obviously, the risk is very different from 100% cladding. Some of the buildings identified have less than 5%, less than 8%. So, that is one factor – how much of the building has been clad with such a cladding?",7,69,2018-01-10-T-005-S-00069
2018-01-10-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Second, what sort of fire sprinkler system is there? The Member would know the contrast with Grenfell Tower again. In Singapore, the requirements for, for example, the fire escape routes are very stringent, and they have to be fire protected as well. What is the height of the building? How much of the building is occupied?",8,70,2018-01-10-T-005-S-00070
2018-01-10-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"These are composite factors and then there are other aspects of safety like how much training do the staff have in commercial buildings. What sort of fire drills were done? So, SCDF, in respect of these buildings, has gone down to look at all these aspects together and worked with the management, while they are taking down the cladding. Because even for buildings with 5% or 8% of cladding, we require them to take down, and at the same time, we are making sure that these other, what I call the human safety factors, are being practised. Fire safety is absolutely important, which is why SCDF makes that assessment first, while the testing is going on, because testing takes some time. But they make an assessment as to whether the building is safe or not safe and announce it publicly.",9,71,2018-01-10-T-005-S-00071
2018-01-10-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Where there is no unrestricted public access to the buildings, SCDF requires the building owners to inform all their tenants of the nature of the cladding and the issues surrounding it, so that the tenants can make a considered assessment. Even though we say it is safe, we believe it is safe, but we think the tenants ought to know. Where there is unrestricted public access, we think that should be made public and it is up on the SCDF's website.",10,72,2018-01-10-T-005-S-00072
2018-01-10-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"That is the approach that is taken, and regardless of whether it is 5%, 8%, 10% or 50% cladding, we require them to take it down. For example, on Alubond, I think 17 have taken down, 18 are in the process of taking down. In respect of Bolliya and Bolli-Core, I think three have taken down. The other four are in the process of taking down. Another building, a church, has been identified more recently. We are in the process of talking to them. So, all of them are in the process of being taken down.",11,73,2018-01-10-T-005-S-00073
2018-01-10-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In respect of other brands of cladding, what is doable has been done, in the sense that we have contacted industry partners, we have required QPs to give us returns to explain and relook at their buildings, make second round of checks. We have identified these brands as being problematic, and they better check, which is how it, for example, Bolliya and Bolli-Core came up. We have also asked for the annual audits to be expedited and this should cover all the others.",12,74,2018-01-10-T-005-S-00074
2018-01-10-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Law whether he will consider a provision in the Penal Code or the Children and Young Persons Act to enhance the discretionary power of the courts to administer harsher punishments for child abuse offenders.,1,75,2018-01-10-T-006-S-00075
2018-01-10-T-006,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Law),"Mr Deputy Speaker, the Ministry of Law, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Social and Family Development and other agencies have been working together over the past year to review the laws relating to child abuse, with a view to enhancing protection for children. This includes a review of the adequacy of penalties for the entire spectrum of child abuse offences. We will announce more details when the review is completed.",1,76,2018-01-10-T-006-S-00076
2018-01-10-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for her reply. There was a recent case of the Public Prosecutor against BDB, where the court dealt with grievous hurt and said that for vulnerable victims, an equivalent of section 73, which deals with foreign domestic workers, would be useful to it to enhance its sentencing ability. So, would the Ministry consider something like that?",1,77,2018-01-10-T-006-S-00077
2018-01-10-T-006,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,The Ministry has taken note of the suggestion by the Court of Appeal and we will consider this as part of the broader review for legislation.,1,78,2018-01-10-T-006-S-00078
2018-01-10-T-007,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what is the cost of the 320 sensors installed in Singapore's potable water supply pipelines to detect water leakages from the pipelines.,1,79,2018-01-10-T-007-S-00079
2018-01-10-T-007,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),"Mr Deputy Speaker, PUB collaborated with the Centre for Environmental Sensing and Modelling under the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) to develop the sensor network system for real-time monitoring of our water supply distribution network. The system enables PUB to monitor relevant hydraulic and water quality parameters, through real-time alerts on irregular data patterns in water pressure, flow and water quality which may potentially affect supply to customers. The data analytics and simulation tools developed as part of the system are used to help plan operations and minimise water supply disruption. PUB will continue to improve the reliability and coverage of the sensor network system.",1,80,2018-01-10-T-007-S-00080
2018-01-10-T-007,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),"Leak detection is one function of the system. Nevertheless, the sensor network system is just one component of PUB's leak management programme. PUB conducts physical checks of its pipelines at least once a year and also deploys portable acoustic leak noise data loggers to aid leak detection. Together with our on-going pipeline replacement programme, this results in Singapore experiencing only about six leaks per 100 km of pipes per year, which is among the lowest incidence in the world.",2,81,2018-01-10-T-007-S-00081
2018-01-10-T-007,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),"The cost of developing the entire sensor network system, including the 320 sensor stations and the data analytics software, is around $9 million. PUB envisages that the cost of further expanding the sensor network to more parts of Singapore will be lowered as sensing technology improves, and as the initial investment in software development is spread over a larger base of sensors.",3,82,2018-01-10-T-007-S-00082
2018-01-10-T-007,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),"PUB will continue to work closely with the industry to develop and improve sensing capabilities and leak detection technologies.

2018-01-10-T-007,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),Just a short supplementary question for the Senior Minister of State. Does one of the possible solutions of the leak management and technological programme include going into possible reduction of evaporation from reservoirs? Is that one of the measures being undertaken?,1,84,2018-01-10-T-007-S-00084
2018-01-10-T-007,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"This water sensor network system, as I have said, fulfils a number of functions. Leak detection is just one of the functions of the sensor network system. The sensor network system helps PUB in terms of monitoring the performance of its water distribution network by monitoring network pressure, water quality and water flow, and so on. In fact, it is necessary and it is important for the data obtained from this to be in real-time because it helps PUB in terms of planning for its operation as well as identifying and responding to anomalies and to minimise water supply disruption. For instance, when there is a water leak incident and the PUB field crew is sent to respond to the incident, they can use the sensor data as well as the software simulation tools to plan for their operations to identify potential risks, and then to be able to take appropriate actions in order to isolate and carry out repair works whilst monitoring this operation as well as the water quality as they are undertaking the repairs. This, again, helps to minimise the water disruption incidence.",1,85,2018-01-10-T-007-S-00085
2018-01-10-T-007,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"With regard to the other areas where PUB continues to look at how it can minimise water losses, due to leaks as well as other causes, one of the areas would be evaporation loss, say, from the reservoirs. My understanding is that PUB has looked into this and some of the products available − for instance, to apply a product to the water surface of the reservoirs to reduce water loss. But in undertaking an evaluation on the cost effectiveness, my understanding is that it is very expensive. It requires multiple applications because the material will degrade under sunlight. So, it has not been taken up, but they will continue to look at different areas in order to be able to minimise water losses as well as to supply good quality water 24/7 to its customers.",2,86,2018-01-10-T-007-S-00086
2018-01-10-T-007,Azmoon Ahmad,Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member),I just have one supplementary question to the Senior Minister of State. How much improvement has been made before and after the implementation of the new technology for the leak detection? Can she share this information?,1,87,2018-01-10-T-007-S-00087
2018-01-10-T-007,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"As I have said, for this sensor network system, leak detection is only one of its functions. A main function of this sensor network system is to monitor the performance of the water distribution network in real-time and to help PUB plan its operations. PUB has found that the sensor network system has been able to enhance its operations, and substantially reduced incidents like valve operations that can lead to a disruption in water supply. Therefore, it is going to expand the deployment of this sensor network system to cover other parts of the network, which would be the newly laid pipelines as well as pipelines where there is limited coverage and in the next two to three years to also cover the NEWater and industrial water pipelines.",1,88,2018-01-10-T-007-S-00088

PUB conducts physical checks of its entire pipe network at least once a year, or more frequently where necessary. Portable acoustic leak noise data loggers are used to aid leak detection. Beyond detecting leaks, PUB has a Pipe Renewal Programme to pro-actively replace older pipes or pipes which are more prone to leaks due to local conditions.

2018-01-10-T-008,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Firstly, will the Senior Minister of State be able to share the figure for the number of leaks each year for the last seven years? I believe the Senior Minister of State said, on average, it is six leaks per 100 km over the last seven years. But what I am trying to get at is has the number been increasing, decreasing or remaining more or less the same? So, can that information be shared? That is the first one.",2,101,2018-01-10-T-008-S-00101
2018-01-10-T-008,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"The second one is  will the PUB consider publishing this data on an annual basis if that is not being done right now? I say that also in the context of the statement that we have one of the best rates of water leakage in the world, which is commendable. I presume that that is using data that is published from other countries. So, presumably, other countries do publish this data. So, if that is not being done, will that data on the number of leaks per year be published on a regular basis?",3,102,2018-01-10-T-008-S-00102
2018-01-10-T-008,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"My third and last supplementary question  is the PUB working or moving beyond just leak detection and response towards proactive leak anticipation or prediction? I believe that there are research projects and there are initiatives in other parts of the world – I am not sure if that is being done in Singapore – where models are constructed using data to predict and anticipate where a fault or a leak is likely to occur, so that preventive action can be taken before the leak actually occurs. I know in Sydney, this has been going on for some time. The Water Research Foundation believes that through failure prediction —",4,103,2018-01-10-T-008-S-00103

This also includes proactively trying to prevent leaks from happening. So, our annual inspection of 5,500 km of water pipeline network that we have, it is a proactive or pre-emptive measure because we also utilise our portable acoustic leak noise data loggers to try and identify these leaks before they surface, through visual inspection as well as using these tools. In fact, in more hotspot areas where leaks may occur because of soil condition and all that, we inspect it even more than once – maybe up to two to three times a year.",5,110,2018-01-10-T-008-S-00110

2018-01-10-T-010,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"This soft launch will allow the Energy Market Authority (EMA), the SP Group and electricity retailers to gather feedback and fine-tune their processes and backend systems before the Open Electricity Market is extended to the rest of Singapore in the second half of 2018.",2,123,2018-01-10-T-010-S-00123
2018-01-10-T-010,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I have five supplementary questions for the Minister.",1,124,2018-01-10-T-010-S-00124
2018-01-10-T-010,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The first is we do understand that the pilot is in Jurong and the areas demarcated by postal districts are, I understand, for the postal codes starting from 60 to 64. So, I would like to ask for the rest of the island, whether the plan is to also have staggered commencement based on postal districts or is everybody going to go live at the same time for the rest of the people outside Jurong? That is the first question.",2,125,2018-01-10-T-010-S-00125
2018-01-10-T-010,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The second question is  I understand that there are about 26 licensed retailers of electricity. EMA had previously said that not all the retailers may be involved in the soft launch. So, I would like to ask the Minister whether there is any clarity now on whether certain specific retailers will be involved and whether this was their own choice or some vetting process by the EMA.",3,126,2018-01-10-T-010-S-00126
2018-01-10-T-010,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The third question is that we understand that EMA has committed to making switching over easy for consumers. I would like to have some elaboration on that. For example, I assume that consumers will have to change their meter boxes, so who is going to pay for that?",4,127,2018-01-10-T-010-S-00127
2018-01-10-T-010,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The fourth question is the Minister earlier said that we are having a pilot so that we can also study how it pans out. And if there are any feedback from the pilot, we can fine-tune for the rest of the island. So, I would like to ask whether the Government anticipate certain specific challenges from the pilot and whether there is a possibility that such challenges and fine-tuning may set the timeline back to beyond 2018 for the rest of the island?",5,128,2018-01-10-T-010-S-00128
2018-01-10-T-010,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Finally, the last question, we have noted that in other countries where there is a choice of electricity retailers, there may be information given to consumers about price comparisons. This may be done by the vendors themselves, for instance. In some of these countries, the regulator actually takes on the role of accrediting whether that information is accurate, to ensure that the consumers are not duped or given inaccurate information. An example is, I think, in the UK, where the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) does this sort of accreditation of information. So, I would like to ask the Minister whether the EMA, for example, is considering such an accreditation role, so that the consumers will have accurate information.",6,129,2018-01-10-T-010-S-00129
2018-01-10-T-010,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"May I remind Members that supplementary questions may be put for the purposes of elucidating an oral answer. That is under the Standing Orders. So, could Members keep their supplementary questions short?",1,130,2018-01-10-T-010-S-00130
2018-01-10-T-010,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank the Member for her keen interest in this initiative. I was heeding your advice and that is why I kept my initial answer short to allow for supplementary questions. There is five, then we try and do justice to some of them, at least.",1,131,2018-01-10-T-010-S-00131
2018-01-10-T-010,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Pilot in Jurong, does that mean that we will have staggered implementation across the board. That is exactly why we are having a pilot because we need to understand. Notwithstanding the best of efforts and planning ahead, this is a massive exercise because it would involve over a million accounts, island-wide eventually, and that is why the idea of focusing it on one district or one area like Jurong, which in a way reflects the diversity or our household and business types. And that, I think, would enable the key entities – EMA, SP and the retailers – to also understand if there are any unanticipated challenges. It is precisely that they are unanticipated that I cannot tell the Member, in answer to her fourth question, do we anticipate any specific challenges. That is exactly why we are having the pilot to see if there is something unanticipated or something that is coming in from a different angle that we had not foreseen, and that is the purpose behind it.",2,132,2018-01-10-T-010-S-00132
2018-01-10-T-010,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, the answer is if the pilot goes well, then I think we should be able to stick to the timeline and move towards the second half for complete implementation. If, however, there are reasons to review that, then we will do so, and we will convey that. The most important point here is the customer experience has to be a good one, and we want to avoid having undue disruption or concern amongst our consumers. So, that is our priority in this exercise.",3,133,2018-01-10-T-010-S-00133
2018-01-10-T-010,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Retailers, yes, there is a vetting process. EMA is now in the process of vetting and qualifying them. They are applying a fairly tight set of criteria. The reason is because unlike the current situation where the retailers are essentially dealing with businesses who are in the contestable market – I understand it is about 90,000 accounts – we are now moving towards households. And therefore, there is a need to make sure that there is an appropriate set of rules governing their conduct and capabilities that the retailers are able to meet.",4,134,2018-01-10-T-010-S-00134
2018-01-10-T-010,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, this is a process that EMA is going through now in its engagement with the retailers. Before we start a pilot, it should be quite apparent how many and the identity of these retailers.",5,135,2018-01-10-T-010-S-00135
2018-01-10-T-010,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Switching is easy, but what about meters? Again, this is something that will be elaborated. But, essentially, the way the Open Electricity Market is designed − I do not want to get into a very technical discussion − it means you can do a switch without having to have what they call ""smart meters"" or ""advanced meters"". It is possible and, in fact, our system is designed to do that. It is based on a principle called ""load profiling"" instead. However, if you have advanced metering infrastructure, it allows for greater flexibility and the kind of plans.",6,136,2018-01-10-T-010-S-00136
2018-01-10-T-010,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"This is something that EMA is studying. In the commercial market, in general, when they opted to become contestable and sign up with retailers, they have had some advanced meters installed. In the case of households, it depends because if their consumption levels are not very high, it may not merit that kind of investment. On the other hand, advanced meters do provide a lot more data which can be very useful for both policy and for system optimisation. So, we have to work out the trade-offs and design.",7,137,2018-01-10-T-010-S-00137
2018-01-10-T-010,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"On price comparisons or accreditation, the intent is to provide as much information as possible to consumers so that they can make informed decisions, and one part of that, apart from the general communications and media plan, is to have an online portal that will provide comparisons across different types of plans so that customers can then access this and then make the decisions based on their needs and they are informed by what these different plans offer.",8,138,2018-01-10-T-010-S-00138
2018-01-10-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Thank you, Sir, just a quick question. Currently, they are replacing the meter outside the houses. In Hougang, I saw them changing from a big one to a very small one. Are those smart meters? So, are they contestable-ready?",1,139,2018-01-10-T-010-S-00139
2018-01-10-T-010,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,I do know about the specific meter. Is the Member talking about household meters?,1,140,2018-01-10-T-010-S-00140
2018-01-10-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,Yes.,1,141,2018-01-10-T-010-S-00141
2018-01-10-T-010,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, I do not know about the specific meters in Hougang. But I would that, in general, the replacement for households has not been about going towards smart meters. That is an entirely different exercise. Indeed, when you deploy smart meters, you also need to have some backend systems that are able to use them. Otherwise, it is effectively a dumb meter because it does not do much more than a conventional analogue meter. So, this is something that we are studying. I would say that, most likely, it is not, because there has been no plan to implement advanced metering for households.",1,142,2018-01-10-T-010-S-00142
2018-01-10-T-011,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) how are excavation works to repair telecom cables, water pipes, sewage pipes and other underground works coordinated across agencies such that excavation work is minimised and shared across agencies to the fullest extent possible; and (b) whether the Government will consider tracking and publishing the instances when excavation works are undertaken at the same area multiple times within the same six-month period as a measure of the effectiveness of such co-ordination.",1,143,2018-01-10-T-011-S-00143

2018-01-10-T-011,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Road works are coordinated by the Road Opening Coordination Committee (ROCC) which comprises representatives from Government agencies, utility and telecoms service providers. It is chaired by LTA. As far as possible, the Committee schedules the work plans of the respective agencies to minimise inconvenience to commuters and residents. However, some works cannot be planned for, such as emergency repairs of cable faults or gas leaks.

2018-01-10-T-012,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng) (for the Minister for Transport),"Mr Deputy Speaker, the actual flight paths of aircraft depend on the prevailing wind conditions and directions. In the case of Seletar Airport, arriving and departing aircraft will sometimes fly over nearby residential estates because of the wind conditions around Seletar Airport.",1,152,2018-01-10-T-012-S-00152
2018-01-10-T-012,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng) (for the Minister for Transport),"The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) is mindful of the noise pollution caused by overflying aircraft and has several measures to reduce it.

2018-01-10-T-012,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng) (for the Minister for Transport),"Second, CAAS requires aircraft that overfly residential estates, such as those to the south and west of Seletar Airport, to operate at a height of at least 450 m or 1,500 ft.

2018-01-10-T-012,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"Yes, I would like to ask whether we can limit the time further, because if you mention 10.00 pm to 7.00 am, it is not true. There are flights that come in at 3 am, 4 am and 5 am. It is continuous – on 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 January. And there are flights that come in after 10.00 pm. So, for those that are noisy, can we turn them away or not allow them to land at Seletar Airport at all and not come near Nee Soon South because they wake people up in the early morning?",1,158,2018-01-10-T-012-S-00158

2018-01-10-T-012,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"I thank the hon Member for raising it. The flights that are permitted from 10.00 pm to 7.00 am are aircraft that are usually smaller and with newer engines, and these can include medical evacuation flights into Seletar Airport. So, we limit this window to smaller, quieter aircraft, and the big aircraft with noisier engines are only limited to day time. So, the data that the Member has provided are probably accurate. The bigger, noisier airplanes are only limited mostly to the day time and up to 10 o'clock at night. Post-10.00 pm, sometimes, it will be for medical evacuation and smaller aircraft.",1,160,2018-01-10-T-012-S-00160
2018-01-10-T-012,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"We take the point that aircraft do bring noise into not just Nee Soon South but to other areas of Singapore because of the small land mass of Singapore.

I also would like to share with the Members that this year, SSG will publish on MySkillsFuture portal, information on the training outcomes of SSG-supported courses. So, you can see more information about the courses to make an informed decision.

In any application for accreditation by a potential service provider or trainers, are the applicants required to declare any association or relations to other service providers who may have been under investigation or who may have been penalised for any improper conduct? And such association might include relationships to shareholders, directors and managers of errant or suspected errant trainers.",1,194,2018-01-10-T-015-S-00194

That is why I think a lot of people jump into this. I would like to ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary two supplementary questions. How can the Ministry provide more information to course applicants to make an informed decision? The second question is, will the Ministry consider open review of courses, just like when we want to book hotels or restaurants overseas, there is always some reviews there for us to view. So, will the Ministry consider that so that when a participant wants to go for that course, they will look at the reviews?",1,198,2018-01-10-T-015-S-00198

For example, you would probably recall that from October 2014, we require the trainers for the WSQ-approved training organisations, at least 80% of their trainers must have Advanced Certificate in Training and Assessment (ACTA) or equivalent. So, we want to ensure the competency of the training providers.",1,199,2018-01-10-T-015-S-00199

I mentioned briefly earlier that the portal called MySkillsFuture portal was launched on 29 November 2017 to help Singaporeans and course applicants to make better, informed decision. We have received feedback from course participants. So, progressively, starting from this month, SSG will progressively publish information on a few things  the course quality, trainee's rating on course outcome, like what the Member has mentioned.

As part of our efforts to enhance the professional standards and also the identity of the adult educators in the Training Adult Education (TAE) industry, SSG has, from October 2014, developed the TAE professional competency model which is a skills reference framework with clear descriptions of the competencies and proficiencies that is required of our adult educators. So, all hands on deck, we are trying to level up the professional standards of the adult educators to ensure that Singaporeans who want to level up their education, their skills, will be well placed to do so.",2,204,2018-01-10-T-015-S-00204

Many of us would have attended courses and at the end of the course, you probably would be given a feedback form. I think she is alluding to that. Indeed, there may be some course participants' views which may be moderated. This is why we have recently introduced a new feature on the My SkillsFuture portal. This is the Community Feedback feature. For residents who feel more comfortable calling, I have provided the hotline.

So, what do they mean by that? The only three high-performing countries with below-average levels of equity.",1,215,2018-01-10-T-016-S-00215
2018-01-10-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I think there was a table that compared the performance of socio-economically disadvantaged students at 15 years old across different countries.

The higher SES students are outperforming the higher SES students in the OECD by a larger margin, and so the difference in the outperformance of all our students is greater than the OECD average.

2018-01-10-T-018,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will consider reducing the minimum age for the Lease Buyback Scheme where the flat owner has a serious medical condition causing significant reduction of life expectancy.,1,238,2018-01-10-T-018-S-00238
2018-01-10-T-018,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Mr Deputy Speaker, to be eligible for the Lease Buyback Scheme, all flat owners should be aged 65 or older.

2018-01-10-T-018,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Nevertheless, should there be exceptional circumstances such as medical or financial reasons, HDB will exercise flexibility for households who do not meet the age requirement fully to take up the Lease Buyback Scheme on a case-by-case basis.",2,240,2018-01-10-T-018-S-00240
2018-01-10-T-019,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the tempo and siting of land development allocation considers the cumulative effect of continuous noise on nearby residents arising from successive construction developments in close proximity; and (b) what measures are being used to incentivise the minimisation of noise arising from public or private sector developments especially when there are residential areas nearby.,1,241,2018-01-10-T-019-S-00241

2018-01-10-T-019,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"In areas that are being developed fairly rapidly such as new housing estates, residents who moved into the area earlier may go through the experience of several nearby upcoming developments being constructed subsequently.",3,244,2018-01-10-T-019-S-00244
2018-01-10-T-019,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Nevertheless, public sector agencies are committed to reducing construction noise levels. For instance, LTA takes reference from NEA’s guidelines when implementing road and rail infrastructure projects. HDB’s contractors also include measures like the staggering of noisy activities, using quieter equipment and construction methods, shielding of noise sources and restricting the duration of noisy activities like piling, to minimise inconvenience to residents during the development process.",4,245,2018-01-10-T-019-S-00245

2018-01-10-T-019,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"I thank the Minister for his answer. I would like to ask one supplementary question. Can the Minister reassure us that the agencies will be proactive in minimising noise, especially in built-up estates, mature estates, like Clementi? I ask this because I have had residents' feedback that for some developments, especially where there was concurrent demolition going on, large pieces of debris were being broken down on-site rather than transported elsewhere to be broken down, with ensuing noise disamenities.",1,248,2018-01-10-T-019-S-00248
2018-01-10-T-019,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Deputy Speaker, as I had mentioned earlier, the agencies are already paying attention to this and they would continue to do their best in, firstly, staging the projects so that we manage the tempo of the projects as the Member had asked, and then subsequently, even when the projects are being implemented, working their best to manage activities on-site, and that would include complying with NEA's noise limits, but even going beyond that. We know there are more advanced construction methods that allow for construction to be done more productively, and importantly, in a quieter fashion. In fact, NEA also has a Quieter Construction Fund which co-funds construction activities that may be more expensive, but can do things in a quieter way.",1,249,2018-01-10-T-019-S-00249

This helps to address mismatches in wage expectations and provides mid-career PMET job-seekers more opportunities to regain employment, especially the long-term unemployed. The CSP also helps employers to tap a wider pool of mid-career PMETs to meet their manpower needs. In fact, around half of CSP employers are SMEs.",1,251,2018-01-10-T-020-S-00251

For example, PMETs with skills mismatches can tap on the Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) to reskill and move into new occupations and sectors with good prospects and opportunities for progression. Momentum for the PCPs has also picked up. In the first three quarters of 2017, about 2,700 PMETs were placed under the PCPs, and this is up from 900 in the same period in 2016.",4,254,2018-01-10-T-020-S-00254

If I understood the Minister correctly, to date, for the CSP about 70% of the employees have remained in the CSP employer, and 30% have moved on to another employer, or have left the CSP employer. Is that right?",1,255,2018-01-10-T-020-S-00255
2018-01-10-T-020,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Deputy Speaker, to clarify, 70% remained in employment.

2018-01-10-T-020,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"I thank the Minister for her clarification. So, my supplementary question will be, to date, based on these figures, I suppose a minority of them, I mean there was a certain amount of attrition – about 30% – have there been any insights gleaned into the reasons behind that? Were there any employability gaps that were discerned after the PMET was placed with the CSP employer which suggest that there are some training gaps that need to be fulfilled? Because anecdotally, I have come across such feedback that that may be the case occasionally. And if so, what kind of solutions can be put forward or deployed to meet those training and employability gaps.",1,257,2018-01-10-T-020-S-00257
2018-01-10-T-020,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"I thank the Member very much for that supplementary question. Mr Deputy Speaker, the CSP is one of many programmes that the Workforce Singapore, together with MOM, leverage on to help job seekers, whether they have been unemployed for a short period of time or if they have been employed for extended periods of time. Obviously, the needs differ, and so, we do not use one programme exclusively.",1,258,2018-01-10-T-020-S-00258
2018-01-10-T-020,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In the case of the CSP, it is very targeted. It addresses a specific issue with wages. In other words, the person is more or less job ready. The employer is quite keen to take him or her on. But, the salary remains something that they cannot find agreement on. So, the CSP comes in specifically to address this issue.",2,259,2018-01-10-T-020-S-00259
2018-01-10-T-020,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The Professional Conversion Programme addresses a different set of issues. Under those circumstances, the jobseeker may be attractive to the employer, but there is a certain gap in the range of skills that he has that causes the employer to think a little bit harder. And so, the PCP comes in to intervene and encourages the employer to give the jobseeker an opportunity to close that skills gap. So, CSP takes care of wage gap; PCP takes care of skills gap.",3,260,2018-01-10-T-020-S-00260
2018-01-10-T-020,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Within the whole range of programmes under the Adapt and Grow Initiative, there are yet others. For example, the P-Max programme deals specifically with the needs of SMEs. For some PMETs that are transiting from different work environments, the cultural context of operating in an SME may require them to have a longer period of adjustment. So, the P-Max programme does that.",4,261,2018-01-10-T-020-S-00261
2018-01-10-T-020,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"I should add that at the Careers Connect centres, which Workforce Singapore operates, there are a whole range of other programmes that deal specifically with issues that jobseekers may have, and they are not confined to training intervention. So, for example, there may be jobseekers who are struggling to cope emotionally with job loss and they have to cross that barrier before they be effective in job search. The Career Recharger programme does that for them – it is one-on-one counselling. There are those who have overcome that barrier, but they want to share tips with other jobseekers who are looking for work in the same field. The Career 360 programme does that for them. Then, there may be those who have not quite sorted out what they really want to do at that stage of their career. The Career Catalyst programme again provides one-on-one counselling to help them to do that. So, there are a whole range of programmes available, and we remain very open to what other interventions will help jobseekers regain employment more quickly, and we will continue to improve upon them.",5,262,2018-01-10-T-020-S-00262
2018-01-10-T-020,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"I thank the Minister for the answer. Just two supplementary questions. Firstly, from my knowledge of the CSP, I think there is still quite a number of SMEs as well as HR and employers in those SMEs who are not aware of the CSP. Just two suggestions. Firstly, can MOM strengthen its outreach, particularly for all SMEs in Singapore, through various collaterals where MOM or other public agencies interface with these SMEs? Secondly, will the Ministry consider, instead of having the employers tap on the CSP prior to hiring the person or before they are allowed to claim the funding, whether it can be made automatic, in the sense that you can detect whether they do hire people who are earning $3,600 and above, and who are above or under 40, and who are unemployed and retrenched?",1,263,2018-01-10-T-020-S-00263

2018-01-10-T-020,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"To his question, if I understand correctly, on whether we can detect that a person has been employed and so, automatically provide a CSP assistance to his employer. The difficulty with that is  how do we know that there was a wage gap? It is only when, if the person has been employed, one assumes that the employer was happy to pay whatever was finally agreed upon. So, it is not something that we can presume, and there are so many cases where people have entered into jobs, and the employers are happy to settle on a certain level of payment. So, we should not assume that there was a wage gap to begin with.",3,266,2018-01-10-T-020-S-00266
2018-01-10-T-020,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"At the same time I think, given what has been discussed in this House in the last couple of days, when disbursing grants, even in terms of wage support, we want to make sure that it is in cases that are really deserving. Can we improve on the application and the processing; can we make sure the employer does not have to wait too long? The answers to those questions are indeed, yes, but always maintaining a certain rigour in the assessment.",4,267,2018-01-10-T-020-S-00267

In my area, we have areas that despite the joint efforts put in, the issue is not solved. So, I want to know besides those methods that the Senior Minister of State has mentioned, are there any other latest methods that could be used to resolve this issue? In fact, I have one case which is quite bad. When I was there I can see it is noisy. Is it possible to change to another type of tree whereby it will deter birds from resting in these trees?",1,281,2018-01-10-T-022-S-00281
2018-01-10-T-022,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Deputy Speaker, in tackling the birds issue, we also must understand that this is a multi-factorial problem. If some cases, there is high-rise littering. I know there are some blocks in which we have residents throwing food particles, food substances out from the kitchen window. These are behaviour that constitutes the source of attraction for the birds to come. And once the birds are used to coming to a certain location because of the availability of food, they will then find natural places to roost.",1,282,2018-01-10-T-022-S-00282
2018-01-10-T-022,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"So, I think in tackling this issue, it is not about deploying more and more technology. AVA adopts a science-based approach to see which of these methods can be an effective way to deter the birds. But no scientific method will deter birds from coming back to sources of food. This is where we need to continue to strengthen our public education, to also take enforcement actions where necessary against people who throw food particles out of their windows. They continue to constitute a source of attraction for the birds.",2,283,2018-01-10-T-022-S-00283

From the feedback I gathered, it is because the birds know where to source for the food. In fact, they fly into the house, fly into the flat whenever the residents prepare a nice dinner or nice lunch on the dining table. The bird even went into their house. The Senior Minister of State is right; that could be the source but we cannot really ask everybody to close their windows.",1,285,2018-01-10-T-022-S-00285

So, they are trying things like fogging methods, deterrent gels and some of these trials may take some time to mature before we know whether the method is efficacious. More importantly, it has to be cost-effective because at the end of the day, this involves extra spending by Town Councils which means conservancy charges will have to be taken in account, on how the money is being spent as well.",3,288,2018-01-10-T-022-S-00288

2018-01-10-T-024,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sir, the deliberate spread of online falsehoods today is a serious problem around the world. You see the details in the Green Paper that has been filed. It gives a framework for the Government’s reasons for bringing this Motion.

2018-01-10-T-024,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Most Members, if not all, would have come across these examples reported almost on a daily basis in the media. And the Green Paper sets out in a summary some of the more serious ones.",3,307,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00307
2018-01-10-T-024,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Why are we concerned? Because we are highly susceptible. Let me share three reasons.,4,308,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00308
2018-01-10-T-024,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"First, of course, the very high Internet penetration in Singapore. More than 91% of Singaporean households have Internet access. So, it is easy to attack and spread falsehoods in Singapore. We have seen it happening.",5,309,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00309
2018-01-10-T-024,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Second, our diversity − as a multi-racial, multi-religious society. That makes it easy to exploit the fault-lines through falsehoods. You get completely fabricated stories spreading. For example, in June of last year, that cat and dog meat were mixed into a marinade of satay in a Geylang bazaar. That is a relatively minor example though it can make a lot of people very angry.",6,310,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00310
2018-01-10-T-024,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But you have more serious examples from other countries. You see some of them in the Green Paper. People can and have targeted specific sections of populations. They can target specific sections of our population − using falsehoods based on race, religion.",7,311,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00311
2018-01-10-T-024,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Third, our international position, both in this region and internationally, makes us an attractive target. We are a key strategic node, a key player in ASEAN. We are a trade hub, commercial hub, financial hub for this entire region. What we say on regional issues and international issues carries weight. So, if we can be influenced and swayed, then foreign interests can be advanced through us.",8,312,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00312
2018-01-10-T-024,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We have been the subject of foreign interference in the past. The Green Paper again sets those out. Those are the obvious known examples. For example, a Malaysian politician financing a newspaper in Singapore which campaigns against National Service – you cannot get a more obvious example.",9,313,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00313

2018-01-10-T-024,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Wide spreading of falsehoods can drown out the facts, can cause people to be disillusioned, can be manipulated to create rifts and damage social cohesion. So, the people who shout loudest and shout falsehoods are those who will get hurt.",12,316,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00316

2018-01-10-T-024,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Government has been studying this problem for a while. The Select Committee can study the issue in depth with a smaller group of Members of Parliament (MPs), and then present a report to Parliament.",18,322,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00322
2018-01-10-T-024,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"It will be open to the Select Committee to decide whether to hold public hearings, whether to hear from witnesses. I think it will be useful to do so. The process will allow for a formal dialogue with selected groups.",19,323,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00323
2018-01-10-T-024,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The composition of the Select Committee, we suggest, the default position is for 10 members − nine Government MPs and one MP from the Opposition bench − but we propose replacing one of the Government MPs with a Nominated MP, to have more diversity. So, we will have − eight Government MPs, one opposition MP and one NMP.",20,324,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00324

2018-01-10-T-024,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Sir, let me state from the outset that the issue goes beyond tackling online falsehoods per se. More fundamentally, it is about maintaining our sovereignty, as well as the multi-racial nature of our society, by ensuring that those who wish to do us harm by peddling falsehoods online do not succeed.",2,329,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00329
2018-01-10-T-024,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"As we have seen in other countries, deliberate campaigns to proliferate falsehoods online have caused panic and confusion, worsened societal fault-lines and eroded trust in public institutions. If unchecked, they may result in grave consequences for the country's social and political discourse. Let us not forget that Singapore has fallen victim to foreign interference through falsehood and misinformation before.",3,330,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00330

2018-01-10-T-024,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"In the Internet age, falsehoods can go viral in seconds. Digital content can be easily manipulated to make it more provocative and stir emotions more easily. Anyone can publish or share falsehoods online, even from halfway around the world. And the nett result is that online falsehoods can destabilise societies far more easily than ever before.",5,332,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00332
2018-01-10-T-024,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Take, for example, the example of the now defunct, The Real Singaporean or TRS website, which my Ministry shut down in May 2015. TRS published doctored articles which sensational headlines as clickbait to increase traffic to its website so as to inflate its readership and earn more advertising dollars.",6,333,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00333
2018-01-10-T-024,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"In February 2015, TRS published a false article on a Filipino family complaining about the noise from a Thaipusam procession involving Indian Singaporeans. Such an incident never happened. The article was deliberately fabricated and falsely attributed the incident to innocent parties to fuel anti-foreigner sentiments. It went viral and created tensions between our local Indian community and the Filipinos living in Singapore.",7,334,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00334
2018-01-10-T-024,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Fortunately, we acted swiftly to prevent TRS from doing further harm. The two editors of the TRS were convicted in court for sedition and MCI cancelled the Class Licence of the TRS website.",8,335,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00335
2018-01-10-T-024,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Sir, recent events worldwide also show that foreign countries can also use online falsehoods to undermine confidence and trust in national institutions and the electoral process. It was estimated that 126 million Americans were exposed to 80,000 pieces of Russian-linked content targeted to influence the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential Elections.",9,336,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00336
2018-01-10-T-024,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"In the UK, foreign Twitter accounts posted four tweets in the month leading up to the UK Referendum, such as how millions of Turkish people will move to the UK, if the UK voted to remain in the EU. Such falsehoods aimed to influence voters and the outcomes of elections. These outcomes in some cases changed the course of the countries, like what Brexit appears to have done.",10,337,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00337
2018-01-10-T-024,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"But let me clarify that we are not against technology. Technology is agnostic. It is the people and actors abusing technology to spread online falsehoods that are the problem. And indeed, technology has improved our lives in many ways, and while technology can be used to divide societies, so too can it be used to bring people together, such as by connecting communities across the world, or mobilising volunteers during crises. That said, as technology continues to push the frontiers of reality, it will be easier to create false information and damage societies.",11,338,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00338

The user then type any words he or she wants to say, which will be expressed in the same exact voice. The resultant voice sounds virtually indistinguishable from the real and does not sound computer-generated at all. This can be used to impersonate anyone, even Heads of States.",14,341,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00341
2018-01-10-T-024,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Singapore is especially vulnerable to this for several reasons. First, we are a small and multi-racial society that can be easily overwhelmed by a larger adversary, taking advantage of our societal fault-lines. Second, Singapore has one of the highest smartphone penetration rates in the world at almost 150%. People can easily access the Internet and social media on their smartphones anytime and anywhere, and hence, are more susceptible to the spread of online falsehoods. And third, while we have a population that is technology-savvy, it is an entirely different matter, whether we have the ability discern truth from falsehood.",15,342,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00342

2018-01-10-T-024,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"While public education remains our first line of defence, it is not enough. Mechanisms need to be put in place to respond swiftly to these falsehoods. So, we need an inclusive approach to address these issues holistically, involving not only the public sector, but the private and people sectors too. And we need a broader national conversation about this issue so everyone has a shared understanding of the threat and a sense of ownership about the solution.",18,345,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00345

The false news was taken down in half an hour but many things happened within that half hour. SPF, SCDF despatched vehicles and manpower. Residents congregated at the scene. Other residents texted to say that they were rushing home. And even after the news was taken down, to play safe, I still mobilised the Town Council to go around check for cracks on walls.

2018-01-10-T-024,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the deliberate spreading of falsehoods is not a novel phenomenon. For as long as human societies existed, there would always be incidence of rumours, untruths being spread in various media. Such falsehoods affect people, relationships, the way people see things, and ultimately, impacts on the society. Human societies have managed to cope and deal with such incidents and its consequences. However, with the advent of digital technology, the spread of falsehoods and its impact on communities have reached unprecedented levels. The spread of deliberate online falsehood is, therefore, of particular concern.",1,384,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00384
2018-01-10-T-024,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Firstly, the manner in which we receive and share information has changed significantly. There are now many more information systems and platforms which translates to more means and ways by which falsehoods can be spread. With the proliferation via social media, falsehoods spread much faster. We now have the concept of ""going viral"", a problem which we never had to deal with before. There is now instant communication – Twitter, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, Telegram – and with a click of a button, an individual could share information to many others almost immediately. On Facebook, an individual could share a post to 5,000 people. On a single WhatsApp group, you can have up to 256 members. Imagine the extent of the reach in numerous WhatsApp groups.",2,385,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00385
2018-01-10-T-024,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Secondly, as individuals, we all receive and share information with the same groups of people. It is natural for people who think alike to come together and share views. The Internet has made it easier for us to talk amongst ourselves with people of like-minded views. In such context, we end up confirming each other’s pre-existing views and reinforce our own biases. Often in such groups, there is no other source of information coming into our circle. We therefore form echo chambers and this amplifies the impact of any falsehoods spread within the group.",3,386,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00386
2018-01-10-T-024,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Thirdly, there are people taking advantage of the new means of human communication and the human psyche to spread falsehoods. The identities of those creating or proliferating falsehoods online are hidden behind the screen of anonymity, such that they are emboldened to spread the falsehoods.

However, in practice, this provision has been ineffective in properly addressing the spread of online falsehoods. The circulation of falsehoods is hard to circumvent, given how quickly they go viral today. One person could possibly be held accountable under the Statute for sending the message containing the falsehood but its virulent spread thereafter, cannot be adequately dealt with using existing provisions in law.",12,395,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00395

In December 2016, Facebook began showing a ""disputed"" warning next to articles that third-party checking websites said were fake news. However, researchers subsequently highlighted to Facebook that this method is ineffective as it was actually entrenching deeply held beliefs.

And so, as it travels very quickly, unsuspecting public would be taken in very quickly. So, to help public learn to discern truths, facts and opinions from lies and falsehoods, it is important that there is a high level of transparency of information flowing especially, from authority.

2018-01-10-T-024,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"First, even as we try to tackle the problem of deliberate online falsehoods upstream, to be truly inoculated to the adverse impacts of falsehoods, people need discernment to differentiate between truth and falsehoods. This is because of the ubiquitous nature of online falsehoods. I refer to paragraph 14(b) of the Green Paper to put things into perspective  36,746 Twitter accounts generated approximately 1.4 million automated, election-related tweets. Additionally, the repudiation of an article as false is often announced hours after the viral impact and seldom reaches all the audiences. False news may also continue to circulate making the article that repudiated it seem outdated.",2,433,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00433

Though the phenomenon of ""fake news"" is not a new 21st century phenomenon but more like an upgraded or multiplied upgraded version of rumours, the rise of technology has exacerbated the issue. In an age of increasing technology sophistication, artificial intelligence can fabricate a scenery that had not existed. It is possible to make a video showing Barack Obama saying things he did not actually say – all without compromising the perceived authenticity of the video, a point alluded to by Minister Yaacob in his speech.",7,438,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00438
2018-01-10-T-024,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Even without sophisticated technology, a simple deliberate miscaptioning and hence, repurposing of an old picture or video, can paint a very misleading picture. For example, in Italy, a government Minister's appearance at a funeral was falsely captioned to make it appear as if she was mourning a mafia boss. Using an apparently trustworthy news article but adding unverified and misleading facts can turn groups of people against each other. When that happens, the corroboration of articles seems to enhance the perceived credibility of the article rather than expose its falsehood.",8,439,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00439
2018-01-10-T-024,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Other ways to increase the audience reach and strengthen perceived veracity by enhancing popularity are through automated bots and phantom accounts. Social media has also become a platform for individuals and larger entities to transcend traditional territorial boundaries to irresponsibly wield the sword of the keyboard to manipulate politics, destabilise a country, increase polarisation or to simply get rich.

2018-01-10-T-024,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Therefore, while we should not hamper constructive discussion and the expression of viewpoints, we need to make sure that decisions are based on the foundation of truth and not the shifting sands of falsehood. An example of how falsehoods may hamper democracy can be seen in the Brexit situation where there was a misleading poll with shaky extrapolation that caused people to think that millions of Turkish people would move to the UK if it voted to remain in the European Union.

2018-01-10-T-024,Ganesh Rajaram,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"Firstly, speed and magnitude of response. One of the areas that the Government and the community have to work on is creating multiple credible platforms to push out accurate information, corrections and rebuttals. The Singapore Government has 16 Ministries and 61 Statutory Boards − and I am not even including Government-linked companies here. Each Ministry and Statutory Board has its own website and social media channels. In confronting fake news that is viral and in danger of triggering a nationwide panic, there must be an immediate response across all channels to ensure that the accurate information drowns out the fake news.",6,458,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00458
2018-01-10-T-024,Ganesh Rajaram,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"Mainstream news media outlets can help lead this charge by enhancing their credibility. At a Digital Media Conference in November last year, The Straits Times Editor and Editor-in-Chief of the Singapore Press Holdings' English, Malay and Tamil Media Group, Mr Warren Fernandez, said, ""Societies have to find a way to make sure that good content gets out there because if you don’t do anything about it, bad content will drive out good content"".",7,459,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00459

2018-01-10-T-024,Ganesh Rajaram,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"Mr Deputy Speaker, in situations of critical importance, beyond Government platforms and mainstream news media, we should also consider immediately marshalling social media influencers here in Singapore to help us get the word out as fast as possible. While we all know that our very own Prime Minister Lee is one of the biggest social media influencers in Singapore because of the sheer number of followers across his social media channels, there are others who also have a wider reach. For us to combat fake news with immediacy and magnitude, it is critical that we engage as many credible influencers as possible.",9,461,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00461

2018-01-10-T-024,Ganesh Rajaram,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"While that’s a great start, I feel that the education has to start at a much earlier stage − at pre-school. If you go to any restaurant or hawker centre in Singapore today, toddlers watching content on iPads and mobile phones are the norm. Most kids learn to use iPads and mobile phones even before they learn how to speak. Sadly, when my son was growing up, these devices were not available. In this digital age, parents and teachers need to teach kids about the difference between what is ""fake"" and what is ""true"". It is akin to teaching our children not to talk to strangers. To be able to tell the difference between what is fake and what is true has to be ingrained in kids from young. This is not something that can be solved by legislation. This needs a whole-of-Singapore approach – everyone from parents to grandparents to teachers need to get involved.",12,464,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00464
2018-01-10-T-024,Ganesh Rajaram,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"Lastly, there is a need for the small group of influencers out there who take pride in offering alternative views and commentary on political and social happenings in Singapore to be more factual, accurate and constructive. Their opinions may not necessarily be fake, but their views and opinions can be very damaging to our social and cultural fabric. To me, opinion pieces that can undermine sensitive issues or negotiations can be even more damaging than fake news from foreign sources. These influencers are Singaporeans, many of whom are very familiar with the OB markers as they may be experts or former media professionals. Many of these influencers may contribute commentaries to foreign online publications that are written to deliberately elicit a strong reaction. The community should be wary of these influencers, and learn to seek other credible sources of information before making a judgement.",13,465,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00465

It is imperative for the Committee to study this issue in depth and solicit responses from the public and various interest groups as a ground-up inclusive move, as compared to introducing legislation alone without consultation. There is a fine line between satires, deliberate online falsehood or differing yet genuine opinions that may not resonate with the State's views.

Secondary schools could also include media and digital information literacy in their curriculum, where students learn to pick on cues to uncover misinformation, question misleading sources and resist the temptation of believing just simply.

So, I think we ought to hear his words to the end. He said, “Singapore has far more vulnerabilities than most national states because it has none of the essential prerequisites for a viable, stable and prosperous state. It has nevertheless functioned fairly adequately for 27 years only on the basis of two intangibles – ideas and the human characters shaped by these ideas.”",46,551,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00551

2018-01-10-T-024,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"The old presumption that if people are all talking about something or sharing some information by the Internet that is going to be true is now the reverse presumption – it is likely something you have to look at very carefully. Weaponised in this way, deliberate online falsehoods or misinformation can sow societal discord, as has been observed in the Green Paper by the Ministers and in various jurisdictions. Fake news also risks, importantly, devaluing and delegitimising the voices of expertise and the concept of objective data—which undermines society’s ability to engage in a rational discourse based upon shared facts. As an academic, there is an importance of objective data that is extremely important. In the course of this speech, I would like to point this House to what is going on in the universities as far as fake news is concerned.",2,556,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00556

2018-01-10-T-024,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"The Select Committee should in my view, Sir, should consider four points, as I would set out in this speech. First, how do we define, what is or what is not fake news. Two, how do we utilise the Government's existing toolbox of soft measures as well as hard laws to combat fake news. Three, how do we equip users of the Internet, most of Singaporeans to be the first line of defence against online falsehoods. And finally, how",4,558,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00558

2018-01-10-T-024,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),That phrase fake news for a variety of reasons and for a variety of people is a loaded term capable of being co-opted by different constituents across the world for different purposes.,7,561,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00561
2018-01-10-T-024,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"I note that three Professors from NTU have directed their minds to this problem of what is fake news in an article they published in August. They undertook an examination of 34 scholarly articles and looked at a duration between 2003 and 2017 in order to map the different conceptions of fake news. They have gone on to say that fake news has two elements. The first, obviously, would be whether there or not is veracity, or facticity in their view; and secondly, the intention behind the news, the degree to which the author of fake news intends to deceive. The most recent understandings of fake news or online falsehoods focus on pieces of news that are low in veracity and high in the intention to mislead. This would be the most dangerous elements of fake news for online falsehoods. When looking at this definition, it is important also to see what it would exclude.",8,562,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00562

It is far more difficult than you would think. As a very simple example, those of us who follow football can understand that if you have a WhatsApp chat group, there is information on your sports teams, on the players that you support and what you think should be changed. Should the managers be doing something different, should a new player be acquired and very often fake news is actually propagated on these WhatsApp chat groups.",19,573,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00573

Major Internet platforms should support the research and development of appropriate technological solutions to disinformation and propaganda which users may apply on a voluntary basis.

2018-01-10-T-024,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Firstly, I need to underscore that constructive public debate or the exercise of freedom of speech must be founded on truth, not falsehoods. Those who advocate strongly for freedom of speech are quick to argue that the ""market"" should be left to ""correct"" misinformation and disinformation. They point out that a marketplace of ideas and thoughts will certainly eventually lead to the truth emerging.",2,589,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00589

The dangers of how freedom of speech can be abused to cause significant harm to society, can be seen from the experiences in the UK and Australia. In the UK, online falsehoods were used to distort sentiment in relation to Government policies and to breed xenophobia.",5,592,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00592
2018-01-10-T-024,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"In 2016, online falsehoods were spread about immigration in the lead-up to the ""Brexit"" referendum, which fuelled support for ""Brexit"" by claiming that the UK will see an influx of 12 million Turks if it remained in the EU. False information was also used to stir up racial tensions in the UK to smear Muslims as a group, and to turn non-Muslims against Muslims.",6,593,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00593
2018-01-10-T-024,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"In the face of numerous occurrences of online falsehoods in the UK, the UK government has launched a parliamentary inquiry into fake news. Their experiences have shown them that if left unchecked, the spread of falsehoods has a serious detrimental impact on society. In Australia, online falsehoods were used to stir up racial tensions to smear Muslims as a group and to stir up xenophobic feelings.",7,594,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00594
2018-01-10-T-024,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"In 2015, companies that get products halal certified were targets of a campaign that claimed that halal certification funds terrorism. Conducted largely through the social media and online networks, Australian anti-Islamic groups demanded companies that carry halal certification labels to drop them. This was part of what were known as rallies to ""reclaim Australia"". There was never any evidence to support the allegation that money from halal certification funded terrorist groups.",8,595,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00595

2018-01-10-T-024,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The second consideration is that falsehoods have the ability to radicalise individuals with extremist sentiments. Terrorist groups have long recognised the need to use online media effectively, in order to radicalise masses and achieve their sinister aims.

2018-01-10-T-024,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Bin Laden’s successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, shared this same view. He referred to ""jihad of the bayan"" which is the message of declaration, and considered this more important than ""jihad of the spear"" – he praised the ""knights of the media jihad"", and the ""clandestine mujahideen"" who were conducting it. Terrorist organisations use Twitter to put out fake news stories. There have been many instances of mainstream media mistaking terrorist-originated tweets as legitimate sources of breaking news.",13,600,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00600
2018-01-10-T-024,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"An example of a terrorist organisation that has been using online falsehoods to push its own agenda is the Islamic State (ISIS). In 2017, it claimed that Mosul’s famed al-Nuri mosque was blown up by a US-led coalition airstrike, when in fact, ISIS had destroyed the mosque themselves, using explosives. Their goal as jihadists was to blame the West and the Americans. The Iraq Military and the US Military released counter-footage, trying to show the truth of the matter, but objective truth has little meaning as the followers of ISIS cannot be swayed by evidence. So, even if you put the counter-truth, it is hard to sway the public and hard to counter the perceptions the mistruths have already shaped.",14,601,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00601

Some countries, such as Germany, have laws to take down unlawful content and systemic breaches that can result in fines of EUR $50 million.

I was then only eight years old, attending Primary 2. I understood what my mother meant and felt helpless. All I could do was to pray silently that the moment we had to leave our new born brother behind would never come.

2018-01-10-T-024,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"First, let us talk about the challenges in discerning truth from falsehood. Technology can make fake news look more and more credible, almost identical as real news. Have you seen online short videos? As long as there is just one person in the video, this person's image can be matched with different expressions and voices to make it look like the person has actually said those words. In the old days, we used to say “seeing is believing”. Now, however, you cannot even believe what you have seen with your own eyes.",7,636,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00636

The first is financial gains. For example, the couple who created The Real Singapore website made more than $500,000 from advertising and bought a house in Australia. $500,000. How long will that take for most Singaporeans to make? They made this money without any effort and conscience, simply by fabricating stories overseas, slandering innocent Singaporeans and dividing our society. Although the website has been closed down, there are still other similar websites. I hope the Government can find ways to sanction them.",14,643,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00643

The US has found out that fake news from Russia and East Europe had been read by 150 million people, and this could have influenced the US Presidential Election. 150 million is 30 times of our own population. If other countries intend to use fake news to influence our five million people and destroy our racial harmony and stability, it should not be too difficult.",15,644,2018-01-10-T-024-S-00644

Like in 1969, they can spread fake news of racial discrimination and marginalisation. Fake news now can spread to the entire island within hours, stirring up suspicion among races. The Government rebuts but country X is prepared beforehand and a new wave of fake news will surface, accusing the Government of racial discrimination. Country X will use social media and a large number of messages left by fake accounts to drown the rebuttal from the Government. In the end, race riots will occur and our economy will slump into recession. After that, country X will look for a puppet to set up a political party, proclaiming to protect the interest of a certain race. The party thereafter manages to acquire political power and adopts pro-X policies. X becomes the ultimate beneficiary but the victims are Singaporeans in general.
