2018-03-01-T-001,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills)),"Mr Speaker, the Polytechnics strive to ensure that their courses are relevant to the needs of industry. Every year, they review the range of their diploma course offerings, and make changes to drop or start new courses. In addition, every three years or so, they do an in-depth review of the curriculum of each course. For courses in sectors such as Information Technology (IT), the curriculum is reviewed more frequently given the fast changing nature of the industry.",1,2,2018-03-01-T-001-S-00002

2018-03-01-T-001,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills)),"Popularity of a course can be measured in different ways – such as ratio of applications to places, or the aggregate score of the last student posted to the course. The popularity of courses change from year to year, so I would rather not disclose which are the two least popular ones this year. It is also a disservice to students currently in these courses.",3,4,2018-03-01-T-001-S-00004

At the different levels, we introduce the different sets of knowledge and discussions that we want our kids to have. At the curriculum development level, we have measurements to look at how our students have grasped what they have learnt. Nevertheless, as the Member can see, things are ever-changing; especially for this year, as we have assumed Chairmanship of ASEAN.

2018-03-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Health),"Mr Speaker, institutions providing intermediate and long-term care services can indeed benefit from the sharing of best practices, standards, staff training as well as pooling of resources for better economies of scale. Today, there are already representative bodies that organise such efforts, sometimes in collaboration with MOH and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC). Examples include the Singapore Hospice Council and the Association of Private Nursing Home Operators. In addition, most of the voluntary welfare organisation (VWO) providers in this sector are members of the National Council of Social Service (NCSS). NCSS’ key roles include raising the capabilities of the VWO members and strengthening partnerships among them.",1,25,2018-03-01-T-003-S-00025

2018-03-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Health),"These representative bodies are complemented by AIC, which plays the roles of sector developer and coordinator. AIC convenes regular sector-wide platforms to raise the quality of care, build up competencies and facilitate effective practices across the sector. In recent years, AIC has promulgated standards such as the Enhanced Nursing Home Standards and Guidelines for Home and Centre-based Care, and convened industry committees to develop strategies and initiatives in quality improvement and manpower development. AIC has also brought providers together for better economy of scale in areas such as procurement of consumables and organisation of transport services, and intends to extend this to new shared services such as security and waste management.",3,27,2018-03-01-T-003-S-00027

2018-03-01-T-003,K Thanaletchimi,Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member),"Sir, I have a clarification. In regard to the AIC that is being the focal point of bringing all the ILTC institutions together, there are different forms of ILTC institutions – some are VWOs, some are privately-owned, some are kind of supported by MOH. How can they within themselves cross-learn the best practices, and at the same time, be more cohesive to be able to transfer skills and sharing skills where it is needed, because there are small and big institutions with the ILTC sector?",1,30,2018-03-01-T-003-S-00030
2018-03-01-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank Ms Thanaletchmi for the supplementary question. Indeed, she is right that there is a bit of unevenness amongst the various providers. That is why MOH felt that it is probably not the right time to have an ILTC association as such. With AIC being the sector developer and coordinator, we are able to help each and every individual operator to level up. I would like to assure Ms Thanaletchmi that we have not precluded the idea of an ILTC association in the future. We will watch this space very closely.",1,31,2018-03-01-T-003-S-00031

All SEPs, not just those in the creative industry, can access subsidised courses offered by Continuing Education and Training Centres appointed by SkillsFuture Singapore as well as certifiable courses that receive funding support of SSG. Eligible trainees can also apply for training allowance under the Workfare Training Support scheme. We encourage all workers, including SEPs, to take advantage of such schemes to upgrade and improve skills and competencies continuously.",3,35,2018-03-01-T-004-S-00035
2018-03-01-T-004,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Second Minister for her reply. Let me just ask her one supplementary question regarding the top five industries that freelancers have ventured into. The Second Minister mentioned there are schemes to help them. How well are these schemes currently taken up? Can more be done to help them? I understand that this group is also not a permanent group; they are a transient group. Some of them will be freelancers for awhile; and then, they will find a full-time job; and then, they may go back again. The issue now is how to help them to continue to upskill. We are also worried about them being stagnant in one position and miss out the entire innovativeness of the economy as the economy improves. Can the Second Minister update us as to how much do freelancers in these five industries utilise the schemes she just mentioned?",1,36,2018-03-01-T-004-S-00036

2018-03-01-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Where there are no associations, it becomes a bit harder. The reason is because if you look at the landscape of self-employed persons, although the numbers have been largely stable over the years, the occupations are very varied. There are at least 100 occupations among all self-employed persons. They keep changing as well.",5,41,2018-03-01-T-004-S-00041

2018-03-01-T-005,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"To help commuters make adjustments, some 150 service agents are deployed at MRT stations to help commuters with the ticketing machines. The service agents helped a few hundred commuters per day in the beginning, but the number has since come down significantly. Based on our sample count, the estimated breakdown of these commuters who needed help is  42% seniors, 35% working adults, 19% foreign workers and 4% others.",3,47,2018-03-01-T-005-S-00047
2018-03-01-T-005,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I thank the Minister for the explanation. I would like to enquire if there is a sense that the same group of commuters, perhaps the 42% senior citizens, would require repeated help in this area. If so, how can we help them to remember how to do so, perhaps for a longer period of time?",1,48,2018-03-01-T-005-S-00048
2018-03-01-T-005,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Anecdotally, there were some who tried it and felt it was still difficult. So, they came back and we helped them. We take a very flexible and patient approach. My philosophy is quite simple  technology must help us and help consumers. We should not try to get consumers to change in order to fit technology, especially if it is difficult. But, at the same time, I think consumers do need some nudging. If you do not nudge people along, we would still be using bullock carts.",1,49,2018-03-01-T-005-S-00049

We have set a target of 75% of peak hour trips to be on public transport by 2030. The mode share of public transport has risen from 64% in 2013 to 67% last year. We expect it to rise further as more rail lines are launched.

2018-03-01-T-007,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Mr Speaker, Sir, being the penultimate speaker in this marathon Budget debate stretching to a third day, there is always this pressure not to cover the same ground as the speakers who have gone before me. I had to revise my speech several times. I realised through the revisions, they have helped me better understand what is at stake in this year’s Budget. So, it is not all that bad being the second last speaker. I cannot speak for Mr Saktiandi though.",1,59,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00059
2018-03-01-T-007,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"This House has heard impassioned pleas from hon Members on the focus areas for this year’s Budget.

2018-03-01-T-007,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"At the same time, all hon Members have agreed that we need to ensure that the Budget is financially prudent. There are divergent views on how this can be achieved. It is important that we in this House try our best to build a consensus on at least the broad areas of strategy that this Budget represents. Everyone must agree that we should not dissent for the sake of dissent. So, what should be the framework for us Members to build this consensus? I will return to this question shortly.",3,61,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00061
2018-03-01-T-007,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"But before that, I want to first deal with a point made by hon Member Ms Kuik in her speech yesterday. It may be useful to outline her speech first. She said the Government's decision to increase GST to 9% is justified as a pragmatic decision. She said the Government's decision not to raise NIRC contribution to above the 50% mark is also justified as a pragmatic decision. She further cites a report in support of the view that the Government is excessively prudent with its large reserves. She then asked how much is then enough for us. She also said ""every tilt towards the side of pragmatism is simultaneously a tilt away from the side of our ideals"".",4,62,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00062
2018-03-01-T-007,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"With respect, I do not see pragmatism on one hand and being true to our ideals on the other as binary choices giving rise to a zero-sum game. This kind of approach would give rise to polarising views which would make it harder for us to reach a consensus on what is the right approach to be taken in our Budget.",5,63,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00063
2018-03-01-T-007,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Let me explain by dealing with the example of reserves that she raised in her speech. Ms Kuik asked how much is enough for us. From my perspective, no one can tell. In a financial crisis, the value of assets, especially those marked to market will shrink. We saw that in the Global Financial Crisis when the international bank shares dropped. We cannot predict with any certainty how much we need to overcome the next big crisis that will hit us. As an analogy, think of the Indian Ocean tsunami, nobody predicted that. We can only make an educated guess.",6,64,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00064
2018-03-01-T-007,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Using the pragmatism/ idealism dichotomy that she raised, what should the Government then do? Should it be idealistic, assume that the world is kind, and if Singapore, a small country with no natural resources, needs help to prop up its finances, it will get help, and it will be treated fairly, equally and equitably?

The first three shared values are  (a) nation before community and society above self; (b) family as the basic unit of society; and (c) community support and respect for the individual.,11,69,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00069
2018-03-01-T-007,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),The Budget reflects these values. Investment in economy and infrastructure is needed to secure the future of Singapore as a nation.

This is an important issue to lay bare, in particular for a small and open economy such as Singapore, as huge amounts of money move in and out of Singapore all the time. This is of benefit to us, especially as a financial centre, but it can bring with it risks that we need to buffer against, so as not to take risk leading to major job losses, and I think that is the penultimate key issue ‒ the job losses that might arise from this.",2,105,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00105
2018-03-01-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"After yesterday's debate, I was looking at statistics overnight. For example, to put things in perspective, based on 2016 data, Singapore foreign direct investment (FDI) stock is S$1.4 trillion. This is quite substantial. This is no fun and games. This is a huge amount. If there is a loss of confidence or catastrophe and, let us say, 30% only of the FDIs were to move out, it will wipe out S$400 billion. And we should note that MAS' official foreign reserves are only $370 billion, and this is just 30% of the FDIs. ""Foreign direct investment,"" if I may define it, is actually the amount of investments by foreign multinational companies or multinational enterprises investing in Singapore. This S$400 billion is what actually leaves Singapore's shores, and we will need money to rebuild for jobs if this goes out. And I remind Members again, this is only 30% of the FDI amount.",3,106,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00106

2018-03-01-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"At this juncture, Mr Speaker, please bear with me. I am trying to share a bit in terms of using a localised version of the island parable sketched by the late American economist Paul Samuelson of Massachusetts Institute of Technology to set the context about the overlapping generational issues that we face before my comments and questions later on.",7,110,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00110
2018-03-01-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"Let us assume we have this island which is home to unusually tall rambutan trees ‒ Samuelson uses cocoa trees and I am using rambutan trees here to give a localised version ‒ and also hungry people ‒ one young and one old generation ‒ and little else. The rambutan trees are our surpluses and reserves, and the fruits are our returns from our reserves. The trees reflect the island's strong fundamental. So, the young among the people would climb the trees and pick the fruits. Take note that the fruit must be eaten quickly before it is spoilt by the hot weather. The older people are physically incapable to climb and pick the fruit. Neither could they buy fruit from the young, as they have nothing to offer in exchange. So, if the elders had saved the fruit from their youth, it would not work. The stockpile would have rotted with the passage of time. So, the solution  the young gives to the old the fruit they pick and, in return, the next generation will do the same for them when they, too, grow old. Thus, the young sort of pays it forward. This also serves as a link between two generations. The scheme works, Samuelson pointed out, only because “new generations are always coming along”.",8,111,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00111
2018-03-01-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"I will pause at this moment and say this may be an oversimplified world I am painting, but the same core values and principles have been applied in Singapore.

2018-03-01-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"In Singapore’s context, things have evolved with practical policies introduced in the past 50 years. Our young can acquire a durable asset, say, an HDB flat, and our Government buy reserve assets and can replant half the rambutan fruits or seeds to grow more rambutan trees. At a future date, they sell these to cash out and take care of themselves. Thus, when the young get older, they can rent or sell the HDB flat to the next generation. In most cases, this kind of saving and investing does far better to serve the people. Capital accumulation enlarges the economy’s productive capacity, thereby creating wealth. Saving and investing both store value and add to it, turning one rambutan fruit into a whole tree. Retirees can, therefore, expect to get more out of their investment than they put in, not to mention other long-term initiatives that we have already built up over the years, such as CPF and ElderShield for future retirement and healthcare needs.",10,113,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00113
2018-03-01-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"So, Mr Speaker, my first question is related to the fruits from the replanting of the rambutan trees. We should make sure we continue to plant more rambutan trees and not go down the path of eating too much rambutans. In fact, we should have a balanced diet ‒ our NIRC (or rambutans) ‒ when we can find other sources of food or tax revenue. After all, too much rambutans may not be good for us. We can a sore throat. Besides, even when we take other sources of food from other plantations or trees, we have consistently taken care of those plantations with fertilisers and tender loving care by offsets and other measures to ensure all is well and more fruits can be produced in the future.",11,114,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00114
2018-03-01-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"So, back to my first question, Minster, will the trees continue to bear fruits at a rate we need? Can we and future generations continue to plant trees, even as some of the older trees wither and die? It would be good, too, if Minister could say whether or not we can continue to expect such returns from GIC, MAS and Temasek in the next few years or decades. If this is achievable, then, perhaps, there could be a chance for the proposed GST hike to be deferred to a later date.",12,115,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00115
2018-03-01-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"I wholeheartedly agree that it is important to save for rainy days and keep a substantial reserve. I am glad that the Government is looking at ways to address the overlapping generation usage of our future infrastructure, especially in the next economic phase of Singapore. This Budget is a good start. In particular, the issue is about optimal financing and that the user pays. Rather than just building up funds now for future infrastructure projects, I am glad that the Budget highlighted efforts to fund infrastructure projects by a debt structure to finance construction of infrastructure. In principle, under such a debt structure, the cost of funding the infrastructure project should be amortised over time, so each generation pays for the benefits they get from using the infrastructure project.",13,116,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00116
2018-03-01-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"In our case, it may be useful to earmark a certain amount of reserves or NIRC to use to “guarantee” the bonds or borrowings for an infrastructure project. To segment spending for infrastructure projects and other expenditures in our Budget explicitly would give taxpayers a better picture on where their money is going to, and how they will benefit from it. In fact, this is a feedback from one of my residents ‒ trying to give a better picture of where the money is spent and how you benefit and the usage of reserves as well.",14,117,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00117
2018-03-01-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"So, the key word here is “earmark” for the guarantee to lower the financing costs. But the returns from the infrastructure project must make sense. If future users cannot afford to pay, lenders can tap on that collateral and assume ownership of it. For example, in the context of the rambutan story, build a fence around one rambutan tree and use that as collateral to borrow money to construct the bridge to the next island (so we can build more rambutan trees there) and not sell the rambutan tree. We can use the toll for the bridge to next island to eventually pay for the bridge. Most importantly, the future users of that bridge will pay for the bridge. No need to chop down the rambutan tree.",15,118,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00118
2018-03-01-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"As mentioned in the Budget speech, borrowing arrangements for statutory boards and Government-owned companies which build infrastructure would form one part of the solution for funding large investments. However, contingent liability is a potential future issue that must be taken into account, given the unpredictable nature of the global economy and the financial markets. So, it is an issue and concern I have. Contingency liabilities could build up for future generations, affecting the ability to obtain funds in future. Does the Ministry see an issue in the build-up of contingent liabilities for future generations?",16,119,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00119
2018-03-01-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"Moving ahead, we will also have to evaluate how a GST increase in the near future would impact on the lower income and middle income groups. If GST is to be increased, how much of it is expected to be ploughed back to reach those in need? Will more resources be pumped into existing assistance schemes to mitigate the impact of rising living costs? It would be prudent to explore means to collect the revenue efficiently, and quickly and fairly allocated to reduce further inequalities.",17,120,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00120
2018-03-01-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"Furthermore, as the Government moderates the pace of various Ministries' budget growth and looks out for ways to be more efficient and effective, there will be decision inflexion points with trade-offs at the margins. I am concerned if some of the decision points and trade-offs may lead to reduced spending in specific areas of education and skills training, in particular, the ITE segment of the student population. They constitute about 25% of the post-Secondary cohort each year and are a significant future labour force with key skillsets for us to be future-ready.",18,121,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00121
2018-03-01-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"I have visited and met students and staff of ITE as part of Yayasan Mendaki’s Future Ready Unit's efforts to enhance the awareness of the younger generation about being future-ready and to instil the importance of SkillsFuture and lifelong learning. Without a doubt, the Government has provided excellent support and resources to ITE.",19,122,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00122
2018-03-01-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"In the last 25 years, ITE has made tremendous progress to provide skills training for full-time students and CET skills upgrade for in-service workers. Recently, ITE had made further advancement by providing new upgrading pathways for its alumni and in-service workers through the programme called Work-Learn Technical Diploma (WLTD), which is a path towards higher certification through apprenticeship model.",20,123,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00123
2018-03-01-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"Another ITE programme, which in my view is excellent, is the Global Education Programme (GEP). This programme provides ITE students with a holistic education by exposing them to new skills, global mindsets and perspectives, and a better understanding of the culture and lifestyle in other countries. It has proven to be life-changing for some of the students and is impactful, especially for those who come from humble backgrounds.",21,124,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00124
2018-03-01-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"So, I hope the Government will ensure that the support for programmes like those in ITE and, for example, programmes like the ITE Work Learn Technical Diploma and the Global Education Programme, will not be affected, and future demands for development resources will continue to be given to ITE. This is even more important in Singapore’s next phase of development where skills meritocracy is essential.",22,125,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00125
2018-03-01-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"Another resource that I hope will not be affected are the financial assistance support for ITE students. More than 50% of ITE students qualify for some form of financial assistance and they generally come from diverse challenging backgrounds. The application and checks because of means testing can be very onerous for these families. So, the ITE schemes allows more direct assistance to the students and their families. I do hope that trade-offs from the reduction in the Budget growth do not lead to reductions in the ITE Opportunity Funds, for example.",23,126,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00126
2018-03-01-T-007,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, this is a progressive Budget that seeks to prepare Singapore to cope with significant future expenditure growth. The Government is clearly seeking solutions to do so without putting too much burden on the current generation and these efforts should be lauded. I hope there will be no more rambutan trees being cut. Sir, I support the Budget.",24,127,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00127

As you said, over 50 Members have spoken for more than 10 hours, and if I were to do a point-to-point discussion, it will take us beyond 10.00 pm tonight. So, in line with my Ministry's policy of limiting Ministries' budget growth to 30% of GDP growth, I shall try shall to keep it to about 30% of 10 hours. [",1,129,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00129

2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"I am glad that the Budget has sparked many thoughtful conversations among citizens and fellow Singaporeans. Many Singaporeans have shared their perspectives with me in the course of various consultations and engagements, as well as with the other Ministers. I am grateful for the feedback that has helped us to refine our thinking and ideas along the way. This is important because the Budget is not an accounting exercise. It is a strategic and integrated plan for the future, about how all of us can come together to achieve our shared aspirations.",1,131,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00131
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"As we learned in Our Singapore Conversation, many aspire for a home where we can make a good living and fulfil our potential, regardless of where we start in life; where we can live purposeful lives, and enjoy our silver years surrounded by the care of family and community; and where we feel assured that our aspirations and needs can be met.",2,132,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00132

2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,I would like to cover three key themes in this debate. My Ministerial colleagues will talk about the respective issues under their purviews at the Committee of Supply (COS).,5,135,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00135
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"First, I will explain our approach to revenues and taxes, and why this is the sustainable, responsible and fair way to meet our future needs. Second, I will talk about the urgency of transforming our economy. Third, I will speak about how we can together build a more caring and cohesive society.",6,136,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00136

2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"In this debate, two main questions have been raised  why do we need to spend more? What are the roles of taxes, reserves and borrowing in meeting our revenue needs?",8,138,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00138
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"First, let me explain why we need to spend more. I explained in the Budget Statement that we face structural and sustained increases in expenditure in a number of areas – healthcare, security and other social spending.",9,139,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00139
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,Government healthcare spending is projected to rise by nearly 0.8%-points of GDP from 2.2% of GDP today to around 3% in the next decade. That is $3.6 billion more in today’s dollars. Why this rise?,10,140,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00140
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"First, we will spend more due to an ageing population. Already, Government subsidies for seniors' healthcare needs are more than six times that of a young person. From now till 2030, the number of seniors will double from about 450,000 to 900,000. This alone will increase healthcare spending significantly.",11,141,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00141
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Second, the number of citizens who have chronic conditions is rising. Without taking action on diabetes, the number of diabetic patients aged 18 and above could rise from 450,000 in 2015 to 670,000 in 2030. We are working hard to arrest these trends.",12,142,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00142

2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The scale and magnitude of terror attacks around the world in recent years are signs that the terrorism threat has heightened. This threat has come closer to our shores, given ISIS’ ambition to establish a caliphate in the region encompassing Singapore.

2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Healthcare spending, even in countries that are prudent like Japan and Germany, is around 10%-12% of GDP. New medical technologies could accelerate spending trends.",22,152,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00152
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"A sudden escalation in terrorist threats or geopolitical tensions could significantly increase the security spending required.

2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Indeed, as Miss Cheryl Chan has noted, it is not about how much we spend, but how well we spend. We achieve very credible outcomes, with overall expenditures of about 19% of GDP in FY2018. This is less than half of what OECD countries typically spend. We think carefully about how to design and organise our underlying delivery and funding systems, and consider the roles of all stakeholders.",26,156,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00156

2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"One group is the Nordic countries, which typically spend about 7% to 8% of GDP. Various OECD countries form a second group, around the OECD average. They typically spend about 4% to 6% of GDP. A third group comprises East Asian societies – Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea.

We were ranked top in the 2017 Gallup Global Law and Order Index, which gauges people’s sense of personal security and their experiences with crime and law enforcement when living in their respective jurisdictions.

2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"In education, we achieve good outcomes because we have invested in our schools and a dedicated corps of educators who believe in developing every child to their fullest potential.

2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"In healthcare, we are able to lead long and healthy lives because we have a well-designed healthcare system and dedicated healthcare professionals, with a system of incentives aimed at delivering value, rather than volume of treatments. We have citizens who take responsibility for their own health and strong families who look after their aged parents.

2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"This is the power of partnership, and of a whole system that encourages everyone to take responsibility. It explains how a tiny country like Singapore with no natural resources can have world-leading outcomes with moderate levels of taxation and spending. This is the Singapore way and we must continue to build on this ethos. In particular, managing the cost of healthcare must be a whole-of-nation effort. We all need to do our part to keep healthcare cost growth sustainable.",40,170,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00170

2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The surplus in FY2017 was largely due to one-off, exceptional factors that we do not expect to occur every year. The main increase came from an exceptional Statutory Board Contribution from MAS due to unexpected currency translation gains and investment gains from a global rally in equity and bond markets. The increase in Stamp Duty collections was generated by the recent property market pick-up.",45,175,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00175
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"We cannot fund our plans to secure Singapore’s future on the basis of episodic windfalls. If we are fortunate to have these occasional windfalls, we should do the responsible thing and save most of it for our future needs. We should not plan for our future in the hope that markets will always continue to move in Singapore’s favour. That is why we are reserving the bulk of the FY2017 surplus for future needs like MRT development plans and ElderShield subsidies. The Government is also sharing some of the surpluses through the SG Bonus.",46,176,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00176
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Let me explain at this point our approach to financing our needs. There are essentially three ways of doing so  raise taxes; borrow; or draw on our reserves. Each of these ways serves a purpose; each involves risks and trade-offs. We have decided on our approach only after deep and serious study – first of our spending needs, followed by the options available to fund them.",47,177,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00177

2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Let me first explain why we have decided to raise taxes. This is not an option that we have taken lightly. Not just because raising taxes is unpopular, but because the Government should as far as possible avoid taking people’s hard-earned money and deciding on their behalf how the money should be spent, unless it has to do so for critical social, economic or national needs.",50,180,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00180

These include areas like healthcare, supporting the elderly and retirees, investing in our people through pre-schools and SkillsFuture, and strengthening our security.

2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"In particular, for the broad-based needs that I have mentioned, a broad-based tax like the GST is appropriate. As then-Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr S Dhanabalan, said at the Debate on the GST Bill in 1993, it is critical to have a “tax system that will make an immediate and direct connection between demands for public service and the private purse”. This is important so that we understand that whenever we increase demands for public services, we should also pay more.

2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Let me now address some key questions that have been raised with respect to the GST increase and other tax changes  first, how we decided on the timing of the GST increase and its announcement; second, how we sized the GST increase relative to our needs; third, how we take care of our lower-income and ensure that our overall taxes and benefits system remains progressive; fourth, how the tax changes will affect our competitiveness.",55,185,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00185
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"First, there have been questions on the timing of the GST increase that I have announced. In planning our finances, we take the long view. We seek to understand major trends holistically and how they may affect Singaporeans. We assess carefully what we need to do in response and how we should find the resources to support our plans. This is how we had determined that we will need to raise GST sometime in the period from 2021 to 2025.",56,186,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00186
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"By announcing the GST increase early, we are being honest and upfront about our national needs and setting out what needs to be done. We are giving ample notice to citizens and businesses that we will need to raise GST. Members of Parliament such as Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan have spoken about why we need to do this, to set out a clear direction for the future.",57,187,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00187
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"I hope that it helps everyone to understand our shared challenges in coming years. Indeed, we must have such important discussions about our future, well in advance. This is important because it is not just Government finances that will be impacted by trends like ageing, but individual citizens and their families. We must all prepare for what is to come. This will also help us to better determine an appropriate offset package that can help with the adjustment.",58,188,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00188
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"But we know that there are always uncertainties. That is why we have given a timeframe of 2021 to 2025 as to when this increase would need to take place. I would like to assure Members that just as the decision to raise GST was not made lightly, the Government will exercise care in deciding the timing for its implementation. Before we move to raise the GST, we will carefully assess the prevailing economic conditions as well as our needs at that point.",59,189,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00189
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Second, let me address questions over how the GST increase is sized relative to our needs. As mentioned, a two-percentage point increase in GST rate is expected to raise revenues worth about 0.7% of GDP per annum. This estimated amount is before we account for the amount needed to fund the enhanced GST Voucher (GSTV). On the other hand, the expenditure drivers that I earlier mentioned – healthcare, security and pre-schools – already exceed this amount. These are serious commitments that we must budget for, and there are risks that overall spending could rise further.",60,190,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00190
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"So, the two-percentage point GST increase will not fully cover our expenditure needs, but only make the fiscal gap more manageable, in conjunction with other measures to manage expenditure. It is thus the prudent and responsible approach to raise GST in good time, instead of hoping for expenditure to fall.",61,191,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00191
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Third, let me address concerns over the fairness and progressivity of an increase in GST. I understand that some are worried about the impact of a GST increase on the cost of living, not just among the lower income, but also among many middle income households. Let me assure everyone that we are mindful of the impact of tax changes on households, particularly the lower income, and will help them to adjust while maintaining a fair and progressive system of taxes and transfers.",62,192,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00192
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"As I have mentioned in my Budget Statement, the GST should be seen together with the rest of our taxes and transfers system, including the GST Voucher scheme. The Government provides structural GST offsets through the GST Voucher. This is a permanent scheme, an integral complement to the GST. For the lower income, we provide substantial offsets. This is a targeted way of making the GST package a progressive one. For retiree households, they also get significant GST offsets.",63,193,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00193
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"In addition, we have schemes and programmes to support the less well-off. This includes the Workfare Income Supplement and Silver Support. From education, to healthcare, to housing, our social programmes provide higher levels of support for the lower and middle income households than they do for the well-off, with lower-income households benefiting the most.",64,194,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00194
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"We also provide support for the middle income. First and foremost, our approach to supporting the middle income is to create good economic growth, as the best form of social security is a good job. Second, we keep the tax burden low, so that Singaporeans get to keep as much as possible of what they earn. Finally, in recent years, we have expanded the support for Singaporeans to take care of their children, and aged parents, easing the burden on the “sandwiched generation” which Mr Desmond Choo spoke about.",65,195,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00195
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"So, when you look at the overall balance of taxes and transfers, lower- and middle-income households receive significantly more benefits from transfers than what they pay in taxes. The middle income group gets $2 in benefits for every dollar of tax that they pay. The lower income group gets about $4 in benefits for every dollar of tax.",66,196,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00196
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"As I have mentioned in the Budget Statement, we will continue to absorb GST on publicly subsidised education and healthcare.",67,197,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00197
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"When we eventually raise the GST, we will enhance the permanent GST Voucher scheme to provide more help to lower income households and seniors. We will also implement a transitional offset package, with lower and middle income households receiving more support, to help them adjust.",68,198,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00198
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Er Dr Lee Bee Wah also asked if we intend to set up a Committee Against Profiteering (CAP) to combat any illegal profiteering due to GST hikes. When we last raised the GST in July 2007, most businesses did not use GST as an excuse to raise prices beyond the GST increase. The then-Committee Against Profiteering looked into the complaints to manage profiteering.",69,199,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00199
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Similarly, when we raise the GST to 9%, we expect businesses not to exploit the situation and use the GST as a cover to raise prices. If necessary, the Government is prepared to convene a similar Committee Against Profiteering.",70,200,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00200
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"There have also been concerns that consumers may choose to shop abroad for daily products and there will be more attempts to evade GST. Today, we limit the value of goods that can be brought into Singapore for their personal use without GST. Customs and ICA officers enforce this, and we will continue to have an appropriate level of enforcement when the GST is raised.",71,201,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00201

2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Dr Intan Mokhtar has suggested raising personal income taxes (PIT). We have raised personal income taxes in recent years to further enhance progressivity. We increased the marginal tax rates for higher income earners with chargeable income exceeding $160,000, and raised the top marginal rate from 20% to 22% for those with chargeable income exceeding $320,000. This took effect from YA2017. We also introduced a cap of $80,000 on personal income tax reliefs, taking effect from YA2018.",74,204,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00204
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Under the present PIT structure, about half of our workers do not pay personal income tax. Among those who do, the top 10% pay about 80% of our personal income tax revenue.",75,205,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00205
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Any review of personal income tax rates must ensure that Singapore remains attractive. Just yesterday, Hong Kong has announced a reduction in personal income taxes in their Budget. We will be moving in the opposite direction if we are to raise personal income taxes when all jurisdictions are competing for talent, including our Singaporean talent. We will continue to monitor and review our rates, but for now, our view is that PIT rates are reasonable for us to remain attractive given the intense global competition for talent.",76,206,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00206
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Mr Ong Teng Koon and Mr Yee Chia Hsing suggested that we look closely at wealth taxes. Aside from taxing income, our current approach to taxing wealth is mainly through taxes on assets that cannot be tax-planned away easily, unlike other methods like estate duties. That is why we have enhanced our property tax regime in the last decade to make it more progressive, and to meet our spending needs. For residential properties, 86% of property tax collected comes from non-owner-occupied residential properties, and owner-occupied residential properties with annual value of $30,000 and above.",77,207,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00207
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"In this Budget, we have made moves to improve the progressivity of our stamp duty regime, so that those who can afford a higher-value residential property pay more taxes on their purchase. I thank Mr Seah Kian Peng and Mr Yee Chia Hsing for their strong support for this move. On average, we collected about $8 billion in recent years from property tax and stamp duty. This is a significant proportion of our revenues. We will continue to review this area closely.",78,208,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00208
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Mr Yee Chia Hsing and Ms Foo Mee Har suggested reviewing taxes on alcohol and gambling. We regularly review such duties, and we will take these suggestions into consideration.",79,209,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00209
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"On the introduction of GST on imported services, Mr Thomas Chua mentioned the $225 billion worth of imported services reported by the Department of Statistics. I wish to clarify that this includes all business-to-business (B2B) services, and vastly overstates the imported services which we will introduce GST on. Our move to levy GST on imported services will not affect most businesses. This is because most businesses can claim full refund of the GST they incur on inputs that they procure for their businesses, including imported services. Thus, businesses affected by the GST on imported B2B services are primarily financial institutions and residential property developers which do not get such full refund.",80,210,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00210
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,Mr Pritam Singh asked if this will yield additional revenues. We estimate it could yield additional revenue of about $90 million per year. But let us be clear that this is a move to defend our current revenue base from being eroded as more transactions move online.,81,211,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00211
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Finally, let me talk about keeping our fiscal system pro-growth. Dr Intan Mokhtar has raised suggestions to raise corporate income tax rates, particularly for MNCs and large firms.",82,212,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00212
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Let me elaborate more about our environment today. Around the world, there are significant changes and uncertainties in the global tax environment. There is on-going discussion worldwide on international tax rules for combating tax avoidance under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project. In 2018, the US reduced its headline corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. It also made other changes to make it more attractive for US companies to invest at home. This may spur cuts in corporate income tax rates around the world.",83,213,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00213

Indeed, we aim to live within our means. We should not over-borrow and burden future generations with unsustainable debt, as we have seen in other countries. The stark difference is that unlike some other countries, we borrow not to spend on recurrent needs like healthcare, education and security, but to invest in long-term infrastructure.

2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"In the next 50 years of the 20th century, a person would have lived through the Vietnam War, the formation of ASEAN, major advances in technology such as the space race and the Internet, the rise and fall of communism and the Asian Financial Crisis.",115,245,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00245
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"As we now come into the 21st century, we are moving from a unipolar world to a multipolar one, with growing tensions between major countries and concerns about global and regional stability.",116,246,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00246
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"If anything, developments that we are witnessing today remind us that the future is ever-changing and uncertain, as recognised by Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Mr Henry Kwek. What is clear is that in the aftermath of a crisis, be it financial or geopolitical, there are usually many years of subsequent weak economic performance. Employment and economic output tend to fall for a sustained period.",117,247,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00247
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"For example, the US unemployment rate only recovered to pre-Global Financial Crisis levels last year. It took a decade. Unemployment rates in some European Union countries have not recovered even after 10 years.",118,248,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00248
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"In turn, with crisis like these, Government revenues are likely to decrease, at the very moment when we need resources to support our people and economy, a view shared by Associate Professor Randolph Tan. That is why our reserves are critical to help us overcome such challenges, especially since we have no natural resources.",119,249,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00249
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin raised the IMF's general guidance on reserves adequacy. IMF's guidance is meant to specifically address capital flight risk, which is the risk that the Singapore dollar deposit holders will switch out to foreign currency because there is a loss of confidence in our currency. That is but one of many scenarios which our reserves have to deal with.",120,250,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00250
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"So, the examples I gave of the last century, and all the major events and the potential impact, should serve as a very important reminder about the role of our reserves. And also, even major countries, very well-developed countries, whether it is the US or the EU, are not immune from financial or economic crises. In fact, ironically, the last global financial crisis originated in the most developed parts of the world. But its impact was felt all around the world.",121,251,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00251
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"So, however much that Singapore develops, however much the world develops, we must be cognisant and we must be prepared to deal with unforeseen events, to deal with crises which can have very significant impact on Singapore and around the world. We need to be prepared for crises that go beyond just a currency crisis.",122,252,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00252
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"More importantly, we must have the humility to recognise that we can never predict what will happen in our lifetime, much less our children's lifetime, or their children's lifetime. So what we must do is to give them the best chance of a better life, whichever way the winds of change may blow.",123,253,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00253

2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Now I have listened carefully to the speeches of members of the Workers' Party to see if they could offer an alternative approach. But as far as I can tell, the Workers' Party supports the thrusts that I spoke of. In fact, no one has asked the Government to cut back on any specific item. On the contrary, they have asked the Government to do even more. Assoc Prof Daniel Goh asked the Government to do more in many areas, like giving Silver Support to those living in large flats. Mr Dennis Tan asked the Government to enhance elderly care support. Ms Sylvia Lim spoke about inequality and what we must do.",126,256,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00256
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"It is easy to ask for more. Not a single one of the Members of Parliament, except Mr Pritam Singh, even mentioned what it would cost, nor how to fund it. In fact, not a single one mentioned about how much it would cost for each of the ideas that you articulated.",127,257,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00257
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Only Mr Pritam Singh spoke about other ways of funding it. Mr Pritam Singh offered a few options. He suggested using revenues from land sales and increasing the NIRC cap. I have explained earlier, clearly, why we cannot, and should not, use this. He asked if we can rely on GST on imported services. I have explained that the yield is small, less than $100 million, and that we need to do this to protect our revenue base. He even suggested that through our Smart Nation efforts, we can increase tax collection from self-employed hawkers and taxi-drivers!",128,258,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00258
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Mr Pritam Singh cannot be serious. Any serious-minded person will appreciate that not one of these is a viable alternative to a GST increase. These are distractions, and Mr Low Thia Khiang asked us not to be distracted, so I hope that you could have a discussion with Mr Low Thia Khiang. Instead of taking a principled stance, Mr Pritam Singh would rather withhold his support for the GST increase by adopting a ""wait-and-see"" posture.",129,259,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00259
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"It is easy to fall back on politically expedient options and pretend that they will solve our long-term challenges. But this is a dishonest and irresponsible approach. If we were to do this, future generations of Singaporeans could easily end up in serious deficit. Then, we will be having a very different conversation about our future.",130,260,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00260
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"I think the Workers' Party should come clean to the people. Do they want the Government to increase healthcare or social spending? Does the Workers' Party want the Government to increase healthcare or social spending, as all your various Members of Parliament have spoken, item by item? If yes, how does the Workers' Party propose to pay for the increase?",131,261,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00261
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"So, I am glad that Mr Low Thia Khiang, who is not here today, appreciates our longer term challenges and the significance in positioning Singapore as a Global-Asia node. But I was puzzled that he characterised the GST debate as a distraction, and that he would rather debate this at election rallies. The Workers' Party Members of Parliament have been elected into Parliament! You are sitting in Parliament! Parliament is exactly the place to debate serious issues affecting our nation's future.",132,262,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00262
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"I have set out, as clearly as possible, why our spending needs will rise and the options for meeting these needs. All your Members of Parliament have spoken and said let us do even more. I have also given very clear notice, way in advance, of the need to raise GST. And I am prepared to answer your queries.",133,263,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00263
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"So, I really hope that the Workers' Party Members of Parliament, having run on a slogan of a First-World Parliament, is not just using attractive election slogans, with no real intent to take your parliamentary responsibilities seriously.",134,264,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00264
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"I hope that when the elections come around, the Workers' Party will not turn around and use the GST to distract people from the longer-term issues that we face. These are serious long-term challenges that we should do our best to address and not take this as electioneering or as political play. We owe it to Singaporeans to do the right thing.",135,265,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00265
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Ultimately, as many Members of Parliament and Nominated Members of Parliament have pointed out, our fiscal approach is about giving expression to our shared values. Embracing the virtue of work and responsibility – where each generation works, earns and contributes its share. And being good stewards of what we have been given today, and doing our part to leave behind something better for our children and grandchildren.",136,266,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00266
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"This approach reflects who we are as a society. Not one based on narrow notions of individualism, where each generation lives for itself and demands a chunk of the pie, but one based on notions of family and mutual support, where all generations take care of one another, and come together to build a better, stronger nation. As the Malay saying goes  ""Serumpun bak serai, sesusun bak sirih"" − we are not only stronger when we come together as one, we look good too.",137,267,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00267
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Another way in which we safeguard our future is to ensure that future generations of Singaporeans inherit a green and liveable city. With the introduction of a carbon tax at an initial rate of $5 per tonne of emissions from 2019 to 2023, we join many countries that have done the same to step up global efforts to address climate change.",138,268,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00268
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked about helping businesses to reduce carbon emissions. We will set aside funds from 2019 to 2023 to support them in improving energy efficiency. This will help businesses lower their energy costs and potentially more than offset the impact of the tax. By taking early action, companies that improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions can become more competitive internationally.",139,269,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00269

2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"When Deputy Prime Minister Teo and I visited the Energy Research Institute @ NTU (ERI@N) last year, we were very encouraged to see that our support for R&D was enabling our researchers to do good work, like on perovskite cells, which Mr Leon Perera mentioned. These cells have the potential to be cost-effective in generating solar energy. These efforts will allow us to compete and collaborate with companies around the world that are making a big push on the green economy. Households can also do their part to reduce energy consumption.",141,271,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00271

2018-03-01-T-007,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Yes, Sir, I have clarifications for the Finance Minister. I have four clarifications for the Finance Minister.

2018-03-01-T-007,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The first clarification, the Finance Minister referred to Mr Low's speech yesterday – I am sorry Mr Low is rushing to Parliament right now after attending to some family matters. And he mentioned that somehow, the Workers' Party was not being upfront because we did not want the Government to distract this debate by announcing the GST.",2,362,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00362
2018-03-01-T-007,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Now, if I heard him correctly, actually, his speech was focused on supporting the Government's accurate identification of the challenges going forward with becoming a Global-Asia node and so on. He did actually specifically say that it is fine for the Government to announce the GST hike, or intended hike, in advance of time and we can actually have a separate debate about it. His main point was that by doing it in this Budget, it distracts the debate from the other things that are being done in the Budget because everybody is focusing on this thing which is not even a Budget measure. So, that is the first thing. And of course, there was a bit of a cut and thrust about whether we should debate it at the election rally and we do welcome the early announcement because we think the voters should also make a decision on this.",3,363,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00363
2018-03-01-T-007,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),The second clarification is about the Party position on the announcement of the GST – and I think Mr Pritam Singh may also elaborate on this further – about why it was said by him that we cannot support the announcement at this point in time.,4,364,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00364
2018-03-01-T-007,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Now, the Government itself is not definitive about when this is going to happen. It may be seven years from today. And, of course, we do note that in the run-up to the Budget discussion, there were some test balloons being floated up about the fact that the Government needs to raise revenue. And immediately the public seized on the fact that Deputy Prime Minister Tharman and, perhaps, other leaders had earlier said that the Government has enough money for the decade. So, the public pointed out, ""Hey, you know, is this a contradiction?"" And I rather suspect, myself, that the Government is stuck with that announcement. Otherwise, if the announcement had not been made, perhaps, we would be debating a GST hike today.",5,365,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00365
2018-03-01-T-007,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Earlier on, Minister Heng also said that the Government has not made a decision on when, because it has itself to look at prevailing conditions, economic conditions and also our needs at that time. Fair enough. Similarly, I do not think we will be in a position to take a stand on that until the information is available at the relevant point in time. So, I think it is ridiculous for the Government to expect us, as a responsible Party, to support something when all the information is still not available and we do not have a crystal ball.",6,366,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00366
2018-03-01-T-007,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Related to that, I should clarify, in case anybody misunderstands, that it is our intention to support the Budget when the vote is called but this should not be mistaken as a support for this announcement of some possible GST hike in a later Budget. It should not be mistaken as such.",7,367,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00367
2018-03-01-T-007,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The third clarification, I think the Minister touched on why it is not prudent to use land sales as part of Government revenue. This is an issue that we have debated before. But the analogy he gave was, we have five parcels of land and if every few years, we sell one parcel, there will be none left. But I think the Minister can clarify that it is not quite like that. Land sales actually include many leases which do come back to the Government after the tenure of the lease. It is not a case of it being gone forever. Or even 10 years for the commercial leases.",8,368,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00368
2018-03-01-T-007,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Finally, my last clarification is, the Minister pointed out about the social mobility insofar as educational attainment of 15 year-olds in the performance of science in the PISA report to say that our poorer students are doing better than their poor counterparts in the OECD countries. I have filed a Parliamentary Question (PQ) on this before. But I think the report also highlights that as far as equity is concerned, our poorer students seem to be further behind our richer students − the gap internally, domestically − compared to the OECD countries. So, is it not really comforting for our poorer students to tell them that they are doing better than their poorer counterparts in other countries when really in their class, they are actually further behind them, on the average?",9,369,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00369

Actually, when I was listening to him yesterday, I thought, I was very happy that he supported the point that I made, about making Singapore a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise. He went on to talk about the various moves that the Government made over the years to look ahead and position Singapore to be able to meet new challenges and secure new opportunities because the world is changing very quickly.",1,371,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00371
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"So, he made a very good speech on our engagement, particularly with China. I was very surprised that towards the end of that very good speech, he then got distracted by this statement. He said  ""Sir, the unfortunate thing about this Budget is that it is looking forward too hastily for future revenue streams by prematurely announcing the GST hike. This has become an unnecessary distraction from the vision articulated in this Budget, and is a real distraction causing the Government to lose its focus in getting buy-in for the vision"".",2,372,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00372
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"This is, in fact, a real distraction because, in fact, if the Workers' Party truly believes that all the things you and your Members have advocated − spend more on this, spend more on this group, spend on more on these others − and that you agree that all these will require new revenue measures, then why do you not just say that ""Yes, we are very happy to support this so let's now talk about how we are going to position Singapore for the future."" I will be very happy to discuss this with you. You can file a Motion, a separate Motion to discuss that.",3,373,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00373

Whether it is pre-school, whether it is SkillsFuture, whether it is healthcare, whether it is revamping the economy, whether it is security. Do we need to provide for that? And if it is, as I said, very clearly, in today's debate, in my round up, I said that even the two-percentage point increase in GST does not fully cover the expected increase in healthcare expenditure. Is it not right for us to say that we know that there is one item that is definitely go up and we will not even have enough to manage that one item? Can we take one measure first, and look at how we can meet that?",6,376,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00376

And even to fund a fraction of what you have suggested, where is the money going to come from, and would a two-percentage point increase help us in some ways? Do you disagree with the fact that our healthcare expenditure will go up and if you do not disagree, then the question is how do we find the revenue sources to meet that?",11,381,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00381

So, now that I know that it is your Party's position, I am even more puzzled because I wonder why all your Members of Parliament, every single one of them, spoke about ""let's do more"". In fact, none of them had suggested that ""No, no, no, you should cut back on this item or that that item.” In fact, “Very good, whatever you do, double up, do more."" So, the question is, if I accept all your proposals, I have to re-do the expenditure sums again, and look at what else we need to do.",12,382,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00382

2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Now, as to your point about the land sales, and why my five land parcel analogy is not a correct one. The basic fact is this  most of our land sales are of pretty long leases − 99 years; for industrial land, some 30 years, some 60 years. If you sell that land for 99 years, you are not going to get back that land until 100 years later. If you are rigorous about it, you really ought to be spending no more than 1% of that land sale proceeds even if you want to use land sale proceeds because that is what the land is worth for a year.",14,384,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00384
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"But for Mr Pritam Singh to say, ""Oh, don't worry, let's take 20% of the land sales and, therefore, use that."" Is it not the equivalent? And you are not going to get the land back of the length of the lease. So that stream, that upfront capital payment, ought to be considered over its lifespan and, therefore, it is not proper. Several Members of Parliament had spoken yesterday that even for building infrastructure, we should be considering lifecycle costs. So, I think we better do our financing properly.",15,385,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00385

Since then, to the upcoming financial year, it has doubled from that. So, when the Minister says that the Workers' Party is irresponsible and dishonest, I respectfully have to disagree with him on that account.

But today it stands at 3.4%. Does this tentatively suggest that the Government actually has more income from NIRC than it originally planned to have, with more likely to be realised in the future, in view of the fact that the NIR formula tends to smoothen out investment cycles? That is the first question.",3,395,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00395
2018-03-01-T-007,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second question has to do with the point I raised in my Budget speech, which is whether there is any scope for raising NIRC from 60% to 70% for a short period of time to oversee large infrastructure spending, with the view to return this back to 50% on the condition that the revenues from such infrastructure must be returned to the past reserves. This would free up more of the Government's Budget in the respective financial years for recurrent spending and this was one suggestion I put forward to stave off the GST hike, and I am not sure whether the Minister replied to that.",4,396,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00396

Is it because we are getting more? Well, the markets have been doing better. But bear in mind one thing, the NIRC is about long-term investment. It is about long-term investment.

And it is not sound to build our finances on short-term fluctuations whether up or down. That is why the NIRC formula has a built-in way to smoothen these asset fluctuations. You do not want to have a situation where financial markets are doing very well, that the Government spends a lot more, and then when the markets go down, which is probably when we need the resources most, that you have very little to meet those needs. Let us be very careful about over-interpreting the number.",4,403,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00403

I do not see the logic of that argument. In fact, what we are doing, or what we are hoping to do, is that we want to have proper discipline and scrutiny of borrowing for infrastructure. That is why we are going to discuss with the President and the Council of Presidential Advisors (CPA). We think that a proper of doing this is to issue bonds in the market so that investors can scrutinise those numbers and see that these are viable projects. Then, seeking the approval of the President and CPA to provide a guarantee. So again, there is another layer of check but at the same time, that layer of guarantee allows us to access funding at probably a better rate.",5,404,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00404

There has been a lot of misunderstanding on this point. Certainly, strong reserves help us to anchor confidence. But MAS' needs in terms of what it does as a central bank is very different from almost all central banks in the world. All central banks in the world adopt an interest rate policy. Whether it is the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB) or the Bank of Japan (BOJ), the central bank announces certain policy rates and then they undertake certain operations to get to that rate if they need to, but the announcement itself and the anticipation of the announcement have very major impact on the economy. That is how they conduct monetary policy. In our case, our monetary policy is centred on the exchange rate.",8,407,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00407
2018-03-01-T-007,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Again, I must give great credit to Dr Goh and his team very early on, for deciding on this most unusual way of dealing with our monetary policy. The reason is this  the exchange rate has a far bigger impact on the state of the economy than interest rates. We are a very open economy and therefore the exchange rate affects economic activity in a far more significant way.",9,408,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00408

It also makes policy announcements regularly so that the market is clear about the official assessment of the economy.

When speculators were speculating on the positions of other currencies, they did not touch very much the Singapore dollar because they know of two very fundamental reasons. One, our finances are sound; that our fiscal policy at the various stages of the crisis is sound. And that is why I mentioned that we are one of 11 countries with a triple-A credit rating. All these firms who are doing credit ratings look at the numbers very carefully before they give us a triple-A rating. So, that is one important anchor.",12,411,2018-03-01-T-007-S-00411

Two, the MAS' official foreign reserves are actually in the data. It is publicly available as to how big the MAS' official foreign reserves are.

Never underestimate how the profit motive can destroy countries. It happened very, very swiftly and I have to say that rather unfortunately, many of the countries that were very deeply affected, adopted policies that looked very good at that point in time.

While the current external conditions are favourable, Singapore’s continued growth will largely depend whether we are able to stay relevant. Our future success is not a given.

2018-03-01-T-009,Lee Yi Shyan,Mr Lee Yi Shyan (East Coast),"Mr Chairman, many of the issues we face today are complex and multi-faceted in nature. For instance, I spoke about the need to nurture a multilingual environment for Singaporeans to use their Mother Tongues frequently and naturally. If this idea is accepted, whose responsibility would it be to see to the creation of such an environment? Another example would be demographic-related issues.

2018-03-01-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, the pre-Parliament stage. When is public consultation on a Bill a must and when is public consultation deemed not needed?

2018-03-01-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Are there any guidelines about the consultation period? It goes without saying that the consultation period should give sufficient time for people to respond. The recent consultation on the Films (Amendment) Bill illustrates the problem when the consultation period was too short, initially for a period of about 11 days in the month of December which is generally a month where persons may also travel. It was sensible then that the Ministry extended the consultation period after request from the public.",5,525,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00525

2018-03-01-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"While a Ministry may certainly choose to adopt other methods of consultation, for example, closed door focus groups or stakeholder discussions, I would say that this should not replace an open consultation on the actual Bill if the Government wants to have a bigger buy-in especially in controversial matters.",7,527,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00527
2018-03-01-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I next move to the Parliament stage. There seems to me some scope for improvement too.

2018-03-01-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"On the other hand, we do see some more helpful explanatory statements.

2018-03-01-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Finally, Ministers' statements to Parliament at the Second Reading of Bills should be as clear as possible. One recent example is the Protection for Harassment Act (POHA) when in a 2017 court case, the Government tried to claim that it was a person entitled to seek relief under the POHA.

Is it currently made clear to all civil and public servants that they can highlight problematic acts without fear for their careers provided that the reporting is in good faith? Also, is the PSC the whistle-blower reporting point for ethical lapses for the whole Public Service, including for lapses relating to the recent requirement that a political office holder cannot instruct the civil servants to act with respect to a person or persons and, if so, is the PSC properly resourced to handle such complaints.",2,550,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00550

In some cases, printed copies are sent to various stakeholders, including Members of this House. I am not sure how many of these printed copies are retained by the recipients for long. I would like to suggest that in future annual reports be produced only as soft copy files. These can be posted on the website. Users can print these for their own use if they want to. Since they have to print for the printing themselves, it is likely that they would only print the pages they need.

However, in the course of the debate, it emerged that in fact the differences between parties was relatively narrow and the benchmark salaries derived from both calculations would not be that different, notwithstanding different approaches to calculation.",2,559,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00559
2018-03-01-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The benchmark adopted by this House for setting Ministerial Salaries was to use the median salary of the top 1,000 income earners, as it was anticipated that people with the calibre to be ministers and managing large budgets of hundreds of millions of dollars should be comparable to this group.",3,560,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00560
2018-03-01-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"At the same time, a 40% discount was applied to this benchmark to indicate that this was public service and people should not come forward for money.",4,561,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00561
2018-03-01-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),The principle was that money should not be a disincentive to serve but it certainly should not be the main incentive.,5,562,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00562
2018-03-01-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Now, the salaries of other public appointment holders were set at specified fractions of the Ministerial salary benchmark. Of course, salaries cannot be set in stone as income levels and Government expenditure change over time. The White Paper recommended this benchmark be reviewed every five years.",6,563,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00563
2018-03-01-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"In the 2015 Committee of Supply debate, my colleague Mr Edwin Tong had asked Prime Minister's Office about whether it was time to review the benchmark with the five-year mark approaching. At that time, Deputy Prime Minister Teo mentioned that he did not feel the benchmark needed to be reviewed and commented that it had worked well.",7,564,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00564
2018-03-01-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Well, it is now 2018, after the five-year timeline to review the White Paper had recommended.

2018-03-01-T-009,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"To ensure an honest and competent government, a benchmark for Ministerial salaries was first introduced in 1994 to ensure that salaries were kept competitive to attract people of the right calibre to step forward to lead the country. Political service and public service require sacrifice and many of our past and present Ministers are good examples of this. Most importantly, we have been practising a system that promotes transparency with no hidden perks. These principles have been the cornerstone of our Government which has always espoused a clean and transparent governance model.",3,570,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00570
2018-03-01-T-009,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"But there is a need to be realistic as well. While many heads of banks, industries and businesses often earn more than our Ministers in terms of salaries, bonuses, perks and allowances because of their responsibilities but our public office holders, who handle Ministries and budgets with larger budgets and an even greater impact on the country and the population, should also be paid fairly.",4,571,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00571
2018-03-01-T-009,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"The benchmark for public office holders was fine-tuned subsequently and the last review was carried out in this House in 2012, agreed to by this House. The details were laid out earlier by our hon Member, Mr Vikram Nair and I will not repeat them. This has remained unchanged since. The Committee to Review the Ministerial Salaries that recommended benchmark also recommended a review at the five-year mark which we have since crossed. It is, therefore, perhaps opportune for the Deputy Prime Minister to update if a review has been conducted and adjustments, if any, will be made to this benchmark?",5,572,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00572

2018-03-01-T-009,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"Sir, in this regard, I wish to seek clarifications from Prime Minister as to whether the public agencies have a Public Sector transformation map which is aligned with the 23 Industry Transformation Maps. As we create new jobs which require new skills in the industries, the public agencies must also correspondingly upgrade and deepen the skills of public officers to better serve the public and business community.",2,574,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00574
2018-03-01-T-009,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"Sir, I would like to propose that all public agencies develop their respective public service transformation maps to improve public services, and upgrade the skills of public officers.

2018-03-01-T-009,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"Sir, over the years, many Government agencies have outsourced part of their services to private service providers in areas such as project management, facilities management, management of public hotlines, and so on. In the process, some public agencies have lost expertise or capabilities in these areas thus resulting in some lapses as highlighted by our annual Auditor-General’s findings.",4,576,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00576
2018-03-01-T-009,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"Sir, we need to relook into the skills required by our public officers to better manage outsourced projects or services so as to achieve better public accountability in using public funds. At the same time, the public agencies must set up systems to be interfaced with industry practices. For example, the introduction of the Building Information System (BIM) for building projects by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) sets the pace for the digitalisation of building designs. It also provides better co-ordination among different stakeholders of building projects thus enhancing productivity and reduce wastages.",5,577,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00577

2018-03-01-T-009,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim (Nee Soon),This is consistent with the larger SkillsFuture movement which calls for the private sector to look beyond paper qualifications.

2018-03-01-T-009,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Teo Chee Hean),The current framework is based on the 2012 White Paper on salaries for capable and committed Government.

2018-03-01-T-009,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Teo Chee Hean),The committee's recommendations contained in the White Paper were thoroughly debated over three days in this House and endorsed in January 2012.

The Prime Minister has written to the committee to thank the committee for its work and the well-considered recommendations. The Government has decided that since the scheme remains valid and the economy is still in transition, we will not change anything now and will maintain current salary structure and level.

Together with other countries, Singapore will do our part to reduce our emissions. To do so in a cost-effective manner, the carbon tax is a decisive move. Its merits were discussed extensively during the Budget debate. The transition period and support will help our companies and consumers make the adjustments.",11,624,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00624

2018-03-01-T-009,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"We will continue to strengthen our institutions to operate in a more integrated way. The recently passed Public Sector Governance Act strengthens our corporate governance and accountability. Mr Perera asked about our internal framework for reporting wrongdoings, and this is an internal disclosure framework. It is working well. Officers know about it. About 320 cases were reported to the internal disclosure framework in 2017. The number has remained stable over the last three years. Of these, about nine in 10 were followed up by formal investigations, with 134 resulting in some form of disciplinary action. However, many of these cases did not involve the misuse of public funds and did not reflect serious gaps in the Public Service's systems of checks and controls.",15,628,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00628

2018-03-01-T-009,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"On annual reports, I completely agree with Mr Perera. We should only print them when we need to.

2018-03-01-T-009,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Mr Lee Yi Shyan also cited the intensified competition among Asian economies and asked how we could adopt an innovation culture more widely.

2018-03-01-T-009,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Dr Teo Ho Pin, Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef and Mr Lee Yi Shyan asked how the Public Service as a whole is upgrading and reinventing itself. All our agencies are working on enhancing their digital capabilities, which will allow them to deliver more integrated services for Singaporeans and businesses. An example is the new HDB Resale Portal. Buyers and sellers of HDB resale flats can now complete the process in half the time, or just eight weeks since the start of this year.",20,633,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00633

Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary will elaborate on our Digital Government efforts later.",21,634,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00634
2018-03-01-T-009,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Ms Thanaletchimi and Dr Teo Ho Pin also asked what the Service will do to prepare our workforce for technological disruption. Last year, I spoke about training 10,000 public officers by 2020 in digital capabilities, such as data analytics and data science for policy formulation, service delivery and corporate services. We are on track. More than 4,000 officers have attended training courses as at the end 2017.",22,635,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00635

We also support our officers of all ages to transform, upskill and innovate, so that they are ready to take on new roles. This is also a question that Mr Patrick Tay asked.",23,636,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00636

From computerisation in the 1980s, the PS21 Movement in the 1990s, the Service has pushed itself to change with the times. Today, as Deputy Prime Minister Teo mentioned, we will need to find opportunities amidst challenges of technological disruption and slowing workforce growth.",2,642,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00642

To answer that question, let me first talk about the state of the Public Service today. It is generally healthy. It continues to uphold the values of honesty and integrity, strives to serve the public better, and we are able to attract our fair share of talent. These are the critical aspects of a functioning and effective Public Service.",3,643,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00643

2018-03-01-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"So, to Ms Chia Yong Yong’s question whether public servants have buy-in to Government policy, I would say, by and large, public officers are committed to policies set by the elected Government. It does not happen that way in every country, and it did not happen here just because public officers are yes-men or yes-women. In fact, Ms Chia is correctly worried that we do not want buy-in to be weakened over time. So, what she said is actually the opposite of Mr Louis Ng's concern that public servants are not speaking up and opposing the Government's policy.",5,645,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00645
2018-03-01-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The system works today because of the mutual trust and respect between Ministers and public officers, which have been built up through years of working together. Public officers know that national policies are developed in the long-term interest of Singapore and Singaporeans. Ministers have confidence that when they set the policy direction or make a policy speech, the Public Service will back them up with diligent implementation.",6,646,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00646
2018-03-01-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"But public officers are not public figures, so Ministers understand that they have to do the heavy lifting in engaging the populace, and speak up for public officers when they are unfairly criticised. This is something that we must continue to work on and not let it be weakened.",7,647,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00647
2018-03-01-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Citizen engagement, including co-creation with the public, has been a major focus since Public Sector Transformation started in 2012. So, on Ms Chia Yong Yong’s question again when she asked about whether public servants understand ground sentiments and whether sufficient effort has been put in to engage the ground, the Public Service over the year has expanded both digital and community outreach channels. For example, the People’s Association has a Kopi Talk series; MCI’s REACH Listening Points and Facebook Live Chats enable agencies to engage broader segments of society and understanding the people's sentiments.",8,648,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00648
2018-03-01-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"We have also been growing our citizen engagement capabilities. For example, the Citizen Engagement Seed Fund was set up in 2016 to encourage agencies to trial innovative engagement approaches. This fund has supported 16 projects by various agencies which have created new opportunities for citizen participation. These projects include MOH’s Citizens’ Jury on Diabetes, and the Singapore Tourism Board’s envisioning exercise for Chinatown and Little India.",9,649,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00649
2018-03-01-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"To Ms Sylvia Lim’s question, it has become the norm for agencies to do public consultations on legislative amendments.

These are very useful exercises, to solicit the concerns the public may have on the Bills, or suggestions that can improve both the policy thinking as well as its implementation.",10,650,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00650
2018-03-01-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The extent and approach to consultation and the duration of consultation, however, are determined by each Ministry, depending on factors, such as the nature of the legislative amendment, impact of the changes and also the level of public interest. In certain circumstances, such as when the Bills are time-sensitive or revisions are routine, a Ministry may decide not to conduct a public consultation exercise.",11,651,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00651

2018-03-01-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Another area which the Public Service is continuously improving on is the last mile of service delivery and the touch point with the public. The basic nature of Public Service is that it serves the masses, so the first challenge is that service delivery can be impersonal. Further, because the system must work for the masses, consistency in application of rules is critical. Otherwise, we get invidious comparisons between citizen A and citizen B. So, the second challenge is that the system can be inflexible and does not cater sufficiently to exceptions.",13,653,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00653

Today, our smart phones and apps can communicate with us in an individualised way even though they are automated systems. So, the Health Promotion Board’s Health365 App is like a fitness buddy to us. And the CPF Board has launched a CPF Retirement Planning Service, where frontline officers use technology to transform citizens’ data into personalised infographics to provide citizens with personalised advice on CPF matters. As a result, the conversations between the CPF officers and the public became richer and more meaningful. Senior Minister of State Dr Janil Puthucheary will speak more about the efforts we are taking to fully leverage technology to deliver public service.",15,655,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00655

2018-03-01-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"In the Public Service, my view is that the key innovation is not so much driven by technology, but by our humanistic instincts – to make a sound judgement, to take a bit of risk, to take responsibility for our decisions. And we need to empower middle management, even ground officers, to be able to do that, while ensuring that the integrity of the system not to give special favours remains intact.",17,657,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00657

For a Director, he will ask if within his area of responsibility, he has sufficiently made improvements, make Public Service more effective, service the public better and empowered, motivated and rallied his troops, the people reporting to him.

Since the period of it taken by fathers is generally much shorter than those taken by mothers, why is the take-up rate of the paternity leave still less than 50%? And so if we know the underlying causes for this low utilisation rate, how are we addressing them? Even if some dads and mums were to feel that the two-week leave is not much in the grand scheme of things, the fact that so few take it up should lead us to relook this policy.",4,739,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00739
2018-03-01-T-009,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"Sir, in a way it is the role of Government to support and not dictate the role of fathers so I do not want to force paternity leave down the throats of families who do not want to take it. However, if the obstacle is something else, something that we can address as a matter of policy, then I think we are in a position and we ought to fix it.",5,740,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00740
2018-03-01-T-009,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Sir, pre-schools, infant and childcare centres offer crucial support for working parents and influence their decision on whether to have another child.

2018-03-01-T-009,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Like childcare, infant care options weigh heavily on the minds of parents. I am concerned that some well-meaning parameters such as space to infant ratio has overly limited the number of places the centre can provide for infants. What can the Ministry do to ensure affordable and quality infant care places so that young mothers have real options to put their infants in infant care so that they can go back to workplace post-maternity leave?",1,744,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00744

Mr Chairman, I am glad to hear that since its launch in 2013, 1,500 companies have benefited from the Work-Life Grant which provides funding and incentives for companies to offer flexible work arrangements. However, I am puzzled as to why based on the 2016 survey when about eight in 10 companies are willing to let their employees go on a planned time-off or to tele-work to attend to personal matters and one or two companies are willing to let their employees work from home on certain days of the week that flexible work arrangements are not more prevalent in Singapore's workplace.",2,745,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00745

2018-03-01-T-009,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The Ministry has been systematic in promoting FWAs for employees, defining such arrangements as being flexi-time, flexi-place or flexi-load. I would like to enquire if similar commitments should be placed on employees to ensure that FWAs are taken on responsibly. I am keen to see that FWAs being rolled out on a sustainable basis in society and that can only happen if both employers and employees see the value in the arrangements.",4,747,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00747
2018-03-01-T-009,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Lastly, on the implementation front, can we consider rolling out FWAs on a sectoral basis? Can we work with some queen-bee companies in these selected sectors to get early buy-in? In fact, can we push the boundary by legislating flexible workplace arrangements for selected industries?",5,748,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00748

2018-03-01-T-009,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Thank you, Mr Chairman. My speech will also contain quite a few number of ""F"" words, specifically flexible, family and friendly. In recent years, a number of companies have implemented flexi-work schemes where employees can choose to start and end work within a range of agreed times. Progress in digital technology has also been the catalyst for the development of collaborative project management platforms that has reduced the need for employees to be housed in the same physical work space.",1,750,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00750
2018-03-01-T-009,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),These practices have facilitated the gradual transition of business models from those that focus on office presence and face-time to those that emphasise deliverables. These initiatives are indeed starting to make an impact in helping employees better manage demands from work and family.,2,751,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00751
2018-03-01-T-009,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"On the public housing front, significant progress has been made in housing to support couples that start a family early; and enhancements made in pre-school provision have also helped dual-income families better manage the education needs of their young children.",3,752,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00752

2018-03-01-T-009,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"My next cut, please, Sir. At the cultural cross-roads of global flows, Singapore, like many of the multi-cultural cities in the world has welcomed – and will continue to welcome – people from around the world for many years. And there are indeed those who have come to our shores, who end up making Singapore their permanent home.",5,754,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00754
2018-03-01-T-009,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"While the Government needs to be mindful about managing the socio-economic impact of immigration on Singaporeans, many of us will agree that immigration certainly leads to a richer and more diverse society.",6,755,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00755
2018-03-01-T-009,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"However, as we go about forging a national identity and building an inclusive Singapore, we need to ask ourselves what can be done to manage this new diversity in our society that has been brought about by immigration?",7,756,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00756

2018-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I will take my two cuts together. Singapore attracts people from all over the world.

These new communities bring with them their language, culture and these add vibrancy to our cultural landscape.",1,759,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00759

Some may feel uncomfortable with or suspicious of people and communities whom they are not familiar with.

These may seem like petty issues but if affects our day-to-day lives. At a more serious level, the newcomers are seen as taking away all your jobs and breaking our families. These negative sentiments need to be addressed.",3,761,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00761
2018-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"We need to accept that global boundaries have become porous and Singapore economy is also dependent on it being open. Some people may be here only for a temporary period. Some may be new citizens. In any case though they are part of our big community. For Singapore to do well, the community needs to be cohesive and integrated. There needs to be platforms to encourage interaction and foster understanding. I understand that there are many efforts in place to integrate the different communities. What more can be done to strengthen integration and bring about greater cohesion.",4,762,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00762
2018-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),My next cut. I have been married for about six years before I became pregnant with my baby. I delivered a baby boy last and I was already 37 years old. My experience is not an uncommon one. We do see many people marrying later and having children later in their lives. Many of us get caught up with our careers and may not plan the time for finding a partner and building a family. It takes effort and time to find the right partner. And most Singaporeans want to have all things in place before they start a family. This will also take time.,5,763,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00763
2018-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Of course, it is best if we can encourage Singaporeans to get settled down and have children when they are younger. But the reality is  this may be easier said than done. With couples marrying later, more married couples may face difficulties in conceiving or have challenges during pregnancy. Will the Government provide more support for these couples such as through enhancing assisted reproduction technology co-funding or raising the age limit to 40 years and above?",6,764,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00764

2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"For some couples, it is not that they set out to marry late. It is just how their lives unfold. The Government cannot interfere with how people go about finding a partner, or whether, and when, they start trying to have children. These are personal decisions. But we can help those who are ready to settle down.",12,805,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00805
2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Alex Yam spoke about the Government's support for Singaporeans to marry, and have children earlier, and we thank him for his suggestions. Since 2001, we have invested significant resources in a comprehensive Marriage and Parenthood Package.

2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"First, we helped more couples get a home of their own more quickly. Since 2015, more than 50,000 new BTO flats have been launched with priority allocation for first-timers. The vast majority of couples like Kenny and Peiru that applied for a BTO flat in a non-mature estate were able to select a flat by their second try, and all were able to do so by their third try. To provide faster access to housing, HDB will start to launch 1,100 flats with shorter waiting times of around two and a half years this year. And I understand that there is another batch of 2,000 to be launched in 2019.",1,809,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00809

2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The Government is committed to ensuring that every parent who wants a pre-school place for their child will be able to have one. Over the past five years, we increased pre-school capacity by 50%. There are now about 7,800 infant-care places and 140,000 childcare places. We also ramped up affordable, quality places through the Anchor Operators (AOPs), Partner Operators (POPs) and MOE Kindergartens, with a focus on new estates with many young families.",3,811,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00811

2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Over the next five years, there will be 40,000 new full-day pre-school places to meet the needs of parents. At the same time, we will continue to safeguard the safety and well-being of children in pre-schools, including through regulation on space norms which Ms Sun Xueling asked about. MSF will elaborate more on ECDA's pre-school efforts later in the debate.",5,813,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00813
2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Darryl David and Ms Sun Xueling asked about the progress made in encouraging more family-friendly workplaces. We have indeed strengthened work-life support to help working parents achieve both career and family aspirations. Today, a working couple can access 20 weeks of paid leave and two weeks of unpaid leave in their child's first year.",6,814,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00814
2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin suggested increasing leave support for fathers, and extending adoption leave to adoptive fathers. Today, adoptive fathers already enjoy the same Paternity and Shared Parental leave provisions as biological fathers.

2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"For instance, we introduced Paternity Leave in 2013, and doubled it to two weeks in 2017.

2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Given the recent enhancements to the legislated leave provisions, we will give businesses some time to adjust. In the meantime, the Public Sector is piloting an additional four weeks of unpaid infant-care leave, for both fathers and mothers, to test the general viability of longer parental leave. It is only six months since we implemented that pilot. The take-up is encouraging. We have got more than 80 staff who have taken it up. It is still a bit too early to form a view but I think the feedback from these staff who have taken the extended leave, is that the leave has been very helpful.",10,818,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00818
2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"We will also continue to encourage more fathers to make use of the enhanced leave provisions to care for their children. Since Paternity Leave was introduced five years ago, take-up rates have increased from 25% to 46%. As Mr Seah Kian Peng pointed out, there is still room for improvement. The Government pays for the Paternity Leave in full and we hope it helps employers to be supportive of employees who are new fathers.",11,819,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00819
2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In addition to parental leave, we have strengthened support for workplace flexibility. More than 350 employers, covering about 250,000 employees, have adopted the Tripartite Standard on Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs). This was launched just about six months ago. Three in four of these employers are from the private sector including small and medium enterprises (SMEs). I believe Ms Sun Xueling will agree that this is a good first step, as a society, in moving towards encouraging FWAs. But there is much more to do. We will encourage more employers to sign on to this Standard to distinguish themselves as employers with progressive workplace practices. I will speak more on the issue of FWAs during the COS debate for MOM.",12,820,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00820

2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"First, we will do more to help couples own a home faster. As announced by Minister Heng Swee Keat last week, we have enhanced the Proximity Housing Grant to provide more support for couples who wish to live together with or near their parents.",16,824,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00824
2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,Some young couples are ready to settle down earlier in life and wish to apply for a BTO flat. We will provide more flexibility in our grant and loan processes to better support them in owning a home. Minister Lawrence Wong will share more later in the debate.,17,825,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00825
2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Second, we will provide more assistance for couples who face difficulties conceiving. This is also what Ms Rahayu Mahzam suggested. Today, eligible couples receive co-funding of 75% of the costs of Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) treatment. From 1 April 2018, we will raise the maximum support available, from $6,300 to $7,700 for fresh cycles; and from $1,200 to $2,200 for frozen cycles.",18,826,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00826
2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Third, we will enhance healthcare assurance for young families. Today, all newborn citizens receive a Medisave grant of $4,000 that can cover their MediShield Life premiums up to age 21.",19,827,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00827
2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,We will go further and extend MediShield Life to cover serious pregnancy and delivery-related complications so that expectant parents can have less to worry about. MOH will share more details in the coming months.,20,828,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00828
2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Next, we will strengthen work-life support. While we have significantly enhanced parenthood-related leave provisions, there are sometimes unexpected care-giving needs that put families under stress, for example, congenital conditions or sudden illnesses among infants, or in cases of multiple or pre-term births.",21,829,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00829
2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Our fourth enhancement is to introduce a new Tripartite Standard to encourage employers to provide care-giving leave in such instances. To promote voluntary adoption by employers, such leave will be unpaid and kept to four weeks. The Standard also provides up to two weeks of unpaid leave for employees with immediate family members who are hospitalised. So, this Tripartite Standard will really help the sandwiched class – those that have to look after the young as well as the seniors in their homes.",22,830,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00830
2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The fifth enhancement is to extend and enhance the Work-Life Grant. We will provide more support to businesses to encourage the adoption of FWAs, in particular, job sharing. These will make it easier for employers to implement practices that enhance family-friendliness. I will share more in a few days.",23,831,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00831
2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Besides these policy enhancements, employers, co-workers, and the community can also provide strong support. For example, Mr Alex Yam will be glad to know that the People's Association (PA)'s Embracing PArenthood Movement, which celebrates young families, reached out to 30,000 parents and caregivers across 250 celebrations held nationwide last year. I have attended some of these very joyous occasions that signal to the new parents that you are not alone and that the whole community is here to support. And so, through this Movement, several parent support networks have also been formed. We will continue to strongly support Singaporeans to start families sooner rather than later.",24,832,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00832

2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,Mr Vikram Nair and Mr Henry Kwek asked about our foreign workforce and immigration policies. Our third strategy to achieve a healthy population profile is to maintain a careful balance in foreign worker as well as immigrant flows.,26,834,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00834

2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Chairman, I would like to show one slide and this has got to do with our working-age citizen population. Our working-age citizen population will soon shrink. Even with immigrants, the number of Singaporeans aged 20 to 64 is projected to peak at 2.2 million around 2020 and then it will decline thereafter. Without immigration, it would have started to shrink earlier and decline at a much faster rate.",28,836,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00836

2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"MOM has also stepped up efforts to emphasise complementarity between the local and foreign workforce. The Fair Consideration Framework sets out clear expectations for companies to practise fair hiring.

Employment rates for those aged 25 to 64 are on an upward trend. Unemployment rates have generally remained low. And over the last five years from 2012 to 2017, real income at the median and 20th percentile of full-time employed citizens grew by 3.9% and 4.3% per annum.",33,841,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00841

This will benefit both businesses and the local workforce. MOM will provide a fuller update later in the debate.",34,842,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00842
2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"From now till 2020, workforce growth will be around 1% to 2% per year. This is significantly less than in the past. From 2010-2020, we are looking at 1% to 2% growth. Compared to the previous decades, you will see very clearly that workforce growth will slow significantly in this decade. Having said that, we think that it is a more sustainable pace going forward. We appreciate businesses' efforts to make adjustments and the economic agencies will continue providing strong support through various schemes and programmes.",35,843,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00843
2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"While managing foreign workforce flows to complement the local workforce, it is also important that we carefully manage immigration flows.

They came as sojourners, with no intention to stay. But slowly this changed. They brought their families over, or formed families here. They built hospitals, schools, mosques, temples and churches for their communities. They brought their own cultures and traditions, interacted with one another, and wove these strands together into a rich and diverse tapestry. Over time, out of their shared experience grew a Singaporean identity, a shared sense of being rooted in Singapore.” And I end the quote.",48,856,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00856

The SNI is about harnessing the full power and potential of digital and smart technologies to create a whole new dimension in jobs and business opportunities. I also have the impression that SNI is also about planning strategically about our future technology infrastructure needs. We have seen how today we are able to get many things done without even moving out of our seats in the office, or at home. But there are areas we need to look into. Allow me to share one example where a doctor remarked that he finds there is just too much to pick up − he shared with me − and navigating the digital maze is just too onerous. The thought that crossed my mind then if a professional finds it difficult, then what about the elderly in our community, especially those with low literacy?",1,888,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00888

2018-03-01-T-009,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David,The development of the Smart Nation initiative requires a pool of talent with bold vision and strong technical competencies.

2018-03-01-T-009,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David,"The creation of a talent pipeline takes time and we have to put in place a robust ecosystem that supports the training, development, and deployment of these talents.

2018-03-01-T-009,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Recently, a second outage hit SingPass and CogPass.

2018-03-01-T-009,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Chairman, we need a concerted and sustained effort to conceptualise, build and manage Smart Nation related projects. We should embark on Smart Nation as a new nation-building project. What that means is that we need a whole-of-Government approach, an all-talent-on-board drive. We have been hiring ICT professionals piecemeal from the private sector. Given the enormity and strategic importance of Smart Nation to Singapore, I suspect that we also need ICT talents who understand where we are and the legacy issues we may have and where we hope to get to. It is a Singaporean Smart Nation vision that we want to get to, one that is inclusive and beneficial to all in Singapore.",5,940,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00940

2018-03-01-T-009,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Mr Chairman, an e-registration plan for future election was unveiled last May. The Elections Department (ELD) said it will pilot a system that will scan the barcode on a voter's identity card to shorten the waiting time for voters at polling stations. As I understood from the news, the electronic system is only for registration. Voting will still be conducted using paper ballots with a pen.",1,942,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00942
2018-03-01-T-009,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Under section 42 of the Parliamentary Elections Act, which describes the manner of voting, subsection (2A)(b) states that ""the number, name and description of the voter, as stated in the copy of the register of electors, shall be called out"". With the proposed e-registration, the need to call out the voter's particulars would no longer be necessary.",2,943,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00943
2018-03-01-T-009,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"This archaic practice of calling out the voter's particulars, directed at the polling agents, makes sense only if the integrity of the registers of electors is in doubt. After contesting in three elections, I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the registers of electors to require a line-by-line checking by my polling agent on polling day.",3,944,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00944
2018-03-01-T-009,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The call-out can also be heard clearly in some polling stations due to the acoustics. Anyone with a mobile phone can secretly record the particulars of the voters as the names and NRICs are enunciated slowly. Some PAP polling agents would echo the particulars in an even louder voice, which is neither necessary nor provided for under the Elections Act.",4,945,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00945
2018-03-01-T-009,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Next, a new process to let registered voters to go to any counter in the polling station to get a ballot paper and to cast the vote into any available ballot box was also proposed last May. I welcome this change. The votes in the ballot boxes will be mixed in the counting stations so it makes no sense to require a voter to go to a particular line and to use a particular ballot box at the polling station.",5,946,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00946
2018-03-01-T-009,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"It is also about time to replace the antiquated voting booth which was in use for many elections. The existing booth allows four voters to vote simultaneously but, because of its A-frame design, it does not offer much privacy. It is also not very user-friendly for persons with disabilities.",6,947,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00947

2018-03-01-T-009,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Notwithstanding the latitude of the provision, the primary focus of CPIB was on reigning in corruption in Singapore or corrupt acts outside Singapore which have a detrimental effect within Singapore.",5,954,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00954
2018-03-01-T-009,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The international landscape, however, has evolved. Recognising that some countries are less adept at handling domestic corruption, the international community has sought to require countries to enact criminal provisions aimed at discouraging legal persons, meaning corporations and natural persons, from engaging in corrupt practices overseas, especially with respect to offering bribes to foreign government officers. Both the UN Convention against Corruption, of which Singapore is a signatory, and the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention mandate this. Under the UK Bribery Act, it is an offence for a UK company not to have taken reasonable steps to prevent the occurrence of bribery overseas.",6,955,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00955

2018-03-01-T-009,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Finally, I would like to revisit a point I made in my Parliamentary Question in February 2017 about introducing an offence for corporations that fail to prevent the commission of offences, such as bribery. The Government, in its reply then, felt there was no need to do so, having regard to the Singapore situation. I respectfully suggest that the Government should relook at this position, given the international dimension that I have outlined in my speech.",10,959,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00959

The Government should also review and enhance the requirements for whistle-blowing policies in companies.",6,965,2018-03-01-T-009-S-00965
2018-03-01-T-009,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"The Government should also consider enhancing the requirements of the independence of the board. Norwegian company law dictates that where a company has controlling shareholders, the independence of the board is principally intended to protect minority shareholders.

In fact, I often think we are speaking English today, because the last industrial revolution began in England, and spread to Europe. The beginning of every new technological shift is often characterised by an initial Gilded Age – an age when there is greater inequality and profits amassed by the few who get it and have access to the new means of production. It takes time for new skills to be commoditised, the means of value creation to be more widely disseminated, and then you get a larger middle class.

The employee has to take the trouble to submit a copy and potentially an extra form. The business has to process the paper copy and also store records properly.

If we did that, we can make two observations. The first is that the TFR has been below the replacement level of 2.1 for about 40 years. And the second is that it has stabilised at around 1.2 since 15 years ago. So, let me try and say a bit more about each one of those two observations.",3,1099,2018-03-01-T-009-S-01099

2018-03-01-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The 360 degree feedback, today it has been implemented quite broadly across senior officers. Public Service Division, in the next two, three years, will extend it to all senior officers. But 360 is largely a developmental tool − 360 feedback appraisal. So, I do not think it is useful to extend it to all public officers but, certainly, to senior officers who are leaders, who have to work with people around them − up, sideways, down − this is useful for them.",1,1114,2018-03-01-T-009-S-01114
2018-03-01-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But the issue is not really 360 feedback as a mechanism but to make sure that Public Service and also the individual agencies have a culture of wanting to do better, embracing change, prepare to be innovative and to have people who do this in the right spirit. That when there is big change, they try to support it or if they cannot support it, they get out of their way or if they have totally different ideas be able to voice them up, debate, come to a resolution and then support the direction forward. I think this is really about building that right organisation culture.",2,1115,2018-03-01-T-009-S-01115
2018-03-01-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, likewise, it is not really about whether you have internal QSM or not but whether the organisation believes in engaging its people and I do think − I agree with Mr Louis Ng –that all public agencies ought to engage their people. All public agencies today do conduct staff engagement surveys periodically. And in that process you do have to engage your people. So, this is very much encouraged.",3,1116,2018-03-01-T-009-S-01116

The Second Reading was 15 August 2016; I checked that this is the correct date. The petition was filed on the 10 August 2016, five days before Second Reading. So, if it had come to the House on the Second Reading, it would have been referred to the next Sitting. By then, it would have been moot because we would have already had the Second Reading debate.",6,1119,2018-03-01-T-009-S-01119
2018-03-01-T-009,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"And, therefore, if Members remember, a Motion was, therefore, tabled to refer the petition to Parliament as part of the Second Reading debate, instead of sending it to the Public Petitions Committee. And so, a general assent was called, everyone in the House agreed and we had a full debate. Mr Kok Heng Leun who filed the petition and Ms Sylvia Lim were also present. Ms Sylvia Lim had a full speech, many clarifications, long debate I remember and then also voted on the Bill. So, the process is transparent and open. I thought it is good to clarify this.",7,1120,2018-03-01-T-009-S-01120
2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Louis Ng asked whether the unpaid leave for unplanned emergencies can be legislated. In fact, legislation is always an option. We legislated paternity leave. But as Mr Seah Kian Peng pointed out, even with legislation, the utilisation is only 46%. When you consider that South Korea legislates paternity leave, in fact, of a much longer duration than we have, the utilisation is, if I am not mistaken, just about 2%.",1,1121,2018-03-01-T-009-S-01121
2018-03-01-T-009,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"So, the real question is not whether we can or we cannot legislate, the real question is why, even with legislation, utilisation is not always 100%. I think that has got to do with the fact that at workplaces people do not always feel that they can use their entitlements. And that also has got to do with culture, whether there is a comfort that there will be no push back from the employers, that performance appraisal is not impacted, that co-workers are not unhappy because you go away. These things do not happen overnight. They take time to change. What we have attempted to do is, when there is a new leave type, perhaps we start with a tripartite standard first. Let the employers who are ready and willing, come on board, and then expand this group. Because what you really need to do is to promote a new culture. This culture of support is harder to try and bring about, but it is the right thing to do.",2,1122,2018-03-01-T-009-S-01122

I understand from a NPTD survey that was commissioned in 2016 − the Marriage and Parenthood Survey − showed that 83% of young Singaporeans want to settle down. However, if you look slightly further down in the survey, it is a little bit more worrying because 59% of singles are not seriously dating and 41% have never dated seriously before. And of those not dating seriously, 42% prefer to leave dating to chance. It means if it comes along, it comes along.",1,1124,2018-03-01-T-009-S-01124

One of the focuses of our chairmanship year is to strengthen the collective resilience of ASEAN members. Based on this backdrop of recent incidents and events, it is clear that within consensus-based ASEAN, there are members with strong divergent views, both within ASEAN or with our dialogue partners. ASEAN will not only have to navigate fishes amongst its member states but also with external actors.

This has been compounded by technological innovation. We all know technology bridges physical distance. When we watch videos or read accounts of events that take place far from Singapore, it does not matter that they may be happening thousands of miles away. They have an effect on us intellectually, as well as emotionally, and shape our views on how Singapore should conduct itself on the international stage.

But despite our best plans, our overseas trips can often be thwarted by unforeseen circumstances that could range from natural disasters to terror attacks. These are beyond the control of any of us and it can create stress for Singaporeans overseas and even pose dangers to their lives. The affected Singaporeans would then require assistance and support and their families and friends back home will also be concerned with their status and well-being. We do not need to look far for past examples. Many Singaporeans who had made travel plans to Bali last December were unable to proceed due to Mount Agung's eruption.

The second set of issues is, as ASEAN Chairman, how do we strengthen ASEAN’s unity, centrality and value proposition? And value proposition not just for outsiders but including our own people. The third political issue is that Singapore is an open multi-racial, multi-religious city-state, a sovereign country in the heart of Southeast Asia. How do we protect our unique identity, our domestic unity and our sovereignty from the inevitable foreign influence, and especially from the primordial pulls of ancestry, race, language and religion?

I am quoting him and we will convey the exact words in Chinese words to the media later on. In fact, this is own our longstanding belief. We have always believed that a successful China, a stable China, is good for our region. The rise of China and the elevation of hundreds of millions of people from abject poverty to middle class is the biggest story of our lifetime. And, as Mr Low said yesterday, as people with Chinese ancestry at a cultural level and emotional level, we must take pride and joy in that achievement. But we are also aware that we are not Chinese citizens and Singapore is the only political entity, the only state in the world, where Chinese are a majority, but we are not under the Communist Party of China.",17,1303,2018-03-01-T-010-S-01303

In fact, surprisingly, Singapore has been the largest foreign investor in China since 2013. Of course, our role will have to evolve because, unlike the past two and a half decades when we were investing and we were moving concepts and ideas into China, today China has become a net exporter of capital and technology.

After all we are two sovereign states with very different national circumstances. So, we must expect differences in perspectives, and we must not get flustered even when pressured. This is to be expected. This is almost par for the course in international relations because you cannot expect two countries’ interests to be completely identical. It is no secret, I mean we’ve had some bumps along the way, but I would say these episodes over the last two and a half years have helped both sides to understand each other’s position better.

The RSAF was able to work seamlessly with their American counterparts because of the regular training between both sides.

After 50 years, we have taken it for granted that there is no war in Southeast Asia, that we transact with each other, have mutual interdependence, investments, trade.

Singapore’s vote was based on a key principle of Singapore’s foreign policy, which is the promotion of a rules-based global community, governed by the rule of international law, including abiding by UN Security Council Resolutions and the peaceful resolution of disputes. We voted in favour of the resolution as it reaffirms previous UN resolutions, rejects any decisions or actions which purport to alter the character and status of Jerusalem, and calls for all States to comply with existing UN Security Council resolutions on Jerusalem. Before this, we had also voted in favour of UN General Assembly Resolution 37/123C in 1982, which deplored the relocation of diplomatic missions to Jerusalem, which was a violation of UNSC resolution 478 (1980).
