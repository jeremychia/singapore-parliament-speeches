2018-07-11-T-001,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the wage growth is moving in tandem with productivity gains; (b) whether the sectoral wage growth is commensurate with sectoral productivity gains; (c) which sectors are productivity laggards; and (d) whether the targeted help provided has led to productivity and wage gains.,1,1,2018-07-11-T-001-S-00001
2018-07-11-T-001,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Over the long term, real wage growth should track productivity growth in order to be sustainable. This is because if real wage growth outstrips productivity growth for an extended period, businesses will be at risk of losing their competitiveness and potentially be forced to scale back or close their operations.",1,2,2018-07-11-T-001-S-00002
2018-07-11-T-001,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Over the past two decades, real wages have grown broadly in tandem with productivity at the overall economy level. Specifically, from 2001 to 2017, real wages for resident workers grew by 1.5% per annum on the back of productivity growth of 2.1% per annum.",2,3,2018-07-11-T-001-S-00003
2018-07-11-T-001,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"In recent years, however, real wage growth has outstripped productivity growth. From 2011 to 2017, real wages for resident workers rose by 1.9% per annum, while productivity grew by only 1.1% per annum over the same period. However, there were differences across sectors.",3,4,2018-07-11-T-001-S-00004
2018-07-11-T-001,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"In particular, domestically-oriented sectors like Construction and Other Services Industries saw real wages rise faster than productivity between 2011 and 2017. This was, in part, due to labour market tightness, which had led to upward pressures on wages and also weak or negative productivity growth in these sectors. Meanwhile, even though the sluggish global economic environment had weighed on the productivity performance of outward-oriented sectors over this period, real wage growth in these sectors was generally still supported by positive productivity growth. Indeed, in sectors, such as Manufacturing, Wholesale Trade and Finance & Insurance, real wages rose in tandem with productivity on the back of their relatively strong productivity performance. However, in other sectors, such as Transportation & Storage and Accommodation, real wage growth exceeded productivity growth.",4,5,2018-07-11-T-001-S-00005
2018-07-11-T-001,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Against this backdrop, it is crucial that we press on with our productivity drive in order to maintain our competitiveness globally, while enabling continued improvement of Singaporeans' wages and living standards. In this regard, we are taking a targeted, sector-specific approach to raising productivity through the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs). For example, under the Hotel ITM, the Singapore Tourism Board and Singapore Hotel Association have launched the Hotel Innovation Challenge to crowd-source innovative technologies that can improve hotels’ productivity and enhance the guest experience, such as facial recognition check-in.",5,6,2018-07-11-T-001-S-00006
2018-07-11-T-001,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"The Government has also provided assistance to firms through schemes designed to help them enhance their capability and productivity. These schemes have seen some early signs of success. For example, firms that tapped on the Capability Development Grant (CDG) managed by Enterprise Singapore for capability improvement projects between 2005 and 2012 experienced a 9.3% increase in revenue, on average, over time. Productivity improvement projects had the largest impact, raising firms' revenue by 12.4%, compared to 7.8% for technology innovation projects and an average of 6.7% for the remaining project areas. Similarly, firms that tapped on the SMEs Go Digital programme, formerly known as iSPRINT, for IT solutions to automate their business functions between 2010 and 2013 experienced a 3.1% increase in their revenue on average over time.",6,7,2018-07-11-T-001-S-00007
2018-07-11-T-001,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Maintaining a close partnership with industry and unions is also important in order for businesses and their workers to benefit from productivity improvements. For example, NTUC has partnered various companies on measures that raise their productivity and competitiveness. The resultant productivity gains are then shared with the workers in these companies, such as through allowances or payments. As a specific example, the Inclusive Growth Programme (IGP) administered by e2i co-funds companies to embark on productivity improvement projects. The companies are, in turn, required to share the productivity gains with their workers through a rise in wages.",7,8,2018-07-11-T-001-S-00008
2018-07-11-T-001,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),The Government is committed to continue to work with businesses and the unions to help businesses improve their productivity and ensure that the productivity gains are shared with workers through higher wages.,8,9,2018-07-11-T-001-S-00009
2018-07-11-T-001,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Speaker, I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for the answer. I am glad to know that the real wage growth is 1.9% and productivity growth is 1.1%. There is a distinct gap there.",1,10,2018-07-11-T-001-S-00010
2018-07-11-T-001,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I would just like to ask a couple of supplementary questions. First, in terms of MTI, can the Senior Minister of State share a bit more about the productivity or wage growth outlook over the next few years? Yesterday, I had asked about the concerns if interest rates were to go up over the next year or so and what it would mean for wage growth outlook from MTI's perspective.",2,11,2018-07-11-T-001-S-00011
2018-07-11-T-001,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The second question is about concerns on the ground about wage stagnation. As the Senior Minister of State mentioned, the outlook for wage growth is that it would not be broad-based growth. How do you allay some of the wage stagnation concerns for specific sectors? As what the Senior Minister of State had mentioned, some sectors are affected more than others.",3,12,2018-07-11-T-001-S-00012
2018-07-11-T-001,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his questions. I think the key is that wage growth will not be uniform across all sectors. Fundamental to driving sustainable wage growth would be to improve productivity. It is one of the important tenets of the ITMs. We want to help our companies to better increase productivity by leveraging on technology such that the companies can make better profit margins while controlling their costs from various pressures. An example of how we can help some of these wage gains translate to benefits from the workers' wages would be in programmes like the IGPs.",1,13,2018-07-11-T-001-S-00013
2018-07-11-T-001,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"But importantly, you also need to put in place a lot of framework to help our workers re-skill and upskill so that they can be productive.",2,14,2018-07-11-T-001-S-00014
2018-07-11-T-001,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Several initiatives have already been in play. First, there is a skills framework. Individual workers can leverage on this skills framework to continue to upskill themselves, working with the employers.",3,15,2018-07-11-T-001-S-00015
2018-07-11-T-001,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"The other scheme which the Government has put forth is the WorkPro Job Redesign grant. The grant provides up to 3,000 incentives to help companies create physically easier, safer and smarter jobs, especially for the older workers aged above 50. Because this is the group where there is probably genuine concern about wage stagnation and also job prospects. By using such schemes and grants, we can encourage companies to help level up the workers. And, in turn, companies can benefit from having more experienced workers, especially higher productivity ones.",4,16,2018-07-11-T-001-S-00016
2018-07-11-T-001,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Finally, there is also the scheme called the Progressive Wage Model, especially in certain sectors which are traditionally low-wage. This model is a productivity-based wage progressive pathway that helps to increase the wages of workers through upgrading skills and improving productivity. So far, this has been implemented in three sectors  the cleaning, security and landscape sectors.",5,17,2018-07-11-T-001-S-00017
2018-07-11-T-001,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,We do see that there is a need to do more for other sectors. Minister of State for Manpower Sam Tan mentioned during his COS speech this year that MOM is ready to support tripartite partners to develop and adopt the Progressive Wage Model voluntarily for other sectors. NTUC has announced recently that the Labour Movement has begun conducting surveys with F&B workers as part of early efforts to see if this can be included in the Progressive Wage Model as well.,6,18,2018-07-11-T-001-S-00018
2018-07-11-T-001,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"So, there are multiple approaches but, fundamentally, they all hinge on raising the productivity of our workers.",7,19,2018-07-11-T-001-S-00019
2018-07-11-T-001,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, I just want to follow up quickly for my question about MTI's real wage growth outlook by sector. Which sectors does the Senior Minister of State think will be affected most in the next three to five years?",1,20,2018-07-11-T-001-S-00020
2018-07-11-T-001,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"We do see that certain sectors would have a lot more chances for manpower growth in terms of number of jobs created. The wages in these growth sectors will probably be a lot more competitive as well. One of the sectors that we believe to be a very good attractive sector that can take in a lot of people with good jobs and good pay would be in the area of wholesale trade, which is very diverse. It includes sectors that deal with commodity trading, but also trading in many other areas. For example, in the logistics sector, which is also a key sector in this group.",1,21,2018-07-11-T-001-S-00021
2018-07-11-T-001,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"The other growth sector would be in the manufacturing space. For example, precision engineering and the semi-conductor industry are still continuing to do well. So, these are the areas in which I think workers would continue to see specific gains.",2,22,2018-07-11-T-001-S-00022
2018-07-11-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,asked the Minister for National Development with the conclusion of public consultation on short-term home rentals (a) what are the main feedback and concerns provided by the public during the consultation exercise; (b) when will new regulations be presented to Parliament for debate; (c) how many illegal rentals have there been so far; and (d) how does the Ministry intend to Police the current short-term rental websites before the laws are put in place.,1,23,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00023
2018-07-11-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked the Minister for National Development in light of concerns from some condominium owners on the further relaxation on short-term leases (a) whether the Ministry will consider getting 100% approval from current property owners in each condominium before short-term leases like Airbnb can be allowed; (b) whether the potential impact of short-term leases on the hospitality industry has been considered; and (c) how is the Ministry dealing with illegal leasing of property currently listed on websites like Airbnb.,1,24,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00024
2018-07-11-T-002,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many Airbnb cases have been reported in HDB units and private residential units respectively in the past three years; and (b) what is the typical timeframe for investigation to complete after a case has been reported.,1,25,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00025
2018-07-11-T-002,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Mr Speaker, with your permission, I would like to take Question Nos 2, 3 and 4 together, please.",1,26,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00026
2018-07-11-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,27,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00027
2018-07-11-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sir, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) conducted a public consultation exercise on short-term accommodation (STA) from 16 April to 31 May 2018.",1,28,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00028
2018-07-11-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Many respondents supported the need for regulations on STA, given that STA can cause negative externalities to other residents. Key concerns raised include safety, security and privacy, as well as abuse of common property. Many also supported regulating STA platform operators, for example, through a licensing framework.",2,29,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00029
2018-07-11-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,One of the proposals was to require the Management Corporation of a strata-titled residential development to obtain the support of at least 80% of the share value in the development before STA can be permitted in any residential unit. The intent is to give homeowners a say in whether or not to allow STA in their development.,3,30,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00030
2018-07-11-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"There was mixed response to this proposal. Some respondents felt that an 80% threshold would be unfair to the minority who do not support STA, but have to accept the presence of STA guests in their developments. On the other hand, there were some who felt that an 80% threshold was too high and that it would be difficult to obtain sufficient votes in support of STA among homeowners. URA is carefully studying all the feedback that we have received and we will do so before deciding on how to take this issue forward, including how to structure the final regulatory approach and whether there is a need for any legislative amendments.",4,31,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00031
2018-07-11-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked about the impact of legalising STA on the hospitality industry. Indeed, this is something we had considered very carefully. The proposed regulatory framework for STA includes controls which are similar to those imposed on the hospitality industry. For example, under our proposed safeguards, STA hosts must collect and record the personal details of their guests and comply with fire safety regulations like the provision of fire extinguishers in their units. We have also proposed licensing platform operators, so that they can also help to ensure that STA activities do not cause problems for other residents. The intent is to provide a more level playing field between the STA sector and the hospitality industry.",5,32,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00032
2018-07-11-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As I have mentioned, these are proposals that we had put out; we have done one round of consultation, received feedback, there are mixed views. So, URA is studying the matter very carefully to see what is the best way forward. Even as we do so, even as we consider the deliberations very carefully, I would emphasise that the minimum stay duration of three consecutive months for private residential properties still applies. URA will take enforcement action against those who breach this rule.",6,33,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00033
2018-07-11-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Alex Yam and Mr Melvin Yong asked about the number of such cases. From 2015 to 2017, URA received 1,808 reports of unauthorised STA in private residential units. In the same period, HDB received 390 reports of STA in HDB flats.",7,34,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00034
2018-07-11-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The time taken by URA and HDB to investigate a report of unauthorised STA depends on the circumstances of each case. Conducting ground inspections and interviews to obtain evidence of an offence can take up to several months in some instances. However, if the party making the report is able to provide details and documentary evidence of the suspected offence, investigations can be completed more expeditiously.",8,35,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00035
2018-07-11-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Speaker, Sir, I have four supplementary questions. The impact on the hospitality sector that I am looking at is, with the liberalisation of short-term leases, does the Minister think that it is unfair to those who had invested in the hospitality sector? They would have invested in the setting up, for example, of hotels and so on.",1,36,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00036
2018-07-11-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"The second question is, why is it 80%? Condominium owners, a lot of them who buy and want to stay in these units themselves, they will be adversely affected. I would think that for existing condominiums, it should be 100%.",2,37,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00037
2018-07-11-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"The third question, a lot of the residents think that if we allow short-term leases, it would drive up the rental costs and, hence, it would have a chain-effect and drive up the cost of living. So, what is MND's take on this?",3,38,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00038
2018-07-11-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"And, last, if we allow short-term leases, it would make investment in a property look more attractive and the returns more attractive and, hence, it would drive up property prices. On one hand, you have just implemented a round of cooling measures that is very unpopular; and on the other hand, you wish to liberalise short-term lease.",4,39,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00039
2018-07-11-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, I will take the questions in turn. On the first point on the hospitality sector, our approach to this has to be one that is based on fair competition. It is not possible to say, ""Let's block any new entrants into the hospitality sector"", simply on the basis that the existing incumbents have put in investments. This is an open market; new entrants can come in but the regulations must be fair and the industry must be regulated on a level playing field. That is the intent of what we have proposed.",1,40,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00040
2018-07-11-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the thresholds, as I have said, there were mixed views from the consultations, so, we are going to review what is the right way forward and what is the best way to ensure that all property owners do have a say in deciding on the appropriate use of their development.",2,41,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00041
2018-07-11-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the impact on rental and the property market, the Member's views are well-taken. We have seen this and we have studied this phenomenon in other property markets as well where, indeed, short-term accommodations have put upward pressure on rentals and on property prices. We are mindful that this may have an impact and that is why, as I have said earlier, we are not rushing to make changes. We are studying the matter very carefully. If and when we choose to do so, we will make sure that there are, indeed, appropriate safeguards.",3,42,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00042
2018-07-11-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Mr Speaker, just two clarifications to seek from the Minister. The hon Member Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and I had raised the question on short-term lease websites that are currently operating. Are there any plans to police them, or to regulate them before the new regulations come into place? The second, as the Minister has mentioned earlier, the number of cases under URA and HDB, they come close to about 2,200 cases. Of these reports, how many have actually proceeded to prosecution?",1,43,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00043
2018-07-11-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, on the websites and the ads that you see on the websites by STA operators, these, in and of themselves, do not necessarily contravene the rules because it is a posting of a place that is available for rental. They do not indicate timeframe. The postings themselves may not necessarily contravene the rules and, even if we were to block the websites, I am sure there will be different ways in which these advertisements can be put up. So, I think the key is not so much the postings or the websites, but the actual STA activities that are undertaken. And if URA knows of any such activities, they will take follow-up and enforcement action.",1,44,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00044
2018-07-11-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I mentioned a number of cases. For all of them, enforcement notices will be issued. A good majority of them will then stop and immediately comply with the enforcement notice. But should there be cases that continue or there are egregious cases, then, indeed, URA will work with AGC on prosecution. There has already been one and we will see if there are others, if they were to come in the subsequent months.",2,45,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00045
2018-07-11-T-002,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"I thank the Minister for the answer. In fact, I think out of the 1,000-over cases, a significant number will be from my constituency. I just did a quick check on one of the websites  I tried to put in a five-day request and it turns out that there are 196 listings just within a small area in Novena and Orchard.",1,46,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00046
2018-07-11-T-002,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"I think a common complaint from my residents is that URA is taking too long to investigate the complaints and to take enforcement actions to stop the illegal short-term home rentals. Residents cannot quite understand why it is taking so long because they have pictures of people coming in buses and in Grab cars every two, three days. In fact, during my house visits, they can even tell me which are the units. When I go and knock on the doors, yes, indeed, sometimes, different residents come to talk to me. So, to them, I think the evidence is quite clear and perhaps the investigations and enforcement action can be more expeditious. I hope the Minister can clarify on this.",2,47,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00047
2018-07-11-T-002,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his feedback. I will ask URA to make sure that they have sufficient resources to carry out the enforcement and make sure that this is done expeditiously.",1,48,2018-07-11-T-002-S-00048
2018-07-11-T-003,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"asked the Minister for Education how many young people leave the education system after their PSLE and the ""N"" and ""O"" level attainment each year in the past three years and whether the Ministry is tracking their employment and continuing education and training prospects.",1,49,2018-07-11-T-003-S-00049
2018-07-11-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Over the years, MOE has implemented many measures to reduce dropouts post-PSLE. These include different education streams to cater to students with different paces of learning at that age, early interventions at lower Primary to help students keep up, and specialised schools, namely Northlight School and Assumption Pathway School, to cater to students who did not qualify for Secondary school courses after PSLE. With all these measures, the proportion of Primary 1 (P1) cohorts who did not progress to Secondary education is practically 0%.",1,50,2018-07-11-T-003-S-00050
2018-07-11-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"At the Secondary school level, less than 1% of the P1 cohorts did not complete Secondary education, compared to 2% 10 years ago. So, it has been halved. The percentage of P1 cohorts that progresses to post-Secondary education has increased from 90% 10 years ago, to 97% now. So, the school dropout numbers that the Member is asking about is a very small proportion of every cohort. And this is a result of our relentless efforts, together with our education partners, over the years.",2,51,2018-07-11-T-003-S-00051
2018-07-11-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"For those who still drop out of school, our teachers actively reach out to them. But the reasons for dropping out are often complex and we have to tap on the expertise and networks of agencies, such as MSF, MHA, self-help groups, family service centres and Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs). For example, VWOs will engage the out-of-school youths and their families, and encourage them to participate in group activities to support their return to school and transit to the next stage of education.",3,52,2018-07-11-T-003-S-00052
2018-07-11-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"As for students who entered the workforce and face employment difficulties, they can tap on support from their alma mater, Workforce Singapore, the CDCs, NTUC's e2i or the self-help groups. We are also expanding the range of opportunities for upgrading and lifelong learning.",4,53,2018-07-11-T-003-S-00053
2018-07-11-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"MOE does not track students who drop out of schools statistically and longitudinally as a group because different agencies and organisations do come in to provide support at different stages of a person’s life. Further, there is always a dynamic churn within the population  students who drop out after ""O"" or ""N"" levels often move on to upgrade and hold good and stable jobs, while well-educated Singaporeans can encounter difficult patches due to industry downturns.",5,54,2018-07-11-T-003-S-00054
2018-07-11-T-003,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Minister. I just have one supplementary question. Because there is now a nationwide SkillsFuture framework in place that provides for comprehensive and continuous education, dropouts might feel that they have no stakeholding in this framework, mainly because they have been kind of labelled as ""failures"" and are not seen as learners anymore. They might be considered as discouraged learners, so to speak. Is there any scope or any specific programmes within SkillsFuture that can reach out to these groups?",1,55,2018-07-11-T-003-S-00055
2018-07-11-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"First, we should really take a firm stand that we should never regard them as failures. Dropping out of school is sometimes owing to family circumstances or personal circumstances beyond their control. Today, our formal education system, whether it is Institute of Technical Education, polytechnic, university, if you drop out for some reason, it will welcome you back.",1,56,2018-07-11-T-003-S-00056
2018-07-11-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The Member may notice that, last week, I announced that we will now also take into account their working experience when we assess re-admission. And that, I think, is a very clear signal  “You never drop out. It’s lifelong learning and you are always welcome to come back. And the more you work and treat your work seriously, you actually improve your credentials.""",2,57,2018-07-11-T-003-S-00057
2018-07-11-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"That is the formal education system. But beyond that, for the lifelong learning system, we have training providers from the private sector, industry partners, as well as our Institute of Higher Learnings, all rolling out new shorter courses that people can enrol for. For these courses, one of the principles in their design is open accessibility. You should not have to demonstrate that you have achieved certain academic grades in order to enrol for a lifelong learning programme. So long as you have the heart, the determination to do it, it should welcome you and it is also subsidised.",3,58,2018-07-11-T-003-S-00058

2018-07-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Mr Speaker, as to Mr Leon Perera's question on the Jurong Lake District, we have discussed this earlier this week. As mentioned, we have not received official notification from the Malaysian government on their position regarding the High-Speed Rail (HSR) Project. In the event there are changes in the status of the HSR, we will study the implications carefully. While there may be a need for some adjustments, we do not expect major changes to the overall plans for the Jurong Lake District.",1,61,2018-07-11-T-004-S-00061
2018-07-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"And as I mentioned during the Sitting on 9 July 2018, the plans for the Jurong Lake District were formulated in 2008, well before the HSR project came about. The plans include new commercial and residential developments, upgrading of Jurong Lake Gardens and the building of a transport hub connecting the various MRT lines. These plans are still relevant today and we will proceed with the implementation of the plans when ready.",2,62,2018-07-11-T-004-S-00062
2018-07-11-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Competition and Consumer Commission (CCCS) will consider mandating that companies planning a merger or acquisition that will substantially change the distribution of market share in any industry seek prior approval from the CCCS before the deal is publicly announced to avoid market confusion and disruption to jobs that may arise if a deal needs to be unwound after an announcement is made.,1,63,2018-07-11-T-005-S-00063

2018-07-11-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan Wu Meng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Under this regime, there is no mandatory requirement for merger parties to notify their merger situations to the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS). Instead, merger parties conduct a self-assessment and, if they are of the view that their merger may give rise to potential competition concerns, they may apply to CCCS for a formal decision on whether their merger would infringe the Competition Act. Where merger parties have doubts on novel or complex issues relating to their merger, they may also approach CCCS for advice on a confidential basis.",2,65,2018-07-11-T-005-S-00065
2018-07-11-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan Wu Meng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"On the other hand, under a mandatory notification regime, all merging parties that cross pre-determined notification thresholds have to notify the competition authority, regardless of whether there are competition issues or not. This imposes compliance costs on businesses and may impede commonplace market activities. It also requires a larger commitment on the competition authority’s resources to ensure that all mergers that cross the notification thresholds are duly notified and to review these mergers.",3,66,2018-07-11-T-005-S-00066
2018-07-11-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan Wu Meng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"A voluntary notification regime thus strikes a balance between regulating competition and being pro-business. CCCS is allowed to more efficiently utilise its resources to proactively scan for un-notified mergers that may give rise to competition concerns and look into such problematic mergers, instead of regulating and reviewing merger notifications under a mandatory notification regime.",4,67,2018-07-11-T-005-S-00067

CCCS may also impose interim measures to protect public interest, where urgent action is required to prevent market confusion and job disruption, while it completes its investigations.",5,68,2018-07-11-T-005-S-00068
2018-07-11-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for his answer. Just two supplementary questions. Firstly, would the Senior Parliamentary Secretary acknowledge that there are risks in the voluntary notification system vis-a-vis a mandatory one, in the sense that, if a merger or an acquisition is found to be illegal after the fact, there could be costs borne by employees, customers and even the wider society for that merger or acquisition to be unwound or to be mitigated after the fact. For example, employees could be let go, brands could be dissolved or removed, products could be withdrawn. It may be very difficult, if not impossible, to make restitution for all those events after the fact.",1,69,2018-07-11-T-005-S-00069
2018-07-11-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"I think there was a recent case where some of these factors came into play. It is not my intention to talk about the specific case I know of that is on-going, but I am really just querying the general principle. How do we manage those downside costs and risks? Particularly, in light of the fact that while there are some jurisdictions that have voluntary notification. The US and the EU, I believe, have mandatory notification beyond certain thresholds. The US has the Hart-Scott-Rodino pre-merger notification requirement above the threshold of about $76 million, which is reviewed regularly and inflation-adjusted —",2,70,2018-07-11-T-005-S-00070
2018-07-11-T-005,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Can we go to the question, please?",1,71,2018-07-11-T-005-S-00071
2018-07-11-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Yes. And so, in the EU, there is a similar one. The second question that I have is in regard to compliance cost. I do recognise what the Senior Parliamentary Secretary said on compliance cost, that we do not want to ""over egg the pudding"" and increase compliance cost unnecessarily. But would that not really go to the question of thresholds? You can set a dollar threshold and the market share change threshold high enough so that the vast majority of M&A would not be affected. So, the question of compliance cost, could it not be addressed through a mandatory notification regime which has sufficiently high thresholds?",1,72,2018-07-11-T-005-S-00072
2018-07-11-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"I thank the Member for his two supplementary questions which actually speak to a single question that underpins what he raised. He is basically asking will a mandatory notification system be able to address situations where the prospective merging parties, for whatever reasons, do not make known the merger in advance.",1,73,2018-07-11-T-005-S-00073
2018-07-11-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"We have mentioned that Singapore's voluntary notification regime is similar to that in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. And, indeed, there are other jurisdictions that have a mandatory merger notification regime, such as the EU, Vietnam, the Philippines and the United States; which include the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, which the Member has raised.",2,74,2018-07-11-T-005-S-00074
2018-07-11-T-005,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"But even in these jurisdictions where there is mandatory notification, the same situation can arise where companies that are determined to implement an anti-competitive merger still choose to go ahead without notifying the competition authorities. So, in summary, it is important, generally speaking, that any competition commission has the ability to address unnotified mergers that are found or determined to be anti-competitive. And our regime, which follows elements from other jurisdictions, addresses that.",3,75,2018-07-11-T-005-S-00075
2018-07-11-T-006,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for National Development what are the eligibility conditions for divorcees with shared care and control of their children to purchase a subsidised HDB flat.,1,76,2018-07-11-T-006-S-00076

2018-07-11-T-006,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for National Development),"As any individual can only be listed in one HDB flat application, we require parents with shared care and control to seek their ex-spouse's agreement before listing the child in a flat application. This ensures fairness to both parties, as HDB is not in a position to determine which parent should exercise the right to list the child. Nonetheless, those who cannot reach an agreement with their ex-spouse may approach HDB to discuss their options.",2,78,2018-07-11-T-006-S-00078
2018-07-11-T-006,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the reply. I have two clarifications. I understand that the shared care and control is actually a Court ruling so that the children following a divorce will be able to live with both parties. But then, our housing policies now penalise them for having this shared care and control, instead of sole care and control. I am wondering if MND can work with the Courts so that we can align our policies so that the judgment that is obtained can actually be enforced and be feasible.",1,79,2018-07-11-T-006-S-00079
2018-07-11-T-006,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The second clarification is, HDB had initially said that they have removed the time bar as they realised that it caused friction between both parties because they cannot decide on who will get the subsidised housing. They also said they had removed the time bar in the best interest of the children involved in the divorce. But now that we are back to the ex-spousal consent on who can list the children as occupiers, are we not back to square one again? And would the Senior Parliamentary Secretary agree that this would again lead to friction between both parties, because they now have to again decide on who will get the subsidised housing?",2,80,2018-07-11-T-006-S-00080
2018-07-11-T-006,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for his questions. Time bar aside, divorced couples with shared care and control of their child, as I have mentioned, are still required to obtain their ex-spouse's written agreement before they apply for a flat. This is because both parents have equal rights to buy a flat with their child and HDB is not in a position to determine which parent should exercise the right. This is also to be consistent and fair to all HDB flat owners and households, where each person can only be listed in one HDB flat. But for those who face challenges in reaching an agreement, HDB will exercise flexibility, if they face financial difficulties or lack family support. We will ensure that parents with shared care and control have options to provide housing for themselves and their children.",1,81,2018-07-11-T-006-S-00081
2018-07-11-T-006,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"So, we recognise that each of the family's circumstances are different and it is best to take an approach where flexibility can be exercised to meet the specific circumstances and needs.",2,82,2018-07-11-T-006-S-00082
2018-07-11-T-006,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Speaker, I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for her clarification. I would just like to take this opportunity to echo Mr Louis Ng's concerns on this matter. I am a practising divorce lawyer and this is a matter I see fairly commonly. Even if the order is not a shared order, even if it is share and control to one parent, there is always this disagreement and issues with regard to the housing arrangements because only one party can list and use the children's name.",1,83,2018-07-11-T-006-S-00083
2018-07-11-T-006,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I would just want to highlight and stress the difficulties that parties have. This becomes an issue of contention because they have difficulties arranging for their housing later, especially in shared care and control arrangements. Parties have difficulties resolving it in a divorce. So, it does not help in the resolution of the divorce, if we do not figure out how we can lay out plans that can help parties moving forward.",2,84,2018-07-11-T-006-S-00084
2018-07-11-T-006,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"There is already this housing guidance arrangement that is given to parties at divorce. They have to fill it up and sign it. From my experience and from anecdotal evidence given by clients who have gone through the process, depending on the officer, the advice given may not necessarily be as thorough and helpful. So, I believe that in circumstances where there is a divorce, it would be helpful if parties are given a very clear outcome, a very clear option that is available to them, especially at that stage before they actually go through the whole divorce process so that they can see how much loan they can take out, how much monies they have, what are their options. They have all these in broad terms but it does not really help because they just give rough figures or, sometimes, to the extent that they would not even have an indication of the housing loan eligibility because they do not have the divorce order yet. I think there is hesitance in fixing a certain amount before they actually know the full picture. To be fair to the parties, you really need to guide them along.",3,85,2018-07-11-T-006-S-00085
2018-07-11-T-006,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"So, one, I would suggest that you review the process in respect of housing guidance to help divorced parties; and, two, I would just echo Mr Louis Ng's point that we may need to review this position about making it an exception because the policy itself does not gel with the principle of a shared care and control arrangement. Because the parties are actually ordered to be able to allow the children to live with them. So, the idea is that, half the time, they are living with the father and half the time they are living with the mother. If they do not have proper housing —",4,86,2018-07-11-T-006-S-00086

I would just like to add that in situations where the settlement of the matrimonial flat and issues of custody and care and control have already been addressed by an interim judgment, for instance, HDB is prepared to consider requests to submit flat applications depending on the facts of the particular case. So, any parties undergoing a divorce may seek advice from HDB on their housing options.",2,90,2018-07-11-T-006-S-00090
2018-07-11-T-006,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Mr Speaker, without belabouring the point, I add my support to the hon Member Mr Louis Ng's suggestions. Does the Ministry work together with the Family Courts in terms of coming to a mutual set of guidelines? Because, in recent months, there have been more cases of shared care and control that I have seen and we also have cases that we have come across with limited tenure shared care and control. For example, a resident of mine was given shared care and control of the children with her spouse for only 10 months and she was told by the Courts that she needs to resolve her housing situation within these 10 months. This was quite distinct from all the other judgments, in terms of divorce cases that I have seen in the last decade or so.",1,91,2018-07-11-T-006-S-00091
2018-07-11-T-006,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"So, does the Ministry work closely with the Family Courts  advising and coming up with these guidelines, so that we do not have situations where the couple and the children end up suffering?",2,92,2018-07-11-T-006-S-00092
2018-07-11-T-006,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for his supplementary question.

Can I suggest that, at least, we waive this ex-spousal consent for children to be listed as occupiers, if the other party has moved on?

I mentioned in my speech earlier that over 70% of the students receive some form of financial help and this is different from the 90% subsidy that we give to ITE students.

2018-07-11-T-008,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Health),"From time-to-time, some centres may encounter short-term challenges in accessing transport services. For example, some centres may take more time to purchase and modify a van or to enter into arrangements with their preferred transport operators. When any centre faces transport difficulties, we encourage them to inform us and AIC will work with them to find alternative transport arrangements so that there is minimal impact on client placement.",3,110,2018-07-11-T-008-S-00110
2018-07-11-T-008,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Speaker, I thank the Senior Minister of State. Two questions. The first one is regarding the AIC's centralised transport service. In your view, is there any supply crunch right now in providing the specialised vans and going into the future where there is an extension of the eldercare centres?",1,111,2018-07-11-T-008-S-00111
2018-07-11-T-008,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The second question is with regard to the collaboration between AIC and the taxi operators and the private hire companies. Is the scope of the collaboration beyond just in terms of teaching the drivers how to handle wheelchair-bound commuters? Is it more than just that in terms of expanding the fleet, for example, into specialised vans and a more direct kind of collaboration between homes and the companies?",2,112,2018-07-11-T-008-S-00112
2018-07-11-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank Assoc Prof Daniel Goh for the supplementary questions. Based on our landscape scan, there are multiple transport options for centres which I have already elaborated on during my Parliament Question reply and that are assessed to be able to provide adequate transport capacity to meet our current demand. We have continually grown the capacity of specialised vans to meet the demand over the years. Even if the demand increases, centres can activate committed capacity under the AIC centralised transport service or other specialised transport operators or use private hire cars, such as GrabAssist and taxis, as an interim approach.",1,113,2018-07-11-T-008-S-00113
2018-07-11-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"My short answer is, we are able to meet the demand based on the current supply. In fact, we have some spare capacity, taking into account that our centralised transport service can ramp up the number of specialised vans to be made available.",2,114,2018-07-11-T-008-S-00114
2018-07-11-T-008,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"As to the Member's supplementary question on the collaboration between GrabAssist or with taxis, other than training the taxi drivers on how to handle such clients, if need be, should there be capacity for specialised vans that can be provided by these operators, I think we can also extend that collaboration to them as well.",3,115,2018-07-11-T-008-S-00115

2018-07-11-T-009,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Health),"Mr Speaker, tuberculosis (TB) is an air-borne infectious disease. One can be infected with TB through close and prolonged exposure to a person with active TB, such as household members, co-workers and classmates. When infected, most will develop latent TB. Persons with latent TB do not have symptoms and are not infectious. The elderly and persons who have weakened immune systems, such as those with severe medical conditions, are more likely to develop active TB. About one in 10 healthy persons with latent TB will progress to active TB at some point during their lifetime.",1,117,2018-07-11-T-009-S-00117

2018-07-11-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for his reply. I have two supplementary questions. First, earlier this year, MOH released an update that two in three new cases reported last year in 2017 were aged 50 and above and up to 30% of older residents in Singapore have latent TB. From the Senior Minister of State's earlier reply, about 10% of those with latent TB can possibly develop the active form. My first question is  with an ageing population, will the number of patients with active TB continue to increase further, with the growing numbers? If so, are there plans to have more targeted public education, public awareness, for this group of older Singaporeans to maybe make them more aware about what signs to look out for, what precautions to take? That is my first question.",1,126,2018-07-11-T-009-S-00126
2018-07-11-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"My second question is  last year, there was a case reported – a staff member at a preschool in Clementi was diagnosed with active TB and then subsequent screening found that 39 children and four other staff members were diagnosed with latent TB. Are there any plans to screen staff, specifically, working at preschool centres to ensure better protection for our preschool children?",2,127,2018-07-11-T-009-S-00127
2018-07-11-T-009,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I thank Mr Melvin Yong for the two supplementary questions. Mr Melvin Yong is right to say that the prevalence of latent TB amongst the elderly Singaporeans is quite high, in the region of about 30%. The reason for that is because TB was endemic in Singapore and was very common until the 1970s. As a result, it is not unexpected to see the prevalence of latent TB to be higher within the older age group.",1,128,2018-07-11-T-009-S-00128
2018-07-11-T-009,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"However, he is also right to say that not all patients with latent TB will develop active TB eventually. Five percent of those who acquired latent TB may get active TB within the first two years and another 5% may develop active TB within their lifetime. Based on these statistics, it is probably not necessary and not cost-effective to do screening or treatment of all patients with latent TB.",2,129,2018-07-11-T-009-S-00129
2018-07-11-T-009,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"With regard to public education, yes, we have put up information on TB on our MOH websites and through press releases. In addition to that, the Health Promotion Board also runs a special social hygiene campaign to promote good hygiene practices and also to help prevent the spread of infectious diseases. During our annual World TB Day, TBCU also holds exhibitions at Tan Tock Seng Hospital to educate the public on TB. We will step up efforts on public education and we will also encourage the elderly to visit some of these exhibitions so that they are aware of the symptoms and what to look out for in case they do develop active TB.",3,130,2018-07-11-T-009-S-00130
2018-07-11-T-009,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"With regard to the Member's second question on the screening of employees in preschools, under the Childcare Centres Regulations, all new staff members are required to undergo a medical check-up which includes a chest X-ray and be certified free from active TB by a registered medical practitioner before they can start work in a preschool centre. Centres are also advised to conduct daily health checks on their staff members and to monitor for persistent cough amongst staff members.",4,131,2018-07-11-T-009-S-00131
2018-07-11-T-009,,,"But I must caution that, sometimes, it can be difficult to diagnose TB because many of us do suffer from a bout of cough in one way or another throughout our lifetime and, unless the cough becomes persistent, then these employees should be encouraged to approach the medical practitioner to screen for active TB. Once the staff are diagnosed to have active TB, of course, they will not be permitted to return to work until they have been cleared to be fit for work by the medical practitioner.",1,132,2018-07-11-T-009-S-00132

MPD is also responsible for implementing measures to mitigate the impact of their development works on wildlife in the area.",1,134,2018-07-11-T-010-S-00134
2018-07-11-T-010,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for National Development),"MPD has since undertaken a number of measures to reduce roadkill in the area. As the Member has mentioned, hoardings have been installed around the development areas on Mandai Lake Road. MPD, the relevant Government agencies and the nature community are currently discussing the need for additional hoardings. Where it is ascertained that additional hoardings will protect wildlife, the relevant Government agencies will work with MPD to determine the location of these hoardings. Other measures that MPD has put in place include a rope bridge to help arboreal animals cross the road safely, and vehicle speed reduction measures, such as warning signs, speed bumps and a lowered speed limit.",2,135,2018-07-11-T-010-S-00135

2018-07-11-T-010,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the reply. Can I check whether an eco-link was part of the proposed mitigation measures for this Mandai development and, if so, why was it not done? Secondly, what oversight does MND have over this construction that is going on in the Mandai area in terms of checking whether these proposed mitigation measures are done? And third, are there any penalties imposed on the developer if the proposed mitigation measures are not carried out?",1,137,2018-07-11-T-010-S-00137
2018-07-11-T-010,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for his questions. Following planning approval, MPD implements an Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan (EMMP) to ensure that mitigation measures are being carried out during the Mandai Rejuvenation Project's development and operations.

2018-07-11-T-011,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked the Minister for Transport if he will provide an update on whether evening ERP is still required to manage traffic congestion along the CTE.,1,142,2018-07-11-T-011-S-00142
2018-07-11-T-011,Baey Yam Keng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng) (for the Minister for Transport),"Mr Speaker, Sir, the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) policy helps to manage traffic congestion and maintain optimal traffic speeds. Currently, evening ERP is only imposed along the northbound Central Expressway (CTE), where traffic speeds range between 48 kilometre per hour and 56 kilometre per hour. This is near the lower bound of the optimal expressway speeds. Evening ERP is, therefore, still required there to prevent further congestion. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) will continue to monitor the situation and review the ERP charges where necessary.",1,143,2018-07-11-T-011-S-00143
2018-07-11-T-011,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Sir, I have one supplementary question. I find that this is very unfair to those residents who are living in the north. They have to pay ERP in the morning and ERP in the evening. Many residents can understand the need for having ERP in the morning. But many feel that the evening one is not acceptable and they feel that speed is not critical when they are going home. So, I would like to ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary whether MOT can review the purpose of the ERP and see how effective it is in mitigating the traffic jam.",1,144,2018-07-11-T-011-S-00144
2018-07-11-T-011,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Speaker, Sir, Er Dr Lee had asked the same question in January 2016. However, over the last two and a half years, the journey speeds on the north-bound CTE in the evening have not changed much. It has not become much worse, nor has it improved significantly. While I agree with Er Dr Lee that, to some people, going home in the evening is not so critical and maybe we should not need the ERP, but I think, with the aspiration for better work-life balance, family time is important to many people nowadays. So, for the tens of thousands of motorists who are enjoying lighter traffic and higher speeds when they travel along CTE in the evening, they have been able to reach home quicker, in time for dinner and to spend quality time with their families. So, I am not sure whether they will share the same views. Speed will affect the time required for the journeys.",1,145,2018-07-11-T-011-S-00145
2018-07-11-T-011,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"LTA's main mandate is to ensure that motorists are able to enjoy smooth and safe journeys on the roads and expressways. Without the ERP, all motorists on the north-bound CTE are more likely to experience jams in the evening. This is expected, as our northern areas are more densely populated, which includes Nee Soon South, where the Member's constituency is. But with ERP, it alleviates this traffic congestion.",2,146,2018-07-11-T-011-S-00146
2018-07-11-T-011,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"We have data to show that, with ERP or when ERP rates are adjusted accordingly, it does shape motorists' behaviour and it alleviates the situation and, at the same time, provides options for commuters. So, those who are willing to pay the ERP charges can enjoy a shorter journey home while others can choose other routes. For example, going up north, they can choose Thomson Road which is not a priced road, or they can take public transport.",3,147,2018-07-11-T-011-S-00147
2018-07-11-T-011,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"In addition, my Ministry has been working very hard to improve these other options.

2018-07-11-T-011,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"Thank you, Sir. Precisely because of work-life balance, a lot of my residents say ""Why not we just get rid of the evening ERP?"" because many of them stay longer in the office and go home only after ERP. So, I would like to urge the Minister to seriously reconsider because the fact that the speed along the CTE did not change much over these few years says that it is no longer effective.",1,149,2018-07-11-T-011-S-00149
2018-07-11-T-011,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"I think I can hear some murmurs among Members here who have direct experience of travelling along the CTE in the evening. But, if I could just use the example for the north-bound traffic along the CTE after the PIE, in the third quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, we did raise the ERP charges because we observed that traffic has come down below the optimum range of 45 km/h, way below 45 km/h. When the ERP rates were adjusted, it did help to lessen the traffic and the speeds went up. So, with that, motorists have been able to reach home faster and we see a direct impact on the motorists' behaviour with the pricing policy.",1,150,2018-07-11-T-011-S-00150

The vehicle must pass a safety assessment to demonstrate that it can adequately handle basic manoeuvres and come to a safe stop upon the detection of an obstacle. Initial AV trials will only be conducted on lightly used roads, such as those in the one-north district. Further trials in more complex environments will be allowed when AVs are able to demonstrate a higher level of competence. All AVs being tested must be accompanied by a safety driver trained to immediately take over full control of the AV when required. All AVs must have a vehicle fault alert system that will alert the safety driver of any faults, and allow the control of the vehicle to be immediately transferred to the safety driver. LTA will only waive the requirement for a safety driver after AV developers have convincingly proven the competence, reliability and safety of their technology.",2,154,2018-07-11-T-012-S-00154

Absolute safety is very hard to determine in any situation or any technology. And the reality is that human-piloted vehicles are not absolutely safe and we do see a significant number of accidents. One of the key concerns about how we develop AVs is to make sure that our roads, over time, become safer.

2018-07-11-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"To find suitable operators for new coffee shops, HDB has used an online tendering system since 2004. This system makes bidding more transparent as it allows prospective bidders to see all bids in real time and adjust their bids accordingly ahead of the close of tender. We are continuously reviewing the tendering mechanism to see how it can be made more effective in ensuring affordable food for residents.",2,165,2018-07-11-T-013-S-00165
2018-07-11-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"For example, instead of simply awarding to the highest price bids, HDB has been piloting the use of the Price-Quality Method (PQM) to tender out several coffee shops. Under the PQM, quality score accounts for 50% of the evaluation and operators with affordable food options will score higher. That is why HDB recently awarded a coffee shop in Choa Chu Kang to a food operator with affordable food options and with initiatives to improve productivity, even though their rental bid was 40% lower than the highest bid.",3,166,2018-07-11-T-013-S-00166
2018-07-11-T-013,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We have seen good outcomes from this tendering approach. So, I am happy to share that HDB will be replacing the existing e-bidding system with the PQM tender for all coffee shops later this year.",4,167,2018-07-11-T-013-S-00167
2018-07-11-T-013,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Sir. The reason I ask this is that, there are a few coffee shops in Nee Soon South, the new one, not even, I think barely around for one year and it closed down, cannot survive. And now, a tender is called again. I met up with the coffee shop operator. They told me that because of e-bidding, some of them are not experienced, just because they want to come into business, they put up a higher price and then when they come in, they cannot survive, they close down. It affected the residents because they serve the surrounding residents, residents have nowhere to go. And then HDB calls another tender. It takes quite a few months before it awards.",1,168,2018-07-11-T-013-S-00168
2018-07-11-T-013,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"So, I am happy to hear about the PQM and I hope that, in future, we will have to be very mindful. You do the sums. A small coffee shop, $30,000, $40,000; how much would they have to charge per stall? I think we can easily calculate whether they can survive or not.",2,169,2018-07-11-T-013-S-00169
2018-07-11-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Minister for Education whether ITE graduates under the age of 25 can be allowed to use their SkillsFuture credits to improve their skills or undertake courses to enhance their employability.,1,170,2018-07-11-T-014-S-00170
2018-07-11-T-014,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Education),"The starting age for SkillsFuture Credit is 25 years old, as it is the age where many Singaporeans would have completed their full-time education and are in, or are preparing to jointhe workforce. Singaporeans under 25 years old can use their Post-Secondary Education Accounts (PSEAs) to defray out-of-pocket fees for approved programmes.",1,171,2018-07-11-T-014-S-00171
2018-07-11-T-014,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Education),"More importantly, beyond the SkillsFuture Credit, Singaporeans have access to a wide range of measures to support their skills development. There are subsidies of up to 97% of course fees for various training programmes, such as the part-time Higher Nitec module which could cost as low as $40, after all the subsidies.",2,172,2018-07-11-T-014-S-00172
2018-07-11-T-014,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Education),Institute of Technical Education (ITE) graduates who wish to enhance their employability or seek employment assistance can receive help from the ITE Career Services Centre or any of the Workforce Singapore career centres.,3,173,2018-07-11-T-014-S-00173
2018-07-11-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Just one quick question  the age of 25, I suppose, was introduced because it sort of meets with the graduation for most university graduates and tertiary education graduates. But for ITE graduates, when they graduate at 21, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that there are Higher Nitec grants and subsidies that are provided. Will the Ministry of Education consider giving some leeway for ITE students after they graduate, especially for those that have graduated and are trying to look for jobs, trying to utilise the SkillsFuture Credit immediately so that they can upskill themselves, going forward?",1,174,2018-07-11-T-014-S-00174
2018-07-11-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,I thank Mr Saktiandi Supaat for his supplementary questions. I think I will highlight four key points to give him assurance that our ITE graduates will have the support to gain access to courses even after they graduate from ITE.,1,175,2018-07-11-T-014-S-00175
2018-07-11-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"The first one is, they have a range of options they can choose from to gain access to courses to support skills development and also employability. I will give a quick example and, that is, the recently launched ITE Work-Learn Technical Diploma. This is, essentially, an apprenticeship-based programme that will allow our ITE graduates to pursue a diploma even as they work. It is designed to enhance our ITE graduates' employability because we have structured it such that it has a very strong, on-the-job component; 70% of the curriculum is based on the on-the-job component. It really allows our ITE graduates not just to learn and gain industry-relevant skills, but also to gain a deep understanding of the company and also the sector.",2,176,2018-07-11-T-014-S-00176
2018-07-11-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"I want to assure the Member that even after our ITE graduates leave ITE, maybe after taking Nitec and working for a couple of years and they are still young, they want to come back and take Nitec again or Higher Nitec, they will receive the support, heavily subsidised. If their family is facing financial difficulties, we can work with them to look at how they can pay the course over a longer period of time through instalments. So, that is the second key point.",3,177,2018-07-11-T-014-S-00177
2018-07-11-T-014,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"For ITE graduates who are under the age of 25, I will briefly talk about the PSEAs. The average balances in the PSEAs are fairly substantial. I want to give the assurance to Mr Saktiandi Supaat that they can use the funds available in the PSEAs and the PSEAs can be utilised for approved courses that are provided by a wide range of Institute of Higher Learnings (IHLs), even public agencies and also private training providers.",4,178,2018-07-11-T-014-S-00178
2018-07-11-T-014,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary. I just want to find out a bit more. Are the PSEA's slew of curriculum courses similar to the SkillsFuture courses or are they a smaller subset of the SkillsFuture range of courses?,1,179,2018-07-11-T-014-S-00179

2018-07-11-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether the Ministry tracks the average and median salaries of early childhood educators according to their educational attainment; and (b) if so, what are the current average and median salaries of early childhood educators according to their educational attainment and how do these compare to five years ago.",1,181,2018-07-11-T-015-S-00181
2018-07-11-T-015,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Speaker, the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) monitors the salary trends of early childhood educators in a few ways. First, ECDA commissions surveys from time to time on salary and other job-related issues in the preschool sector. The last survey was conducted two years ago, 2016, and it covered the 79 operators employing close to two-thirds of the educators in the sector. Second, the polytechnics collect data on the starting salaries of polytechnic graduates, including those from the early childhood Diploma courses, through their annual Graduate Employment Surveys.",1,182,2018-07-11-T-015-S-00182
2018-07-11-T-015,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Based on ECDA's survey which they conducted in 2016, basic salaries for educarers with a professional certificate range from about $1,800 to $2,100 per month, salaries for teachers with a professional teaching Diploma range from $2,200 to $3,000, and salaries for principals with a professional leadership Diploma range from $3,100 to $6,000. These salaries have increased by about 15% since the previous survey in 2013, outpacing that of the general market for similar job sizes which grew by about 8% over the same period. Also, based on the 2017 Polytechnic Graduate Employment Survey, the starting salaries of full-time early childhood Diploma fresh graduates have increased by about 20% to $2,300 since 2013.",2,183,2018-07-11-T-015-S-00183
2018-07-11-T-015,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Going forward, ECDA expects salary growth for early childhood educators to continue to outpace that of the general market. Apart from the continued expansion of the sector, which will require 20,000 early childhood educators by 2020, from about 17,000 today, ECDA is working closely with anchor as well as partner operators to ensure salary and career progression for their teachers, commensurate with their contributions and professional skills.",3,184,2018-07-11-T-015-S-00184
2018-07-11-T-016,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat,asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether he can provide an update on the number of HDB blocks that are not given lift upgrading due specifically to the funding cap; and (b) whether HDB will consider polling the residents in these affected blocks to explore the possibility of co-sharing the amount beyond the funding cap to have lift access at their floors.,1,185,2018-07-11-T-016-S-00185
2018-07-11-T-016,Desmond Lee,The Second Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"Mr Speaker, the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) was launched in 2001 to provide direct lift access to flats and enhance convenience for residents, especially our elderly and less mobile. At the start of the programme, there were more than 5,300 Housing and Development Board (HDB) blocks without 100% lift access. LUP was initially found to be unfeasible for more than 1,000 of these blocks due to cost or technical constraints.",1,186,2018-07-11-T-016-S-00186
2018-07-11-T-016,Desmond Lee,The Second Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"Over the years, HDB has adopted innovative technical solutions to provide such blocks with lift access. Through these efforts, the vast majority of the 5,300 blocks have since been able to benefit from LUP and there remain only about 150 blocks where HDB has not found any solutions to overcome existing constraints. About 70% of these 150 blocks are not eligible for lift upgrading due to cost considerations. In total, less than 1% of sold flats do not have direct lift access.",2,187,2018-07-11-T-016-S-00187
2018-07-11-T-016,Desmond Lee,The Second Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"For some of the blocks where LUP is not feasible, the cost of providing 100% lift access would be prohibitive. In addition, asking residents to co-share part of the amount beyond the cost cap may cause undue financial hardship to residents. LUP is done on a polling basis and, if the poll is successful, those who do not vote in favour of LUP still have to pay their share of the cost.",3,188,2018-07-11-T-016-S-00188
2018-07-11-T-016,Desmond Lee,The Second Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),Singaporeans who are in urgent need of direct lift access due to medical conditions or disability may approach HDB for housing and financial assistance. HDB will assess each request on a case-by-case basis to see how best to render help.,4,189,2018-07-11-T-016-S-00189
2018-07-11-T-016,Desmond Lee,The Second Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development),"For these remaining blocks, HDB continues to look at available technical and innovative solutions to see how we can provide for these blocks and, as and when they become available, we will make that option possible.",5,190,2018-07-11-T-016-S-00190
2018-07-11-T-016,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Just a quick clarification. Those blocks that cannot get LUP because of the funding cap, why in the first place did the Ministry not put them under the main LUP contract because they will enjoy huge economies of scale when it comes to bidding? Some contractors are like that. If I build one lift, it is more expensive, I do not mind throwing in a few other freebies. If the whole thing were to be parked under the original LUP, I think those blocks which have funding cap issues will probably be resolved. I do not know whether the Ministry could consider throwing another tender for all these lifts.",1,191,2018-07-11-T-016-S-00191
2018-07-11-T-016,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"I thank the Member for his question. Some of the 150 blocks are not eligible for LUP because of very severe site constraints. Part of it is technical, part of it is just the way in which the block is designed in relation to the land surrounding it. But for those blocks that are not eligible because of cost considerations, they are well in excess of $100,000 per unit.",1,192,2018-07-11-T-016-S-00192
2018-07-11-T-016,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"So, even if you drive this as a part of the overall LUP, which they were, because, LUP, when you call the contract, it is for all unavailable blocks that qualify. The nature of these remaining number of blocks, the cost would be way in excess of $100,000. So, that is a very different order altogether.",2,193,2018-07-11-T-016-S-00193

Concord Primary School has consistently improved over the years because of him and his colleagues and its Applied Learning and Learning for Life programmes (APL and LLP). They have made the news.",28,222,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00222
2018-07-11-T-017,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"But what made me sit up when speaking to Mr Kumaran and his colleagues were the stories that they had beyond just the rankings, beyond just the ALP and LLP. Kumaran's stories are not of children who are bored in class because of too much tuition. They are stories of bright girls and boys who sit at the back of the class and, sometimes, do not even come to school because parents do not encourage them to turn up at school. Stories of him and others visiting the houses of such students and using tough love, Mr Speaker, to encourage these students to attend school and tough love on the parents as well to send their children to school. It helps that Mr Kumaran is more than six feet tall and is built like a discipline master should be.",29,223,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00223
2018-07-11-T-017,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),But I congratulate every neighbourhood primary school like Concord that continues to make a difference.,30,224,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00224
2018-07-11-T-017,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"Like Kumaran, I am proud to come from a neighbourhood primary school myself. I graduated from Princess Elizabeth Primary School. Contrary to its name, Princess Elizabeth Primary School has nothing to do with the United Kingdom! It is named after a road which is based in Bukit Batok right now. It used to be Hillview, but now it is Bukit Batok. After the PSLE, I was fortunate to get a place in RI. And let me say a few words about RI. Those four years were the most blissful years of a kid's education.",31,225,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00225
2018-07-11-T-017,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"RI has held itself up as the best school, but not because it has always put itself up to be that, but because none of us came from a feeder primary school, Mr Speaker. No one dared to think, when they entered RI in Secondary 1, that they were the best in the class, a subject or a sport because we had no idea who might be better than you; we were all just equals coming there. Your path was never paved for you; you worked hard to earn your own reputation. My schoolmates could not have been from more diverse backgrounds or sensibilities.",32,226,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00226
2018-07-11-T-017,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"I was thus concerned when the Prime Minister raised in May that diversity had become an issue in RI. That saddened me. And I am happy to report that after speaking to Vice Principals and teachers at RI, they have tried to take some swift action to combat this perception. RI has established a scholarship and mentorship programme for Primary 5 and Primary 6 students from across the country. I spoke to Mrs Theresa Lai, a Vice Principal, who hopes that, through this mentorship and scholarship programmes, RI can play a part in the social mobility of these students with both financial support and also through ""old school"", ""older brother/older sister"" mentorship, where you have Secondary 1 and Secondary 2 students actually going to meet their counterparts, or their juniors in primary school to encourage them. Although the mentors provide academic support, the larger idea is to work with these nine- and 10-year-olds in primary school to deal with the socio-emotional stresses and what leadership skills actually involve.",33,227,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00227
2018-07-11-T-017,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"RI has also engaged the principals and teachers from primary schools to see how they can better support these students.

2018-07-11-T-017,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"Through these engagement efforts, RI, as a school, tries to dispel the notion that it is an exclusive educational institution; it is not only for the bright children from	wealthy backgrounds.

2018-07-11-T-017,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"The third and final point I want to touch on, Mr Speaker, is how when we look at the future of education, it really is a call to stare into a crystal ball but to think what are the benefits and advantages that Singaporean students would need to possess, partly because of our geography, partly because of the languages that we are encouraged to speak and that we do speak as a mother tongue and what more we can do.",40,234,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00234

And, in that Declaration, they said this  ""India, China and other Asian nations are growing and their influence on the world is increasing. Australians need to become 'Asia literate', engaging and building strong relationships with Asia."" I think they tried to do precisely that. Today, they suggest that they, too, maybe one day soon, should be a member of the 10-party ASEAN block so it becomes part of Southeast Asia and not just Asia.",41,235,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00235

They are Singapore-literate. They speak English; they speak very good English; they can understand smatterings of the three languages beyond English that are our national languages. But are we doing more to ensure they understand what really makes Asia tick? Because that has to start at the secondary school level.",42,236,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00236

2018-07-11-T-017,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to firstly declare that I am a parent of a child with Down's Syndrome. My son Ayden is, therefore, by common definition, a child with special needs. The first few months of Ayden's life was probably the most challenging period in my life. Down's Syndrome children typically have certain associated medical conditions. So, at the beginning, I was at Kandang Kerbau Hospital almost every other week for a slew of medical appointments. Other parents, whose children have special needs, would probably share similar experiences.",1,241,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00241
2018-07-11-T-017,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"In addition to the worry about the children's health, there is also always that nagging fear about their future, how society would see them, whether they will be able to take care of themselves when they grow up, what will become of them when we, the parents, pass away. It is not uncommon to hear this – and I believe the hon Member Ms Denise Phua would have shared this – that these parents often say that they would rather live to see their child die so that they could ensure that the child's needs are met to the end. It is heartbreaking to hear.",2,242,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00242
2018-07-11-T-017,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"This worry is not unjustified. A quick sensing of the current environment suggests that society, whilst now more open and accepting of people with special needs, is still not completely comfortable with them. The National Council of Social Service (NCSS) conducted an attitude study with 1,400 citizens and permanent residents in 2015 and found that the public viewed persons with disabilities less favourably than those without a disability. They also had less favourable attitudes towards those with intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorder. The Lien Foundation's Inclusive Attitudes Study conducted in 2016 echoed this finding. Half of the parents they polled indicated that they were uncomfortable about their child having to sit next to one with special needs in class.",3,243,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00243
2018-07-11-T-017,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I also hear stories from parents of children with special needs about how people treat their children. One father shared that on one occasion, a few young children were running towards his daughter. They probably just wanted to play, but their caregiver was heard shouting ""不要去那边！她是神经病的人!”. Do not go there. She is a crazy person.",4,244,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00244
2018-07-11-T-017,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Several months back, I heard on the radio, a caller commenting on a discussion on inclusivity. The man said that his wife is a teacher and that there is a child with special needs in her class. His wife must have shared her challenges with him. He said that he was of the view that ""these children"" should not be put in the same class as normal children. They are disruptive and cause a lot of problems to the teachers and the class. He felt that parents of children with special needs are in denial and they want to believe that their children are normal, so they insist that their children be in mainstream schools when they actually should be taught elsewhere.",5,245,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00245
2018-07-11-T-017,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Honestly, I understood where this gentleman was coming from. The challenges faced by teachers in such settings are real. We need to deal with these challenges. I will touch on this a little later in my speech. But the caller's solution to the problem offended and hurt me as a parent. His tone and the curt manner in which he declared his views reflected how he felt about children who are different. They should be taught separately, kept apart from normal children. I appreciate it may not be completely fair to postulate from his brief remarks what he thought of people with special needs in general. To me, though, it felt like a rejection, that children like Ayden will always be seen as a burden, that they should be put in appropriate places. I cried my eyes out that afternoon.",6,246,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00246
2018-07-11-T-017,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"So, what does all this have to do with the Motion today? Why am I telling you these stories? There are many different aspects of the Motion that we can debate about today but I would like to speak about inclusive education from the perspective of persons with special needs. The reality is, whilst Singapore has made great strides in encouraging and promoting inclusiveness within our community, we have some way to go in truly walking the talk. Our society is still not yet able to truly view persons with disabilities as an equally valued member of the community. And I believe that we can review and build our education system so as to change perceptions, normalise disabilities; so that people can appreciate that persons with special needs are simply differently abled and are of no lesser value than any other member of society.",7,247,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00247
2018-07-11-T-017,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Singapore has done a lot towards building an inclusive society. The Government started the journey in 2007 when the First Enabling Masterplan (EM1) was drafted and adopted. EM1 outlined a vision where persons with disabilities are fully integrated, empowered to reach their potential and are contributing members of society. A decade later, the Third Enabling Masterplan had been drafted and is currently being implemented.",8,248,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00248
2018-07-11-T-017,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"However, there are still gaps and areas which we can give more attention to, so as to truly embrace people with different abilities and give them the opportunity and motivation to excel. I would like to say at this juncture that this is not about seeking special treatment. A pragmatist may also say that it would be unreasonable to expect the Government to put in large resources and funding to address needs of only a small percentage of people in the community. But I trust one can agree that enhancing inclusiveness within our education system will bring great benefit to Singapore as a whole.",9,249,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00249
2018-07-11-T-017,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Firstly, fully embracing people with special needs within our community creates opportunities for people to be more caring and compassionate. I recall a conversation I had with you, Mr Speaker, when you were then the Minister for Social and Family Development. You feel strongly that people with special needs have a role to play in helping build kindness and empathy in the community. They are conduits through which we can elevate the level of compassion amongst Singaporeans. I fully agree.",10,250,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00250
2018-07-11-T-017,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Research shows that a genuinely inclusive education system allows children to build and develop friendships that they might not have encountered otherwise, as inclusive settings encourage higher levels of interaction than segregated settings. What results is better outcomes for social and communication development and an early inculcation of values of inclusion. Such early exposure benefit both children with and without special needs, where they will be better able to demonstrate greater compassion, empathy and have better understanding on how to interact with their peers and accept diversity. These children could develop better interpersonal skills and exhibit greater adaptability.",11,251,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00251
2018-07-11-T-017,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"These results could already be seen at Kindle Garden, a preschool by Asian Women's Welfare Association, Singapore's first inclusive preschool. At Kindle Garden, children with different needs and different backgrounds study together. Learning is personalised and children are taught to embrace diversity and respect for each other. I accept that the model is not necessarily easy to replicate, but, for now, let us focus on the results that could be achieved if we truly set out to be inclusive.",12,252,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00252
2018-07-11-T-017,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Secondly, there is great future economic value in equipping our special needs children with the necessary skills so that they could be independent. Research shows that when children with special needs are being supported to communicate with their peers, they enhance their independent communication, mastery of augmentative and alternative communication strategies and have increased speech and language development. If we intervene early, in schools, we give them the necessary skills and prepare them for the future, there is a greater chance that they would graduate school and join the workforce. If they can work well, be independent and contribute meaningfully towards the economy, less resources need to be spent on support structures or schemes when they are adults.",13,253,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00253
2018-07-11-T-017,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"In light of the above, I make the following recommendations to enhance the education landscape.",14,254,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00254
2018-07-11-T-017,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"For one, we should have an integrated education system and school setting. A common misunderstanding of an inclusive education is one where there is simply a presence of students with disabilities in a classroom or school setting but where micro or macro exclusion still occurs. If there is segregation and the children are not treated equally within the same setting, that is not truly inclusive education.",15,255,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00255
2018-07-11-T-017,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"In 2012, MOE announced that 20 Special Education (SPED) Schools will be paired with mainstream schools so that students from both schools have the opportunities to mingle, for example, during recess and at school events. I understand that there are also lessons in Character and Citizenship Education in mainstream schools that help raise awareness of disabilities and how each person can play a part in developing an inclusive society. Schools have also forged partnerships with Voluntary Welfare Organisations to provide opportunities for students to interact meaningfully and deepen mutual understanding. These are all great efforts but we need to build on them.",16,256,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00256
2018-07-11-T-017,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"So, we should have an education system where children with and without special needs learn and play within the same setting but in different pathways. I believe that this is more accurately described as an integrated education system. That way, students can receive different support and assistance based on their needs but yet have the opportunity to interact meaningfully.",17,257,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00257
2018-07-11-T-017,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Currently, there are special needs students in mainstream schools. However, such arrangements, in some situations, have been challenging for the teachers as well as the students – those with and without special needs. We hear many instances where the teachers and the allied educators cannot manage the students and the class situation. Teachers get stressed, the students in class are affected, parents chime in and express their unhappiness about the arrangements and everyone is discouraged by the efforts to be inclusive. So, to do this properly, we need to build the proper support structure and have sufficient resources.",18,258,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00258
2018-07-11-T-017,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"One key resource is the group of teachers who are trained to teach students with special needs. It appears that there is currently a shortage of such teachers. While there is a growing pool of allied educators specialising in learning and behavioural support and a large number of teachers trained to meet special needs in mainstream schools, teachers have been reported to be shorthanded in managing students requiring additional learning support. In addition, we have also seen reports in the papers about the Lien Foundation survey which alluded to a high burn-out rate of professionals working with special needs children. Fifty-one percent of the 423 professionals surveyed felt that burning out quickly was one of the key challenges they faced. Forty-four percent said salaries and benefits were unattractive while 34% pointed to manpower shortage as a challenge.",19,259,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00259
2018-07-11-T-017,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"We, therefore, secondly, need to improve the profession and career pathway of special education teachers. Currently, these teachers are hired by various social service organisations who are guided by the salary scale recommended by NCSS. The general perception is that these teachers receive less recognition and their pay packages are less attractive than their counterparts in mainstream education.",20,260,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00260
2018-07-11-T-017,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I propose that these teachers come under the purview of MOE, like their peers in mainstream schools, so that they would have access to the same salary scales, as well as career opportunities, which would, in turn, raise the stature and attractiveness of the role and encourage more to pursue a career in this profession. Having more educators trained in supporting special needs would better support the learning needs of our children and ensure that they can achieve their fullest potential. These teachers can be tapped on to support students in mainstream or SPED schools.",21,261,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00261
2018-07-11-T-017,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"In the same vein of building resources, I would make a third recommendation that we also build synergy between the education and health sectors, so as to ensure that access to the necessary assessments is enhanced. Early identification of learning difficulties can help ensure that students who have such needs receive the necessary support as soon as possible. However, parents often cite long waiting lists for MOE psychologists when seeking to have their children assessed. Taking a leaf from the General Practitioners (GP)-Partnership Programme in the mental health sector, I propose an MOE Psychologist Partnership Programme where several recognised private psychologists can provide assessments for learning difficulties. To address high costs, the identified practitioners could provide subsidies to families with the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) cards, with part of the costs subsidised by the Government.",22,262,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00262
2018-07-11-T-017,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Lastly, I propose a review of the administration of school curriculum for both mainstream and SPED schools. Our children are all unique, with different talents and abilities. Often, in the school system, we are pushing them into categories or groups, which allows for a more expedient delivery of information and knowledge. However, this means that we may not be fully developing their strengths and addressing their weaknesses. For example, at the moment, children with special needs in mainstream schools are still expected to complete the same curriculum as their peers. Support is given when their natural abilities fall short of what is required. But if we are really serious in allowing each child to flourish, there may be value in adjusting a curriculum according to each individual’s needs, pace of learning, as well as providing the facilities and resources required to cater to the wide spectrum of disabilities.",23,263,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00263

Developing a good education system that is inclusive and suited to the times should be a constant work-in-progress. I believe our robust discussion today will contribute towards the continued development of a quality education for all children in Singapore. Mr Speaker, with that, I beg to move.

For the last 16 years, I have been part of the teaching and learning ecosystem in Singapore. I am a co-founder of a purpose-driven tuition centre. I am a publisher of current affairs magazines sold directly to schools. I am also a coach and trainer of working professionals, helping them develop the social and emotional skills they need to become better architects for cultural change.

2018-07-11-T-017,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"My interest in education began when I was 25. I had started an experimental tuition group with my friends because we were curious about two questions. The first was  ""Why are so many young Singaporeans graduating out of our local education system uncertain about who they are and indifferent to bigger problems in Singapore and the world?"" And the second question was  ""What can we do about it?""",2,287,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00287

But by the end of that same year, the group ballooned into 100 kids and we realised we should officially register as a private tuition centre. So, we applied to the Registry of Business (RCB) calling ourselves School of Thought and, soon after, an RCB officer called me back to tell us our name could not be approved. I asked him what was wrong with the name School of Thought. And for as long as I teach, I do not think I will forget what he said. His response, without any irony, was this  ""What do schools have to do with thinking? School of Math, yes. School of English, I understand. But thought?

Also, 16 years have passed and times and attitudes have evolved since then and I am more optimistic that I would not get that response today. Still, I do not wish to brush off his remark as an aberration. Because his remark to me is a signpost that there could be many more individuals out there who were taught an incomplete or mistaken lesson about the purpose of education and that gap in their learning does have consequences on us all at a systemic level.",6,291,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00291

When we asked them why there was a surge of interest in social and emotional development from their sector, they shared with us their challenges in teaching some of their staff to see their patients as not just diseases to treat, but people to care for. One medical team shared with us that their conviction to put more emphasis on empathy in their curriculum came after a disillusioned medical student revealed to them that she was quitting the profession after she witnessed two surgeons she was supposed to be learning from execute a surgical procedure with flawless expertise, while simultaneously making the most vile and derogatory comments about the unconscious patient.

They become our customers and entrepreneurs deciding what money can buy and what money should never ever buy.

Teachers do appreciate the need to expand their work scope beyond teaching to broaden their skill sets.

Adjunct Prof S Gopinathan at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and former dean of National Institute of Education (NIE)'s School of Education said in an interview with The Straits Times that even the best-trained teacher will find it difficult coping with a class of 40 students in an era where we want children to be more inquisitive, explain their insights, have more applied learning.

Even really good teachers are telling us that the only way they can cope with giving individualised attention to everyone in a large class is to sacrifice time from their after-work hours to prepare, mark, answer questions and meet up with kids. This is a price that many good teachers are willing to pay because of their personal convictions, but it does come at personal cost to their own mental, physical and emotional well-being.",18,303,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00303

I see that we currently have smaller-size classes at the JCs, tertiary and university levels, but not at the primary and secondary school levels. I suggest that we explore our assumption that the tertiary level students need more individualised attention than younger students. If education is about helping learners gain in confidence and ability to manage and own their own learning process, then should not the smallest classes and the greatest availability of teacher support be with the youngest children?",19,304,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00304

Without a local knowledge base, we can't say it doesn't make a difference based on international research"". Which brings me to the high-stakes exam issue.",26,311,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00311

Which means if the teacher wants to do anything interesting, he only has four weeks in a term. So, 40% of the school term is taken up by exam preparation.

It is hardly a silver bullet solution and abolishing it will definitely generate many new problems and fail to resolve some old ones. It will force many other policies to change together with it. However, I also see that the ground does not seem sufficiently convinced so far by the little tweaks being made to PSLE grades. We know this because they are not changing their behaviour in any significant way. Mothers are still quitting their jobs to prepare their kids for PSLE. The billion-dollar tuition industry is still not pivoting their business models to help kids grow in character rather than in grades any time soon. They are quite confident that they know their customers are not going to shift. The ""arms race"" kiasu culture seems to be eating all our strategies for breakfast.",30,315,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00315
2018-07-11-T-017,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"So, I do wonder whether abolishing PSLE could be a psychological Gordian knot that needs to be cut. I can understand the Government's resistance to abolishing PSLE because to take on the barrage of trouble involved, the win must be significant and something the majority of the electorate must show that it is willing to support. Because abolishing PSLE will set off a chain reaction of very uncomfortable changes. Without PSLE, there might be much less reason to stream in primary school or upon entering secondary school. Primary school teachers will be challenged to up their game and compelled to design and deliver a curriculum that is no longer about preparing kids for a standardised exam. And MOE would have to devise a whole new way to assess the quality of teaching in primary schools without data from PSLE results.",31,316,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00316
2018-07-11-T-017,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"Abolishing the PSLE also opens up the question of how then should we level the playing field for secondary schools? Do we want to ensure all secondary schools are funded, resourced and governed the same way by MOE? If so, then we have to remove all other kinds of admissions, such as the DSA and even end the special status of some schools. This would be a very difficult change for some elite schools to swallow, because nobody wants to give up their elite identity.",32,317,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00317
2018-07-11-T-017,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"If we do abolish PSLE someday, these teething issues would take probably a painful decade to iron out, but once a steady state is reached, there would be much less difficulties.

I do not have an answer about whether we should or should not abolish the PSLE because I recognise it takes a lot of political risk to make that change. So, this is all easy for me to say because I am not a politician and I am just speaking as a parent. This particular parent's naive hope is that we will someday dismantle the PSLE because I would rather give more time and space for our teachers to develop our children's thinking without fear of messing up a high-stakes exam. Moreover, I think a 16-year-old is far more cognitively prepared to deal with the psychological impact of a high-stakes exam than a 12-year-old.

That message sent by the achievement file was compassionate but very clear  I, the parent, was part of the process of my child's growth.

In fact, some of the kids who attend their preschool class currently read better than children who joined them at primary school-age. So, there is a trickle-down effect as well. As the kids grow in confidence, they started to influence their siblings to read.",44,329,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00329
2018-07-11-T-017,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"I hope the Government can partner community groups to intervene as early as possible in the literacy gap. For instance, can the National Library place a personalised mini-library in every low-income household with a child that requests to have one? Every parent in this room also knows there is a huge difference when children grow up in a literacy-rich environment. That is why we buy books for our kids though we also have access to public libraries. So, we allow these kids to initiate the request for their own mini-library and own their own customised cargo of books. They might be far more likely to see books as part of their life. If the Media Development Authority can consider working with these successful ground-up literacy movements to co-create a solution using media or technology that could help sustain their impact, that would be great because kids need plenty of repetition and audio-visual recordings of these books for them to play back at their own time might prove really helpful.",45,330,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00330

A stable home environment and literacy-related support for these parents will help the child's educational progress and more deliberate and pre-emptive outreach from the Government to help these migrant mothers care for their Singaporean child in the short run could stave off far more expensive problems in the long run. Community groups like ReadAble, working directly with such migrant mothers, hope for much greater public dialogue on how they can partner the state to help more migrant mothers and their Singaporean children progress in the education aspect.",46,331,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00331

The kids there are focused on discovering their values and what work they would like to do and not just mug before an exam. The content, pedagogy, assessments are learner-centric. They are 70% experiential learning. By the end of their programme, they would have all gone for an eight-week industry attachment. And, yes, they have achievement records, not report cards, and their kids are so proud to show them to their parents.

This school is Northlight and it was an idea floated in 1997 and dismissed as before its time and made real only in 2005 when Mr Lim Chuan Poh, a Permanent Secretary at MOE, had the curiosity to find an answer to one student's frustration about why he had to repeat PSLE so many times. That Permanent Secretary's leap of faith allowed more leaders and purpose-driven principals and teachers to come and put their own skin in the game and it was all of them combined together – their collective courage to live out their highest ideals of education that made Northlight happen.",49,334,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00334

2018-07-11-T-017,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"I bring this up because discourse is something fundamental and integral in education, specifically in the study of the humanities. Through Literature, History, Geography and the Arts, we develop a keen sensibility for nuances, differences and complexities. Take, for instance, the Dream of the Red Chamber, which, when studied from a humanistic approach, is not just a literature text to be examined. Rather, it is a very nuanced study of humankind, of society, of politics, of culture and art. We discover that being human, through that book, means having to deal with the different aspects of living  social, political, emotional, psychological, spiritual, physical, carnal and meta-physical. Yes, the Dream of Red Chamber does talk about carnal desires. We learn that power of empathy, by seeking to understand and deeply appreciate how each of these characters are like and, of course, including their shadows.",12,388,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00388
2018-07-11-T-017,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"Why is this important? Because we do not want a future society without empathy. Education plays such a crucial role here, because our young ones should be given the opportunity to explore in schoo,l under the guidance of teachers, so that they learn at a tender age about the complexities of humanity. Without this, we will likely have a generation of people lacking in empathy, believing only in one's value and unable to comprehend or accept vulnerability in human existence.",13,389,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00389
2018-07-11-T-017,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"In fact, even in the study of science, technology, mathematics, the focus is not merely on the discovery of theorems, theories and inventing things. Rather, great scientists and inventors view nature with awe and are constantly searching for humanity's relationship with nature, to understand rather than to alter it. This is because they are acutely aware that the search for truth is a quest in humility. We search because we are ignorant. And in acknowledging our imperfection and ignorance, we open our hearts and minds to learn and improve.",14,390,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00390

2018-07-11-T-017,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"In teaching critical thinking, a lot of emphasis has been placed on the methodology of problem-solving. That is to say, one learns to analyse the problem, then suggest solutions, before evaluating its results. There is also an emphasis on dialogic learning. Allow me to quote Paulo Freire, the pedagogue who advocated Problem Posing approach, dialogic learning and critical pedagogy. To him, dialogue ""cannot exist without the profound love for the world"", and Problems-posing Education ""affirms men and women as being in the process of becoming"".",18,394,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00394

Asking too many questions is sometimes seen as diverting energies in something that is irrelevant; it sidetracks from the task orientation.

He certainly knew all the right steps to do so, but, interestingly, he would deliberately permit himself to take detours, try alternatives, until he met with an obstacle. Was he wasting his students' time as he meandered and hit roadblocks? Not in the least. In fact, his trajectory was illuminating, because as he traced his steps back, he talked about why this path did not work and how we could perhaps try another path instead.",23,399,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00399

Curiosity is about getting lost, but allowing oneself to do so without fear. Any inventor or artist will tell you the same thing  that the fun part of creation is when you are trying to find your way around, when you are experimenting and discovering the world in the process. There should be no fear in that, but, rather, we should become accustomed to the promise that it brings with it.",24,400,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00400

The answer, again, is our educational institutions. They are well-equipped to guide young people, young explorers and creators in life, as they find their own individual paths.

We are a small nation of 5.6 million. Should we create a race to the last for 5.6 million individuals, so that some privileged ones amongst us, or some able-bodied amongst us, can be the best? How about harnessing our collective capabilities instead through collaboration, so that we, as a nation, can move mountains at no one's expense?

I would not talk about classroom sizes because my colleague, Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin, has talked about it. But I want to talk about assessment again, which I think is an important aspect of learning. Yet today our assessment methods are still focused on the quantity that students have learnt, rather than the quality of their learning and retention. Many of us are aware of diagnostic assessment, where assessment is used to diagnose students' needs, so that the learning process can be improved to help them acquire knowledge better. In short, diagnostic assessment is less about KPIs, more about taking the interest of each individual child at heart. It means education to harness his or her skills, to address his or her needs and to encourage and groom each child's unique strengths.",39,415,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00415

In our bid to make a living, to ensure that we best provide for our children materially, have we become so caught up with work that there is a trade-off in our time spent with them? Have we also passed on that role of education fully to teachers, rather than undertake part of it ourselves?

However, I am not sure whether this is followed by all ECDCs. From what I have seen and what other parents have shared online and with me, play is not a strong focus in some of the ECDCs.

Attractive salaries, incentives and supervision should be put in place for educators of young children. When children feel cared for in a stable and supportive relationship, stress naturally goes away and learning takes care of itself. In fact, shifting our priority to care over academic outcomes is key in helping children thrive and reach their full potential.",14,439,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00439
2018-07-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Fourth, the future of our education requires us to cater to the emotional health of students more comprehensively. I am heartened to see that schools remain vigilant in preventing further suicides in children. However, that is not adequate. We want children to thrive, not simply survive. A survey by Chapter Zero, a social enterprise working with parents, caregivers and educators in Singapore, showed that the top two qualities parents hoped to see for their child were ""healthy relationships with others"" and ""strong emotional health"". Approximately half the parents interviewed were concerned that the educational system did not support students to develop these qualities. Seventy percent of the parents raised the need for more emphasis on social-emotional learning in preschools and primary schools, particularly on mindfulness, empathy and conflict management.",15,440,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00440

Studies have shown that there is correlation between the level of pro-social behaviour that a student showed in kindergarten and their education and job prospects, criminal activity, likelihood of substance abuse and mental health in adulthood. Other studies likewise indicate that feeling socially connected as a child is more strongly associated with happiness in adulthood than academic achievement is.",16,441,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00441

How can the abstract concept of modelling be effectively and comprehensively explained to an eight-year-old child who is only two years into the primary school system? Is our education system, in its pursuit to be competitive, inadvertently taking away the joy of learning? How are our students supposed to spend time to explore and discover their love for Mathematics, if they are inundated with planning out models for problem sums today? Shall we not guide our students to discover what they do not know and assist them to explore alternatives, rather than providing concepts and solutions?

I think one way of ensuring that we focus more on life skills is to explore how we can shift from an exam-based academic system to a more coursework-based or skills-based academic one.",16,492,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00492
2018-07-11-T-017,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"I spent 16 years in the polytechnic as an educator and I have seen how students who have less than stellar academic PSLE or even ""O"" or ""N"" level scores often end up doing very well in the polytechnic system. They are able to achieve good grade point average scores in the polytechnic, which reflects their ability to do well academically. They are transformed from being regarded as academically poor or average, into good academic achievers. The main difference, of course, is that they are now in a system that measures academic achievement in terms of coursework and skills capability, as opposed to the ability to study for an exam.",17,493,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00493
2018-07-11-T-017,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"There are some subjects at the ""N"" and ""O"" levels that allow students to do well based on their practical and skills-based capabilities, but the fact remains that our education system is still very much an exam-based academic one, especially when it comes to the mother-of-all exams, the PSLE. Ultimately, a good PSLE T-score demonstrates a child’s ability to cram for exams and deliver in a controlled exam-based environment and one wonders if that is an accurate reflection of his or her potential.",18,494,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00494
2018-07-11-T-017,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"So, while I am not advocating the scrapping of the PSLE and I acknowledge the proposed changes being made to this exam by MOE, I would like to suggest that MOE consider how it can make the PSLE more about a demonstration of other skill sets and capabilities, other than the ability to “cram-and-deliver.” Perhaps, the element of coursework or continuous assessment could be introduced as part of one’s PSLE grade, such that the eventual PSLE score is a more holistic reflection of a young adult’s capabilities and abilities.",19,495,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00495
2018-07-11-T-017,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"The Government has, over the years, increasingly recognised that there are multiple pathways to success. Having a degree, for example, is only one of the many peaks of excellence and we have, indeed, seen many examples of successful people who do not have degrees. The fundamental objective of education is thus not to pursue paper qualifications, but the assurance that the receivers of education learn employable and relevant skills that enable them to succeed in the industry or career of their choice.",20,496,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00496
2018-07-11-T-017,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"In an earlier speech debating the President’s Address in May, I briefly commented on how the Government has recognised the importance of providing learners with various options that cater to different learning needs and aspirations in the post-primary school education sector. The same choices are also given to parents in the pre-primary education sector with different early childhood education options providing different pedagogies and curricula to suit different needs.",21,497,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00497
2018-07-11-T-017,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"While multiple options are provided for pre- and post-primary school students, the primary education sector still follows a one-size-fits-all model where schools administer a centrally planned curriculum with limited room for variations. As evidenced by how our post-primary and tertiary education sectors have produced a varied pool of talent who are skilled in a variety of different fields, could we not also allow our primary schools to be more diverse in offering their own curriculum that caters to different learning needs and aspirations?",22,498,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00498
2018-07-11-T-017,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),I am supportive of Ms Rahayu Mahzam’s amendments that development paths need to be suited to unique strengths and interests and I believe strongly that having different systems and different pathways will ultimately be beneficial as it produces different products. Diversity ultimately results in a whole that is always more than the sum of its parts and I would like to encourage MOE to perhaps run some pilot programmes in the primary school sector to see how alternate systems and pedagogies could also be successful.,23,499,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00499

2018-07-11-T-017,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"In this increasingly complex world, it is not so much about what you know, as what you can do. I thus strongly urge the Government to consider how we can continue to ensure that our people, both the young and not-so-young, are given adequate opportunities and pathways that allow them to learn and develop along different pathways, while at the same time, master a set of life skills and domain knowledge that enables them to maximise their unique potential.",25,501,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00501

2018-07-11-T-017,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Being an educator is not easy. I always make the comment that we will never presume to tell a lawyer how to do his job. You would not go onto a plane to tell a pilot how to fly a plane. Indeed, you would not tell a brain surgeon how to perform surgery. But everybody seems to want to tell teachers and educators how they should teach the children in school, so, it is tough. We have to deal with these expectations. We have to deal with the amount of work outside of the classroom. We have to deal also with the fact that we are shaping and growing young people and young children.",27,503,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00503

Thank you for taking our children from building blocks to the “ABCs”. Thank you for preparing them for the mother-of-all exams. Thank you for guiding them in their coursework and their projects. Thank you for all the academic, the non-academic work and the administrative work that you do outside the classroom.

And lo and behold, the kids who go for these private extra coaching end up on the first team representing the school.

But I raise this now, in light of this Motion, to strongly urge the House that if we are serious about encouraging our children to pursue their passions, that education continues to be the pathway for success for those who have less, then perhaps it is time that we pay more attention to sports education. Sports in our schools should be a meeting place for friendship, fellowship and the pure enjoyment of sport, regardless of your family and financial background.

When conceived and introduced in 2004, the programme was to enable Primary 6 and Secondary 4 students who are exceptionally talented not just in academics but also CCAs, and sports included, to be guaranteed places in secondary schools or JCs, through tests and trials. While the scheme has worked and Minister Ng Chee Meng has announced that a review is being undertaken to address how different schools select students, here are some observations about the scheme that merit further scrutiny.",22,526,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00526

These are sports coaches who have, over the years, studied the DSA entrance requirements of schools and created programmes that aim to guarantee your child a place in the school of choice if you enrol your child in their classes over a period of time. Some of them are so good at it that they will refund the fees if your child does not make it to the school of your choice through the DSA programme.",23,527,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00527

So, parents who can afford the fees would enrol their kids in these programmes. But what do these coaches actually teach? A friend, whose child attended one of these classes, talked about how the coach instructed the child not to pass the ball to his team mates during the trials or when the coaches from the DSA schools were observing him. This is to ensure that the child would outshine his team mates and secure that precious DSA place in the school.",24,528,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00528

Yes, the boy got into the school through DSA, but is now miserable as he does not enjoy the sport and only enrolled and played it to get into the top school. We need to ask ourselves if this is what the DSA scheme is intended to be and if this ""gaming"" of the system is acceptable. Is this what sports is about? Do we want to encourage such behaviour and, worse, reward it, by giving these children places in our top schools?",25,529,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00529
2018-07-11-T-017,Ganesh Rajaram,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"What we need is for the system to also recognise and reward children who exemplify good sportsmanship and character as these are qualities that will stay with them beyond their school sporting careers. Just look at Japan at this year's Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup in Russia. They were a hair's breadth away from beating Belgium and qualifying for the Quarter Finals but the world now remembers them more for their behaviour off the field, for their fair play and how they left their dressing room spotless and penned a note of thanks in Russian to their hosts.",26,530,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00530
2018-07-11-T-017,Ganesh Rajaram,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"Perhaps, the Ministry can work on tweaking the DSA trials to include criteria, such as sportsmanship, fair play and traits and values exhibited like Sean See from St Andrew's Secondary School. Sean, the school's hockey captain, captured our hearts earlier this year when he asked the umpire not to allow a goal that his team had scored when their opponent was not ready, as he felt it would not have been fair to the other team. This resulted in his team eventually losing the match. To me, values, such as integrity and fair play, are as important, if not more, than one's ability as an athlete. By including these other criteria in the DSA selection process, the Ministry would send a strong signal to the teachers, coaches, parents and children about the kind of young Singapore it hopes to nurture.

2018-07-11-T-017,Ganesh Rajaram,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"Mr Speaker, Sir, the other main role in education belongs to us, the parents. Fundamentally, it is up to parents who should know and understand our children best, to make the best decision with them and not for them. Let me share a personal experience which I think has helped me become a better father. I think most people in this House know that I love sport. I played it at all levels and am a true football nut. So, when my son came along, all I dreamed of was to see him have the same passion for sport as I did, and for football, in particular.",28,532,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00532
2018-07-11-T-017,Ganesh Rajaram,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"When he was about four or five years old, I enrolled him in a football academy, as I had wanted him to have a very good foundation. But after a few weeks of watching him from the sidelines, I noticed that while he seemed happy enough, instead of going after the ball and passing it, all he seemed to do was chase after the other children, much like he was playing a game of ""catching"". So, on the way home from training one day, I decided to have a heart-to-heart with him. ""Do you actually enjoy football?"" I asked. ""Yes, daddy, very much"", he said, smiling. Then, I pressed, ""But why do you just chase the kids around?"" The smile on his face turned to a frown and, almost bursting into tears, he said, ""Actually, daddy, I don't like football at all."" So, I said, ""Why didn't you say anything, you don't have to play the sport if you don't like it?"" And his response broke my heart, ""Because you love football, daddy."" That is when I realised that, as a father, I just assumed that my child would love what I loved and would want to be just like me. But I had never bothered to ask him what he liked.",29,533,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00533

He tried everything from aikido, to swimming to table tennis to golf. And, finally, after a few years later, on his own, he began to develop a love for football – thank God! And he is today an accomplished footballer, having played competitive football for school and club. It is a sport he genuinely loves, for all the right reasons. As parents, it is natural to want our children to be just like us and have the same interests as us. As a parent, it is also easy to fall into the trap of seeing other parents and their children succeeding and excelling in different sports and thinking to ourselves our boy or girl could also do that. I know of parents who have pushed their children so hard that their children end up resenting not just the sport but their parents as well.",30,534,2018-07-11-T-017-S-00534

Neither is it for the purpose of competition. Sports are more than that. Children enjoy the benefits of playing in the field through their interaction with one another and learn values, such as comradeship, hard work, discipline and honesty. When children engage themselves in sports, they develop among them the sense of competition, become unenvious, forbearing, develop together good virtues and the sense of accepting defeat.

However, more awareness needs to be created about the use of this credit. Additionally, there must be three ""Flex"" for lifelong learning to be successful.

For instance, in the green energy industry sector, have we trained an adequate number of cohorts to fit this industry under the place-and-train programme, if we find that this will be the future-ready skill that is required now?

It also suggested they scored higher on test anxiety. The adult literacy rate of Singapore increased from 92.5% in 2000 to 96.8% in 2015 with an annual growth rate of 0.75%.

For skills to be truly recognised across Singapore, we must ensure Public Service, Government agencies and Statutory Boards revamp its recruitment methods to provide greater emphasis on aptitude, attitude and skills, with less focus on paper qualification.

One way of doing so is to build up a team of Singapore-based professional markers for humanities subjects, even as we continue to work with Cambridge as our examination partner. These professional markers can be former teachers. But I hope that once they become markers, they should not be allowed to go back to become teachers or part-time tutors. Besides focusing on marking, they can also work closely and strengthen MOE's curriculum development team.

Nevertheless, there could be scope for us to do better. One way we can do so is to examine what is being done in Hong Kong. I am not advocating for our examination board to be privatised like in Hong Kong. Rather, I am suggesting we take a look at how Hong Kong's examination board works with the private sector to accredit certain members of the relevant industries to evaluate students. For example, students learning auto repair would be evaluated by specially accredited actual mechanics, operating in real workshops, rather than in mock-up classrooms. I do understand this is a departure from the current way we evaluate, but I hope that we can at least explore incorporating elements of this approach even for our ""N"", ""O"" and ""A"" levels.",13,643,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00643

Where we can improve is this  MOE and MCCY can collaborate by growing ActiveSG's Sports Academy and Clubs to absorb even more students from all schools and give them co-curricular activity (CCA) under the Leadership Engagement and Development (LEAD) framework.

But because different primary schools have different standards, they have come up with a device and a tool to harmonise and to normalise the standards, so that they are comparable. In this case, the stress is somewhat transferred upstream.

They gathered a large volume of data on students' results and did a multivariate analysis on the key determinants of the results, with a special focus to find out if class size made a difference.",52,702,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00702
2018-07-11-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The conclusion was in the first page of the report on the study, which said, ""No significant relationship was found between class size and achievement."" However, the study did find that, for the learning of Hebrew, the larger the class size, the better the results. There are various explanations behind this, but I would not go into it today.",53,703,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00703
2018-07-11-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),The third study was done in 2011 by the Center for American Progress and the results were particularly insightful and shed light on the results of the two studies I previously cited.,54,704,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00704
2018-07-11-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"It observed that smaller class sizes were a popular idea, but, after tens of billions of dollars were spent across states, particularly in California and Florida, it did not affect results in a statistically significant way. One reason was that in the US' context, smaller class sizes meant hiring of many new teachers who were inexperienced and yet to be effective in the classroom.",55,705,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00705
2018-07-11-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The report said, ""The evidence on class size indicates that smaller classes can, in some circumstances, improve student achievement if implemented in a focused way. But class size reduction policies generally take exactly the opposite approach by pursuing across the board reduction… (They are) also extremely expensive and represented wasted opportunities to make smarter educational investments.""",56,706,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00706
2018-07-11-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"When I was in Finland earlier this year, I visited a secondary school. Finland has a very good education system. And I asked the teachers for their opinion on class sizes. They told me this  they said there are different political parties in Finland and each has a position on the class size. Whoever is elected would then legislate the class size and put it into law.",57,707,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00707
2018-07-11-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),The teachers said they would rather not have the rigidity. Grant the school the teaching resources and give them the flexibility to configure class sizes for different groups of students for different subjects. This is what Singapore has been doing.,58,708,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00708
2018-07-11-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Let me summarise. Earlier generations of Singaporeans have worked hard to uplift their lives and education played a major role. But success creates new problems. The doubts of many Singaporeans – whether meritocracy still works, whether inequality is worsening – are, paradoxically, the results of our policies succeeding and improving the lives of Singapore families. That is why I said tackling inequality is unfinished business.",59,709,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00709
2018-07-11-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"But I stress there is no contradiction between meritocracy and fairness, nor reducing inequality and raising our collective standards. Instead, we should double up on meritocracy, by broadening its definition to embrace various talents and skills. We should not cap achievement at the top, but work harder to lift the bottom.",60,710,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00710
2018-07-11-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"I wanted to set out these fundamentals, because it is important to have broad agreement around them.

Some we will implement. Some may take time to implement. Others may involve trade-offs and we may decide not to implement them for the time being.",62,712,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00712
2018-07-11-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Mr Speaker asked two questions. He asked, “What is the most important school you attend? Who are our most important teachers?” My answer is this  the most important school is our family; the most important teacher is our parents.",63,713,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00713
2018-07-11-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Of course, it takes a village to raise a child. But the home and the parents are one of the most important education experiences all of us would have. Imagine a family is a school and a parent is a teacher. It makes the job of MOE complicated. Between the parent and the child, it is a complex relationship. All of us who are parents would know that there are expectations, love, respect, hopes, fears, and worries, as a parent. It is a complex relationship and MOE is in the middle of it.",64,714,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00714
2018-07-11-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"It also means that being an educator is a great privilege because you get to educate a child who is the most cherished and valuable to the parents. This is why Mr Darryl David mentioned that being a teacher is unlike all other professions, it is unlike a lawyer or a pilot, where nobody questions you on how you do your job. But when it comes to teachers, parents will question, because parents, too, are the most important teachers to the child. And it is a complex relationship between mother and child; father and child. There are so many opinions on education because of that. It is so close to our hearts because it affects the closest people in our lives – our children.",65,715,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00715
2018-07-11-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"It also means that discussions on education can be frustrating and sometimes end up in a stalemate. Parents will say, ""MOE, you better change."" MOE will say, ""I think parents, too, you need to change."" Sometimes, we point fingers at each other. The children do not say this. They look at you and say, ""I think both of you better change.""",66,716,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00716

I feel optimistic and hopeful because, through all these speeches today, it may appear that we have different views. But underlying all that, there is consensus on the direction ahead. I do not think we ever had such a strong chorus of voices in the House, emphasising the importance of joy of learning and cautioning against excessive tuition and relentless chasing of academic results.",67,717,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00717

MOE leads the SkillsFuture movement, which emphasises opportunities for Singaporeans to fulfil their potential, regardless of starting points. A wide range of subsidised modular courses are available through the SkillsFuture series at our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). We also empower individuals to make informed decisions for lifelong learning through the MySkillsFuture portal, which hosts online self-assessment tools.

2018-07-11-T-018,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),"Recognising that children learn better in school when they have a strong early start, we set up the first five MOE Kindergartens in 2014 with the following admissions policy  to reserve one-third of places for Singaporean children from low-income households. This has benefited children like Sitihajar, who may not have had the opportunity to enjoy quality and affordable preschool education otherwise.",5,724,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00724

Last year, her monthly fees at MOE Kindergarten cost $150. But because Sitihajar's family met the income eligibility criteria, her parents only paid a monthly fee of $1.50. As Sitihajar was also enrolled in KCare for afternoon student care, her parents paid $2.10, instead of the monthly fee of $225 for Singapore Citizen children. Sitihajar was also able to redeem three sets of uniforms yearly, as part of the Start-Up Grant of $240.",6,725,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00725

Under this scheme, he has his school and miscellaneous fees waived and receives free textbooks, school attires and transport subsidies. He is automatically placed on the School Meals Programme, where he can use the meal subsidies for breakfast, lunch and recess. With basic needs, such as food and transportation, no longer a concern, Saiful is a friendly and helpful student who is fully engaged in his learning. I should add that MOE's financial assistance would apply to Saiful, even if his family is already receiving concurrent help from other agencies.",8,727,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00727

Over the past few years, Saiful has been able to tap on the school's Opportunity Fund to enjoy co-curricular activities, such as a local learning journey to the River Safari. In the future, as Sitihajar and Saiful progress to a post-secondary educational institution, such as ITE, polytechnics or autonomous universities (AU), we will continue to support them.",9,728,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00728

By raising the annual bursary quantum of the Community Development Council/Citizens Consultative Committee Bursary by between $200 to $400, depending on the institution, we can help students further defray the cost of post-secondary education. We have also enhanced students' access to these bursaries by introducing Gross Monthly Household Income as an alternative income assessment, so that more students qualify for assistance.

MOE remains committed to helping our weaker students in schools through levelling-up initiatives. For example, additional teachers are provided to ensure that the Learning Support Programme and its sister programme, Learning Support for Mathematics, for lower primary students, are conducted in small groups of less than 10.

They will have on-the-job learning at the workplace for three days and continue with their education for the remaining two.

2018-07-11-T-018,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),"Our Allied Educators in Learning and Behavioural Support also work alongside our teachers. Let me illustrate this through the story of Sam from Presbyterian High School. Because of Autism Spectrum Disorder, Sam had difficulties approaching teachers and presenting in class. He would feel sick and look for opportunities to avoid these situations. This is unfortunate, because while Sam has a flair for Chinese orchestral music and plays the ""Ruan"" well, he is afraid of performing in front of others.",35,754,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00754

Eventually, I am happy to share, Sam applied what he learnt and put up a great performance in front of the whole school! We know that there are many more teachers and Allied Educators like Mr Lae out there who are supporting our students to overcome their learning difficulties.",36,755,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00755

MOE fully funds a range of Assistive Technological Devices, also known as AT Devices, for them and also collaborates with two Volunteer Welfare Organisations, the Asian Women's Welfare Association and The Singapore Association for the Deaf, to provide integration and learning support for students with physical and sensory impairments. These organisations also provide training for students and teachers on the use of AT Devices.

Now, I would like to share the story of Emeth, who graduated from MINDS Woodlands Gardens School in 2017. Deemed ready for work, he was referred to the School-To-Work Transition Programme, which MOE jointly launched with MSF, and SGEnable in 2015. Job coaches supported him at various work experiences organised by the school and its industry partners. Emeth's parents also worked with the school to reinforce his travel training skills and build his stamina and fitness for employment. This year, Emeth found employment at the Yishun Community Hospital, in the Kitchen Department, where he works as a Kitchen Attendant.

Mainstream students are learning important lessons on empathy and acceptance of others who are different from them. This includes explicit instruction about the needs of Persons with Disabilities through the Character and Citizenship Education syllabus. Our schools have also developed programmes to strengthen peer support, so that no child is left behind.",40,759,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00759

In the programme, a SPED school is partnered with a mainstream school and both schools provide purposeful activities, such as joint CCA activities, sharing of facilities and joint school celebrations. As we see our SPED students grow in confidence through the programme, we see our mainstream students grow in empathy. However, partnerships and activities are not limited to the Satellite Partnership. At the recent Singapore Youth Festival Concert, students rehearsed and performed alongside each other in a range of items.

This partnership allows for Pathlight students to be taught by Pathlight teachers in self-contained satellite classes sited within mainstream schools. Where appropriate, Pathlight School students join their mainstream peers in their classes for academic learning. This model is possible because the academic and social inclusion opportunities serve the needs of the Pathlight students. The experience is, however, not easy for these students with moderate autism. Yet, gradual exposure over a period of years have benefited these students who go on to post-secondary education institutes.",43,762,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00762

Since 2014, MOE has established Special Education Needs Support Offices, known as SSOs, in each of our AUs, polytechnics, ITE colleges, and arts institutions.

To ensure a smooth transition to Singapore Polytechnic, the SSO and Benjamin’s lecturers worked closely to see how they could facilitate his learning, such as enlarging the font sizes on slides and handouts. The SSO also arranged for Benjamin to visit the Resource Centre at the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped, so he could find the best AT Device for his needs. He eventually chose a handheld device which makes reading easier by enlarging fonts and adjusting the colour contrast of materials.

They have put the focus on the love of learning as the driving force for education and called for the Government and people to work together to ensure that education is accessible, inclusive and lifelong.

2018-07-11-T-018,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The first is that parents want reassurance that their children will have a bright future and that they will not lose out. We have heard much about a future-ready education system, stress, competition, the PSLE, lifelong learning, inclusivity. All these are really different aspects of the same concern, which is, trying to ensure that our children have the best possible chance to succeed.",3,771,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00771
2018-07-11-T-018,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Second, even as we want our children to get ahead, there is also a strong sentiment that we want our children to be able to enjoy their years in school.",4,772,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00772
2018-07-11-T-018,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Mr Louis Ng, Mr Darryl David and Mr Kok Heng Leun spoke about this. We do not want the children's years in school to be only about homework, tests, assessments, grades and examination scores. Schooling must also be an enjoyable educational experience, built around a love of learning, of exploration and of play. It must be holistic, teaching skills like critical thinking, to prepare them for the new world ahead and it must have the emotional well-being of students at heart. Mr Ganesh Rajaram and Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin also spoke about the need to change our culture, that as teachers, parents, as a society, we need to give our children space to grow. We need to listen to them better in order to support them better.",5,773,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00773
2018-07-11-T-018,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Third, many of you also spoke about how this love of learning must be a lifelong one. Ms Thanaletchmi, Assoc Prof Randolph Tan and Mr Darryl David urged that our children must continue to learn after they leave school and throughout their working lives. Employees and employers alike must be nimble and receptive to on-the-job training.",6,774,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00774
2018-07-11-T-018,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Fourth, this debate reflects our social conscience. Many Members of Parliament, including Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan, Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin and Mr Azmoon Ahmad raised the issue of inequality. You worry that the vulnerable, the disabled and the low-income will not be able to get as much out of the education system as those who are better off, that they will get left behind and that the gap is widening. This shows that, as a people, we care about those who are disadvantaged.",7,775,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00775
2018-07-11-T-018,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"A fifth common theme was that of inclusivity, integration and social mixing. Ms Rahayu Mahzam, Ms Chia Yong Yong and Mr Henry Kwek have spoken passionately about this. We are concerned that children born with special needs will go through life without being embraced or valued by society. We are concerned that the divide between rich and poor or between children from different backgrounds and communities may grow. This is important because it says something about our values and the kind of society we want, the kind of people that we are, and we want a society that is more equal, more unified.",8,776,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00776

2018-07-11-T-018,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"On all these broad objectives, we are aligned. These are MOE's objectives, too. We, too, want every child to have a bright future and to do well. Like Members of Parliament who have spoken, we want them to have a wonderful school experience. We are also concerned about the vulnerable and we want integration and inclusivity to be at the heart of our education system. Where we may differ in some aspects are on the strategies or solutions, but let me reassure the House that we are very much at one in terms of the overall aims and objectives.",10,778,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00778
2018-07-11-T-018,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Minister Ong Ye Kung and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Faishal Ibrahim have already explained some of our Ministry's programmes and the considerations behind our work.

Most people do not stop to examine the signage, but, if you did, you would see MOE's mission statement on it, which is  ""Moulding the Future of Our Nation"". It is a mission we take very seriously. MOE has walked a life journey, not just with the nation, but also with every Singaporean who has passed through the education system. Let me show you that journey through the eyes of three generations of women.",12,780,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00780
2018-07-11-T-018,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"When Singapore achieved Independence in 1965, Mdm Iris Wong was 11 years old. She used to walk in the hot sun to May South Primary School. School was often disrupted because of social unrest and racial riots. In those early years when Singapore was a fledgling nation, MOE played a key role in racial harmony and integration, bringing children together in a national school system. Our priority for a newly independent country was mass education for a young population and to help people get jobs in an era of industrialisation.",13,781,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00781
2018-07-11-T-018,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Mdm Wong's education journey ended after Secondary 4, which was considered quite a high attainment in those days. She began work in her father's tailoring shop and had three children, one of whom was a daughter, Josephine. Josephine went to Outram Primary in the 1980s. She drank milk out of little plastic packets and brushed her teeth over the school drain – as I did when I went to primary school in the 1970s! In the 1970s, we had milk, too, because milk was to help children get strong bones as rickets was still a problem at that time, due to poor nutrition in a country that was still not well-off.",14,782,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00782
2018-07-11-T-018,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"By Josephine's time, the economy had changed. We were moving up the value chain, from a lower-skill manufacturing base, which was producing things like fish hooks and matches, to a more capital-intensive and a high-skills economy, producing electronics and petrochemicals. The education system had to adapt to equip Singaporeans to thrive in this new situation and also to address high dropout rates.",15,783,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00783
2018-07-11-T-018,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"That was when streaming was introduced to cater to our children's different learning paces. The school dropout rate fell sharply after streaming. Attrition for the first primary school cohort that was streamed was about one in 10 students, as compared to the previous rates of one in three. Josephine left school, went to polytechnic, worked for a few years and then she got a degree in Marketing Communications. By the time she was being courted by her husband-to-be sometime in the 2000s, the education system was coming of age and undergoing a paradigm shift. We had entered the phase of the knowledge-based economy, where ideas and information are the key drivers of growth. We needed a people with entrepreneurial spirit, the ability to innovate and we had to build intellectual capital.",16,784,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00784
2018-07-11-T-018,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"So, then-Prime Minister Mr Goh Chok Tong introduced a new education philosophy ""Thinking Schools, Learning Nation"", that reduced curriculum time to make room for more inquiry-based activities that would develop creativity and critical thinking. We also gave our schools greater autonomy to be innovative in programmes and invested in Information and Communications Technology. To deliver this, we hired more teachers and strengthened teachers' professional development to improve teaching quality.",17,785,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00785
2018-07-11-T-018,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"In the 2000s, to cater to new and different aspirations, MOE introduced more choices, diversity and flexibility in terms of types of schools and programmes. In 2010, Josephine gave birth to a beautiful baby girl, Vera. Vera is now eight years old. She started primary school in CHIJ Toa Payoh last year. The future that she faces will be very different from that of her grandmother and her mother. The beginning of this decade when she was born marked the end of the Global Financial Crisis and the beginning of what we call the future economy. The future economy calls for a very different sort of education from that undertaken by Iris and Josephine. It will be a VUCA environment – Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous. It is a future driven by the need for skills, innovation, adaptability and flexibility. It will be disrupted by technology. It will see the weight of the global economy shift towards Asia.",18,786,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00786
2018-07-11-T-018,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Members have correctly identified that our education system needs to be able to respond to this.

2018-07-11-T-018,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The reason that I went through this history of MOE is really to show that, at each stage, as times changed, MOE has responded, our education system has responded. It has adapted and adjusted in order to walk that journey with the nation and with Singaporeans.",20,788,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00788

2018-07-11-T-018,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"First, we now put a lot more emphasis on developing the whole child, not just their academic achievements. This is key to our student-centric, values-driven philosophy. I know people do not like jargons like ""student-centric"", but, basically, what it means is we put the child at the centre of it and we build around that. MOE's approach is actually best reflected in our 21st Century Competency Framework. I have asked the Clerks to put copies of this on Members' seats. You may see it and if I could ask you to refer to it. It is often referred to as the MOE Swiss Roll but I think if we want to be technically correct, it should be an Arctic roll; Baby Boomers will know which ice-cream I am referring to.",22,790,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00790
2018-07-11-T-018,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"If you look at it, you will see that the core of the framework is values, because at the end of the day, the most important thing is, for the individuals, what kind of person you are, your character. So, values are at the core of it. And this ties in with Character and Citizenship Development, which we have made as a central part of our education system.",23,791,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00791
2018-07-11-T-018,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The next two rings reflect the social and emotional skills that our children will need to navigate the world ahead; and the outermost ring shows what kind of people we eventually want them to be  confident, able to learn on their own, contributing actively in all their undertakings to society and to be good citizens. So, for the Members who have spoken about the need for character, for good attributes, please be assured that this is actually a focus of our education system.",24,792,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00792
2018-07-11-T-018,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Next, we have to ensure that our children will attain knowledge, to have a solid foundation in literacy and numeracy. But this book knowledge alone is not enough. This year, OECD published a paper entitled ""Education 2030  The Future of Education and Skills"". Future-ready students will need broad knowledge, but also practical skills, like the ability to utilise new technology. These skills will be in great demand by employers. And even this is not enough. The churn and change caused by technology and other disruptive factors means that learning has to continue well into adult life. The ability to learn, unlearn and relearn will be key.",25,793,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00793
2018-07-11-T-018,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Much of the stress that we have talked about is really driven by the assumption that there is only one path to success – the academic route.

Others are much better with their hands or are more creative and artistic. And different children respond differently to different methods of teaching. The future economy will be much more diverse than today's. Doctors, lawyers, engineers, architects and accountants will still be around, but the way they do their jobs will be very different. There will be increased demand for jobs in new areas like Financial Technology, Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality. Dell Technologies recently released a report based on a survey of 3,800 business leaders across the world.

We have the Sports School to cater for sporting talent, School of The Arts for those artistically inclined; we have the NUS High School of Math and Science for those who are Science, Technology, Engineeering and Mathematics (STEM)-inclined; and the School of Science and Technology which focuses on STEM as well, but their curriculum also centres on applied and interdisciplinary learning.

We have secondary schools with Enhanced Art and Music programmes. Mr Kok Heng Leun spoke passionately about Arts and the Humanities.

So, in its place, we introduced differentiated learning, which recognises that different children have different strengths and also learn different subjects at different paces.

It is our educators who motivate students and who identify opportunities for them. For example, Outram Secondary School has a remarkable principal, Mr Boo Hian Kok. He formed a task force, consisting of teachers and Student Welfare Officers, to address Long-Term Absentee cases, the children who did not turn up for school. For those teachers, their calendar is cleared for the first few periods in the morning. If students do not turn up by 8.00 am, these teachers will make phone calls, visit homes, knock on their doors and encourage the families to send them to school.",68,836,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00836

He used to skip school because his stepmother has a chronic illness and he had to buy her meals. With the school’s help, he now stays with his grandparents, who are better able to care for him. He loves soccer, so, the school placed him in a special soccer programme to encourage him to come back. His attendance is now regular.

But mindset is a difficult thing to change. It takes time. And we call on all partners to do this. As I was reading the newspapers today, I flipped to the Forum page and I saw a letter written by a young, 17-year-old JC student, Teo Chen Wei. He was talking about PSLE. He wondered whether removing the T-score might help, or whether it might actually result in other means of stress. But the most telling thing in his letter was this  he said, “The most effective way to improve the education system is for parents and children to accept that failure in examinations is not failure in life”.

So, you could be excellent in aeronautics, or the culinary arts. Whatever it is, we want excellence because we want our people to do well. At the same time, does failure mean that you cannot progress? The answer is no, because we have created so many different pathways and we hope that people will see a setback as something from which to learn and to move forward.",76,844,2018-07-11-T-018-S-00844

And the Ministry has come forward to say that there are areas where the imperfections are there. The Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) is not perfect.

2018-07-11-T-020,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan,"The first is there has to be a move away from the stalemate between parents and the education system. This is also problematic because a lot of system designers within MOE are also parents. So, I think the first point that has to be made and that has been made by the three Government speakers earlier, is that everyone acknowledges that stress is there. Everyone acknowledges that the children, or the young persons, or the students are dealing with this stress. How do we alleviate these problems without sacrificing excellence and meritocracy? That has to be at the core of this.",4,853,2018-07-11-T-020-S-00853
2018-07-11-T-020,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan,"The second point that I would like to make is that perhaps when we look at these points, moving away from the stalemate and, in fact, the acknowledgements that the PSLE and other systems are imperfect, is that not every sacred cow needs to be sacrificed.

We know banding is going to happen, we know certain other aspects are going to be significantly changed. But I think parents generally, Singaporean parents, are wondering what will really differ so that I do not have to go and pay all my money to a tuition teacher.

I understand the need for national examinations so that we know, we can allow students to, up to some point, be assessed and then, find the kind of things that they want to go for. Is it possible that we consider, like in some other Scandinavian countries whereby basic education should last more than six years? It can start from six to 16 and, during that process, especially when we have this 21st Century Transformation Plan, where there is so much content in there, that, within those six years or even more and when there are examinations and national examinations in between, the process of learning actually cannot be deep enough. Because you will be moving from learning a bit to preparing for examinations. And I think perhaps the Ministry should start thinking about – that, in the long run, that we should have this shift.",1,857,2018-07-11-T-020-S-00857
2018-07-11-T-020,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun,"The second thing is about play which fellow Members have talked about, purposeful play. It is just scary that every play becomes purposeful. Then, you would not be playful. Sometimes, whimsical play is equally important because it is only when it is whimsical, that we actually make greater discovery.",2,858,2018-07-11-T-020-S-00858
2018-07-11-T-020,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Deputy Speaker, purposeful play is for the learning part, but they do also have just play-play. They do, so do not worry. There are both types of play. We will certainly encourage our teachers and remind them of that.",1,859,2018-07-11-T-020-S-00859
2018-07-11-T-020,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"On PSLE, there has been a lot of debate on that. I think we all agree that it is not a perfect system, but it is something that has stood us in good stead.",2,860,2018-07-11-T-020-S-00860
2018-07-11-T-020,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"We do not want to dismantle something which really helps us to channel the students to the further path ahead. But I think the point that Mr Kok Heng Leun is really making is that, prior to age 12, or leading up to age 12, you want them to enjoy their learning; you want them to have enough content that they have a solid foundation; you do not want them to have so much stress that, not only do they not enjoy it, but it really becomes self-defeating in terms of the educational purpose.",3,861,2018-07-11-T-020-S-00861
2018-07-11-T-020,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, as I have said earlier, on those broad objectives, we are aligned. And we will find ways. So, as we have said, we will work together on this. And, in fact, as Members have said, there is much hope, we are working to transform the system so that our students can be ready for the future. We look forward to working with Members, parents, teachers, educators in accomplishing this purpose.",4,862,2018-07-11-T-020-S-00862

2018-07-11-T-022,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister),"Within a job, the specific pay of officers would differ given differences in factors, such as experience, skills and performance on the job. For candidates with no work experience at the point of recruitment, their starting salaries may be differentiated by qualification given that it is useful as a proxy for depth of knowledge and skill. However, once the officer is in service, his progression depends on his performance and potential and is independent of starting qualifications.",2,877,2018-07-11-T-022-S-00877
2018-07-11-T-023,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"asked the Minister for Law with regard to neighbour disputes concerning cigarette smoke (a) whether mediation can be made compulsory for all involved parties; (b) whether there is any follow-up to ensure respondents continue to adhere to the terms of a settlement; and (c) for those who do not proceed with mediation, how are these disputes typically resolved.",1,878,2018-07-11-T-023-S-00878
2018-07-11-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Community mediation is generally a voluntary process and can be proceeded with only if both parties agree to mediate.,1,879,2018-07-11-T-023-S-00879
2018-07-11-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"For cases that do not proceed with mediation, the parties may end up resolving their issues through other informal means. For example",2,880,2018-07-11-T-023-S-00880
2018-07-11-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,(a) they have directly communicated with each other and arrived at a resolution; or,3,881,2018-07-11-T-023-S-00881
2018-07-11-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,(b) grassroots or community leaders have assisted the parties to hold a conversation that leads to a satisfactory outcome for them.,4,882,2018-07-11-T-023-S-00882
2018-07-11-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"However, for intractable cases where parties are unable to resolve their disputes by voluntary mediation or other informal means, the aggrieved party can file a case with the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT) as a last resort. The CDRT judge can order the parties to attend mandatory mediation in the Courts or at the Community Mediation Centre (CMC), attend counselling or fix the case for hearing.",5,883,2018-07-11-T-023-S-00883
2018-07-11-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Therefore, while community mediation is generally voluntary, an avenue of compulsory mediation does exist and the failure to comply with the CDRT's order to attend mediation may attract legal consequences. Where the CDRT judge, on hearing the parties, decides to make a Court Order, this order can entail the payment of damages, require a party to do or refrain from doing something (for example, take measures to prevent cigarette smoke from drifting into neighbouring units), or apologise. If a party breaches the Court Order, the other party can apply for a Special Direction to ensure compliance. A refusal to comply with a Special Direction may lead to, among other measures, an Exclusion Order. This requires the non-compliant party to move out of his home.",6,884,2018-07-11-T-023-S-00884
2018-07-11-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Written settlements reached by parties through mediation at CMC are private contracts. These contracts are binding on both parties. The aggrieved party, therefore, has the option to enforce the agreement through civil proceedings. Alternatively, if the parties feel it may be useful, CMC will offer parties another round of mediation at no further cost.",7,885,2018-07-11-T-023-S-00885

There are currently over 100 PCPs in about 30 sectors, which is approximately twice the number of PCPs a year ago. New PCPs for internal auditors, financial forensic professionals and consultants have been launched this year. We will continue to monitor demand, expand programme capacity and introduce new PCPs where appropriate, to provide more opportunities for mid-career jobseekers.",2,888,2018-07-11-T-024-S-00888

Over 1,100 PMETs were placed through CSP in 2017. Of these, more than 500 (46%) were aged 50 and above, almost three times higher than in 2016. We will press on with efforts to raise awareness of CSP among employers and older PMETs.",3,889,2018-07-11-T-024-S-00889
