2018-08-06-T-003,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David,asked the Minister for Defence whether the Government can consider deferring National Service for outstanding young male Singaporeans who have the potential to accomplish significant successes in fields other than sports if those successful achievements can also bring international fame and recognition for Singapore.,1,27,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00027

2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to take the six PQs that are directed to MINDEF and to give a common reply from Question Nos 20 to 25.",1,35,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00035
2018-08-06-T-003,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Please do.,1,36,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00036
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mr Speaker, I thank Members for their questions. It allows MINDEF to explain our policies. Singapore's founding leaders knew the strict conditions that National Service (NS) would impose on its citizens when they passed the National Service (Amendment) Bill. This was 51 years ago and the Enlistment Act in 1970. In 1984, just as he was about to retire, a reflective Dr Goh Keng Swee acknowledged it plain and simple, ""National Service imposes (not only) a great sacrifice of time and money on the young men called up."" But Dr Goh followed with the reason why this sacrifice was called for and why NS was crucial to our nation's survival. I continue, quote, Dr Goh's words, ""deep in his heart the average Singapore citizen knows the danger he faces are real and not hypothetical, and that there is a need to defend ourselves.""",1,37,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00037
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The Appellate High Court also brought their minds to bear on our NS policy, just as recently as 2017 last year. This was during an appeal on the sentencing of NS defaulters. Their written judgement spelt out the reasons why more stringent sentencing benchmarks were justified but those same reasons lie at the heart of what various Members of Parliament (MPs) asked today – Dr Lim Wee Kiak, Mr Darryl David, Mr Sitoh Yih Pin, Ms Joan Pereira, Mr Muhamad Faishal Abdul Manap, and Dr Intan Mokhtar in her Question for Written Answer. In various forms, they asked these questions  how strict is this requirement for every male to serve his NS when required? What exceptions or flexibility can be given?",2,38,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00038
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"It was a landmark decision, presided over by the Chief Justice. The Appellate High Court referred to Deputy Prime Minister Teo's Ministerial Statement given in 2006 to this House, when he was Defence Minister. That Ministerial Statement coupled with the written judgment of the Appellate High Court, illuminate the fundamentals on which our NS policy are based, that we must not unwittingly weaken lest we undo this nation’s foundations. I urge all Members to read them. It is crucial. The judges opined that, ""In practical terms, what the three fundamental principles of national security, universality and equity mean is that in order to ensure Singapore's national survival, every male Singaporean must serve NS and at the time he is required to under the (Enlistment) Act, without regard to his personal convenience and considerations. When a person refuses to serve NS at the time that he is required to and instead returns to serve at a time of his own choosing, or worse, at an age when he can no longer serve, his actions strike at the very core of the principles of national security, universality and equity.""",3,39,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00039
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Thirteen NS defaulters were prosecuted after the new sentencing framework was established last year. In Court, in every case, each of them gave reasons why he did not enlist as required. Some wanted to complete their university degree first before NS. Others said they had to support their families. But in every case, in every judgment, the Courts dismiss these personal reasons, convicted and sentenced them to jail because harsh as it is, the Enlistment Act is blind to ""personal convenience and considerations"", no matter how talented the individual, no matter how exceptional his circumstances. That is the core of the Enlistment Act. The critical need for a strong defence puts aside personal pursuits and mandates that each liable male performs his NS when required. This is the law our founding leaders and subsequent leaders passed in this House. We may have forgotten it or diluted it, but the Enlistment Act stands.",4,40,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00040
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The written judgment noted that everyone was asked to do his ""fair share"". ""This entails every citizen who is required to serve NS making sacrifices or postponing individual goals to serve the nation when the nation needs his service"". The sum of it – these arguments spell out in unequivocal terms the NS obligations for every Singaporean male.",5,41,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00041
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"So, deferment cannot be for the individual, no matter how talented, to pursue his own interests or career. In other words, because I am so exceptional in talent, I deserve to be deferred. This is not the Enlistment Act. No matter how talented, and even if it vicariously brings credit or fame to Singapore because that would be fundamentally wrong and goes against the core principle of equity.",6,42,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00042
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The Enlistment Act is blind to talent, personal considerations, personal circumstances.",7,43,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00043
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Some Singaporeans have voiced the same opinions over Mr Davis' application. I assume Members filed these questions as a result of that. Mr Suresh Nair, who wrote to our feedback unit and said this, ""Let this Davis case be the right and timely reminder of the need for absolute fairness in applying laws regarding NS deferment"". He has understood this.",8,44,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00044
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Therefore, to preserve equity for all national servicemen, MINDEF will only defer individuals very selectively if their deferment serves Singapore's interest first and foremost, never their own. That is the only basis. This was the only basis to defer three sportsmen, swimmers Joseph Schooling and Quah Zheng Wen, and sailor Maximilian Soh, from NS so that they could train and compete in the Olympics. The sportsmen who were deferred, knew this because clear expectations were laid out when deferment was given. We discussed it with MCCY on the standards required for their training. Neither was deferment open-ended nor unconditional. They will have to return to serve NS, and if they do not meet the standards agreed upon, deferment will be curtailed. These strict conditions are necessary because even for these individuals who can bring glory to Singapore, there are detractors, who think it's unfair for anyone to be deferred. Mr T. Ng wrote to MINDEF, “Please be fair to all Singaporean males, who spent years serving NS. Every Singaporean male’s career is important from his own point of view.”",9,45,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00045
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Disruption for individuals after they are enlisted for NS follows the same principles and is also given only for national reasons. We disrupt medical students to complete their medical studies because we need them to serve as Medical Officers during their NS to take care of their fellow soldiers. It is not a personal career choice. We need them. It is not an entitlement and once the reasons are no longer valid, the disruption will end. No discussions. For example, we previously allowed overseas medical students to disrupt, but this was stopped in 1992, when we could produce enough doctors locally. You can appeal, but we will just say ""no"", because we have enough. Similarly, dental students were not disrupted after 1989, as there was no need for NS Dental Officers. And for transparency, MINDEF publishes a full list of all medical students who are disrupted every year.",10,46,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00046
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Having stated the general principles, let me explain why the application by Mr Harvey Davis for his son's deferment was rejected even though MINDEF recognised that his son, Mr Ben Davis' achievement in obtaining a senior contract with Fulham Football Club (FC).",11,47,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00047
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"First, Mr Ben Davis is playing for Fulham FC as an English national, not a Singaporean citizen. MINDEF is not privy to the contract signed between them, but we assume this published information is correct and that the father must have his reasons for doing so.",12,48,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00048
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Second, Mr Harvey Davis has consistently refused to indicate when his son would return to serve NS, if deferred. The father replied to MCCY, Sport Singapore (SportSG) and Football Association of Singapore (FAS), stating, ""We are unable to commit to a date for his return should he be playing professional football in the United Kingdom or Europe. In addition, it is also a possibility that Ben could be offered a new two-year contract in 2019 after the first year of his pro- contract just like he has been offered a new two-year pro contract half way through his two-year scholarship contract. Or, he could be sent out on loan or sold to another club. There are a lot of variables all dependent on his development and progression.""",13,49,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00049
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Third, if he was not granted deferment, the father indicated that Mr Ben Davis would still proceed to sign the contract, and he has done so. The reason given by the father was that his son would only return to fulfil his NS commitment if he is unsuccessful in his professional career. In fact, Mr Harvey Davis went further after MINDEF rejected the application – that he would consider the option for his son to renounce his Singapore citizenship in order to pursue his career.",14,50,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00050
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The father's responses made clear his intent for his son to pursue a professional football career to the fullest. If Mr Ben Davis will not give up his senior contract, which he is now offered, which provides for an allowance of a few hundred pounds a week, to serve his NS, it is even more unlikely that he will return to serve NS if he subsequently gets offered a contract worth many times more. And if he is not given a further contract with Fulham FC, the father has said that he may find other clubs which his son can be loaned to.",15,51,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00051
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The application by Mr Harvey Davis for his son’s deferment is to further his son’s professional career first and to the longest extent possible. He has been quite open about this. And you would have read what he said. Singapore and her interests, including his son's NS obligations, are secondary considerations, if at all. There has been no indication, commitment or plans as to how Mr Ben Davis would help football standards in Singapore, if deferred. Mr Harvey Davis has urged MINDEF to approve deferment for his son so that it would serve as an inspiration, he tells us, for the 1,000 students registered with his company JSSL, 500 or so who are local. For your information, JSSL Singapore, or Junior Soccer School & League Singapore, is a youth football club and academy business run by Mr Harvey Davis, and advertises itself as having links to Fulham FC.",16,52,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00052
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"MINDEF could not find any valid grounds to approve the application for deferment by Mr Harvey Davis for his son. There is no commitment to serve Singapore or our national interests. To grant deferment to Mr Ben Davis to pursue his personal development and professional career would be unfair to the many others who have served their NS dutifully as required, and not at a time of their choosing. It would also erode the basis on which our Courts have upheld the Enlistment Act passed by Parliament and punished those for not fulfilling their NS liabilities but instead pursue their own personal concerns and careers.",17,53,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00053
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"As a writer, Mr Patrick Tan Siong Kuan, wrote to The Straits Times Forum, ""The defence of our country cannot be a matter of serving when it is most convenient. It is a responsibility that every man must take seriously when called upon, regardless of race, family connections or financial status. It takes personal sacrifice and putting the country before self. Otherwise, there will be no Singapore tomorrow.""",18,54,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00054
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mr Suresh Nair who wrote to the MINDEF Feedback Unit said this, ""If Davis is proud of his red passport, he must do what every Singapore teenager does, to dutifully observe the National Service obligations.""",19,55,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00055
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"I know it must be difficult for a 17-year-old, Mr Ben Davis, to receive such public attention. It was never MINDEF's intent, but we had to respond to his father’s claims to the media to explain to Members of Parliament and Singaporeans the basis of our decision on this crucial national policy.",20,56,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00056
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"I have dealt with the application by Mr Harvey Davis for his son. Let me now address the important issue that Members of Parliament have asked – can and how do we achieve sporting excellence, including for team sports, if National Service duties are to be fulfilled? I think that was the second thing most Members asked. National Service does require sacrifices, certainly personal ones, but performing one’s National Service duties and pursuing national aspirations for sports excellence need not be mutually exclusive.",21,57,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00057
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Many talented sportsmen have served National Service as required and yet at the same time raised the level of their own skills and the teams they played with. To MINDEF's knowledge, there are three other footballers who have also been talent-spotted to take part in trials for professional leagues overseas. All three have completed their National Service as required – Saifullah Akbar, and Ikhsan and Irfan Fandi. In fact, Saifullah Akbar and Ikhsan Fandi asked to be enlisted early, presumably so that they could complete their NS first to pursue their professional careers.",22,58,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00058
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Prior to enlisting, Saifullah played for the Under-16 national team and he was actually spotted by a professional Australian club at age 16 but he went ahead to enlist for NS. During their National Service, Irfan and Ikhsan trained and played for the Under-22 national team during the 2017 SEA Games. They were supported by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and Home Team. Irfan and Ikhsan are now playing for the Young Lions in the Singapore Premier League and representing Singapore in regional football competitions. I understand Irfan has gone for trials with European clubs, including an upcoming trial with Sporting Braga, and Saifullah and Ikhsan are slated to follow suit at CD Tenerife and Braga. I am not a football fan, so these clubs are quite foreign to me, but you would know it, football fans out there. This is a good sign for football in Singapore and talented footballers.",23,59,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00059
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Talented footballers, Ben Davis included, can emulate the example of Irfan, Saifullah and Ikhsan to complete their National Service duties as required and also advance their professional football careers. In fact, Saifullah Akbar will finish his National Service today and he is going to try out for a European club. You may have read his interviews, they asked him, ""How did you feel when you were called up for National Service?"" He said, ""I tried to have a positive attitude. I told myself that army training will strengthen me. And now that I have finished NS, I can go on to pursue my dreams"". For him, it was never a choice that he had to make not to fulfil his National Service obligations like everyone else. He said, ""I had to train harder"" but he kept a positive attitude. That is the kind of example we want young Singaporeans to emulate.",24,60,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00060
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"For the recent SEA Games in 2015 and 2017, MINDEF supported those competing, whether they were competing individually or as a team. We adjusted some enlistment dates for national servicemen, so that they could participate in the Games first and enlist later. This included some footballers. Those who were already enlisted were given time off to train and maintain their peak performance. For the upcoming Asian Games later this month, so far, 10 of our national servicemen have been given a short postponement of their enlistment of a few weeks, or if they have been enlisted, they have been given time off to train for the Games. This includes a member of the Water Polo team who clinched their 27th straight SEA Games Gold last year. We wish all these sportsmen every success and hope that they can continue to do well for Singapore in the Asian Games and beyond.",25,61,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00061
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"MINDEF has done more. Beyond these provisions, we have offered disruption to Full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) competing in these games. But very few have chosen to disrupt, presumably because they are able to train adequately in the SAF.",26,62,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00062
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"These many examples show that MINDEF has exercised flexibility towards sportsmen competing in team sports, a question asked by Dr Intan, Mr Muhamad Faisal and others. But we have done so without transgressing the fundamentals of National Service and still maintaining equity for all national servicemen. MINDEF will work with MCCY, SportSG and other relevant agencies through various pathways that can allow sportsmen to do well and still fulfil their National Service obligations, whether it is individual or team sports.",27,63,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00063
2018-08-06-T-003,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Let me thank the Minister for the very, very long and elaborate explanation. I think we all agree that National Service is pivotal and essential to our national security.",1,64,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00064
2018-08-06-T-003,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"I would like to just seek a clarification from the Minister now. Currently, is there a rising trend in terms of application for deferment or disruption for NS with regard to sports excellence over the last few years? That is number one.",2,65,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00065
2018-08-06-T-003,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Number two is that if Ben Davis had given a date to say that he would return, will NS consider his deferment?",3,66,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00066
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mr Speaker, as Member of Parliament Dr Lim Wee Kiak noted, I have given a long reply. Because this is crucial to state the fundamentals of our National Service policy and from that, whether deferment or disruption can be given. We have to understand that, our Courts have upheld it. I said, after the revision of the sentencing benchmarks, 13 defaulters went to jail. So, the Courts take it very seriously and I know Members here too.",1,67,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00067
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"You asked specifically whether there has been a trend in increased applications. I do not have the figures but I do not think so. What MINDEF has done is to, on its own, work with MCCY and SportSG to increase flexibility, and I gave some details in terms of adjusting enlistment dates, disruptions, time-off. And the fact that we have less people disrupting or taking up the offers to disrupt indicates to me that they probably have weighed what they wanted to do and did not see the need to disrupt.",2,68,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00068
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked a hypothetical question  if someone like Mr Davis had said that they would come back, would it have affected our judgement. I have spent a long time explaining how we decide. If you come back to serve your NS, it is your duty. But the main considerations are  is there a national interest? It can never be for personal pursuits, it must be for national interest, first and foremost.",3,69,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00069
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"In the last 15 years, we have agreed to long-term deferments for three sportsmen who met that, and we will continue to keep to those standards so that we can be fair to other national servicemen who do their NS dutifully, who put aside their own careers to do NS, as well as not undermine the Court's basis for sentencing those who default the National Service.",4,70,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00070
2018-08-06-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),I thank the Minister for the clarification. I just wanted to clarify two further points.,1,71,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00071
2018-08-06-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"First, I understand that Ben Davis was called up to play for Singapore but he was never capped which meant he was never fielded for Singapore. But is it correct that all those who in fact played for Singapore have found a way to do their National Service duties alongside representing the country? That is the first.",2,72,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00072
2018-08-06-T-003,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Second, even where national athletes are deferred, is it always pegged to representing the country at a specific game, for example, rather than just open-ended?",3,73,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00073
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mr Speaker, I am not privy to all the facts for Mr Davis – or MINDEF is not privy to all the facts – as I understand it. By FIFA rules, he has not played for Singapore. So, he is still free to choose which country he wants to play for. FIFA rules are quite interesting, and this is from my understanding; I stand corrected, but you can only choose one country for the rest of your life. That particular shirt you wear can never be changed. Even if you change your citizenship, you can only represent one country. In that sense, I think they have taken a particular philosophy.",1,74,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00074
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The question is  do you peg those deferred? The key consideration is national interest. There is a misconception that you can be deferred if you are exceptionally talented. That is not the Enlistment Act. How do you decide between one who is exceptionally talented versus another with exceptional circumstances? Someone who is poor who needs to work to support his family because the parents are sick. From the Court's point of view, they have ruled that personal considerations – put aside. That has been the basis and I think that is correct.",2,75,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00075
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Now, obviously, you need some talent, exceptional talent, to be able to compete and bring glory to the country. That is a given. We judge it on that basis. It is never easy, it is not a science. We will consider each case with all the facts and make a decision and tell the public, if not, satisfy the majority of national servicemen, who put aside personal considerations to do their National Service duties.",3,76,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00076
2018-08-06-T-003,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"I thank the Minister for the reply. I think we all agree on the critical importance of National Service and the sanctity of serving the country. I have a couple of supplementary questions, Mr Speaker.",1,77,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00077
2018-08-06-T-003,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"First of all, will the Minister or MINDEF be prepared to consider sport that perhaps cannot be so quantitatively assessed? For example, should a Singaporean sportsman one day win the Australian Junior Open Tennis Championship and have a real possibility of achieving success on a global stage, thereby playing under the Singapore flag, would we be able to consider something like that?",2,78,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00078
2018-08-06-T-003,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"My second question is, would we be able to consider outstanding achievement in activities other than sports, say, in performing arts or perhaps even in music.",3,79,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00079
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen:,"The answer is ""yes"", if it satisfies the criteria that I talked about, that we maintain equity for all other national servicemen, and that it serves the national interest, never their own. The first example the Member gave was that he competes in tennis and then he decides he wants to be a professional tennis player before he comes back, obviously, that will affect our considerations.",1,80,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00080
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen:,"The second question is outstanding achievements. Yes, in fact, we have. We have gone on record to say that we have deferred some very exceptional musicians. And as I have said, it is not a science and, for the cases that we have deferred, they went on to their development and enlisted either at the same time or very soon after their cohorts were also enlisted. So, there was equity maintained. Similarly for academic. I know that we have on record somebody who entered university in his teens but completed his university education at the same time that his cohorts went to the army and he went in together with them. So, those considerations are maintained.",2,81,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00081
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen:,"So, the key considerations are how do we maintain equity for all national servicemen, and for national interests.",3,82,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00082
2018-08-06-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied):,"I thank the Minister for the clarification on the deferment policy. I asked a question on deferment during the Committee of Supply in 2012 and I asked my question in relation to the Olympics because there is this constant reference to a high watermark sporting event before deferment is considered by MINDEF, or at least that is the popular perception. In the 2012 reply given by the Minister, it was stated that 13 athletes were deferred for a period of two to six months to participate in the 2011 SEA Games and the 2010 Asian Games. Can I confirm that with the Minister's Statement, there is no change in the policy for NS deferment?",1,83,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00083
2018-08-06-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied):,"The second question actually is picking up from what Dr Lim Wee Kiak said about a two-year contract. For example, if a Singaporean commits to return to performing his NS after his cohort has been called up, let us say at the age of 18, and that individual says, ""At the age of 20, no matter how this training contract goes, I will come back to serve"", would MINDEF allow deferment in that particular case?",2,84,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00084
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen:,"Let me answer the first question which is more factual. If I said so in Parliament, it must be so. The Hansard says so and there is no change in our deferment policy. On the fundamental principles, we must maintain equity for all national servicemen, and it must be for national interest, never for personal interest. So, that has not changed. In fact, it has not changed over the time that MINDEF has administered this policy.",1,85,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00085
2018-08-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen:,"On the second question, my reply to Dr Lim Wee Kiak is that I really do not want to engage in hypothetical circumstances. We assess the individual as it is. It is hypothetical, indeed. If you are not willing to come back to serve your NS when you are earning a few hundred pounds a week, how is MINDEF to believe that you would come back when you are earning many times more? So, that has to come into consideration. And also he has to serve the purposes for deferment based on our current policy.",2,86,2018-08-06-T-003-S-00086

The Minister for Defence has, in his earlier reply to PQs, explained how MINDEF has accommodated the training requirements of enlisted Team Singapore athletes, and allowed these athletes to take up additional training opportunities in the lead-up to the Major Games – within the duration of their NS. For instance, enlisted members of the national football and water polo teams have in the past been given permission to train with their team mates in preparation for the Southeast Asian Games and other major international competitions.

In the case of Joseph, his original NS deferment was from 2013 to the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.

For team sports, we have to adopt a whole-team development strategy which covers the entire squad of athletes, beyond just an individual athlete. We have several considerations when we assess our support for NS-liable athletes involved in team sports. For example, we look at the robustness of the NSA's development plans for the team, whether there is a clear target for a Major Games competition in sight and the plans to achieve this, as well as the individual athlete’s role and potential contribution to the national team.

Besides engaging industry associations like the Singapore Contractors Association Limited and the Commercial Diving Association of Singapore, we also issue regular alerts to share learning points from recent accidents. For example, we have notified companies on the dangers of improper use of material hoists, which led to a fatal accident in a food factory.

We have completed about 80% of the extended inspections. What we have done so far is to issue six stop-work orders and 164 composition fines amounting to $188,750.

2018-08-06-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Administrative and Support Services, Construction, Education, Infocomm and Professional Services are among the top five sectors which firms on the FCF Watchlist belong to. These firms employ a range of occupations such as architects and engineers, business professionals, IT professionals and managers with many being paid between $3,000 and $10,000. Firms on the FCF Watchlist will have their Employment Pass applications scrutinised, and consequently experience longer processing times. The Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) also engages these firms to offer assistance to improve their hiring practices. To date, over 2,000 Singaporean PMETs have been hired by firms on the FCF Watchlist.",2,120,2018-08-06-T-006-S-00120

I just want to ask the Minister since the update during COS on the number of companies that are on the FCF Watchlist which is 350, has there been an increase or a decrease. Likewise, because of the new broadened coverage of the FCF with effect from 1 July this year, what is the MOM seeing? Has there been an increase or a decrease in the number of Watchlist companies?",1,123,2018-08-06-T-006-S-00123
2018-08-06-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, the number of companies on the Watchlist is largely stable. We continue to work with each one of them to improve their hiring practices. As and when we are told of companies that have practices that are suspected to be discriminatory, TAFEP will engage the companies. Our intent is really to help them improve their practices in order to be fairer and more progressive towards Singaporeans. So, the number that we work with is not a fixed target, but it does give an indication of the intensity of the effort that we are applying.",1,124,2018-08-06-T-006-S-00124

We have expanded the requirement so that more companies that employ Employment Pass-holders have to make known the jobs that they are seeking candidates for.

2018-08-06-T-007,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I thank the Minister of State for the reply. Could I just check further whether 2% is about 14,000 workers every year? It is quite a huge number.

2018-08-06-T-007,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"On the first question, certainly, I think that all the foreign workers have direct access to MOM if they want to make a complaint. At this moment, we do not take every written change at the point of application. But having said that, when there is a dispute, we will require the documentation to be provided. And the law protects the worker, especially when there is no documentation provided in terms of written agreement of the change in salary.",2,138,2018-08-06-T-007-S-00138
2018-08-06-T-007,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Thank you, Sir. Just one more question. I understand that the reply is that five in 10 of these salary reductions occurred within one year from the work permit issue date. But could I also check whether we have data on how many of the salary reductions occurred before the work permit issue date – which means that the foreign workers were promised a salary, but when they arrived in Singapore, the salary was immediately reduced. Does this conduct constitute providing false information to MOM during the work permit application stage?",1,139,2018-08-06-T-007-S-00139
2018-08-06-T-007,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Thank you. In short, any reduction in salary before the work permit issuance will constitute an offence.

Subsequently, as part of the Government's overall move to encourage Singaporeans towards home-ownership, HDB sold existing 3-room rental flats to the sitting tenants, and closed the 3-room rental register in 1982. Hence, when HDB resumed the rental building programme in 2007, only 1- and 2-room flats were built.",1,146,2018-08-06-T-008-S-00146

2018-08-06-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"There are no plans to impose a limit on the number of family members who can live in a rental flat or to impose occupancy standards for such flats.

2018-08-06-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"When HDB closed the 3-room register in 1982, the experience was that many of these families, in fact, preferred to buy, rather than to rent, the 3-room flats because it made more financial sense for them. They could pay using their CPF, and at the end of the day, they would have a flat of their own.",2,152,2018-08-06-T-008-S-00152
2018-08-06-T-008,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, if you were to talk about families, larger families who want to apply for two separate units, they would have to pay a larger rental amount. Some of them may prefer not to do so. They may prefer to save, for example. If it is a first-timer family, they may very well prefer to build up their savings first in order to buy a flat later. So, I think there are multiple needs here.

2018-08-06-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Regarding the second question about plastic bag charge, as I have said earlier, the NEA life-cycle assessment study has shown that different types of disposables – whether it is single-use plastics or other types of bags – have an impact and cost on the environment, even biodegradable bags, because you need lots of water for production, for instance, or there will be forest destruction and greenhouse gas emissions in the process.",4,182,2018-08-06-T-010-S-00182
2018-08-06-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"What we are really looking at is how we can do this in a holistic manner. In fact, a city like San Francisco, for instance, is now imposing a charge not just on single-use plastic bags, but all kinds of disposable bags, paper as well as plastics. We are monitoring this closely to see the effectiveness of the policy.",5,183,2018-08-06-T-010-S-00183
2018-08-06-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Having said that, what is important is, we need to look at our local context, to adopt a rational and discerning approach to design policies suited to our unique needs and circumstances. In Singapore, for instance, the SEC study, the recent survey has shown that two-thirds of the respondents who take single-use plastic bags from supermarkets, say that they use these bags to bag and dispose their garbage. In fact, many of us stay in high-rise apartments and we use plastic bags to bag and dispose our garbage. It has taken us many years from the 1970s to get Singaporeans to do this. It is a key way for hygienic disposal of waste. Therefore, we cannot take this for granted. We need to carefully consider how imposing a mandatory charge on single-use plastics will impact on such behaviour.",6,184,2018-08-06-T-010-S-00184
2018-08-06-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Secondly, we have proactive measures in place to tackle the harmful effects of plastic in the oceans and landfills, which are actually the subject of discussion by many other countries and internationally. We have a safe and efficient waste management and disposal system. All our plastic bags that are disposed properly will be incinerated. They do not go directly into the landfill. Even for those that may get into our waterways, we have measures in place – litter traps for instance and flotsam removal craft – to retrieve these bags before they go into the sea.",7,185,2018-08-06-T-010-S-00185

However, there is an irresponsible minority that continues to litter and disregard prevailing societal norms. To tackle such anti-social conduct, NEA has taken a tough stance on litterbugs. Last year, it took 32,000 enforcement actions against littering offenders.",1,198,2018-08-06-T-011-S-00198
2018-08-06-T-011,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"While enforcement may serve as a deterrent, it is not the panacea.

2018-08-06-T-011,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"To this end, NEA and various partner organisations have been conducting campaigns and programmes to promote environmental awareness and encourage greater stewardship of our common spaces. The annual Clean & Green Singapore (CGS) co-organised by the NEA, PUB, the National Parks Board (NParks), and the Community Development Councils (CDCs) encourages the community to play an active role in keeping Singapore clean and litter-free. There are also other initiatives, such as the Public Hygiene Council's annual Keep Clean, Singapore! campaign which advocates the value of maintaining cleanliness beyond our own homes, and fostering the habit of picking up after oneself. The month-long event held in May this year saw more than 370 organisations, including grassroots organisations, public agencies and corporations, take part in more than 500 clean-up activities across the island. NEA has also been targeting its publicity efforts at mass events, such as the National Day Parade celebrations to remind people to pick up after themselves.

We will continue to work with grassroots organisations and Town Councils to raise awareness about this issue amongst residents. Unlike public estates, private estates are collectively owned by their residents and public access to such estates are restricted. Home owners in private estates therefore have the autonomy to govern and manage the shared private spaces in a responsible manner. For this to happen, residents should come together to encourage and influence acceptable social behaviour in their communities. Many condominiums have already put in place by-laws prohibiting littering within their estates. The management committees of these private estates can work with their residents to cultivate the right behaviour accordingly.",5,202,2018-08-06-T-011-S-00202

2018-08-06-T-011,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The fact that NEA has committed significant resources to enforce against high-rise littering, including the deployment of surveillance cameras rightly show that NEA and MEWR are concerned about the situation of high-rise littering in our neighbourhoods. Hence, I want to ask the Senior of Minister of State  why is there a difference in the approach and actions by NEA when it comes to enforcement actions, whether it is public housing or private housing or the ECs and the condominiums, especially where the littering does pose safety concerns?",2,206,2018-08-06-T-011-S-00206

2018-08-06-T-011,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"And lastly, would the Ministry keep an open mind and review the need to amend the legislation as otherwise the NEA will have to resort to a private suit to take the culprit to task in ECs and in private estates?",4,208,2018-08-06-T-011-S-00208
2018-08-06-T-011,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"I thank the Member for his three questions. I would take them together. With regards to the difference in treatment, let me say that the prohibition against littering under our current law, the Environmental Public Health Act (EPHA) applies to publicly accessible places only.

2018-08-06-T-011,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Private estates, such as Executive Condominiums and private strata-titled condominiums are not regarded as such a place in law as access to such places by the public is restricted, which I have mentioned earlier. So, our anti-littering law therefore does not apply to littering within these private estates, such as condominiums. And NEA is, in turn, unable to carry out enforcement against littering incidents within these private estates.",2,210,2018-08-06-T-011-S-00210
2018-08-06-T-011,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"However, when an MCST approaches NEA for assistance to tackle cases of high-rise littering, NEA will explore ways to collaborate with them, to educate and advise the residents against such anti-social acts, for instance, working with them to send out advisory notices against such anti-social acts.",3,211,2018-08-06-T-011-S-00211

The management committee of these private estates can actually work with the residents to encourage and influence the right behaviour accordingly.

2018-08-06-T-011,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"But if all else fails, the management corporation can apply to the courts to enforce these by-laws against errant residents.

The attacker accessed SingHealth’s system through an initial breach on a front-end workstation, circumvented the multi-layered security barriers by using advanced and sophisticated tools, and then gained access to privileged credentials to access the database.

2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Concurrently, the IHiS team immediately investigated the suspicious activity, to determine its nature and whether it was malicious. This process took time as our hospital systems process millions of data queries daily. There will always be a number of unusual processes that need to be investigated and most of these turn out to be legitimate activities. Furthermore, the attacker was careful to remove its traces as it worked, making investigation harder. On 10 of July, IHiS confirmed from its investigations that it was a cyber attack, and informed SingHealth, MOH and the Cyber Security Agency (CSA).",7,236,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00236
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Thereafter, several streams of tasks were carried out concurrently. An inter-agency team, comprising MOH, IHiS, SingHealth, MCI and CSA, worked closely together to contain the cyber attack, and undertake measures to prevent further attacks. We implemented additional containment and monitoring measures such as restricting user access, blocking additional connections, resetting security tokens, mandating password changes for users and heightened monitoring of IT systems across our public healthcare sector. At the same time, a separate team in IHiS supported SingHealth’s efforts to assess the extent of the data affected and identify the patients these data belong to, and planning for patient engagement to inform them of the incident.",8,237,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00237

This included name, NRIC number, address, gender, race and date of birth. Of this, 160,000 had information on their outpatient dispensed medicines accessed. However, no phone numbers, passwords or credit card information were accessed. All records in SingHealth’s IT system remain intact and are unaltered. IHiS staff combed through detailed access logs to confirm that the databases were not tampered with.

2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Patient well-being is our top priority. This includes safeguarding the confidentiality of patient data as well as ensuring safe and effective patient care. We face the constant challenge of striking the right balance between having stronger cybersecurity safeguards, while ensuring effective and safe patient care.",13,242,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00242
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"To achieve this, we adopted a multi-layered approach to cybersecurity.",14,243,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00243
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"First, prevention. Our systems are designed with defensive measures against illegal access. For example, there are multi-layer security defences in place both at the perimeter guarding against threats on the Internet, as well as within the perimeter to protect against unauthorised access. Vulnerability scans and tests are conducted regularly. Independent IT security audits are also carried out, with the last such audit on the affected system carried out in the second half of 2017.",15,244,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00244
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Second, detection. We have monitoring tools and services to detect breaches. Our systems are also designed to provide extensive detailed activity logs for internal and external round-the-clock monitoring.",16,245,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00245
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Third, response. We have established operating and technical procedures and measures to contain the impact and neutralise the threat once a breach is discovered. In the event of a breach, we will also notify and work with CSA to contain and investigate the breach. Exercises are conducted regularly to ensure staff are familiar with the procedures.",17,246,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00246
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Beyond setting up a resilient system, we also need a culture of vigilance and cybersecurity awareness. This applies to our healthcare staff, as well as our IT staff. We should always adopt safe cyber practices, watch for suspicious emails and messages, and report them to our IT departments as soon as possible.",18,247,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00247
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Members of Parliament have also asked about Internet surfing separation (ISS). In view of continued malicious activity that we discovered, that we observed, I decided to temporarily impose ISS for all our public healthcare systems. ISS was implemented for SingHealth since 19 July, and National University Health System (NUHS) and National Healthcare Group (NHG) have done so since 23 of July. Imposing ISS will limit avenues for attackers to enter and exit the healthcare clusters’ IT systems. However, ISS has created some inconveniences as well as operational challenges for healthcare workers and patients. We have taken precautions to ensure patient care and safety are not affected. I would like to thank our healthcare workers and patients for their understanding and support.",19,248,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00248
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Could we have initiated ISS earlier? ISS is not a decision to be taken lightly. In fact, even before the incident, IHiS had been working with our clusters to study and assess the feasibility of ISS and the ways to mitigate the impact on patients and healthcare professionals. Internet access is an integral part of many of our healthcare institutions’ daily operations. They rely on the Internet to access other systems for the delivery of some healthcare services. These include receiving and reading reports from laboratories, referrals to our private sector partners, video consultation and tele-rehabilitation, as well as the payments and claims systems. We were also learning from the experiences of other countries’ healthcare IT systems and exploring alternative approaches to achieve similar protection as ISS, while minimising the impact on operations and patients.",20,249,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00249
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Many healthcare systems in other countries have also found it difficult to implement ISS for practical and operational considerations. Healthcare systems, such as Hong Kong’s Hospital Authority and Kaiser Permanante have not adopted full ISS. One possible approach we are studying and piloting is the virtual browser solution. This enables users to access the Internet more safely through a set of quarantined servers. This will reduce the number of potential attack points. The virtual browser solution will be complemented by the deployment of Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) measures, which will provide additional defence against advanced cyber attacks. The deployment of ATP or Advanced Threat Protection had been initiated before this incident and is currently underway, expected to be completed by end of this month.",21,250,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00250
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Our on-going pilot on virtual browser was scheduled to be completed by September this year. Nevertheless, given the urgency of the matter, we went ahead to implement ISS, albeit a temporary measure. To mitigate the challenges on the ground and allow the healthcare institutions to continue to operate safely, our engineers worked overnight and through the weekend to put in place temporary work-around solutions. The team continues to be on the ground to resolve the problems that have arisen as a result of ISS. Areas that have been affected include reading of diagnostic reports from laboratories, video consultation and assessment of suspected stroke patients at our emergency department. Waiting times for consultation may also be longer as doctors may need to access references on the Internet through a separate computer.",22,251,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00251
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"There remain some issues not yet fully resolved, such as referrals to private sector partners, and submission and retrieval of results from screening systems. These do not compromise patient care and safety, but affect the efficiency of our healthcare system.",23,252,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00252
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"As a result of the security measures, some patients may experience a longer wait for consultations and receive their test results, as well as delays in checking their MediSave accounts or making their claims. The productivity and efficiency of our services may also be affected in some areas. We would like to thank our patients for their understanding as we work through these issues on the ground.",24,253,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00253
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Although I said ISS was a temporary measure, now that it has been implemented, we will study the impact of ISS on the ground, and determine whether we can keep it as a permanent measure, at least for some parts of our healthcare system. We will need to develop longer term mitigation solutions to overcome the operational issues if ISS were to stay.",25,254,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00254
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Sir, the cyber attack is unprecedented. Despite our security measures, the attackers had been very patient, very persistent, and very resourceful. With advanced hacking tools, they eventually succeeded in gaining access to SingHealth’s IT system. We take this seriously as there is no reason to believe that they will not try again, with even more advanced tools. Therefore, we are reviewing the cybersecurity measures of our key IT projects and strengthening them where necessary.",26,255,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00255
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Members of Parliament have asked about the National Electronic Health Record (NEHR) system. The NEHR is a separate system that was not affected by this cyber attack. Due to the need for the system to interface with multiple external partners, the NEHR is designed differently from the systems that were infiltrated. Nevertheless, we recognise that this is an important national system of significant scale, as it will eventually house key medical records for all patients.",27,256,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00256
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"We will therefore put the NEHR through a rigorous independent external review before we proceed with the mandatory contribution of electronic health records. We have engaged CSA and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Singapore as independent third parties to help identify any vulnerabilities and recommend measures to address them. We must assure ourselves, users and patients that the necessary safeguards are in place, before we proceed with wider implementation of the NEHR.",28,257,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00257
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"However, we should not reverse our direction in the use of technology in healthcare. Digitalisation, technology and use of data in healthcare have brought many benefits to our patients. We cannot return to the days of paper and pencil.",29,258,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00258
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"IT systems have allowed us to greatly improve the safety and effectiveness of patient care. During an emergency where a patient is unconscious, access to his medical history in the NEHR helps doctors prescribe more effective medication and treatment in a timely manner. Data analytics helps us to better understand disease patterns and plan ahead to meet our needs in the future. Automation improves productivity, reduces human errors and enables patients to receive better care.",30,259,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00259
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"When patients receive care beyond the hospital, integration of IT systems allows easier referrals across settings and enables better team-based care, and more effective emergency response. These have to be matched with efforts to continually improve our ability to secure patients' data, and the increasing robustness of the systems to deal with a constantly evolving cyber security threat.",31,260,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00260
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Given the broader national cybersecurity implications, Minister Iswaran has appointed a Committee of Inquiry to look into this incident. We will extend our full support to the work of the Committee. We look forward to its report and recommendations to further strengthen our resilience against cyber-attacks.",32,261,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00261
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"At the same time, we will be conducting a thorough review of the robustness of the cyber safeguards of our key IT systems. We will identify potential areas for improvement in cyber threat prevention, detection and response. To do this, we will bring in third-party experts to support us in this work where necessary.",33,262,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00262

2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mr S Iswaran),"Let me start by adding CSA's perspective to the Minister for Health's detailed account of this incident and subsequent response. On 10 July 2018, CSA was notified that an unauthorised network intrusion had occurred at SingHealth. CSA immediately deployed members of its National Incident Response Team to investigate the incident. The CSA team conducted forensic investigations on suspected compromised computers and supported IHiS in implementing measures to contain the attack. This included blocking unauthorised connections to prevent access by the attacker, resetting servers, enforcing mandatory password resets for all SingHealth users, heightened monitoring across all public healthcare IT systems, and implementing Internet Surfing Separation.",12,277,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00277
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mr S Iswaran),"CSA's investigations ascertained that on 4 July, IHiS system administrators had discovered unusual activity on one of SingHealth's IT databases which triggered follow-up investigations by IHiS' IT team. CSA subsequently established that the attackers had obtained a foothold in SingHealth's network by infecting a front-end computer with malicious software – what is called malware. The attackers had evaded detection by the SingHealth network security tools, moved stealthily through the system, eventually gained access to the database servers storing SingHealth's patient records, and copied the data to servers hosted overseas on 27 June to 4 July. No further data loss has been detected since 4 July.",13,278,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00278
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mr S Iswaran),"Based on the logs, two types of data were illegally accessed – personal particulars, including the name, NRIC number, address, gender, race and date of birth of 1.5 million patients, and the outpatient dispensed medication records of 160,000 patients.",14,279,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00279
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mr S Iswaran),The attackers also repeatedly and specifically tried to steal the medical records and data of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.

2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mr S Iswaran),"However, to reinforce the point that Minister Gan Kim Yong made, no telephone numbers, passwords, or credit card information were accessed or stolen. Neither were other medical records, such as diagnoses, test- results, or doctor's notes. They were not illegally accessed. The data that was illegally copied was not tampered with, nor was it deleted.",16,281,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00281

An APT group refers to a class of sophisticated, usually state-linked cyber attackers who conduct extended and carefully-planned cyber campaigns to steal information or disrupt operations. Some recent examples of cyber-attacks by APT groups include the hacking of the US Democratic National Committee in 2016, and the theft of more than 20 million personnel records from the United States Office of Personnel Management in 2014. Singapore has also been the target of APT attacks, such as that on NUS and NTU last year. The cyber attack on SingHealth had characteristics that are typical of an APT attack. The attacker used advanced and sophisticated tools, including customised malware that was able to evade SingHealth's anti-virus software and security tools. After establishing a foothold in the network, the attacker took steps to remain in the system undetected before stealing the patients' information. The attack fits the profile of certain known APT groups but, as I have said earlier, for national security reasons, we will not be making any specific public attribution.",17,282,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00282

2018-08-06-T-013,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"I thank both Ministers for their comprehensive statements. We have been talking about cyber attack but, practically, this has been more a case of cyber snooping or cyber theft rather than an attack, which brings me to my main question  how sure are we that no malicious malware still remains on the systems? I think we have been lucky in the sense that the systems have not been disrupted in terms of patients' safety or care. But as I understand it – correct me if I am wrong – with these APT type of attacks, a lot of these initial attacks are meant to demonstrate that they can actually invade the systems, but the ultimate goal may be to be able to plant some malware that can disrupt our systems when the time comes. That was my main question  how sure are we that no malicious software remains on the systems given that the databases is a very large and complex system.",1,305,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00305
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Speaker, I thank the Member for his question. First, I do not think we should speculate on the motives of the attacker. I think it does not detract from the fact that this is an illegal criminal act and we have the responsibility to get to the bottom of it.",1,306,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00306
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Having said that, can we be sure that there is no remnant malicious malware in the system? As I had said earlier, our agencies – CSA working with their counterparts in IHiS and SingHealth – have done everything they can to secure the system and to detect and eliminate the risk. In fact, as we also elaborated, even as we were doing the work to contain the challenge, as late as on 19 July, there was evidence of some residual risk which had to be dealt with. At midnight on the 19, Internet Surfing separation was then imposed.",2,307,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00307
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The short answer is we have done everything in our means to secure the system, to detect any residual risk and eliminate it. But as I have said several times in the course of my statement, one can never be sure that we have fully eliminated that risk.",3,308,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00308
2018-08-06-T-013,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"I thank the Ministers for their statements. Since the cyber-attack, a few of my elderly residents came to see me and told me that they worry that their medication records will be altered. How can we help our people, especially our elderly residents, to better understand our cybersecurity matters and even measures that will be taken?",1,309,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00309
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Mr Speaker, Sir, as I explained in my speech, IHiS, together with CSA, have gone through our detailed access logs to ensure that the data has not been altered. But we understand that patients will still be anxious and want to know more about this incident, and how they can protect themselves, and what implication there is for them. I encourage them to contact SingHealth which will then follow up with more detailed explanation specifically to the affected patients. There is a hotline that they can call and the number is 6326 5555. If they want to have more details, please contact SingHealth and our people, our hotline operators are trained to answer their questions and to help them clarify any doubts or anxiety that they may have with regard to their medication information.",1,310,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00310
2018-08-06-T-013,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thank you, Speaker. I have two clarifications. I have actually filed a question to Minister for Health to ask if the Government could elaborate on the reasons for the several days of delay between the time that the attack was confirmed and the time that the public was made aware of it. According to the timeline released by the Government, it was confirmed on 10 July that a cyber attack had indeed taken place, and two days later, in fact, a police report was lodged. But the public only got to know about this attack on the 20th. I would like to ask the Minister to elaborate on the reasons why the public was not made aware earlier because they could have taken some steps, for example, to change their passwords or protect their information.",1,311,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00311
2018-08-06-T-013,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Second question is also for Minister for Health. During the first press conference on 20 July, we noted that the Minister apologised for the incident. But we are hearing today, really, that the CIIs are responsible for safeguarding the data on the systems. So, is there any significance as to why it was not SingHealth that apologised but rather the Minister who apologised?",2,312,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00312
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"I will first clarify the second question. I think SingHealth, during the press conference, had also apologised, probably it was not carried in the media. But they do apologise to the patients for the incident as well as the inconvenience that has been created. Anyway, my apology is on behalf of the entire healthcare family. I take it that, ultimately, I will have to apologise to the patients who are affected.",1,313,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00313
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"On the first question on the time between the 10 July when we confirmed that it was a cyber attack until 20 July when we had a press conference and informed the public, I explained in my statement that between 10 and 20 July, many things were happening and there were multiple streams of work that were carrying on at the same time. Our priority at that time was to ensure that our system was protected, our data would not be subject to further exfiltration. That took a while because first they had to trace back where the sources of attack came from, so that the Cyber Security staff would know where and how to protect the database. We also need to investigate to determine whether or not there were additional data that were compromised beyond what we already knew.",2,314,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00314
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"So, the first stream of investigation was to focus on protecting the data. The second stream of work was on investigation of the incident to trace back to see how it started, so that we were confident that this was the only attack that we were experiencing. The third stream was to identify what were the data that were compromised and who were the patients that were affected, so that we could pave the way to inform them. Therefore, the third stream was very important as well.",3,315,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00315
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"At the same time, SingHealth also started to prepare to inform the patients and all these will require time. In the meantime, we also had to make sure that there were no further attacks on the system. As we mentioned earlier, as late as 19 July, there was still malicious activity in the data system. That is why we had to impose ISS on 19th evening, so that on the 20th, when we disclosed to the public, we were quite confident that the system had been stabilised. At the same time, we have sufficient information to share with the public how the incident happened, what were the data that were compromised, and who were the patients that were affected.",4,316,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00316
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,All these require time to prepare. And it is important for us to ensure that our information given to the public is accurate as far as we are able to ascertain.,5,317,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00317

2018-08-06-T-013,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"My second point is that cyber attacks such as these are actually, to me, a new form of terrorism that calls for the same, if not, more of the resources and attention that is given to, for example, physical terrorism by MHA. There is a lot of public education. I can still remember it is run-hide-tell and many of these are things that were done to ensure that we are very cognisant of physical terrorism. So, I think for cyber terrorism is all the more important.",2,320,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00320
2018-08-06-T-013,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"In view that Minister Iswaran has said that the Smart Nation plans will press on for various reasons, what is the Government's plan in terms of added resources and also acquisition of cybersecurity expertise, for example. We know that nation-wide there is a shortage of such cybersecurity expertise. And so, what are we going to do about it to ensure that we are protected in the long term, as we proceed with our Smart Nation plans?",3,321,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00321
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for her clarification. I think the Member is absolutely right. We should be very clear that our challenges with cybersecurity are in no way different to our challenges with terrorism. We have raised our awareness about terrorism. We have a systematic effort for that. But when it comes to cybersecurity and defences, I think perhaps the level of awareness is not as palpable. The reason is probably also because many of us, all of us, use digital devices as part and parcel of everyday life and we do not pause to think sometimes what the implications are of having this hyper- connectivity and the kind of data that flows through our devices and the connections that we have with the Internet, and the wider Internet community.",1,322,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00322
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, in terms of the specific question, what are we doing, first, we have to use this opportunity to reinforce the message and the importance of cybersecurity to the general public and the measures that they can take at a personal level, which is what we have just outlined; but also to organisations, public and private organisations, because often the investment in cybersecurity is seen as a cost, without an obvious payoff and obvious value. These sort of instances help to crystallise why cybersecurity must be taken seriously at the top management level, and you put in place systems and make the judgement in terms of what kind of resources should be allocated for this.",2,323,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00323
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"As far as the Government itself is concerned, we are very clear that we have to continue to invest in our ability and capabilities to prevent, to detect and to respond to any kind of cyber-attack. As I said earlier, the reality is that this is going to be a ceaseless battle because the perpetrators or the potential perpetrators are constantly developing their own capabilities. So, we have to also ensure that we are able to do so. This is why we are investing in cybersecurity, not only in terms of building our capabilities within the CSA, but also in the broader system. We have many efforts in the broader ecosystem – the ICT ecosystem, and cybersecurity is one of the focal points for that.",3,324,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00324
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"And the final point I would make is as part of our overall defence, if you will, cyber defence, this is not just a battle we fight alone. We have allies from around the world. All of them face similar challenges, they are all investing in their capabilities, and the cooperation with our allies helps to strengthen our own capabilities in resisting such attacks.",4,325,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00325

I have one clarification for Minister Iswaran and one for Minister Gan. For Minister Iswaran, will the Ministry be investigating whether there is any negligence on the part of SingHealth in meeting the standards of proactively protecting the CII under the Cyber Security Act? And for Minister Gan, Minister mentioned that the permanent ISS may be implemented for parts of the healthcare system. Can the Minister elaborate which part of the system is likely to face the permanent ISS and given that this attack happened at a front-line work station, would this actually mean most of the healthcare systems face a risk?",1,327,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00327
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, the Committee of Inquiry has been asked, as elaborated in the Terms of Reference, to study what were the factors that led to the incident and how were the relevant players involved in the response, in order to derive the lessons that can be used and applied in the context of our public sector ICT systems and databases and also specifically for the health system.",1,328,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00328
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In that process, I imagine that they would be looking at what could have been done, what should have been done and then, make their recommendations accordingly. I would urge Members to refrain from going down the path of allocating blame at this stage. I think our resolute focus should be on ensuring that the system in SingHealth is secure, and patient data is protected. And for this, we need all parties who are involved to be working together in order to achieve that objective. The COI will conduct its due process and when we have the outcome of that and we know the recommendations and findings, then we can take appropriate action.",2,329,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00329
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Sir, let me first respond to the second part of Assoc Prof Goh's question on which part of the system should be continued with ISS and which one should be exempted from ISS. I think it is still early days, I would not want to pre-empt the decision. IHiS, together with SingHealth and the clusters, are reviewing and we have also just implemented ISS. We really want to understand the impact on the ground and assess which are the parts that really can continue with the ISS and which are the portions of the healthcare system that actually ISS is not practical and could affect patient care in the long term.",1,330,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00330
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"So, just to explain, today, whilst we have introduced ISS, there are a number of work around solutions which IHiS team has been working with our clusters on the ground to help our doctors and our patients to ensure that the system will continue. But some of these work around solutions are not sustainable in the long term because they are basically work-arounds. And, therefore, we will have to look at whether there are practical, long-term solutions for some of these work-arounds. In areas where it is not possible and there may be alternative safeguards that will be able to provide added protection but not necessarily ISS, those are the alternatives that we could consider. One example I mentioned earlier in my statement was a virtual browser solution together with Advanced Threat Protection measures. Taken together, they will provide significant protection without having to resort to ISS.",2,331,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00331
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"I would imagine that in a healthcare system where care is quite closely linked to Internet access in some areas, for example, emergency departments and so on, it may be critical and these are the areas which are more likely to be given certain rights for Internet access. And even with Internet access, there are ways to protect against our core database system. For example, you could designate specific servers that they have access to and denied access to other servers that are not related.",3,332,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00332
2018-08-06-T-013,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"I do not want to go into too much detail because these also have implications on our security measures. Suffice to say that I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the review. We give the Committee and the team time to look at the system and to review the implementation of ISS on the ground today. And from the experience of ISS, we can then make an informed assessment of which are the parts that should continue with ISS and which are the parts we should maybe refer to alternative solutions.",4,333,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00333

I just have one question  in relation to the COI's Terms of Reference no 5, I noticed that the focus is largely on public sector IT systems. I am aware that the COI's Terms of Reference is in particular on public health data. Can the Minister for Communications and Information probably share a bit more about the private sector IT systems and, in particular, whether there is any public sector databases which potentially have systemic risks impact on Singapore and Singaporeans in particular. Maybe he can share a bit more on that. In particular, for example, telcos, banks and private hospitals and what is the plan, strategically, for CSA to address some of these issues.",1,335,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00335
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I thank the Member for the clarification. First, I think we have to be clear. The COI's Terms of Reference have been scoped to focus on this incident because if we scope it too wide, then you will lose the value of setting up such a Committee – which is really to go deep, understand what the issues were and then to come up with valuable insights and recommendations which we can apply across the public sector and specifically in the healthcare system.",1,336,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00336
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The Member then asked whether there are issues around databases and IT systems that reside outside the public sector. Sir, I want to bring Members back to the point I made earlier, which is that the CSA will be designating computer systems in 11 sectors as Critical Information Infrstructure. Some of these sectors the Member highlighted are banking, telecommunications. There are others, like energy, water and so on.",2,337,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00337
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"And each of these sectors have computer systems that may be within the public sector or in the private sector, but by virtue of the functions they perform, the databases they hold, they are deemed to be Critical Information Infrastructure. And, therefore, they will be designated and governed as such by CSA, by the rules and provisions under the Cyber Security Act.",3,338,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00338
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"And that is where, as I mentioned in my earlier statement, CSA will ensure that there are certain minimum requirements that are implemented but beyond that there may also be certain advisory guidelines on what else they can do to further strengthen cybersecurity. But, ultimately, the regulators and owners of those CII will have to make the judgement call and be accountable for the uninterrupted essential services they provide.",4,339,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00339
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"On the point of the private sector, what we learned from this incident will be shared. We have various platforms to do that in because there are, generally, various education sessions that Government agencies conduct to heighten awareness of cybersecurity and the measures that can be taken. We also have the framework of the Personal Data Protection Act and the Personal Data Protection Commission which is actively involved not just in following up on complaints or reports of personal data breaches but also in terms of raising awareness and education and sharing best practices, so that the general private sector can also continue to harden itself against cyber-attacks.",5,340,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00340

2018-08-06-T-013,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"Thank you, Sir. Minister Iswaran in his statement mentioned twice that this attack is state-linked which means I take it that it is not a normal kind of cyber attack and Singapore is being targeted by another state and thereby this attack is state-linked. If that is the case, then may I know whether the Government knows which state is behind the attack or is linked to this attack? And, if so, whether or not the Government is prepared to share the knowledge with Singaporeans that which state is carrying out such attack on us. In the details, Minister Iswaran mentioned that the attack was conducted by a professional group, APT Group. Does the Government or the CSA in its investigations, knows what is the name of the Group and where this Group has launched the attack from? And he also mentioned that data was copied to another server. So, may we know where is the server sited?",1,342,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00342
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, let me state it for the third time for the Member's reference. The attack fits the profile of certain known APT groups, but for national security reasons, we will not be making any specific public attribution.",1,343,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00343
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"He asked whether we are prepared to share the names, if we know specifically whom and whether we are able to then share that. And I would put to the Member that first, I have explained why we have a larger set of concerns around this matter. Secondly, in this sort of matter, whilst one can have a high level of technical confidence, one may not be able to have the certainty that you might need in order to specifically assign responsibility. And this is the kind of evidentiary threshold that may not stand up in a court of law, but at the operational level, the agencies that are involved have a high level of confidence in their findings.",2,344,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00344
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Having said that, we do not think it serves our national interest, nor is it a productive exercise for us to be making specific public attribution. What is essential is that we diagnose the problem clearly and take the appropriate steps. And if, in the process of the COI deliberations, specific attribution can be made in a manner where action can subsequently be taken up in a court of law, we will certainly consider that course of action.",3,345,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00345

Many of my residents expressed concern when they heard that their personal details had been stolen, especially NRIC. They are very worried and they do not know how will this data be used later on. I would like to ask the Minister  what more can the Government do to address the concerns of those whose details had been stolen?",1,347,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00347
2018-08-06-T-013,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"And there are some suggestions that whether can an SMS alert be sent to them if let us say, their NRIC details were being used, for example, open certain accounts or involved in certain financial transaction.",2,348,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00348
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for her question which I think is a genuine, true reflection of some of the concerns on the ground. And that is why, in my statement, I try to explain why Singaporeans in general and elderly residents, in particular, can draw some comfort from the fact that transactions that involve banks, financial institutions and those involved in sensitive Government e-transactions, all have two-factor authentication (2FA). So, it is not just about the ID, although in some cases, and I think, in many cases, the IC number is used as the ID. And this might be an opportunity for us review that and see whether we can use other ID which are more robust. And then, in addition to ID, you need the password as well as the one-time password.",1,349,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00349
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, what we can explain to our residents in general is that the system that is in place is a secure one. But what might be prudent for them to do, is where they have got accounts, where they have already set them up and they have used their IC number particularly as an ID or some cases, people even use their NRIC as the password, they should reset and ensure that they have thoroughly reviewed this kind of exposure.",2,350,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00350
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"On the point she made about alerting them to any other kind of activity which can have financial implications, typically in all of these transactions, you would have to not just put in your IC number or name. If you are going to for example, buy something online, you need either credit card data or some other kind of financial information. That information has not been taken in this instance. And therefore, that link is broken. And hence, the consumers and the general residents can be comforted by that. But I think we should not get complacent and we should review this. And where they have got some accounts, I think it is well-worth using this opportunity to look at resetting passwords.",3,351,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00351

2018-08-06-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I believe Minister Iswaran mentioned that this has many analogies to a terror attack. And certainly, in dealing with the terrorists, the Government does have powers, for example, under the Internal Security Act, to investigate and detain without evidence that would stand up in a court of law. And the national security reason is why you would not want to put it in the court of law. Do you think we need similar frameworks to deal with cyber threats?",1,353,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00353
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I thank the Member for the question. I think our existing legislative framework provides us with sufficient scope, because if you can demonstrate and prove a criminal act, then you can take action under the Penal Code or appropriate legislation. If we can find a specific actor or individual who has posed a threat to our national security, then we also have legislation that allows us to take action against such individuals. So, I think the legislative levers are adequate. But this is a domain where the nature of the crime and specific attribution can be quite challenging at times.",1,354,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00354

2018-08-06-T-013,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Ministers for their Statements. Just one supplementary question for Minister Iswaran. After the conclusion of the COI process, will MCI or other relevant authorities attempt to reach out to cybersecurity and IT professionals across the whole-of-Government and indeed in the private sector, to apprise them of some of the findings, to educate them maybe about the signatures of some of these groups that have made the attacks so that they can be better alerted to detect and pre-empt them, and also educate them also on on some of the preventive measures that they should undertake, drawing on the learnings from, not just this attack, but perhaps the one at NUS and NTU as well, that happened previously.",1,356,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00356
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The answer is certainly ""yes"". In fact, that is the objective of the exercise. We want to make sure that whatever the findings are, we are able to extract the lessons and recommendations which can then be used not just within the public sector or within the CII sectors but  for other private sector operators because there is a general concern about security.",1,357,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00357
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But the qualifier I will make is that, what we can share is constrained by the considerations I had pointed out earlier. Secondly, it is also about having a risk-adjusted approach because in certain types of companies and certain types of operations, their risk profiles are different, and are at a lesser level. And therefore, they may not need to do everything but they do need to  take up certain basic measures for cybersecurity purposes. So, it has been a differentiated approach, but the larger point about drawing lessons which can then be shared, this is something that we certainly intend to do.",2,358,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00358

2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I understand where the Member is coming from. Let me say this  we are aware of the range of possible ways to harness talent, and we have to use them in a judicious way in order to ensure that we have our fair share of the talent that is needed for the kind of challenges that we face.",1,361,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00361

2018-08-06-T-013,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"My question is for the Minister for MCI. While we regret this incident on SingHealth, can the Minister enlighten us whether other countries are also victims of cyber attacks? And secondly, can he confirm that, apart from the COI, there is also a police report that is lodged, and what is the purpose of that police report? Is it to see if any crimes have been committed?",1,363,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00363
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I thank the Member for this questions. First, have other countries been victims of cyber-attacks? In my statement, I highlighted a couple, both who are in the context of the United States. But there have also been other incidents in Europe. And I think many of these may not even be reported in the public domain but we know that they are occurring. So, the truth of the matter is  this is a universal challenge; we are not an exception. In fact, every country is facing this challenge and the greater their connectivity and the use of digital technologies, the greater their challenge as well. So, that is an important point that all of us need to understand and appreciate.",1,364,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00364
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The second point is on the contemporaneous police investigation. So, the COI is doing its work. It will be aided by the CSA, which leads a team of investigators, and they will also have the AGC leading evidence. The police report was lodged because there was  suspicion of a crime being committed. And so, the police will investigate this incident in that context. But the police will also take reference from any deliberations that take place in the COI.",2,365,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00365
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"And I would add that there is a third stream, because there was also a report lodged with the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC).

2018-08-06-T-013,Speaker,Mr Speaker,I will take one last question. Mr Liang Eng Hwa.,1,367,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00367
2018-08-06-T-013,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"This question is for Minister Iswaran. My sense is, after hearing what he said in the statement, is that we are really at the mercy of this state-linked cyber attackers, almost to operate on their terms. So, I want to ask the Minister, whether besides the defensive measures that we take, are there any counter-offensive measures that we can also take as part of cybersecurity strategy so that we can not only defend, but also deter such attacks.",1,368,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00368
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Let me say this. First of all, I think we should not create the impression that we are helpless or that we are at the mercy of these potential perpetrators. If that was the case, then why have this strong robust response? Because we have conviction that we can deter, and we have the capability. And where we do not, we will build it, and we will find ways to strengthen our systems so that we can resist such attacks.",1,369,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00369
2018-08-06-T-013,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"And as far as this effort is concerned, it is also important that even as we do this, it is important that psychologically, not just this House, but Singaporeans at large, understand that it cannot be foolproof. And so, we must have that resilience that when it happens, we will pick ourselves up again and we will learn from it, grow stronger and we will carry on. I think that is the most important aspect of the way we can deter such attacks.",2,370,2018-08-06-T-013-S-00370

2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Mr Speaker, thank you for allowing me to make this Statement. In May this year, I informed the House that a Committee of Inquiry (COI) would be convened to investigate the death of full-time National Serviceman Corporal (First Class) Dave Lee that occurred on 30 April 2018. The COI has submitted its preliminary findings to the Armed Forces Council on 16 July this year and I would like to update this House on their findings, as well as follow-up actions taken by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) since May.",1,376,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00376
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Under the SAF Act, the COI is structured primarily to investigate and determine facts related to the incident and to identify causation, lapses and systemic problems, if any, which resulted in the incident. The COI does not deal with culpability of individuals. Specifically, to encourage disclosure and cooperation by all involved in the incident, section 8C of the SAF Act provides that no statements made to the COI shall be admissible as evidence in a Court Martial or for disciplinary proceedings. To keep to this remit, I will, therefore, use no names nor designations in this Statement but instead use a generic term – commander/s or person/s, as appropriate.",2,377,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00377
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"As I mentioned in May to this House, Police investigations are on-going and the Coroner may hold an inquiry. Their procedures and evidence uncovered are part of the judicial process to determine if any criminal offence has been committed in this incident and are separate from the COI.",3,378,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00378
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"In May, I had also informed this House that the COI would submit its report to the External Review Panel on SAF Safety (ERPSS). The COI has done so for their preliminary assessment and I will also be sharing the ERPSS' responses and recommendations.",4,379,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00379
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Let me start with events that occurred the day before the heat stroke occurred. On 17 April this year, CFC Dave Lee and the troopers from the Support Company participated in two physical training sessions in Bedok Camp, namely Combat Circuit 4 from 6.30 am to 7.30 am at the hockey pitch, and Cardiovascular 6, followed by Balance, Flexibility and Mobility 6 from 3.30 pm to 5.30 pm at the running track. This was a day before the heat stroke.",5,380,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00380
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),The COI found the training for Combat Circuit 4 to be compliant with regulations or guidelines.,6,381,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00381
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"However, the COI did discover breaches of the Army's Training Safety Regulations (TSR) for Cardiovascular 6 and breaches of the Army's directive for another subsequent event that took place later that day.",7,382,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00382
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Let me first deal with Cardiovascular 6. In this lesson, soldiers had to run six laps of 400 m each, a total of 2.4 km. They have to run according to the lesson plan, grouped according to their running ability. However, the entire company was asked to run at a common pace. This meant that for the first three laps, CFC Lee was asked to run at a slightly faster pace than required – of about 10 seconds faster per lap. For the next three laps, CFC Lee was allowed to run at his own pace. The rest timing in between each lap was noted to be reduced to one minute – which is 45 seconds shorter than what was stipulated in the lesson plan. These deviations were a breach of Training Safety Regulations. The reason given was that the commanders wanted to enhance fitness and foster greater cohesion by keeping the platoon intact, and the soldiers running at the same pace, not in groups.",8,383,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00383
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Later that night, before the fast march the next day, the collective punishment that was meted out to CFC Lee's platoon was also not authorised.",9,384,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00384
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"At about 9.40 pm, the entire Scout Platoon, including CFC Lee, were told to fall-in in their No 4 uniforms and assault bags. The commander/s had wanted to punish the platoon collectively for the perceived lack of teamwork and the use of mobile phones after Lights Out; in particular, by two troopers despite repeated warnings. At 9.45 pm, the commanders meted out the informal punishment – this was in the form of physical exercises, which comprised Bear Crawls, Sprints, Leopard Crawls, as well as Push-Ups and Crunches. In total, it was from 30 to 35 minutes. They also had water poured over the troopers from their water bottles and subsequently from the jerry can. The session ended with the troopers reciting the Guards Creed a few times in a high kneel position. As I have said, the entire session lasted for about 30 to 35 minutes. The platoon was eventually sent back to their bunks at about 10.25 pm to wash up and had Lights Out by 10.45 pm. The troopers were also instructed by commanders not to switch on the lights in their bunks. The COI noted that the commanders did not seek prior approval for the conduct of this informal punishment or inform their superiors after the punishment.",10,385,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00385
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"While the majority of the troopers interviewed opined that the commanders were good commanders who demanded high standards, this punishment was unauthorised.",11,386,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00386
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),The COI found that the conduct of unauthorised informal punishment compromised the seven hours of uninterrupted rest as the trainees had about six hours 15 minutes instead. Less sleep could be one of the factors which caused CFC Lee to have more fatigue before participating in the fast march.,12,387,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00387
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Let me move on to the day of the heat stroke. The COI's assessment was that the conduct of the fast march was in line with the lesson plan and relevant regulations. CFC Lee had undergone the requisite build-up training prior to the 8-km fast march, and all measures to prevent heat injuries according to the TSR had been complied with – which are temperature-taking regime, hydration regime, water supply where soldiers must carry water and have re-supply points planned for, work-rest cycle based on the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature, and rest management, except that CFC Lee and his platoon did not have the requisite seven hours of sleep that I have just mentioned.",13,388,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00388
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Before the fast march, CFC Lee had taken his temperature, which was normal at 36.3°C, and had drunk water. This was witnessed by his buddy, who also observed him to be looking well and seemed to be his usual self. CFC Lee and his fellow scout troopers then consumed their Recommended Dietary Allowance, which consisted of an oatmeal cracker and chrysanthemum drink.",14,389,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00389
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Thereafter, the safety brief was conducted by the Conducting Officer. Troopers were asked if they had completed their 6-km fast march build-up training, completed their water parade, and had seven hours of uninterrupted rest, and taken their body temperature during the declaration. The troops were asked to declare if they had. The Conducting Officer had checked if there was anyone who was not feeling well. Three troopers stood out as they had not completed their 6-km fast march and were subsequently deployed as marshals. No one else sounded off any other concerns when the checks were made. This was followed by the conduct of warm-up exercises to get the troopers ready for the 8-km fast march.",15,390,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00390
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"After the conduct of warm-up exercises, the fast march commenced just before sunrise with the troopers despatched in four waves, at five-minute intervals. Each wave included a commander as a rear sweeper. CFC Lee was in the fourth wave – the last wave.",16,391,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00391
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"After CFC Lee completed the first 6 km, he had a mandated 20-minute rest. After the 20-minute rest period, as CFC Lee was moving off for the last 2 km, he sounded off to the commanders that he had cramps in his calf muscles. They advised him to stretch his calf muscles, which he did, and encouraged him to complete the march.",17,392,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00392
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"CFC Lee was the last one to complete the 8-km fast march in around 100 minutes, including the 20-minute break. Shortly after the fast march, as CFC Lee was walking from the end point of the fast march to the Support Company line, he was observed to be disoriented and immediately attended to by the commander/s and the cover medic/s.",18,393,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00393

2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"After the fast march, the persons attending to CFC Lee thought that he was suffering from physical exhaustion. His pulse was assessed to be normal and his skin felt cold to touch. His temperature was not taken. The first-aid that was administered comprised the removal of CFC Lee’s equipment, unbuttoning his uniform, applying ice packs at his vital points, pouring water on him and giving him water. He was also given oxygen. However, the COI noted that the on-site cooling measures administered were inadequate, including the failure to administer an on-site intravenous drip, the improper placement of ice packs and the improper use of a ground sheet. When his condition did not improve, CFC Lee was subsequently evacuated to the medical centre. However, there was a significant gap between the onset of symptoms and his arrival at the medical centre.",20,395,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00395
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"On arrival at the Bedok Camp Medical Centre, CFC Lee was semi-conscious. His temperature taken measured 42.7oC. Two bags of fast IV drip were administered and he was also placed in the Body Cooling Unit, for two cycles. Seeing that CFC Lee was not responding to the treatment, the Medical Officer decided to evacuate him to the Changi General Hospital.",21,396,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00396

Unfortunately, his condition deteriorated and he passed away on 30 April 2018. This was 12 days later.",22,397,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00397
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"The COI opined that the significant delay from the time of symptoms to evacuation could have escalated the heat injury to a heat stroke. Full body cooling should have been instituted as soon as possible, and within 30 minutes of presentation of signs and symptoms.",23,398,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00398
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"The delay in evacuation resulted as the persons attending to CFC Lee mistook his signs and symptoms as being due to physical exhaustion. Though trained, they had never encountered any previous case of heat injury themselves.",24,399,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00399
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"There were several suggestions for CFC Lee to be evacuated, but these calls were either not heard or not heeded.",25,400,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00400
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"For completeness, let me share the COI’s finding on one other aspect, which is CFC Lee’s state of health prior to the fast march. While CFC Lee had no significant medical history, it was established that he had been taking some medication in the weeks prior to the fast march following a visit to the Jurong Polyclinic on 31 March 2018 for acute upper respiratory tract infection. This was more than two weeks before the fast march on 18 April.",26,401,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00401
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Let me conclude with the COI’s preliminary assessment on the cause of death. The COI found that CFC Lee’s death was the result of heat stroke leading to multiple organ injury. Other than this, the COI did not find any physical injury sustained, as verified by the autopsy, nor any evidence indicating any foul play or medical negligence that caused his death. While the COI was unable to ascertain the direct causes which led CFC Lee to suffer from his heat stroke, it noted that possible contributing causes were accumulated fatigue, insufficient rest, CFC Lee’s less than optimal state of health and his potential use of medication. However, the COI’s preliminary assessment was that the likely reasons for CFC Lee succumbing to the heat stroke were inadequate on-site casualty management and delayed evacuation to the medical centre.",27,402,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00402

2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Second, the panel emphasised that it is essential for personnel to comply with safety rules promulgated in the approved operating manuals. Breaches, such as those found by the COI in this case, should not be condoned.",2,407,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00407
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Third, the ERPSS highlighted the value of strengthening the safety culture in Army units. They felt that if each soldier takes greater personal ownership and responsibility for safety, it would bring about desirable behaviours, such as (a) having a strong respect for safety rules and guidelines; (b) being willing to speak out when there are safety concerns; (c) taking care of each other; and (d) open-reporting, so as to share lessons and prevent future accidents. Such behaviours would substantially strengthen the Army’s efforts to ensure safe training.",3,408,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00408
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Finally, the ERPSS flagged out three areas for further emphasis based on the COI’s findings. First, the need to strengthen commanders’ knowledge on heat injuries and improve their decision-making processes. Second, for medics to be able to exercise their professional authority when dealing with medical issues. This includes being able to communicate effectively with commanders who are much more senior than them. Third, for commanders to watch out for soldiers who are feeling unwell or are unable to cope and proactively pull them out of training before they get injured.",4,409,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00409

2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Let me now focus on what the SAF has done or will put in place to reduce the risks of heat injuries so that we can achieve zero training fatalities. Training and safety protocols were reviewed and advised by an External Review Panel on Heat Injury Management (ERPHIM). This was chaired by Assoc Prof Mark Leong, who is a senior consultant at the Department of Emergency Medicine at SGH. The following changes will be put into place.",6,411,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00411
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"First, a simplified protocol to lower the bar for immediate evacuation. Under this protocol, all commanders and medics across the SAF will evacuate every trainee that cannot respond to simple questions on time, place and identity. The intent is obvious. This takes the guesswork out of the assessment and what the reason is, as this case showed, and imposes early evacuation as the default, as a strict Training Safety Regulation to be followed. This Training Safety Regulation is effective immediately.",7,412,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00412
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Second, additional methods to cool servicemen during training. For example, the Army will implement what is called the Arm Immersion Cooling System – you immerse your arms – and this has been used in the US and Australian militaries to reduce heat injury for all fast marches and route marches that are 12 km and longer. Portable cooling methods, such as purpose-built cooling pads, will now replace less effective ice packs to be used on the spot. These will be implemented in phases, starting from this month.",8,413,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00413
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Third, there had been suggestions for wearables. The expert opinion of this Expert Review Panel on Heat Injuries is that those currently available in the market are not effective for measuring core temperature.",9,414,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00414
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Fourth, the Army will ensure that our commanders and soldiers can better recognise the signs and symptoms of heat injuries. Lesson plans on safety will be improved and the annual Training Safety Regulation test will also include mandatory questions on heat injury prevention and management.",10,415,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00415
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Fifth, the importance of open reporting will be emphasised. Soldiers will be encouraged to use the Hotline to report any unauthorised activities or violations of rules, especially during Basic Military Training phase and reinforced during In-Camp Training.",11,416,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00416
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Sixth, more opportunities for make-up training. The Army will encourage our soldiers not to push themselves beyond safety limits. If a soldier feels that he is unwell during any training activity, or if the buddy notices it, soldiers will be reminded to err on the side of caution, to stop and make up training another day.",12,417,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00417
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Seventh, more clinical exposure and patient contacts for medics to upgrade their skills in resuscitation and handling of emergencies. This may include periodic attachments to hospitals, A&E departments or to run in ambulances.",13,418,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00418
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mr Speaker, we need a strong SAF that can defend Singapore but it must and can be built up without compromising the safety and well-being of Singapore’s precious sons serving their National Service. CFC Lee was an exemplary soldier who served with commitment, and was well-respected by his peers for his positive attitude. The loss of such a good soldier like CFC Lee is deeply grievous to us. It will take collective effort to achieve zero training fatalities. Each serviceman must take care of himself or sound the alert when his buddy is not well, or if regulations are not complied with during training. Commanders must be alert and pull out early those who are not coping and use another occasion to train.",14,419,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00419
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,Zero training deaths must be the norm and any mishap should be vigorously attended to by commanders to achieve this norm. Let me conclude by expressing this House’s deep condolences to the late CFC Lee’s family. The SAF has updated the family of the COI’s findings and the actions that the SAF is taking to prevent recurrences of the lapses found. I assure all Members that MINDEF and the SAF will do all it can to help the family through this difficult period.,15,420,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00420

2018-08-06-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the hon Minister for Defence on 18 April 2018, before the fast march started, when CFC Lee and the other platoon mates were asked whether or not they had seven hours of uninterrupted sleep, what was the response of his platoon mates and himself? And if they did not respond that they did not have seven hours of uninterrupted sleep, how do we, in future, make sure that the soldiers would state the truth of the matter?",1,422,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00422
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mr Speaker, the facts are what I have recounted. The findings were recounted by the COI and that three troopers stood out, declared that they did not fulfil all the conditions of the conducting officer, and they were deployed as marshals and were not put on the 8-km fast march. How do we ensure that, in their zeal, perhaps, soldiers take cognisance and take training safety regulations seriously? I presume that some of them who did not have seven hours uninterrupted sleep, for instance, still said, ""I can go on"". As I have said, this was the external safety review panel's comment too, that you have got to make it second nature for the trainees to say, ""Look, this is for my own self-protection or my buddy. I am going to tell on you because you did not do it, because I am going to protect you."" We thought that one crucial factor was to give more opportunities for make-up training. So, if they know they have time to make up and they would not fail the course, there will be more incentives for them to declare that they did not have it. And if commanders know now that if the conditions are not met, they will ensure that the conditions are met.",1,423,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00423
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"There is not going to be an easy answer. At this stage of ours where we have the regulations but we are not sure every-body follows these, we need every-body to play their part to achieve zero training fatalities.",2,424,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00424
2018-08-06-T-014,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Minister for the Ministerial Statement with many details of the COI Report. I would like to ask the Minister – not sure if I heard correctly – what was the COI's finding with respect to the detection of the physical status of the soldier CFC Dave Lee, during the fast march itself. Did any of his colleagues or instructors detect or spot that he was not coping well during the training? My second question is this  would the SAF look into the possibility of training commanders for early detection of soldiers who are not coping well during an extreme, strenuous exercise like the fast march so that they can be pulled out before the completion of the fast march.",1,425,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00425
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mr Speaker, the findings are, again, as I have given in the Ministerial Statement. For the first 6 km, there did not seem to be any witness who noticed anything out of the ordinary. He took his 20-minute rest. During the last 2 km, he complained of cramps, told his commanders and his commanders advised him to stretch, which he did. And he was the last one to complete the fast march. It was only at the end of the fast march as he was walking towards the company line that they noticed that he was disoriented and then, the medics and others gave him immediate attention.",1,426,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00426
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"How do we ensure better recognition by commanders and men? That indeed is the point. So, as I have said, one of the recommendations is to take the guesswork out of this. In this instance, those attending to him thought he had physical exhaustion, not heat exhaustion. The immediate training safety regulation, effective now, is that we do not really care what the reason is. As soon as anybody is disoriented, we take him out, we send him to the medical centre, where there are facilities, where there is expertise. And I think we have learnt from this that, you do not guess, you may not be in the best position, err on the side of caution. And we want a simple mechanism where you can determine if someone is disoriented. If he is not oriented to time, place and identity, that is it – to either one, not all three – you evacuate him.",2,427,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00427

2018-08-06-T-014,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"I thank the Minister for his comprehensive answer. In the Report, I do not sense that the weather was a factor for this heat injury. But in the face of global warming – and the last few months have been very, very intense weather – I am just curious  are commanders given the discretion to, in extreme weather conditions, extreme heat waves, pare down the training or is there an SOP to allow them to have flexibility, not during normal times, but extreme heat situations?",1,429,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00429
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mr Speaker, Sir, our training requirements are much more serious than that. It is not discretionary, and Members will remember when I updated this House about what the requirements are for fast marches or any training activities, we use special sensors which measure the wet globe temperature and, depending on what the temperature is based on this instrument, you mandate work-rest cycles – you can only work so much and you need to rest so much.",1,430,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00430
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"So, yes, indeed, temperature is taken into account. In fact, after this, we looked around other militaries to see whether we were more stringent or less stringent than others. And we have learnt from it. So, different militaries use different work-rest cycles depending on what the temperature or the humidity is. So, we are reviewing that. But it is not a discretion given to commanders. They must follow it. It is part of the TSR.",2,431,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00431

2018-08-06-T-014,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I thank the Minister for sharing the Committee of Inquiry's Report. I think the next steps are all quite logical. But one of the things that struck me – this was a trainee who, for all intents and purposes, appeared healthy to everyone, even completed the exercise and then passed out after that. There are many situations where tough training pushes people to the limits. So, are there any thoughts about looking at exercise-specific instructions? For example, if you are doing, say, trench-digging, where you would not sleep for a number of nights, you might be a little bit tired; you might be a little bit disoriented. But does that require the same procedures – what is normal, what is not? And maybe something more attuned to specific exercises, particularly those that are higher, I guess, that test people more may be useful as well because it will probably be different in different exercises.",1,433,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00433
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The approach that the Army uses is graduation – in other words, graduated activities that train up. So, if you notice from my Ministerial Statement, one of the pre-requisites that the conducting officer had asked was  have all of you done the 6-km march? And some did not, alerted themselves and fell out of the march.",1,434,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00434
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"So, there was graduation, and not only in terms of just distance but tolerance for heat. So, that is also built into the programme. I would say at our level that we have not had a heat stroke of this magnitude for the last nine years, as I have said. Unfortunately, the commanders, those who dealt with CFC Lee had never encountered one in their own experience and that may have been part of the problem.",2,435,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00435
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"How do we simulate this? How do we teach better? I think it is a challenge.

2018-08-06-T-014,Randolph Tan,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"I am not sure if I understood correctly, is it true to say that the conclusion is that CFC Lee's condition and the 6-km march could not be linked to what happened to him subsequently? Did the COI actually give any conclusions about whether there was a link? My second clarification is  I think the Minister said earlier that wearables were considered but have now been ruled out. Would the possible use of wearables continue to be explored?",2,439,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00439
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mr Speaker, what the COI did was to investigate in detail, first of all, chronologically, the events leading to the heat stroke. And they started from the day before the fast march. I have related how there were a number of activities, two of which did not comply with Training Safety Regulations – one part of the lesson plan where CFC Lee ran faster than he should have for three laps of 400 m each. And that night where there was an informal unauthorised punishment which lasted 30-35 minutes which resulted in them not having seven hours of sleep as required – they had about six hours 15 minutes or thereabouts.",1,440,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00440
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The COI concluded, based on all these findings – and I would repeat this because I think it is important – that CFC Dave Lee's death was a result of heat stroke. There is no argument there. Other than this, they did not find any physical injury sustained nor any foul play or medical negligence. The COI was unable to ascertain the direct causes which led CFC Lee to suffer from heat stroke. It noted the possible contributory causes were ""accumulated fatigue, insufficient rest and less than optimal state of health and his potential use of medication"". These are words that they used. But their preliminary assessment was that the likely reasons for him succumbing to the heat stroke were inadequate on-site casualty management and delayed evacuation to the medical centre. Heat stroke is usually a culmination of events – exposure to heat, your own body's mechanisms cannot cope with the heat produced and it shuts down. The COI opined that they could not find any direct cause but it could have been due to a number of accumulated causes. But they felt that his succumbing to the heat stroke was a result of delay between the symptoms and evacuation.",2,441,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00441
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"I think the Member's second question was on wearables. We had an expert panel of doctors – the Chair, who is a senior consultant in the A&E Department in SGH – and they concluded that wearables that are on the market do not measure core temperature that well because, for heat injuries or heat strokes, you need to measure core temperature. In this case, as you have noticed, when they touched CFC Lee's skin, it was actually cold, cooler than norm – it was not warm. So, if you have wearables that measure surface temperature, it does not quite work. You have to measure core temperatures and the technology just is not there yet.",3,442,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00442

2018-08-06-T-014,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),I thank the Minister for the Report. My condolences to the family. I have one clarification and one question. The first clarification is the part about the conducting officer asking them if they had seven hours of rest. The troop apparently did not respond to that. Did the COI talk about why they did not respond to that? Was there a reason why they did not? That is the first clarification.,1,444,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00444
2018-08-06-T-014,Kok Heng Leun,Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member),"The second question is, I wonder if there is a daily log of the activities that the troops go through that would have been recorded everyday so that that would include how many hours of rest that they have or any extra activities that have been added on. Is there such a daily log that has been placed so that we could check on it, at least, for the conducting officer?",2,445,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00445
2018-08-06-T-014,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mr Speaker, those are good questions. I would have to go back to the detailed COI Report to see whether they had asked the various platoon members why they did not all say they did not have the seven hours of sleep. From what I can recollect, they did not give specific reasons. And as I have said, one surmises that they wanted to do it because they wanted to carry on with their training.",1,446,2018-08-06-T-014-S-00446

Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to preserve the ease of doing shipping business in Singapore. Specifically, this clause exempts Shipowners' Liens from the requirement of registration as a charge under section 131 of the Companies Act. A Shipowner's Lien is a standard feature in ship charterparties.

2018-08-06-T-018,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"First, leaving aside the long standing industry custom and practice where shipowners do not habitually register Shipowners' Liens, the registration of Shipowners' Liens is particularly difficult from a practical perspective. This is because each ship is typically subject to a continual series of charterparties, each entered into as quickly as possible, to ensure that the ship is continually gainfully employed. Often, charters are for periods as short as a few days. This means that many charterparties may have been completed before a charge can even be registered.",13,468,2018-08-06-T-018-S-00468

2018-08-06-T-018,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"We have taken a different approach. In our case, the Bill, while exempting such Shipowners' Liens from registration requirements under section 131 of the Companies Act, maintains the Singapore Courts' characterisation in the Diablo case of such liens as charges. The effect of this is that the Shipowners' Lien retains its essential nature as a security but without the need for registration. As a result, the Shipowners' Lien will take priority over other charges created subsequent to it, as well as over unsecured creditors. This is unlike Hong Kong where, given that a Shipowners' Lien is not a charge to begin with, it will not take priority over other charges, and will rank pari passu with unsecured claims.",19,474,2018-08-06-T-018-S-00474

However, creditors and members, who were bound by a compromise or scheme of arrangement before the amendments in 2014, were inadvertently excluded from the amended provision, in respect of a company which is in the course of being wound up.

The charterers then went into liquidation and the owners sought to enforce a lien over subhire pursuant to clause 18 of the bareboat charterparty by serving a lien on the pool. The pool withheld hire payments to the charterer. The liquidators applied to the high court directing payment of the charterhire to the charterer.,5,486,2018-08-06-T-018-S-00486

Although it can be said that the decisions of the Court of Appeal and the high court are not surprising given that they are, in some respects, consistent with English law on the registrability of liens on sub-hire and sub-freights, the recent decisions are none the less the first local judicial pronouncements on the effect of the non-registration of such liens. The shipping community led by the Singapore Shipping Association bemoaned the “onerous” and “administrative burden” of having to register all such liens and pleaded for a “statutory carve out”.",7,488,2018-08-06-T-018-S-00488

And I am in total agreement. Such a lien clause is very common in standard charterparties all over the world, not just in bareboat charterparties which is the subject of the Diablo case but also in time and even voyage charterparties; in many of these commonly used charterparty forms we will use a variant of a lien clause allowing lien over hire, freight, sub-freights or sub-hire. Parties all over the world enter into charterparties on an everyday basis. Singapore is of course a major maritime hub in the world with many shipping businesses setting up companies, subsidiaries and operations in Singapore.

Otherwise, the shipowners and charterers would have to compete with unsecured creditors for payment.

Let us take a scenario of two marine vessels colliding within Singapore port limits, resulting in deaths. A Coroner's inquiry or other Inquiry will usually be conducted, which means the police will likely commence investigations. Under this Bill, the TSIB will also be activated to conduct its own investigations into what caused the accident. Will the TSIB and police share their findings with each other, or will they work independently? Is there a possibility of conflicting findings being reached by TSIB and other agencies, for example, TSIB may find that there was a mechanical problem in one of the vessels, while the police may find that the crew was reckless. Further, according to clause 21 of the Bill, the TSIB report will be admissible before a Coroner's Inquiry.

In that incident, there was controversy around whether the crash had been caused by deliberate pilot action, or by mechanical or other causes. A law suit was brought in Singapore by the families of six victims who refused to reach settlements with Silkair. The court had to consider two conflicting findings from transportation investigation agencies – the Indonesian National Safety Transportation Committee and the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The Indonesian agency concluded that the cause of death was unascertainable while the US NTSB found that the crash was likely caused by intentional pilot action. Eventually, the court found that the cause was unascertainable and the families lost their cases. However, if the US NTSB finding had been accepted, Silkair would not have been covered by the applicable Warsaw Conventions to limit payout to each victim to US$75,000 each.",9,562,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00562

This is potentially worrying. In the normal course of events, the TSIB would have interviewed the relevant parties in the incident before coming to conclusions in any draft report.

Rather, the prevention work that is in place to lower the probability of an accident happening at all is imperative. Can the Minister explain how will the TSIB be staffed with sufficient professionals with the necessary skills to collate information, analyse and study the patterns of near-misses and anticipate weak links so that preventative measures can be drawn up and implemented?

Eventually, the US attorney did not pursue criminal charges against the operator as the incident was determined to be not deliberate as the operator had simply “lost control” of the device. This brings to mind some grave concerns. Indeed, most accidents are not deliberate, so who will be held responsible if damages, casualties, or even fatalities stem from a drone accident? In July 2014, a drone had narrowly missed colliding with an Airbus A320 as it was taking off from London's Heathrow airport. In Singapore, we have been fortunate to have had no serious accidents involving drones.

For example, the Bill limits the TSIB’s role to investigating only incidents involving buses that are operating under the LTA’s public bus service contracts. Why not extend the powers to cover all types of bus incidents? With so much innovation disrupting the land transport sector currently, should not the TSIB have the powers to step in and investigate major incidents on our public roads that are beyond the public bus contracts?",4,584,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00584

It is my understanding that military and police vehicles are exempt because otherwise the personnel involved would have to give testimony that may cover national security matters. Hence, I would like to ask the Minister under what circumstances would the Air Force or Navy request the TSIB to investigate an incident involving a military aircraft or a military vessel? If a request is, indeed, made for the TSIB to investigate, some protocol should be put in place to address and safeguard security information relating to the incident or the assets.",6,586,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00586

It is a fairly unique process; it has been tested in practice; it has an international application. It arose really from our obligations under some international treaties, ICAO and IMO.",2,594,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00594
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"This Bill brings together the work that has been already ongoing. The TSIB was administratively created in August 2016, coming out of the Air Accident Investigation Bureau. They have been doing the work already but this Bill will facilitate that work, it brings it together under one legislative framework, and it enables the investigators to effectively perform their safety functions, improve transport safety, and be in accord with international practices as well as our international agreements under one legislative framework.",3,595,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00595
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Many countries have a similar multi-modal transport investigation agency – Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, the US. Having a multi-modal transport safety investigation agency allows the cross-sharing of best practices and resources. While there is a need for domain-specific industry experience, engineering experience, safety operation experience, there is a significant amount of cross-sharing in terms of legal practices, cross-border issues, and how one interfaces with other Government agencies, among other things.",4,596,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00596
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"So, there is a need for deep specialisation – aviation experts, maritime experts, subsequently rail experts. But there is also a need to bring them together administratively, and the experience from overseas shows that this works. It also allows the deepening of the investigation expertise, for example, in the human factors and system factors.",5,597,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00597
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The TSIB is staffed with very experienced and competent investigators, currently with aviation and maritime industry experience. So, this industry experience is something very significant. While they have been in industry, they have had the experience of operating some of these safety issues, of designing safety policies within their agency, within their commercial organisation. So, they bring to bear, when they come and work under the TSIB, all of those years of experience. The director has 20 years of experience and is a fairly senior person, and it is that level of expertise that we will need to have.",6,598,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00598
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Some of the Members asked about training and capability development. The investigators attend both local as well as foreign training courses to update their knowledge of transport systems, to sharpen their investigation capabilities. And the training is ongoing; it is not just merely at the point of entry at TSIB. They go on attachments with TSIB’s counterparts. Indeed, we are able to and have brought in both volunteer investigators as well as appointed overseas experts, depending on the nature of the incident and the case that is being investigated. A whole series of resources will be brought together, depending on what is needed.",7,599,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00599
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The number of people, however, that we need here in Singapore in order to do this, while they are very talented and have deep expertise, is probably not a number that will justify a single training centre. So, that is not something that we are currently planning on.",8,600,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00600
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"We are planning to build up our rail safety investigation capabilities over the next two years through the recruitment and training of rail safety investigators. But we are not looking to do this by transferring people across different parts of the Government because these types of capabilities will be needed in other agencies and in other entities, because there is an ongoing need for investigations, for disciplinary processes, enforcement and regulations, and so forth. So, we want to build up a separate arm of capability.",9,601,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00601
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The objective of the TSIB is really just to focus on the safety standards, looking at the causes, drawing safety lessons, preventing recurrence.",10,602,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00602
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"As has been noted, we have included the provision for TSIB to be activated to investigate incidents involving LTA-contracted bus services. The question was raised about why not all buses, why not all major incidents? So, again, I would reiterate, there are plenty of other organisations and agencies that can investigate – the Police; LTA itself can conduct an investigation; the Minister for Transport can also convene committees and Commissions of Inquiry, for instance.",11,603,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00603
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"So, by constituting TSIB, it is not that all investigations will only happen under the remit of TSIB. It is a very specific and particular type of investigation that will happen under TSIB, and all the other agencies that can continue to investigate incidents and systems will continue to have that opportunity to do so.",12,604,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00604
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The reason why we have looked at the provisions specifically for LTA-contracted bus services, firstly, it is about the systems associated with it. You need something which is a fairly complex system, to begin with organisationally, to justify this type of investigation.",13,605,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00605
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Secondly, ordinary road accidents usually are about human error and the opportunity is there for Traffic Police as well as the LTA to investigate. But in this case, we wanted something apart from LTA to investigate LTA-contracted services. I hope that answers the Member's questions. This independent assessment of safety issues and recommendations would run in parallel to any potential traffic police investigation.",14,606,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00606
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The TSI Bill does provide for the investigation of incidents involving unmanned aircraft, unmanned vessels, unmanned rail vehicles, and, at the Minister's direction, unmanned buses which operate on services contracted by LTA.",15,607,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00607
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"There were a number of questions about military vehicles and exemptions. This is a requirement under international agreements that the transport safety investigations are not conducted into occurrences involving only military and state transport vehicles. So, as part of that international agreement, we have had to then put in that exemption clause. But we do have jurisdiction to investigate the occurrences between one of these exempted vehicles and one which is not, that is, one which is a civilian vehicle.",16,608,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00608
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"One of the Members asked about what are the circumstances in which the SAF would request the TSIB to conduct an investigation into a transport occurrence that involves a Singapore military ship or Singapore military aircraft – I think that is an issue for them to answer. TSIB is available as a pool of resources and expertise that are there, so, if there is a need for this particular type of safety investigation and we are resourced to be called upon by the SAF. If the investigation involves information that is relevant for national security, there are already protocols in place, and that came out of the experience that the Air Accident Investigation Bureau had, working together with RSAF. So, protocols have been developed and they will extend across all these different inter-agency boundaries to deal with issues around sensitive information, to allow these investigations to proceed.",17,609,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00609
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Members brought up the issue of the exemption that the Minister for Transport can order through the Gazette. This will only be exercised in highly exceptional cases and it will not be taken lightly. This exemption arises from the fact that there is an international requirement for the provisions of the Bill, which provide TSIB with a significant amount of powers, and require the reports to be made public, and we do want to make sure that when it is necessary from a national interest, that certain vehicles can be exempted from those provisions. It will be done through an order in the Gazette and will not be taken lightly.",18,610,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00610
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"In the past two years, the TSIB has initiated an average of 17 investigations into aviation and marine incidents per year. Each investigation takes approximately one year to complete. TSIB institutes its own investigations. There is no transfer of investigations from other agencies, and there will not be as these new domains are investigated. These will be independent and separate investigations.",19,611,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00611
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Mr Ng asked about the detention of vehicles, Clause 30, which empowers the director to detain a transport vehicle for the reasons given. There is no expressed cap on the duration of detention. Clause 30, para 5, explicitly says ""The Director must not detain a transport vehicle under this section for longer than is necessary and reasonable to exercise any other powers under this Act."" The transport vehicle can only be detained for both what is necessary and reasonable to facilitate the investigations. So, TSIB will be mindful not to detain these vehicles for longer than necessary.",20,612,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00612
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"With respect to the issue of costs, today already, air incident investigation costs and expenses are recovered from owners and operators whose aircraft are the subject of investigations. So, clause 18 is really looking for parity across a number of domains just to make sure that the same approach and same treatment is applied.",21,613,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00613
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The examples of the types of costs was asked. For example, the cost of conducting specialised tests, recovering and storing the wreckage as well as administrative and operational overheads of conducting the investigation.",22,614,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00614
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Ms Sylvia Lim in particular asked about the information that will be obtained by the TSIB in the course of investigation. So, the requirement is that the information is used solely for the purpose of improving transport safety. That is why the Bill is crafted in the way it is, in order to maintain that opportunity to have a free flow of information without the fear that the persons giving that information will be penalised. So, in order to do so, the TSIB staff, as well as former staff who are involved need to be distanced from judicial proceedings. They cannot be compelled to give evidence in civil or criminal proceedings related to the incident. Further to that, some information such as onboard recording information cannot be disclosed. This is the international practice.",23,615,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00615
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The final part of this component is that the investigation report is inadmissible as evidence in courts and proceedings with the exception of the coroner's inquiry and that is to stay consistent with the fundamental purpose of this transport safety investigations. The reason why the coroner's inquiry has an exception made for it is because the purpose of the coroner's inquiry is to determine the cause and circumstances connected with the death without necessarily framing a finding as to determining a question of criminal, civil or disciplinary liability.",24,616,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00616
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"However, this barrier against disclosure is not absolute. Under clause 43, paragraph 4, the High Court may order the disclosure of the restricted information if it is satisfied that this is necessary. But ultimately, it is the coroner's prerogative to decide whether it is necessary to wait for the conclusion of the TSIB investigation before making a decision about the cause of death, the verdict on the cause of death. This is not under TSIB's remit, it will be up to the coroner to decide and the coroner will be aware that this investigation is happening and the coroner will have to make that decision.",25,617,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00617
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"There are issues with respect to the coordination of multiple investigations from multiple agencies. So, the agencies involved have developed a standard operating procedure to make sure that they adhere to their own regulatory framework as well as to allow the investigation to proceed. If there is sharing of information, it is done within the regulatory and legal frameworks for each investigation and for each agency.",26,618,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00618
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Indeed, during the course of the investigation, the TSIB will engage with the parties concerned to deliberate the information collected to analyse the contributing factors and to try to make some preliminary recommendations. But ultimately, the drafting and the report is by TSIB. The TSIB has to take full responsibility for those recommendations and stand by them. So, where there is, for example, conflicting information that is coming in, TSIB has to make the decision about what would be their recommendations and justify these in their report.",27,619,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00619
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked particularly about the issue of making the draft report available. This is a practice that has been happening in the aviation industry, particularly, internationally and the commercial players see value in this because it increases public confidence in the safety of the processes – their processes as well as the international agreements. It should be seen not as a vetting of the final report but as a completion of the fact-finding and analysis of the information that is there and how experts interpret what has happened.",28,620,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00620
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"But ultimately, the positioning of where TSIB sits within the Ministry, its protections under the law, and the structure of their operations as regulated by this Bill give it that independence from commercial interests. I am sure there will be an attempt to put across vested interests and lobbying so on and so forth, but it is precisely because of that, that we need to ensure that there are protections for the director of TSIB and the officers of TSIB to have that independence when they issue their recommendations in their final report.",29,621,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00621
2018-08-06-T-019,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Ms Joan Pereira asked about the penalty for failing to respond to safety recommendations. This is not the penalty for a safety lapse. This is not a penalty for a safety lapse. This is a penalty for failing to administratively cooperate with the TSIB and respond to safety recommendations. It is not as a punitive penalty for a safety lapse for an incident, which is a matter not for TSIB to determine but for the police or for the agencies or the regulators to investigate and determine as needed.",30,622,2018-08-06-T-019-S-00622

He died at the scene.",1,632,2018-08-06-T-021-S-00632
2018-08-06-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The runaway wheel also narrowly missed another motorcyclist as it tumbled across the road. It was sheer luck that others did not come into contact with this wheel and suffer the consequences. That motorcyclist was the late Mr Slemat Rakisan. He was 57 years old. I knew Mr Slemat. We were fellow community leaders serving together in Jurong GRC. He was a well-loved gentleman. The hon Minister and grassroots adviser of Yuhua GROs, Ms Grace Fu, in her eulogy posting, described him as a ""humble and compassionate leader"" who also brought much laughter with his Tom Jones and Elvis Presley impersonations. I met him just the weekend before he died at a community music event. The randomness of the accident leading to his death remains disconcerting.",2,633,2018-08-06-T-021-S-00633
2018-08-06-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Just three months after the KJE accident, there was yet another instance of a loose wheel coming off a Malaysian-registered truck this time, on the West Coast Highway. This rolled across the lanes and smashed into a car travelling in the opposite direction. Thankfully, the driver of the car only suffered a minor injury to his right ear.",3,634,2018-08-06-T-021-S-00634
2018-08-06-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Wheels come off the vehicles as a result of mechanical failures. These unfortunate accidents illustrate how mechanical failure in heavy vehicles often lead to accidents that may cause serious injuries or fatalities. Regrettably, these two are not the only instances of accidents involving mechanical failure in heavy vehicles. In July last year, a private bus driver realised the brakes of the bus had failed, and to avoid a collision with the stationary cars in his path, he mounted a kerb intending to manoeuvre his vehicle into a nearby tree for a controlled crash. Unfortunately, he hit a woman cycling home from work along a footway. She died at the scene. It was determined by the Coroner after an inquiry that the brake failure was due to a missing drain valve component, which led to the bus having no braking ability whatsoever.",4,635,2018-08-06-T-021-S-00635
2018-08-06-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In such fatal accidents caused by mechanical failure, as opposed to driver negligence or recklessness, these are often ruled as misadventures and there is little that the authorities can presently do to impose criminal liability for the accidents, although civil remedies such as insurance claims remain available. This state of affairs is, with respect, unsatisfactory because the parties responsible for maintaining the critical component parts of the heavy vehicles that failed, escape criminal liability for causing the accidents.",5,636,2018-08-06-T-021-S-00636
2018-08-06-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),I respectfully suggest that the Government consider imposing liability on the owners and operators of the heavy vehicles to hold them to account for accidents arising from mechanical failure that may be obviated through proper maintenance.,6,637,2018-08-06-T-021-S-00637
2018-08-06-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"It is well known that a significant number of fatal accidents involve heavy vehicles.

2018-08-06-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In the workplace context, the figures of fatal accidents involving heavy vehicles are also concerning. In September 2017, Minister of State for Manpower, Mr Sam Tan highlighted that in 2016, 22 workers were involved in fatal accidents caused by moving vehicles. This was a 47% increase from 2014. He also highlighted that in the first half of 2017, there were 379 injuries and 7 fatalities caused by vehicle-related incidents. This led to implementation of new workplace vehicle safety initiatives, which is very welcomed.",8,639,2018-08-06-T-021-S-00639
2018-08-06-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"It appears that there are no publicly available studies which has been done to ascertain how many of these accidents involved mechanical failure. What is clear is that such accidents do happen, whether in Singapore or overseas. In the 2015 Major Accident Investigation Report conducted by the Australian National Truck Accident Research Centre, it was stated that mechanical failures accounted for 5% of crash incidents in Australia, with tyre failure accounting for 72% of losses attributable to mechanical fault. In the United States, federal statistics show that mechanical failure plays a role in 12% of all motor vehicle accidents.",9,640,2018-08-06-T-021-S-00640

This would cover accidents caused by the behaviour of drivers of heavy vehicles, such as speeding and red-running. However, whilst it is an offence under the Road Traffic Act for a person who causes a heavy motor vehicle to collide with any buildings or structures, there is no specific offence under the Act which attributes responsibility of the owners and operators of heavy vehicles for road traffic accidents caused by mechanical failure that is preventable.",12,643,2018-08-06-T-021-S-00643

2018-08-06-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Last year, a public bus driver was acquitted of the offence of rash driving. He was accused of driving above the speed limit whilst negotiating a bend along the slip road of Bukit Timah Expressway into Dairy Farm Road. The bus crashed.

2018-08-06-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),The prosecution's expert witness testified that he found an air leak in one of the bus' air pipes which could have affected the brake efficiency but he could not conduct a brake efficiency test due to the damage the bus sustained in the crash.,15,646,2018-08-06-T-021-S-00646

2018-08-06-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),What is evident from the case is that there was no focus on the bus company to ascertain whether it had properly maintained the brake system of the bus.

Secondly, a daily pre-operational check is also recommended as a simple and useful way to spot potential risks or defects before the vehicles are operated.

With close collaborations between Government, unions and employers, we will do our best to educate and help consumers, and to retrain workers, so that Singaporeans can ride the wave of the digital revolution.",6,705,2018-08-06-T-026-S-00705
2018-08-06-T-027,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what is the projected number of Data Protection Officers (DPO) needed in Singapore for the next five years; (b) what is the current shortfall; and (c) what is the Ministry's plan to train and deploy more DPOs.,1,706,2018-08-06-T-027-S-00706
2018-08-06-T-027,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"It is mandatory under the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), for all private-sector organisations to designate one or more individuals as a Data Protection Officer (DPO). The DPO is responsible for ensuring that the organisation complies with the PDPA.",1,707,2018-08-06-T-027-S-00707
2018-08-06-T-027,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"According to a 2018 survey commissioned by the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC), close to 60% of private sector organisations in Singapore have appointed at least one DPO. This represents a six percentage point increase from the previous year. PDPC is studying this issue closely, with a view to increasing both the numbers and capabilities of DPOs.",2,708,2018-08-06-T-027-S-00708
2018-08-06-T-027,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"There are two parts to my Ministry and PDPC's plan to train and deploy more DPOs. Firstly, we are developing and supporting training programmes for DPOs. For example, since 2014, PDPC has developed an e-learning programme for DPOs to learn about the fundamentals of the PDPA.",3,709,2018-08-06-T-027-S-00709
2018-08-06-T-027,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"PDPC is supplementing this by rolling out more advanced training programmes to enhance DPOs' skills. These include the Professional Conversion Programme for DPOs, which started last month, and the Practitioner Certificate for Personal Data Protection Preparatory Course, which starts in October this year. In addition, PDPC has supported the development of personal data protection-related courses to be taught at the National University of Singapore and Singapore Management University starting this academic year, through which graduates can attain professional, internationally recognised certification.",4,710,2018-08-06-T-027-S-00710
2018-08-06-T-027,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The second part of our strategy is to foster a collaborative environment where DPOs can learn best practices. PDPC is making Singapore a training hub for data protection professionals in the region by anchoring data protection-related events here, such as the annual Personal Data Protection Seminar hosted by PDPC. PDPC is also encouraging the formation of more communities of practice, such as AsiaDPO and the Law Society's Cybersecurity and Data Protection Committee.",5,711,2018-08-06-T-027-S-00711
2018-08-06-T-027,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"While we continue to grow and deepen the pool of DPOs, organisations must also do their part by appointing and supporting their DPOs. By doing so, organisations will not just comply with the PDPA, but more importantly, build consumer trust in their ability to use and safeguard personal data responsibly.",6,712,2018-08-06-T-027-S-00712
2018-08-06-T-028,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak,asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs after the Trump-Kim summit (a) what role can Singapore play to keep up the momentum for dialogue between the US and North Korea; (b) whether Singapore is involved in any diplomatic efforts to encourage the denuclearisation of North Korea; and (c) how has the summit strengthened relations between Singapore and North Korea.,1,713,2018-08-06-T-028-S-00713
2018-08-06-T-028,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,Singapore acceded to the request by the US and the DPRK to host the Summit between US President Donald Trump and DPRK State Affairs Commission Chairman Kim Jong Un on 12 June 2018. We did so in order to facilitate peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula.,1,714,2018-08-06-T-028-S-00714
2018-08-06-T-028,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Before I address the role of Singapore in future developments on the Korean Peninsula, allow me to highlight two key features of the Summit that resonated with some of the key attributes of Singapore.",2,715,2018-08-06-T-028-S-00715
2018-08-06-T-028,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"First, the choice of Singapore as the venue of the Summit reaffirmed our reputation as an impartial, reliable and safe country. We did not put our hand up or volunteer to host the Summit, but we were pleased to provide a conducive and secure venue which had the full confidence of both parties. The US and the DPRK have publicly stated that they selected Singapore as host because we are politically neutral. Singaporeans can take pride in this expression of trust and confidence in us. We should continue to uphold our reputation as a credible, trusted and consistent partner that is able to play a constructive role on the international stage.",3,716,2018-08-06-T-028-S-00716
2018-08-06-T-028,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Second, hosting the Summit highlighted the importance of a whole-of-government effort. While MFA was the lead coordinating agency, an undertaking of this scale and nature is not something that MFA can do alone. We worked closely with other Ministries and agencies, including MHA, MINDEF and MCI, amongst others, to organise the Summit. The various agencies had to deal with the major security and logistical challenges, as well as facilitating the large global media presence. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all members of Team Singapore who made this Summit possible. I am also grateful to all Singaporeans for your understanding and patience during the Summit.",4,717,2018-08-06-T-028-S-00717
2018-08-06-T-028,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Let me now address the question on Singapore's role in the dialogue between the US and the DPRK. We were not involved in the direct bilateral discussions between the US and the DPRK that led to the signing of the Joint Statement between the two leaders in Singapore. Neither are we party to the ongoing discussions between the US, Japan, ROK, China, Russia and the DPRK. Singapore welcomes the Joint Statement at the Singapore Summit, which is an important step forward, and we wish the US and the DPRK success in implementing it.",5,718,2018-08-06-T-028-S-00718
2018-08-06-T-028,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Of course, we are aware that the Summit is only the first step in a long and difficult peace process. We hope that the US and the DPRK will continue to engage in dialogue and make efforts towards peace, building on the agreement forged during the Singapore Summit. The ASEAN Foreign Ministers have also issued a statement welcoming the successful conclusion of the Summit.",6,719,2018-08-06-T-028-S-00719
2018-08-06-T-028,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Although Singapore is not party to the ongoing negotiations on the Korean Peninsula, anything that happens on the Peninsula will affect the rest of the region, including Singapore. It is in our collective interest to see a peaceful, stable and denuclearised Korean Peninsula, and we will continue to support efforts to these ends.",7,720,2018-08-06-T-028-S-00720
2018-08-06-T-028,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"What are some of these efforts? On our part, we encourage the DPRK's engagement with the international community, such as through participation in multilateral fora. One of these is the ASEAN Regional Forum, or the ARF for short, which was just held in Singapore over the last weekend on 4 August 2018. The ARF is a constructive platform for participants to promote confidence-building and preventive diplomacy in the region. It is currently the only ASEAN-led platform that the DPRK is a member of, and we hope that their continued participation in the ARF would contribute to efforts in resolving the situation on the Korean Peninsula.",8,721,2018-08-06-T-028-S-00721
2018-08-06-T-028,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"The Singapore Summit has also helped broaden our relations with the DPRK. Prime Minister Lee met Chairman Kim on the sidelines of the Summit, where the two leaders exchanged views on Singapore-DPRK relations, as well as developments in the DPRK and on the Korean Peninsula. I also visited Pyongyang in the lead-up to the Summit, at the invitation of Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho. During my visit, I called on President of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly Kim Yong Nam, and met Foreign Minister Ri. We had wide-ranging and frank discussions on bilateral relations, developments on the Korean Peninsula and global issues. I continued my discussion on these issues when I hosted Foreign Minister Ri on his visit to Singapore last week, in conjunction with his participation in the ARF. These engagements with the DPRK have increased the mutual understanding between our two countries.",9,722,2018-08-06-T-028-S-00722
2018-08-06-T-028,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"At the same time, notwithstanding the positive developments on the Korean Peninsula in recent months, the reality is that United Nations Security Council sanctions on the DPRK remain in place. All UN Member States, including Singapore, are obligated to implement the UN Security Council Resolutions. We take our international obligations seriously, and remain committed to fully implementing the sanctions. We look forward to concrete progress towards the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, which would create an environment for the easing of sanctions.",10,723,2018-08-06-T-028-S-00723
2018-08-06-T-028,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"We will continue to keep our channels with the DPRK open, while fully complying with the UN Security Council Resolutions. We encourage the DPRK to continue engaging with the international community through multilateral fora. We hope that all parties involved will continue the dialogue and efforts towards establishing lasting peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.",11,724,2018-08-06-T-028-S-00724
2018-08-06-T-029,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari,asked the Minister for Health (a) what are the considerations for the locations of SingHealth dental clinics; (b) what is the average waiting time for patients to make a dental appointment; (c) whether there are plans to have more SingHealth dental clinics in other big estates to enable affordable dental services and accessibility to the public; and (d) whether a SingHealth dental clinic can be made available in every polyclinic.,1,725,2018-08-06-T-029-S-00725
2018-08-06-T-029,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Singaporeans can receive subsidised primary dental care at polyclinics as well as private dental clinics through the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS). There are currently more than 700 CHAS dental clinics and together, they served a total of about 438,000 patient attendances in 2017.",1,726,2018-08-06-T-029-S-00726
2018-08-06-T-029,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Ten of our polyclinics also offer subsidised primary care dental services. The median waiting time for new dental appointments at our polyclinics is about 4.5 months in 2017, compared to 5.8 months in 2013.",2,727,2018-08-06-T-029-S-00727
2018-08-06-T-029,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Specifically on the Member's question about dental clinics at SingHealth polyclinics, there are three of them in the eastern region, serving about 31,000 patient attendances in 2017. They are Bedok Polyclinic, Punggol Polyclinic and Tampines Polyclinic.",3,728,2018-08-06-T-029-S-00728
2018-08-06-T-029,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In planning for dental care capacity, MOH takes into account both CHAS dental clinics and polyclinic dental capacity. Therefore, not every polyclinic will need to provide dental care services if overall, there is adequate subsidised capacity to meet the dental care needs within a geographic location.",4,729,2018-08-06-T-029-S-00729
2018-08-06-T-030,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Home Affairs how is the regime in the Drug Rehabilitation Centre assisting inmates to stop their addiction and replace addictive desires with healthy pursuits.,1,730,2018-08-06-T-030-S-00730
2018-08-06-T-030,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) introduced the Enhanced Drug Rehabilitation Regime (EDRR) in the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) in 2014. Under the EDRR, inmates are assessed for their risks of re-offending and the severity of their drug abuse problem upon admission into DRC. They undergo psychology-based correctional programmes which are calibrated to their risk levels and target the underlying attitudes and beliefs behind their drug abuse problem. For example, lower-risk inmates learn about the consequences of drug use and pick up skills to prevent relapse. Higher-risk inmates will undergo high-intensity counselling programmes which address multiple risks and needs, such as criminal thinking and drug addiction issues.",1,731,2018-08-06-T-030-S-00731
2018-08-06-T-030,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"SPS also provides meaningful activities to engage DRC inmates and encourage them to desist from future drug abuse by pursuing healthy alternatives. One example is the Basketball Clinic programme, which encourages inmates to take up the sport, and inculcates positive values like teamwork. Another example is Urban Farming, which was introduced in May this year. Through this activity, inmates learn how to collaborate with others and to take ownership of shared goals. DRC inmates also participate in family programmes, skills training and religious counselling.",2,732,2018-08-06-T-030-S-00732
2018-08-06-T-030,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So far, we've seen encouraging results with the enhanced regime in DRC. The two-year recidivism rate of DRC inmates has come down from 60 – 70% in the 1990s to around 30% for the 2015 release cohort. We will continue to enhance the regime for even better outcomes.",3,733,2018-08-06-T-030-S-00733
2018-08-06-T-030,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"While interventions within DRC are important, community-based programmes also form an integral component of rehabilitation. It allows inmates to serve the tail-end of their DRC detention in the community under structured supervision, supporting their reintegration back into society. We will continue to work closely with our community partners to strengthen the support to inmates on this front.",4,734,2018-08-06-T-030-S-00734
2018-08-06-T-031,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Law (a) what is Singapore's contribution to the anticipated Singapore Convention on Mediation to be signed in August 2019; (b) how will the Convention be promoted; and (c) how is Singapore preparing the legal industry for it.,1,735,2018-08-06-T-031-S-00735
2018-08-06-T-031,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"On 25 June 2018, the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) at its 51st session in New York, decided to recommend to the 73rd United Nations General Assembly the following",1,736,2018-08-06-T-031-S-00736
2018-08-06-T-031,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"(a) first, to adopt a United Nations Convention on International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation;",2,737,2018-08-06-T-031-S-00737

2018-08-06-T-031,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,The Commission also adopted the Model Law on International Commercial Mediation and International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation.,5,740,2018-08-06-T-031-S-00740
2018-08-06-T-031,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In recent years, mediation has become an increasingly popular means for resolving cross-border commercial disputes. Mediation is cost-effective, flexible and efficient. It is particularly attractive for businesses who wish to preserve relationships and leave open the possibility of working together in future. However, one oft-cited concern of mediation is the lack of enforceability, should one party later renege on his obligations. The Convention will address this concern. It will make it easier for businesses to enforce mediated settlement agreements, provide certainty to users, and facilitate international commerce.",6,741,2018-08-06-T-031-S-00741
2018-08-06-T-031,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Singapore will host the signing ceremony of the Convention in August next year. It will be the first UN treaty named after Singapore. This will put Singapore on the world map for our thought leadership.,7,742,2018-08-06-T-031-S-00742
2018-08-06-T-031,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Support for Singapore to host the signing of this significant Convention and for the Convention to be known as the ""Singapore Convention on Mediation"" at UNCITRAL was unanimous. This is a strong testament to Singapore's leadership in international dispute resolution and Singapore’s contribution to the development of the Convention.",8,743,2018-08-06-T-031-S-00743
2018-08-06-T-031,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Singapore is today one of the leading cross-border dispute resolution centres in the world. We have a trusted legal system, with strong rule of law. We provide a complete suite of professional dispute resolution services to meet the varying needs of business, including litigation, arbitration and mediation. To this end, we have also set up Maxwell Chambers, the world’s first integrated dispute resolution complex.",9,744,2018-08-06-T-031-S-00744
2018-08-06-T-031,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As part of our efforts to strengthen the dispute resolution eco-system, Singapore has invested heavily in the development of international commercial mediation, including through building up institutions and updating our laws.",10,745,2018-08-06-T-031-S-00745
2018-08-06-T-031,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"(a) In 2014, we set up the Singapore International Mediation Centre (SIMC) to provide international commercial mediation services and the Singapore International Mediation Institute (SIMI) to set standards for mediation and professionalise the sector.",11,746,2018-08-06-T-031-S-00746
2018-08-06-T-031,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"(b) In 2016, we set up the Singapore International Dispute Resolution Academy (SIDRA) to complement service and training with research, to develop Singapore thought leadership in negotiation and dispute resolution, including in mediation.",12,747,2018-08-06-T-031-S-00747
2018-08-06-T-031,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"(c) In 2017, the Singapore Parliament passed the Mediation Act to strengthen the enforceability of mediated settlement agreements in Singapore. In other words, we have already sought to address in Singapore the fundamental problem which the Convention seeks to overcome.",13,748,2018-08-06-T-031-S-00748
2018-08-06-T-031,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As part of this effort, Singapore also contributed directly to the development of the Convention at UNCITRAL. We had a multi-agency team which worked hard on this. The team included MinLaw representatives and local industry experts, all of whom played a big part in seeing to the outcome we have today. Over a period of about three years, the delegation worked on the terms of the Convention, negotiating and building consensus when there were different positions amongst member states, and taking steps to ensure that diverse interests were accommodated. This process was chaired by a Singaporean. Overall, our team at UNCITRAL was able to exercise thought leadership on various issues of differences which emerged over the course of negotiation, leading to a successful outcome.",14,749,2018-08-06-T-031-S-00749
2018-08-06-T-031,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"While conclusion of the Convention would be a significant achievement, it is but the start of a long journey. Adoption will take time, as individual countries consider the implications of becoming parties to the Convention, get the support of various domestic stakeholders and make the necessary adjustments to enable implementation. When the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (the New York Convention) was first adopted in 1958, it had 10 signatories. This year, as it marks its 60th anniversary, the New York Convention now covers close to 160 parties.",15,750,2018-08-06-T-031-S-00750
2018-08-06-T-031,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,The Singapore Convention on Mediation will enter into force six months after three States have signed and ratified the Convention. We hope that a critical mass of like-minded countries can sign on to the Convention in the first instance when the Convention is open for signature in Singapore in August next year. Singapore will support UNCITRAL in its work to promote awareness of the Convention amongst member states. Singapore will also be happy to share our own expertise and experience supporting and developing international commercial mediation. We look forward to welcoming all interested States to Singapore to be the first signatories to the Convention.,16,751,2018-08-06-T-031-S-00751
2018-08-06-T-031,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Within Singapore, the next step is to ensure that we are ""Singapore Convention-ready"" in two ways  first, that our businesses are familiar with and competent in the use of mediation as another tool to handle commercial disputes; and second, that we have a good pool of practitioners who are capable of handling international commercial mediation and advising parties on its use. MinLaw will work with the industry and mediation institutions like the SIMC to conduct briefings to raise awareness of international commercial mediation, and to have available training in this area for interested corporate executives and legal practitioners.",17,752,2018-08-06-T-031-S-00752
2018-08-06-T-031,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,The Singapore Convention on Mediation is a great opportunity for Singapore to further strengthen our reputation as an international dispute resolution hub and for our legal industry to play a greater role in this growth area. My Ministry looks forward to working closely with the legal industry to propagate the benefits of the Convention and the strengths of our dispute resolution services to ensure that the needs of international commercial businesses operating out of Singapore continue to be well-served.,18,753,2018-08-06-T-031-S-00753
2018-08-06-T-032,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for Manpower what is the trend of graduate underemployment in Singapore and what Government interventions are in place to facilitate optimal deployment of degree holders to relevant jobs.,1,754,2018-08-06-T-032-S-00754
2018-08-06-T-032,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In line with international practice, Singapore tracks time-related underemployment, or the percentage of residents in part-time jobs but willing and able to engage in additional work. Among resident degree holders, such underemployment has remained stable at around 2% over the last decade.",1,755,2018-08-06-T-032-S-00755
2018-08-06-T-032,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Singapore's autonomous universities work closely with industry partners and sector agencies to ensure that course offerings stay relevant to the needs of industry.

2018-08-06-T-033,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,The lift lobbies and common corridors at HDB BTO projects are designed to be naturally lit and ventilated. This open concept design is eco-friendly and lowers maintenance costs.,1,761,2018-08-06-T-033-S-00761
2018-08-06-T-033,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In Singapore's tropical climate, especially during monsoon seasons, rainwater splashing along more open areas like lift lobbies and common corridors in a heavy downpour is inevitable. Hence, for weather protection, common corridors are provided with an extended overhang (that is, a canopy). While this measure is generally adequate, it may not be able to fully prevent the corridor from getting wet during heavy downpours accompanied by strong winds. To avoid water-ponding and overly wet floors during rain, the floors at lift lobbies and common corridors are graded to allow excess water to flow to the scupper drain.",2,762,2018-08-06-T-033-S-00762
2018-08-06-T-033,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"HDB introduces rain screens where appropriate, based on feedback from residents as well as its own studies. Nonetheless, such screens are not installed in all locations as some locations need to be kept open and well-ventilated for fire safety reasons.

2018-08-06-T-034,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Trap-Neuter-Release-Manage programme, or TNRM in short, is a humane and science-based method to reduce the stray dog population through sterilisation. Our animal welfare groups or AWGs, have been working on localised sterilisation efforts in different areas in Singapore for many years. To take these efforts further, AVA has announced a nation-wide TNRM programme to sterilise more than 70% of the stray dogs in Singapore over five years.",1,766,2018-08-06-T-034-S-00766
2018-08-06-T-034,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"AVA plans to implement the programme progressively from the last quarter of this year, with support from AWGs, veterinarians, and other stakeholders. AVA will provide funding support and resources, and maintain oversight over key operational work, such as trapping, sterilisation, and outreach. However, AVA cannot do it alone. The success of this programme requires close partnership with many stakeholders. In particular, we will need AWGs and vets to continue contributing their experience and expertise. For example, AWGs can help with trapping and rehoming efforts while vets can assist with the sterilisation procedure.",2,767,2018-08-06-T-034-S-00767
2018-08-06-T-034,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As for the Member's question on pet abandonment, AVA regularly reviews its regulations and programmes to promote responsible pet ownership. For example, AVA revised the dog licensing regime in March 2017. Pet businesses now have to license all dogs before they are sold. They also have to transfer the dog licenses to the new owners when the dogs are sold or transferred. This helps to improve traceability and deters abandonment. AVA will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the revised dog licensing regime. AVA will take enforcement action against errant pet owners who abandon their dogs. A person found guilty of pet abandonment may be fined up to $10,000 and/or jailed up to 12 months.",3,768,2018-08-06-T-034-S-00768
2018-08-06-T-035,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many special needs children are receiving subsidies for early intervention programmes at pre-school level under the Enhanced Pilot for Private Intervention Providers (PPIP) scheme; and (b) whether there are plans for increasing the number and geographic distribution of Enhanced PPIP centres.,1,769,2018-08-06-T-035-S-00769
2018-08-06-T-035,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,The Enhanced Pilot for Private Intervention Providers (PPIP) scheme complements the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC). It provides developmental and therapy services for children aged 0-6 who are at risk of moderate to severe developmental delays.

2018-08-06-T-035,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"There are currently 21 EIPIC centres serving 3,000 children with developmental delays. MSF has recently increased the number of PPIP providers from 6 to 10. From 2015 to 2017, an average of 115 children were enrolled in PPIP each year.",2,771,2018-08-06-T-035-S-00771
2018-08-06-T-035,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To ensure that these centres are accessible to parents and children, we have expanded the geographic spread of the centres. Earlier, the six PPIP centres were located in the Central, West and East regions. The current 10 centres operating are geographically spread across the North, North-East, Central, West and East regions.",3,772,2018-08-06-T-035-S-00772
2018-08-06-T-036,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the standard protocol for NEA to handle feedback about smokers smoking in prohibited areas; and (b) where there is no pictorial evidence and NEA is unable to catch the culprit red-handed, what other measures are taken to ensure that culprits will be apprehended especially those who have had multiple reports made against them in residential areas.",1,773,2018-08-06-T-036-S-00773
2018-08-06-T-036,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the progress of efforts to keep our neighbourhood spaces smoke-free; (b) whether banning smoking in more designated areas have resulted in improving a smoke-free environment; (c) whether operators and premise managers are doing their part to stop patrons and visitors from smoking in prohibited areas; and (d) whether there are adequate enforcement resources and penalties to stop smokers who disregard the prohibitions imposed by NEA.,1,774,2018-08-06-T-036-S-00774
2018-08-06-T-036,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Government has over the years progressively extended the smoking prohibition to more public places, to protect more people from the harmful effects of passive tobacco smoke. Such places include the common areas of housing estates such as void decks, fitness corners, and playgrounds, as well as sheltered pedestrian walkways and bus stops. In 2016, the prohibition was further extended to neighbourhood and reservoir parks. Today, smoking is disallowed in more than 32,000 places and progress has been made towards our vision of a smoke-free and conducive living environment.",1,775,2018-08-06-T-036-S-00775
2018-08-06-T-036,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Generally, smokers appreciate the reasons behind these restrictions and most comply willingly. However, there is a minority who do not, and this is where the concerted efforts of various stakeholders can make a difference. When someone we know – be it a family member or a friend – lights up where he or she should not, we ought to remind them to spare a thought for those around. Such social cues are important for signalling and entrenching the positive social norms that smokers should abide by.",2,776,2018-08-06-T-036-S-00776
2018-08-06-T-036,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Operators and managers of smoking-prohibited premises have a statutory responsibility to stop patrons from smoking and request them to leave if they refuse. Most managers are aware of the important role they play in safeguarding the health of their non-smoking patrons. Managers who fail to discharge their duties will be liable for a maximum fine of $2,000 upon conviction.",3,777,2018-08-06-T-036-S-00777
2018-08-06-T-036,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Regarding the Member's question about the National Environment Agency's (NEA) protocol in responding to feedback on unlawful smoking, NEA upon receiving such feedback, will engage the manager of the relevant smoking-prohibited premises to ensure that signs are prominently displayed to remind smokers of the prohibition, and to remove any misleading cues such as litter bins fitted with ashtrays.",4,778,2018-08-06-T-036-S-00778
2018-08-06-T-036,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"If the complaints persist, NEA will undertake further investigations by contacting the complainant and other witnesses for additional information. NEA may also obtain video footage from nearby CCTVs if available. If the alleged offender is identified, NEA will interview the person to ascertain culpability. A summons may then be issued if there is evidence that an offence had been committed. Errant smokers can face fines of up to $1,000 upon conviction.",5,779,2018-08-06-T-036-S-00779

Residents who come across people smoking in prohibited areas can submit feedback, including details of the incident, to NEA through the myENV mobile application, and NEA's hotline and website. Such information can provide useful leads for us to target areas where breaches of the smoking prohibition occur repeatedly.",6,780,2018-08-06-T-036-S-00780
2018-08-06-T-036,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"While enforcement of the smoking prohibition will continue, it is not the panacea to curbing inconsiderate smoking. Our hope is for smokers to be mindful of the potential harm they may cause others, and not light up in places where smoking is prohibited. The families and friends of smokers, as well as the general public can also help reinforce positive social norms through reminders. Ultimately, we would like to help smokers kick the habit for the benefit of their own health, their loved ones, and the community.",7,781,2018-08-06-T-036-S-00781
2018-08-06-T-037,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how will the further liberalisation of the energy market and introduction of new energy sources such as JTC's SolarRoof project help to moderate prices of electricity in the short term and long term; and (b) what are the Government's plans to further liberalise the energy market.,1,782,2018-08-06-T-037-S-00782
2018-08-06-T-037,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Singapore relies on imported fuel to meet our energy needs, with natural gas accounting for about 95% of our electricity generation. Our electricity prices are thus largely driven by movements in the global energy markets, given that we are a small country and price takers for natural gas.",1,783,2018-08-06-T-037-S-00783
2018-08-06-T-037,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Nevertheless, the Energy Market Authority of Singapore, or EMA, has pursued various measures to improve the price-competitiveness of our electricity supply. EMA has progressively introduced competition into our electricity market since the 1990s, so that companies would strive to be more cost-effective and offer better service in competing for customers. This includes our retail electricity market, which EMA has gradually opened up to competition since 2001, by allowing larger businesses to purchase electricity from retailers, instead of buying from SP Group at the regulated tariff.",2,784,2018-08-06-T-037-S-00784
2018-08-06-T-037,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"EMA is working to open up the rest of our retail electricity sector through the Open Electricity Market (OEM), which would allow all households and small businesses to choose an electricity supplier and price plan that best suits their needs. We introduced a soft launch of the OEM in Jurong in April 2018 and are on track to begin the nationwide rollout from the fourth quarter of this year. We will be sharing more details in the next few months.",3,785,2018-08-06-T-037-S-00785
2018-08-06-T-037,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Beyond promoting competitive markets, the government has also sought to diversify our sources of generation, to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and exposure to volatile global fuel prices. For instance, we have been working to facilitate the adoption of solar power, which has grown from 0.4 megawatt peak (MWp) in 2008 to around 145 MWp by end-2017. Initiatives such as JTC's SolarRoof project is part of our plan to raise solar adoption further to 350 MWp by 2020, and 1 gigawatt peak (GWp) beyond 2020.",4,786,2018-08-06-T-037-S-00786
2018-08-06-T-038,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry can provide an update on Pedestrian Overhead Bridge (POB) lifts slated for construction in Toa Payoh East-Novena; and (b) whether a lift can be prioritised for the POB in front of 308 Thomson Road.,1,787,2018-08-06-T-038-S-00787
2018-08-06-T-038,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"To make public transport more accessible, LTA has been retrofitting pedestrian overhead bridges near public transport nodes with lifts. We give priority to bridges which are used by large numbers of less ambulant pedestrians. By the end of this year, we will have completed such retrofitting works at 47 sites, including a recently completed one near Blk 26 Toa Payoh Lorong 6.",1,788,2018-08-06-T-038-S-00788
2018-08-06-T-038,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"As for the pedestrian overhead bridge at 308 Thomson Road, the site will undergo major works as part of the North-South Corridor construction.

2018-08-06-T-039,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Public transport is affordable for our seniors. First, senior citizens above 60 years old enjoy substantial discounts of up to 57% off adult trip fares. With these discounts, their rail and basic bus fares do not exceed 87 cents. Second, with Differential Fares, senior citizens enjoy a further discount of up to 50 cents off their rail fare if they started their journeys before 7.45am. Third, senior citizens who travel frequently can buy monthly concession passes at $60, to enjoy unlimited bus and train rides. Fourth, senior citizens from lower-income households receive further assistance through Public Transport Vouchers.",1,791,2018-08-06-T-039-S-00791
2018-08-06-T-039,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The Public Transport Council (PTC) regularly reviews our fares to keep them affordable while ensuring the financial sustainability of the public transport network. In fact, over the past three years, fares for senior citizens have decreased as part of the annual Fare Review Exercise. Today, the total discounts for senior citizens travelling on our public transport network amount to about $80 million every year. Larger subsidies for one group of commuters will mean higher fares for other commuters or a heavier burden on taxpayers. The PTC has to balance these difficult trade-offs.",2,792,2018-08-06-T-039-S-00792
2018-08-06-T-039,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"As for the Member's second suggestion, I am pleased to inform that all new buses will have visual and audio announcements of the next bus stop.",3,793,2018-08-06-T-039-S-00793

This is based on surveys of establishments with at least 25 employees. We do not specifically track retrenchments from Multi-National Corporations (MNCs), but these companies are included in our surveys. Over the same two years, close to 70% of local retrenched workers were displaced due to company reorganisation and restructuring of business processes, which in some instances may include the adoption of new technologies to automate job tasks. However, new jobs were created at the same time. In particular, local employment grew by 11,200 in 2016 and by a further 21,300 in 2017.",1,808,2018-08-06-T-043-S-00808

This has led to an increase in recyclables collected, from 25,300 tonnes in 2011 to 44,400 tonnes in 2017. In a survey conducted in 2015/2016, more than 70 percent of HDB households indicated that they practised recycling. However, this has not translated into an increase in our domestic recycling rates, which have hovered at around 20 percent in recent years. Taken together, these figures indicate that households are generally aware of recycling, but do not practise it regularly. More needs to be done to make recycling part of daily living for all Singaporeans, by making it more convenient for households to recycle and through more outreach and education on good recycling practices.",2,822,2018-08-06-T-045-S-00822

In 2016, 269 large hotels and shopping malls provided these information to NEA. They have also become more aware of how to improve their waste management systems. The proportion of large hotels and malls that recycle has increased from 84 percent in 2014 to 94 percent in 2016. We will look into how the reporting requirement can be extended to other large waste generators such as industrial premises.",3,823,2018-08-06-T-045-S-00823

NEA and the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) have published food waste minimisation guidebooks for food retail establishments, supermarkets and food manufacturing establishments. NEA’s 3R Fund has also supported 22 premises to install on-site food waste treatment systems. Our food waste recycling rate has increased from 12 percent in 2012 to 16 percent in 2017.

We are also studying the feasibility of extending the EPR concept to other waste streams, such as packaging waste including plastics. We will bring forward the mandatory reporting of packaging data and waste reduction plans from 2021 to 2020. This will build on current voluntary efforts such as the Singapore Packaging Agreement (SPA) which encourages businesses to minimise packaging waste. Since its introduction in 2007, the signatories have collectively reduced 46,000 tonnes of packaging waste and saved over $100 million in packaging material costs.",5,825,2018-08-06-T-045-S-00825

This is to ensure that there is sufficient space for cyclists to pass other path users, including individuals in wheelchairs, safely on footpaths that may only be 1.5 metres wide. This width limit has been widely publicised by LTA since 2016 through numerous platforms including videos, posters and banners. LTA also works with retailers, interest groups and Active Mobility Patrol volunteers to reach out to the public about this width limit.

My Ministry will not be tracking the fulfilment of the pledges but will be happy to work with interested parties to support their plans. NEA offers a Climate Action SG Grant for NGOs and interest groups to fund projects that promote climate action messages, promote the 3Rs and energy conservation. Successful applicants receive a grant of up to $5,000. We have also supported organisations with good ideas to reach out to a wider audience. For example, we worked with PacificLight on their climate action-themed ""Crea8 Sustainability"" competitions for educational institutions.

In 1984, just as he was about to retire, a reflective Dr Goh Keng Swee acknowledged it plain and simple – ""National Service imposes (not only) a great sacrifice of time and money on the young men called up.""",1,913,2018-08-06-T-062-S-00913
2018-08-06-T-062,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The Appellate High Court also brought their minds to bear on our NS policy in 2017 during an appeal on the sentencing of NS defaulters. Their written judgement3 spelt out the reasons why more stringent sentencing benchmarks were justified but those same reasons lie at the heart of what Members of Parliament (MPs) have asked today – how strict is this requirement for every male to serve his NS when required? What exceptions or flexibility can be given? It was a landmark decision, presided over by the Chief Justice. The Appellate High Court referred to DPM Teo's Ministerial Statement given in 2006 to this House, when he was Defence Minister. That Ministerial Statement coupled with the written judgement, illuminate the fundamentals on which our NS policy are based, that we must not unwittingly weaken lest we undo this nation's foundations. I urge all Members to read them. The judges opined that, ""In practical terms, what the three fundamental principles of national security, universality and equity mean is that in order to ensure Singapore's national security, every male Singaporean must serve NS and at the time he is required to under the [Enlistment] Act, without regard to his personal convenience and considerations. When a person refuses to serve NS at the time that he is required to and instead returns to serve at a time of his own choosing, or worse, at an age when he can no longer serve, his actions strike at the very core of the principles of national security, universality and equity.""4",2,914,2018-08-06-T-062-S-00914

In Court, each gave reasons why he did not enlist as required. Some wanted to complete their university degree first before NS. Others said they had to support their families. In every judgement, the Courts dismiss these personal reasons, convicted and sentenced them to jail terms. Harsh as it is, the Enlistment Act is blind to ""personal convenience and considerations""5, no matter how talented the individual or exceptional his circumstances. At the core of the Enlistment Act, the critical national need for a strong defence puts aside personal pursuits and mandates that each liable male performs his NS when required.",3,915,2018-08-06-T-062-S-00915

These arguments spell out in unequivocal terms the NS obligations for every Singaporean male. Deferment therefore cannot be for that individual, no matter how talented, to pursue his own interests or career, even if it vicariously brings credit or fame to Singapore.

The sportsmen deferred know this, as clear expectations were laid out when deferment was given, in discussion with the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) on the standards required for their training. Neither was deferment open-ended nor unconditional. They will have to return to serve NS, and if they do not meet the standards agreed upon, deferment will be curtailed. These strict conditions are necessary because even for these individuals who can bring glory to Singapore, there are detractors, who think it’s unfair for anyone to be deferred.

It’s not an entitlement and once the reasons are no longer valid, the disruption will end. For example, we previously allowed overseas medical students to disrupt, but this was stopped in 1992, when we could produce enough doctors locally.

In addition, it is also a possibility that Ben could be offered a new two-year contract in 2019 after the first year of his pro-contract just like he has been offered a new two-year pro contract half way through his two-year scholarship contract. Or, he could be sent out on loan or sold to another club. There are a lot of variables all dependent on his development and progression.”10",10,922,2018-08-06-T-062-S-00922
2018-08-06-T-062,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Third, if he was not granted deferment, the father indicated that Mr Ben Davis would still proceed to sign the contract, and he has done so. The reason given by the father was that his son would only return to fulfil his NS commitment if he is unsuccessful in his professional career.",11,923,2018-08-06-T-062-S-00923
2018-08-06-T-062,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"In fact, Mr Harvey Davis went further after MINDEF rejected the application – that he would consider the option for his son to renounce his Singapore citizenship in order to pursue his career.",12,924,2018-08-06-T-062-S-00924
2018-08-06-T-062,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The father's responses made clear his intent for his son to pursue a professional football career to the fullest. If Mr Ben Davis will not give up his senior contract, which provides for an allowance of a few hundred pounds a week, to serve his NS, it is even more unlikely that he will return to serve NS if he subsequently gets offered a contract worth many times more. And if he is not given a further contract with Fulham FC, the father has said that he may find other clubs which his son can be loaned to.",13,925,2018-08-06-T-062-S-00925
2018-08-06-T-062,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The application by Mr Harvey Davis for his son's deferment is to further his son’s professional career first and to the longest extent possible. He has been quite open about this. Singapore and her interests, including his son’s NS obligations, are secondary consideration, if at all. There has been no indication, commitment or plans as to how Mr Ben Davis would help football standards in Singapore, if deferred. Mr Harvey Davis has urged MINDEF to approve deferment for his son so that it would serve as an inspiration, he tells us for the 1000 students registered with his company JSSL, 500 or so who are local. JSSL Singapore, or Junior Soccer School & League Singapore, is a youth football club and academy business run by Mr Harvey Davis and advertises itself as having links to Fulham FC.",14,926,2018-08-06-T-062-S-00926
2018-08-06-T-062,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"MINDEF could not find any valid grounds to approve the application for deferment by Mr Harvey Davis for his son. There is no commitment to serve Singapore or our national interests. To grant deferment to Mr Ben Davis to pursue his personal development and professional career would be unfair to the many others who have served their NS dutifully as required, and not at a time of their choosing. It would also erode the basis on which our Courts have upheld the Enlistment Act passed by Parliament and punished those for not fulfilling their NS liabilities to pursue personal pursuits.",15,927,2018-08-06-T-062-S-00927
2018-08-06-T-062,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"As a writer, Mr Patrick Tan Siong Kuan, wrote to The Straits Times (ST) Forum – ""The defence of our country cannot be a matter of serving when it is most convenient. It is a responsibility that every man must take seriously when called upon, regardless of race, family connections or financial status. It takes personal sacrifice and putting the country before self. Otherwise, there will be no Singapore tomorrow.""11",16,928,2018-08-06-T-062-S-00928

2018-08-06-T-062,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"I have dealt with the application by Mr Harvey Davis for his son. Let me now address the important issue that MPs have asked – can and how do we achieve sporting excellence, including for team sports, if NS duties are to be fulfilled? NS does require sacrifices, certainly personal ones, but performing one's NS duties and pursuing national aspirations for sports excellence need not be mutually exclusive.",19,931,2018-08-06-T-062-S-00931
2018-08-06-T-062,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Many talented sportsmen have served NS as required and yet at the same time raised the level of their own skills and the teams they played with. To MINDEF's knowledge, there are three other footballers who have also been talent spotted to take part in trials for professional leagues overseas. All three have completed their NS as required – Saifullah Akbar, Ikhsan and Irfan Fandi. In fact, Saifullah Akbar and Ikhsan Fandi asked to be enlisted early, presumably so that they could complete their NS early to pursue their professional careers. Prior to enlisting, Saifullah played for the Under-16 national team and was reportedly spotted by an Australian club at age 16 but went ahead to enlist for NS. During their NS, Irfan and Ikhsan trained and played for the Under-22 national team during the 2017 SEA Games, supported by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and Home Team. Irfan and Ikhsan are now playing for the Young Lions in the Singapore Premier League and representing Singapore in regional football competitions. I understand Irfan has gone for trials with European clubs, including an upcoming trial with Sporting Braga, and Saifullah and Ikhsan are slated to follow suit at CD Tenerife and Braga, respectively. All of us will certainly cheer them on to succeed. This is a good sign for football in Singapore and talented footballers, Ben Davis included, can emulate the example of Irfan, Saifullah and Ikhsan to complete both their NS duties as required and also advance their professional football careers.",20,932,2018-08-06-T-062-S-00932

Enlistment dates for NS were adjusted for those affected so that they could participate in the games first, including some footballers. Those who were already enlisted were given time off to train and maintain their peak performance. For the upcoming Asian Games later this month, so far, ten of our national servicemen have been given a short postponement of their enlistment of a few weeks, or if they have been enlisted, time off to train for the games, including a member of the Water Polo team who clinched their 27th straight SEA Games Gold medal last year.

2018-08-06-T-068,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"A key reason is the emergence of unregulated online investment platforms. These platforms allow trades across a wide range of products, such as currencies, shares, commodities and binary options.

2018-08-06-T-068,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The number of successfully prosecuted cases looks low compared to the number of Police reports. One of the reasons is that a significant proportion of investment scams today are committed remotely by syndicates operating in foreign countries, or the alleged investment assets, for example, distressed properties and agricultural products like seaweed farms, are overseas and difficult for Police to track down conclusively. Also, one investment scam may have multiple victims, resulting in many Police reports.

2018-08-06-T-070,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there are any statistics about the awareness and practice of breast self-examination among females in Singapore; and (b) whether the Ministry will work with schools to educate students about breast self-examinations and do needful follow-up when necessary.,1,963,2018-08-06-T-070-S-00963
2018-08-06-T-070,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among females in Singapore, and the risk of developing the disease rises with age. The Health Promotion Board (HPB) works with healthcare providers and community partners on awareness and public education efforts on breast self-examinations. For example, HPB partners the Breast Cancer Foundation and the Singapore Cancer Society on outreach activities during the Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October each year. An information booklet on breast self-examination is also available at all polyclinics. These efforts benefit females of all ages, including students. Previous surveys have found that approximately 45% of women in Singapore performed regular breast self-examinations",1,964,2018-08-06-T-070-S-00964
2018-08-06-T-070,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Because the risk of breast cancer rises with age, HPB puts added emphasis on females of working age and beyond, rather than students. For example, it recommends that from the age of 30, females should do regular breast self-examinations.

2018-08-06-T-074,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The Government encourages all employers to have good re-employment and age-friendly hiring practices. This is achieved through broad-based measures that are available to all employers, including Government’s outsourced providers. For instance, the Special Employment Credit provides wage offsets to employers who hire older Singaporean workers aged 55 and above and earning up to $4,000 a month. An additional wage-offset of up to 3% of monthly wages encourages the employment of older workers above the re-employment age of 67.",1,978,2018-08-06-T-074-S-00978
2018-08-06-T-074,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"To facilitate age-friendly employment practices, companies can tap on the WorkPro Age Management Grant. The Government has also worked with tripartite partners on the Tripartite Standard on Age-friendly Workplace Practices to encourage employers to adopt age-friendly practices. These employers commit not to use age as a selection criterion in recruitment, and commit to engage employees on re-employment issues at least six months prior to the retirement age and subsequent extension of re-employment contract. The tripartite partners have also issued the Tripartite Guidelines on Re-employment of Older Employees which provides and calls on employers to adopt good practices in re-employment.",2,979,2018-08-06-T-074-S-00979
2018-08-06-T-074,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"In support of these efforts, the Government ensures that its tender specifications do not discriminate against outsourced workers in any industry based on factors such as age or gender. As the primary objective of procurement is to obtain goods and services, our specifications do not dictate the employment practices of service providers. Promoting good employment practices is better achieved through the measures described above. The Government will continue to review the relevance and effectiveness of our policies in this area.",3,980,2018-08-06-T-074-S-00980

Since 2013, MOM has taken action against over a hundred EAs. We meted out penalties ranging from warnings, demerit points and forfeiture of their security deposit, to prosecution for flagrant cases.

During the programme, FDWs are warned of the consequences they face should they be found to be underaged. They are also given the chance to come forward if they are under 23 years old. Those who own up are assured of passage home and they will be allowed back to Singapore to work after they turn 23.
