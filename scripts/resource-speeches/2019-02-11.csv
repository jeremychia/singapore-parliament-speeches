2019-02-11-T-001,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong,asked the Minister for Defence whether NSmen go through adequate training and safety refresher courses immediately before participating in exercises and whether these courses need improvement.,1,12,2019-02-11-T-001-S-00012

2019-02-11-T-001,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Defence (a) whether any common causative factors can be discerned in the deaths of NSFs and NSmen over the past 18 months, by way of root cause analysis; and (b) whether any systemic changes in policy, guidelines or approaches to training will be undertaken to address the root causes of these training deaths.",1,16,2019-02-11-T-001-S-00016
2019-02-11-T-001,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui,"asked the Minister for Defence (a) whether the safety protocols and procedures are the same and apply as stringently for both NSFs and NSmen; (b) whether additional safety considerations and measures are in place for NSmen due to their time away from active training; and (c) when was the last time SAF conducted a comprehensive review of its safety culture, and whether a new review is necessary.",1,17,2019-02-11-T-001-S-00017

2019-02-11-T-001,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for Defence when the Primus Self Propelled Howitzer gun barrel is being lowered either while operated by its crew or when the repair/maintenance crew are on board, whether the existing training, operation and safety manuals, including standard operating procedures, do expressly provide for (i) specific and safe deployment positions for personnel in the cabin and (ii) specific instructions for personnel to stay clear of the gun barrel.",1,20,2019-02-11-T-001-S-00020
2019-02-11-T-001,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong,asked the Minister for Defence (a) what are the psychosocial support systems in place for NSmen and NSFs to augment SAF's safety culture; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider mental health first-aid training for all military supervisors so they can better support their men in times of distress and crisis.,1,21,2019-02-11-T-001-S-00021
2019-02-11-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),Question No 1.,1,22,2019-02-11-T-001-S-00022
2019-02-11-T-001,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman) (for the Minister for Defence),"Mr Speaker, may I seek your permission for Question Nos 1 to 20 to be answered in the Ministerial Statement by the Minister for Defence later.",1,23,2019-02-11-T-001-S-00023
2019-02-11-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Please proceed.,1,24,2019-02-11-T-001-S-00024
2019-02-11-T-002,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong,asked the Minister for Health to what extent should informed consent for minor medical procedures be sought from patients that will be considered reasonably detailed and effective and not lead to the practice of defensive medicine and drive up costs.,1,25,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00025
2019-02-11-T-002,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,"asked the Minister for Health in respect of the recent imposition of a $100,000 fine on an orthopaedic doctor (a) whether this will result in more instances of ""defensive medicine""; (b) whether there will be an impact on medical costs as a result of doctors paying more for litigation insurance; and (c) how will the Ministry work with the Singapore Medical Council to reassure doctors that only egregious cases will attract heavy penalties.",1,26,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00026
2019-02-11-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak,asked the Minister for Health in respect of the recent action against a doctor for not informing his patient on the side effect of a minor medical procedure and the online petition by doctors for a review of the disciplinary action by the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) (a) what is the Ministry's position on the SMC ruling and its response to the petition; (b) what is the impact on clinical practice in Singapore if it is now mandatory for a doctor to outline and get the consent of a patient for every possible side effect and potential complications of a drug or treatment procedure; and (c) what is the impact of this requirement on medical costs and treatment.,1,27,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00027
2019-02-11-T-002,Irene Quay Siew Ching,Ms Irene Quay Siew Ching,"asked the Minister for Health with regard to the fine meted out by the Singapore Medical Council on a surgeon for not informing his patient of the side effect of a medical procedure (a) whether the penalty is commensurate with similar cases in the past, and if there were extenuating circumstances for these cases; (b) whether the penalty meted out will (i) result in a shift of such procedures back to the hospitals and impact patients' accessibility of care and (ii) impact the future practice of medicine and overall healthcare costs in the long run; and (c) how do we define material information that patients need to be informed of under the modified Montgomery test.",1,28,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00028
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Health),"Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 21 to 24 together?",1,29,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00029
2019-02-11-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Please proceed.,1,30,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00030
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Mr Speaker, Members have raised several queries relating to the recent disciplinary action against an orthopaedic doctor for not informing his patient on the side effect of a minor medical procedure and the potential impact on clinical practice in Singapore. I understand Mr Murali Pillai",1,31,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00031
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"First, let me briefly set out the background.",2,32,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00032
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Dr Lim Lian Arn is an orthopaedic surgeon. His patient complained that Dr Lim had failed to advise her on the possible complications arising from an injection of a steroid and local anesthetic injection, also commonly known as H&L Injection. Dr Lim's treatment of the patient was found to be appropriate. But he did not advise nor document in the patient’s medical records, possible complications or the patient’s consent.",3,33,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00033
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Dr Lim, who was represented by lawyers at the Disciplinary Tribunal or DT, pleaded guilty to a charge of professional misconduct under section 53(1)(d) of the Medical Registration Act for failing to obtain informed consent from the patient before administering the H&L Injection.",4,34,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00034
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Through his lawyers, Dr Lim asked for the maximum fine of $100,000 in lieu of suspension or if the DT decided that suspension was warranted, a three-month suspension. The SMC had sought a suspension of five months.",5,35,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00035
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"After considering sentencing precedents and the facts and circumstances of the case, the DT agreed with Dr Lim’s counsel that the maximum fine of $100,000 would be an appropriate sentence. Both Dr Lim and the SMC did not appeal the sentence.",6,36,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00036
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Members have asked how this case would affect the future practice of medicine, with regard to informed consent and what constitutes material information. Members also asked if the penalty was commensurate with similar cases in the past, and how MOH would assure doctors that only egregious cases will attract heavy penalties. Overall, Members were concerned about whether the decision will lead to defensive practices and increasing healthcare costs.",7,37,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00037
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Let me first set out the overall situation, before discussing the specific matters in this case. From 2013 to 2018, the SMC convened Complaints Committees or CCs to investigate over 900 complaints. And in about 92% of these cases, the CCs were of the view that no formal inquiry by a DT was necessary.",8,38,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00038
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"In those cases referred to the DT, the profession accepted the DTs’ findings and sentences in most of them. Only in a few cases were questions raised.",9,39,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00039
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Now, let me deal with some questions which have arisen in respect of this case.",10,40,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00040
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"First, on the issue of informed consent. It is wrong to infer, the decision makes it mandatory for a doctor to lay out and get the consent of a patient for every possible side effect and potential complications of a drug or treatment.",11,41,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00041
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,Dr Lim admitted that he was guilty of failing to inform the patient of any risks and complications; he was not found guilty for failing to inform the patient of all possible complications that could arise from the H&L Injection.,12,42,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00042
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Second, what is considered material information? Under the SMC Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines or ECEG, doctors are to disclose relevant and material information to their patients, while remote risks with minor consequences will generally be deemed immaterial and need not be disclosed. What a doctor needs to inform a patient about prior to a treatment or procedure continues to depend on the specific facts of the case, including the particular circumstances of the patient.",13,43,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00043
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"However, what is considered material information was not the issue before the DT in Dr Lim's case, and the DT did not apply the modified Montgomery Test as Dr Lim conceded that he had not informed the patient of any risks or complications at all.",14,44,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00044
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"In determining the sentence, the DT considered cases submitted by both counsel involving similar misconduct, where the sentences had ranged from fines from $5,000 to $10,000, with $10,000 being the maximum penalty allowed before the increase to $100,000 when the Medical Registration Act was last amended in 2010; to suspension orders from three to 12 months, or both fines and suspensions. Ultimately, the DT decided that the maximum fine of $100,000 requested by Dr Lim's lawyer would be the appropriate sentence.",15,45,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00045
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"There can be questions as to whether this was too high a fine, and why the SMC was asking for a five-month suspension. There has been considerable concern in the medical profession about the maximum fine having been imposed and that at one point suspension was considered. The concerns are understandable, when considering the facts and circumstances of this case. Many fair-minded doctors would think that the penalty imposed was harsh.",16,46,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00046
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"The appointment of a Sentencing Guidelines Committee on 1 January 2019 will therefore help in ensuring consistency and fairness in the sentences meted, and improve transparency and rigour in the disciplinary process.",17,47,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00047
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Mr Speaker, the Ministry understands and acknowledges the concern that this decision, including the penalty, has caused to the medical profession. There has been feedback on the considerable confusion amongst medical practitioners on the requirements on informed consent and material information, and how the modified Montgomery Test and the ECEG should apply.",18,48,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00048
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"We want to take steps to reassure the profession – and to clarify the position – as the MOH does not want the profession to go down the path of defensive medicine. We acknowledge that the profession needs assurance on what the legal position is, and what the procedures/punishments are when disciplinary proceedings are undertaken. We will need to discuss the issues with the profession, in the context of a broader review of the current rules, processes and legal position, to achieve the above outcome.",19,49,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00049
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Our medical disciplinary process is self-regulated. While the SMC administers the disciplinary process, the CCs and DTs comprise substantially of senior doctors and make decisions independently of the SMC. In arriving at their decisions, the CCs and DTs also obtain the opinions of experts who are peers of the respondent doctor. This protects both the public and ensures fairness to the doctors.",20,50,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00050
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"This system works well only with the support of doctors, and only if doctors understand and participate fully in the system. My Ministry will carefully consider what steps are necessary to maintain the trust between patients, doctors, SMC and MOH.",21,51,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00051
2019-02-11-T-002,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Senior Minister of State. The Disciplinary Tribunal says that the doctors do not have to disclose all side effects but we have seen that in this case for the H&L injection, it was listed out from (a) to (g) the side effects that Dr Lim should have informed and noted in the case notes for the patient. So, it seems as though that although the DT says that the doctor does not have to list all the side effects to the patient, yet, at the same time, the charge is precisely that he had failed to list out all the side effects and that he should have done so. I could read out (a) to (g) but it would be very long, and that is precisely the point. Because it is a very long list, and the consultation would drag on for very long for the doctor.",1,52,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00052
2019-02-11-T-002,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"So, the question is for MOH, when it says material information is all that is needed, how? (a) to (f)? (a) to (e)? (c) to (f)? How many side effects would be material information? And if the doctor informs the patient from (a) to (e) and leaves out (f), and if the patient gets (f) as a side effect, would then the doctor be liable?",2,53,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00053
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,I would like to thank the Member for the clarification. I would like to reiterate that there is no need to list all the complications for a particular procedure. What is important is that the doctor needs to inform patients complications or side effects that are relevant to the patient.,1,54,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00054
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"In the grounds of the decision by the Disciplinary Tribunal in this case, I note that there were six possible complications that were listed from (a) to (f). But I would like to reassure Members of the House as well as the medical profession that these are just examples of some of the possible complications that Dr Lim could have told the patient. However, in this case, it is not a matter of whether sufficient complications or side effects had been counselled; rather, it is the case whereby Dr Lim had failed to even inform the patient of any possible side effects.",2,55,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00055
2019-02-11-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Dr Lim Wee Kiak.,1,56,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00056
2019-02-11-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to declare my interest as a practising ophthalmologist. The medical fraternity currently has rallied, including with the public coming in, to raise a petition against this whole issue. Even for the public, they felt that this $100,000 fine is a little too excessive. Yes, I agree with the Senior Minister of State that it is self-regulatory, but self-regulatory does not mean no regulation at all. MOH should still have an oversight over SMC. My question, then, is what is MOH's position and will this $100,000 fine be reviewed again rather than to leave it as it is. If we leave it as it is, then the medical fraternity will just say that there is no change in everything else; which means that we still could be fined $100,000. If we miss out just one side effect, we could be fined.",1,57,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00057
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank Dr Lim for the supplementary question, as well as to highlight the concern of the medical fraternity regarding this case. Particular to this case, we note that Dr Lim's lawyer had actually requested either $100,000 fine in lieu of suspension, or if the DT decided on suspension, a period of three months. Of course, this is based on past precedents, as noted by both SMC and the defendant's counsel. While the DT could have ordered an alternative sentence, it decided to impose the maximum of $100,000 as proposed by Dr Lim's lawyer and not to impose a suspension instead. But we acknowledge the concerns raised by the medical community and together with the Ministry of Law, we have assisted the SMC in appointing a Sentencing Guidelines Committee on 1 January 2019, as I have mentioned in my reply, so that we could assist the DTs and legal counsels in setting appropriate sentences going forward.",1,58,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00058
2019-02-11-T-002,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Sir, I thank the hon Senior Minister of State for his comprehensive explanation. My question revolves around the fact that in the recent past, I see that doctors were somehow disquieted by SMC's rulings. Given that the medical profession is meant to be self-regulating, as mentioned by the hon Senior Minister of State, how do we address the gap between what is understood by the medical profession on one hand and the SMC's rulings meted out by senior doctors? In that regard, I note that there are sentencing guidelines that would be issued. What other steps can be taken to address this gap?",1,59,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00059
2019-02-11-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank the Member for the supplementary questions. Indeed, our medical disciplinary process is self-regulated. While SMC administers the disciplinary process, the CCs and the DTs, comprised substantially of senior doctors, make the decision independently of the SMC. So far, based on the statistics that I have given in my reply, majority of DT findings and sentences were accepted by the medical profession. Only a small number of cases attracted some questions with regard to the decisions. But based on these statistics, we can see that, actually, the self-regulatory processes are working very well. I do understand there are some concerns with regard to informed consent as well as material information, and we will engage the medical community to clarify some of these doubts that they may have.",1,60,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00060
2019-02-11-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Dr Lim Wee Kiak.,1,61,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00061
2019-02-11-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, for giving me a chance to seek clarification. I would just like to ask the Senior Minister of State again  in the past, there have been precedents whereby DTs have thrown out certain cases but, in the end, upon appealing to the Ministers, the DT has to reopen the case again. In this case now, it is the direct opposite, which means that the DT has already decided, whether, currently, since there is a petition from both the public as well as from the medical fraternity to the Ministry, will the Minister now consider reopening this case?",1,62,2019-02-11-T-002-S-00062

Therefore, there will be no need to reopen this case. But having said that, we will continue to look at some of the concerns of the medical profession. In fact, we will be engaging the three professional bodies of the medical profession to see how we can address some of these concerns. At the same time, if necessary, we will review the disciplinary processes in the form of amending the Medical Registration Act.

Today, close to 65% of all GCE Level written scripts were marked on-screen already. By the end of this year, we are on track to mark on-screen almost all of GCE Level written scripts.

2019-02-11-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Let me conclude, even as MOE, SEAB and Cambridge Assessment work towards on-screen marking and e-examinations, let me emphasis that every system has risks. Going electronic will eliminate the risk of lost scripts, but new risks associated with electronic data will surface. So, whatever system we adopt in future, we need to study the pros and cons carefully, proceed methodically, identify and ensure that risks are managed and mitigated to the greatest extent possible.",17,94,2019-02-11-T-003-S-00094

2019-02-11-T-003,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister for the assurance of the steps that will be taken to ensure the integrity and security of our Cambridge exam papers. While we move towards more of e-examinations and online marking, I think that will take several years. Will we consider doing entirely all of our GCE marking locally? The Minister mentioned that, yes, it will require a lot more markers and teachers, but I think we do have the capability here and would it not be easier to fly in some of the markers and auditors from Cambridge to audit the marking, rather than leaving our papers overseas where our exam papers have been taken onboard trains and that is why they were lost. Because when we do marking here, even for the PSLE papers, papers are not removed from the marking centres at all.",1,96,2019-02-11-T-003-S-00096
2019-02-11-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The consideration is a practical one. As I mentioned, Cambridge Assessment hired 2,200 markers. We have the capability to do all the markings locally. I am very confident of that. But considering that between examinations and release of results, it is of a certain time frame, 2,200 additional markers are required. So, while you may save time transporting the scripts, the amount of extra resources required is huge. And I am quite mindful of the workload of teachers especially during vacation. We need to turnaround this in a very short time. So, on balance, the collaboration with Cambridge Assessment has been working well, not withstanding this couple of incidents. They take their role very professionally. Even as we move to e-marking, this is a collaboration that, on the whole, logistically, taking into account the resources and costs required, it is still worthwhile for us to do so.",1,97,2019-02-11-T-003-S-00097
2019-02-11-T-003,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Minister for his answers. Just one supplementary question. Pending any future changes to the marking method and the examination method, since the last incident, have any new measures been taken to improve the transportation and delivery of the scripts to UK and back to Singapore. Thank you.",1,98,2019-02-11-T-003-S-00098
2019-02-11-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The protocol is all there, that once a marker has scripts in their hands, they are not supposed to leave it behind, and I think this is what happened in this particular incident. A bag was left behind and someone mistook the bag and he lost 32 scripts. Cambridge Assessment took this very seriously. It is a very unfortunate lapse. They have since tightened the instructions, conveyed to all the markers. The marker who was involved, he would not be engaged anymore. I think with their efforts and constant reminders, we can mitigate such risks to the minimum extend possible.",1,99,2019-02-11-T-003-S-00099
2019-02-11-T-003,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar,"Just one more question. Maybe not quite directly related to these current questions that you are managing right now. Just looking at the potential risks of such summative assessment formats such as the GCE exams, would we consider, going forward, to minimise the dependence on such summative assessment formats and look at more at how we can balance such summative exams with students' portfolios for instance. Because for the students whose exams papers are missing, they get a certain prorated grade which they feel that sometimes it is fair, sometimes it is not quite fair. But if they have a student portfolio, they know that it is their work, built up over time, that they can depend on for admission to the next entry level in their education journey.",1,100,2019-02-11-T-003-S-00100
2019-02-11-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"It is a question about summative versus formative assessment. If we have more formative assessments, more regular tests, there is actually more risks of losing scripts. But, I think it is a valid question on the direction that education is going. Given our system today, summative assessments will still play a big role. Because parents and students depend a lot on PSLE for allocation of places in Secondary schools, and from Secondary schools moving to JC or Polytechnic. But, I think what we ought to refine is at the admission level. That beyond looking at the summative test result, can we look at portfolio, as the Member mentioned, performances in other areas outside of academic. So, DSA scheme, EAE schemes that we had introduced and refined over the years, all these will help towards the move away from over-relying on summative tests.",1,101,2019-02-11-T-003-S-00101
2019-02-11-T-003,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"I thank the Minister for his reply and I appreciate his concern for the workload of his staff and the teachers. At the Autonomous Universities, we have to complete all our marking locally within a very short span of time as well and it is a very stressful period for all of the Faculty. But I wonder if the Ministry could commit, for example, to studying this issue of the costs of arranging for all of the marking locally. What would be the cost implications of doing that versus the current arrangement with Cambridge Assessment. The reason why I asked this is, I think there should be no questions internationally about the credibility of our examination system if it were to be done all locally. I think Singapore has established a good reputation in that regard and I am confident that if we were to do it locally, we should have no issues with the reputation of students' credentials. Thank you.",1,102,2019-02-11-T-003-S-00102
2019-02-11-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"A couple of points. First, the question may well be moot because by the end of this year, we will have substantially moved everything to electronic marking. So, the whole concern about transport of scripts which really underpins this concern, will not arise. But as I mentioned earlier, moving away from scripts, you will eliminate the risks of losing scripts but moving to electronic marking, a new set of risks will surface.",1,103,2019-02-11-T-003-S-00103
2019-02-11-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I think the deeper question is this collaboration with Cambridge Assessment. I fully agree with the Member that Singapore has a good reputation in education, there is high regard internationally for our education system. We are in a good position to do this ourselves and harness the resources to mark the papers, set the questions. But I think we are where we are too because of a certain earnestness to learn from different systems around the world and to work with different credible, reputable systems around the world. And this approach led us to working with Cambridge. Many, many years of working with them, Cambridge helped us, raised us to this level of international repute. So, I think it is a collaboration that is still worthwhile keeping while mitigating the risks of lost scripts.",2,104,2019-02-11-T-003-S-00104

Are there shortages in manpower and if there are, is there any study into the remuneration package and welfare for postman and other ground service staff. Because I noted that SingPost made a profit of $42.2 million on operating activities. So, did they do a remuneration package study.",2,119,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00119
2019-02-11-T-004,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"My second question is, there is only one postal service company in Singapore and it is doing essential service. How do we ensure that they are not complacent? Because this issue has been brought up in Parliament before. It is not getting better but getting worse. So, it shows that maybe they are complacent.",3,120,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00120
2019-02-11-T-004,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"The third question is, they are found according to the report last week to have many lapses in 2017 and falling short can result in a fine up to $50,000 a month for each indicator. My question is, why were they only fined $100,000. Is fine alone sufficient deterrence?",4,121,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00121
2019-02-11-T-004,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Earlier, the Senior Minister of State mentioned about regulatory requirement and I have also read on several occasions that the Ministry had implied or mentioned the revoking of licence. I would like to ask under what circumstances will the licence be revoked. And are there any plans to issue more than one licence so that there is competition? Perhaps, they cannot cope. So, we may want to look into having more than one postal services provider in Singapore.",5,122,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00122
2019-02-11-T-004,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Last but not least, and this is the most important question  what action will be taken in general, and at Yishun Town in particular, in order to bring back the trust and confidence of people.",6,123,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00123
2019-02-11-T-004,Sim Ann,Ms Sim Ann,"Er Dr Lee mentioned six supplementary questions; I counted five. But if I leave out any, she is welcomed to ask again.",1,124,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00124
2019-02-11-T-004,Sim Ann,Ms Sim Ann,"I will take her last question first, which is what actions for the residents of Yishun. Indeed, amongst the complaints that SingPost received and the ones that have been sent to IMDA last year, IMDA has noted that some of these complaints pertain to the Yishun area. It has discussed with SingPost and SingPost has re-deployed two experienced postmen to cover the Yishun beats as of November 2018. We hope that this would address at least some of the concerns but IMDA will be monitoring this very closely.",2,125,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00125
2019-02-11-T-004,Sim Ann,Ms Sim Ann,"Er Dr Lee has also asked about the situation in Yishun as of the end of last year, as her first question. So, I think we have addressed that.",3,126,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00126
2019-02-11-T-004,Sim Ann,Ms Sim Ann,"She has also asked whether SingPost had planned for the seasonal peaks and what has it been doing to cope with the operating environment. Mr Speaker, as I have mentioned earlier, we believe that the operating environment, however it changes, that is the responsibility of SingPost to plan for it. SingPost has talked about seasonal peaks and about the changing proportion of parcels to letters. We are of the view that this is something which it, as the service provider and the operator, should plan for and ensure that its workforce is properly remunerated, properly trained and equipped to do this job.",4,127,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00127
2019-02-11-T-004,Sim Ann,Ms Sim Ann,"As for the status of SingPost as the postal service provider, I believe the next two questions that Er Dr Lee had mentioned, pertain to this. Let me explain, Mr Speaker. Under our current framework, we have one public postal licensee that is SingPost. But it is not the only ones who are licensed to deliver basic letters. There are four in total. As the public postal licensee, what they need to do is, in addition to delivering letters, they have to maintain a set of universal service obligations (USOs). These include, for instance, the maintenance of posting boxes, the issuance of stamps and there is an obligation to deliver basic letters from and to anyone within Singapore. That is what we call the USOs. Those are the obligations tied to being the public postal licensee. This does not mean they have a monopoly on the delivery of basic letter services. This segment of the market has also been opened up; as explained, there are now four in total. As for the parcel delivery, this is also a very open and competitive segment. We have many companies that are doing parcel and door-to-door delivery.",5,128,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00128
2019-02-11-T-004,Sim Ann,Ms Sim Ann,"Er Dr Lee has asked about the quantum of the fine and whether that is considered sufficient. First, allow me to explain that under the QoS framework, IMDA does have discretion to decide how much financial penalty to levy for each count of failing the QoS. I have described earlier in the main reply there are several types of QoS that the public postal licensee has to abide by. In terms of determining the actual quantum per count, IMDA would take into account factors such as whether there are aggravating factors, for instance, has there been repeated failures, and also, mitigating factors, for instance, whether or not the delay time is longer or shorter.",6,129,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00129
2019-02-11-T-004,Sim Ann,Ms Sim Ann,"We completely agree with Er Dr Lee that relying on fines is not sufficient. As I have mentioned, regulatory action is on-going. More can be expected from IMDA in the coming months. But very importantly, other measures also need to be taken. We are glad to see that SingPost has owned the issue and has announced steps in the right direction, for instance by extending delivery hours, by re-looking at remuneration for its workforce and so forth. At the same time, the use of technology must continue. This is something that IMDA has been in constant discussion with SingPost on, and in fact, in previous years, have also required SingPost to take on technological upgrade so that its postal workforce can do its job better.",7,130,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00130
2019-02-11-T-004,Sim Ann,Ms Sim Ann,"The next question that Er Dr Lee has asked touches on who gets to deliver basic letters, so I think I have covered that when I explained the overall framework.",8,131,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00131
2019-02-11-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"My residents have also told me that they often do not receive letters even from my constituency office. So, I am also worried. With the increased popularity of emails, we often think that snail mail will lose its popularity. But when we look at the annual financial report of SingPost, in the last financial year, 90% of SingPost's profit comes from postal service. In other words, postal service is the cash cow for SingPost. So, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State, is it the case where SingPost is under-investing in postal services while they try to take some money to diversify their business?",1,132,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00132
2019-02-11-T-004,Sim Ann,Ms Sim Ann,"I believe that Mr Ang Wei Neng's question is also something that should be asked of SingPost by its shareholders; after all, it is a listed company. I understand that these are also the issues that the shareholders should hold SingPost to account for. In terms of under-investing, I shall not comment on this specific issue. However, I think we can also take cognisance of the steps that SingPost has talked about, in terms of paying more attention to the postal workforce, in ensuring that the operations are right, in extending the delivery hours. So, I think those steps that they have mentioned are indicative of what SingPost's own diagnosis of the problem is. However, IMDA will nto stop here. We will continue to work very closely with SingPost. We will also continue to monitor and regulate.",1,133,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00133
2019-02-11-T-004,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the comprehensive answer. While we are still waiting for technological solutions such as use drones to deliver mail, I wonder if the Ministry could consider or help to facilitate alternate delivery agents and systems for now. In the Central CDC, we tried a drop-mail system where we employed senior citizens who are still healthy to drop mail in their localities. We found the outcomes to be quite good in accuracy and the speed was very fast, maybe better than SingPost. The CDC does not have the ability to scale it, but I believe there is a good potential there to create reliable delivery systems, employing seniors; and also graduands of Special Education schools and others who may not be able to have other forms of jobs.",1,134,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00134
2019-02-11-T-004,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"I wonder if the Ministry and other related agencies would be interested in helping us organise this so that we can scale this kind of system and create interim jobs that might be meaningful, and also provide opportunities for seniors and others to build better health and earn some pocket money.",2,135,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00135
2019-02-11-T-004,Sim Ann,Ms Sim Ann,"I thank Ms Denise Phua. I shall ask IMDA to work closely with her CDC to understand this pilot scheme that she has started and to see how this can improve postal services. In terms of other solutions that the Member had asked, I would also like to take this opportunity to say that locker trials have started in two locations in Bukit Panjang and in Punggol under the Locker Alliance. This is a trial that SingPost is also a part of, to see whether there can be better solutions for the last-mile delivery of parcels which may be too large to fit into letter boxes.",1,136,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00136
2019-02-11-T-004,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for a very comprehensive reply and the assurances. I just have a question, and this pertains to the timeline. I understand that some time may be needed for SingPost to address the gaps and as MCI considers additional regulation, may I know if there is a timeline for both these aspects? In the mean time, what else might we be able to expect to ensure that the letter delivery performance will still be upheld?",1,137,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00137
2019-02-11-T-004,Sim Ann,Ms Sim Ann,I thank Ms Tin. We make no assumptions as to how long this journey is going to take. But I can share at this moment that IMDA aims to release its decision with regards to SingPost's 2018 letter delivery by the middle of this year.,1,138,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00138
2019-02-11-T-004,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for informing the House that two experienced postmen have been put in to serve the residents of Yishun Town. During my recent visit to SingPost's Woodlands distribution centre, I came to understand that actually, there is a shortage of postmen serving in Yishun Town. There are supposed to be 40-over postmen, but they only have 30-plus. I would like to ask when will the number of postmen be increased? Otherwise, they are over-stressing the current working postmen, and that is why sometimes, you will find that there are other consequences. That is one question.",1,139,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00139
2019-02-11-T-004,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"The second question, just now, the Senior Minister of State mentioned about thorough review with SingPost. I would like to know is there any timeline given because we do not want them to just over-stress the postmen and the ground service staff. I think they are over-stressed; they work very hard.",2,140,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00140
2019-02-11-T-004,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,I think the Senior Minister of State did not answer one of my questions. I asked under what circumstances would the licence be revoked.,3,141,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00141
2019-02-11-T-004,Sim Ann,Ms Sim Ann,"First, Er Dr Lee has asked about staffing issues. I think that by announcing its plans to hire more postmen, SingPost is acknowledging that there are vacancies and I believe it is not only restricted to the Woodlands distribution centre. We believe that with SingPost's intention to also review remuneration for the staff, we hope that these vacancies will be easier to fill than they currently are now.",1,142,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00142
2019-02-11-T-004,Sim Ann,Ms Sim Ann,"In terms of the concern on manpower, indeed, we share Er Dr Lee's concerns about the importance of maintaining the well-being of the postal workforce. This is the reason why it is not just about tightening requirements and levying the penalties, but also monitoring very closely to ensure that first of all, the workforce is adequately trained and prepared for the job that they have to do. This is certainly a priority for my Ministry and also for IMDA.",2,143,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00143
2019-02-11-T-004,Sim Ann,Ms Sim Ann,"In terms of the circumstances under which the licence for being the public postal licensee will be revoked, first of all, I want to state that we do need an operator to maintain the universal service obligations. As I have mentioned, it is not just about delivery of the letters. It is about maintaining the posting boxes, it is about issuance of stamps, it is also about having somebody who undertakes to deliver and collect letters from anywhere in Singapore. So, this has to be given. What we currently have is a set of QoS standards to monitor the delivery of letters. But as I have mentioned, SingPost is not immuned to competition here. IMDA will be monitoring this very carefully. I do not think at this moment that the lapses in terms of the QoS standards are such that it warrants removing of the licence. However, we are very conscious of the pain points that consumers have reported, including pain points concerning services that are not covered by the QoS, and this is the reason why IMDA is now also considering additional regulatory standards.",3,144,2019-02-11-T-004-S-00144
2019-02-11-T-005,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,asked the Minister for Manpower what safeguard can be provided to employers of foreign domestic workers (FDWs) who are required by employment agencies to make advance payment of the FDW's monthly salary purportedly to settle loans or outstanding dues owed by the domestic workers to foreign parties.,1,145,2019-02-11-T-005-S-00145
2019-02-11-T-005,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Manpower (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Mr Speaker Sir, foreign domestic workers (FDWs) incur expenses in their home countries when they seek opportunities to work overseas. For instance, they may be required to pay their employment agency (EA) a fee. This cost is typically paid by their employers on their behalf in the form of advance salary payments facilitated by the EA.",1,146,2019-02-11-T-005-S-00146
2019-02-11-T-005,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Manpower (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Manpower),"To protect employers and FDWs, EAs are required by law to fully disclose the terms and conditions of their services, including the amount FDWs are charged and their refund policies on advance salary payments by employers. In the event that the employer terminates the FDW employment contract early and sends the FDW back to the EA, or the FDW commits an offence and has to be repatriated, the EA would usually refund any outstanding advance salary payment made by the employer.",2,147,2019-02-11-T-005-S-00147
2019-02-11-T-005,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Manpower (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Manpower),"MOM expects EAs to fully discharge their duties and obligations to employers and FDWs, and safeguard the interests of these parties. In addition to conducting regular inspections, we also act on feedback received and will not hesitate to take irresponsible or errant EAs to task.",3,148,2019-02-11-T-005-S-00148
2019-02-11-T-005,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the answer. I have a supplementary question. It is in relation to allocation of risk. In a situation where a foreign domestic worker leaves earlier than anticipated, and where a family has already made advance payment to an employment agency, which collects it for a foreign employment agency. Could the Ministry consider, perhaps, the employment agency issuing a bond such that if such a situation happens, at least the family can recoup the losses through the exercise of its rights under the bond.",1,149,2019-02-11-T-005-S-00149
2019-02-11-T-005,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Member Mr Murali Pillai for the suggestion on the bond. Let the MOM team think through the pros and cons of this suggestion. At this point in time, allow me to assure Mr Murali Pillai that the employers of FDWs have alternative options and also avenues for recourse. For example, although employers generally prefer the advance salary payments because they hope that the FDW will stay with them for the entire contract, there are some employers, who, for various reasons, do not prefer the advance salary payments and these employers can approach EAs that are able to customise a package to suit their needs. So, there are varying practices in the market.",1,150,2019-02-11-T-005-S-00150
2019-02-11-T-005,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"For Mr Murali Pillai's point, to protect employers and FDWs, MOM requires the EA to clearly state their refund policies in the service agreement. For example, if the FDW terminates the employment prematurely, the employers should check the contract that they signed with the EA, because the contract will lay out whether and under what circumstances, they will get full or partial refund. I want to assure Mr Murali Pillai that we take this very seriously. Every single case that is surfaced to MOM, will be followed-up and investigated thoroughly. Since 2016, MOM had investigated and taken actions against two EAs that had failed to state their refund policies.",2,151,2019-02-11-T-005-S-00151
2019-02-11-T-005,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a further supplementary question. The suggestion I have made in relation to the provision of a bond, is to deal with the function of the employment agency as a collecting body, as opposed to the usual situation envisaged in a contract where the employment agency is really seeking to be paid its own fees. In the context of the employment agency being a collection agency, perhaps, the risks associated with the monies being given to the employment agency only to be delivered to a foreign employment agency can be dealt with through the bond system.",1,152,2019-02-11-T-005-S-00152
2019-02-11-T-005,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"I want to thank the Member for his supplementary question. He rightly described it as risk and a bond instrument could also mean that there will be fee charges which may inadvertently be passed on to the consumer, in this case, the FDW employer. So, we need to think through the suggestion very carefully. I want to say that MOM has put in place fee caps to regulate what an EA can charge the FDW, and that is important, because that may then manifest itself as advance salary payment. And EAs are not allowed to collect fees that exceed FDWs' monthly salary for each year of contracted service. EAs who flout this rule may be prosecuted or even have their licences revoked. We will also issue warning letters or composition fines to less egregious EAs.",1,153,2019-02-11-T-005-S-00153
2019-02-11-T-005,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"The example that Mr Murali Pillai highlighted was that the EAs should not function as a collection agent. While MOM will undertake all the necessary efforts to prohibit our Singapore-based EAs from charging the FDWs beyond the fee cap, we must also explain that we have no jurisdiction over the EA in the home country of the FDW.",2,154,2019-02-11-T-005-S-00154
2019-02-11-T-005,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Having said that, for the case that Mr Murali Pillai's resident is facing, if he could share with us the information, that would be most helpful. We will then be able to investigate this further and if we find any suspicious or irregular practices, we can follow up with the relevant Embassy and enlist their help so that we can stop the malpractice at source.",3,155,2019-02-11-T-005-S-00155
2019-02-11-T-006,Irene Quay Siew Ching,Ms Irene Quay Siew Ching,asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether BCA has plans to mandate child-proof pool fences in private swimming pools in view of the increasing number of near-drowning cases involving children and 10 deaths reported in KK Women's and Children's Hospital from 2011 to 2015; and (b) what are the measures taken by BCA over the years to improve the safety of private swimming pools.,1,156,2019-02-11-T-006-S-00156
2019-02-11-T-006,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for National Development),"Mr Speaker, for the safety of young children, the Code of Practice for the design and management of aquatic facilities recommends that toddler and learner pools be situated away from the deep areas of other pools, and this is done to prevent unintended use. There are also safety-related guidelines under the Code for warning signs, slip-resistant flooring, depth markings as well as providing adequate lighting.",1,157,2019-02-11-T-006-S-00157
2019-02-11-T-006,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for National Development),"As an added safety precaution, private pool owners can install child-resistant barriers, and for strata-titled developments, the management corporations may make such improvements to their swimming pools, by passing a special resolution.",2,158,2019-02-11-T-006-S-00158
2019-02-11-T-006,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for National Development),"Besides infrastructural measures, parents and caregivers should closely monitor young children when they are near swimming pools. I think that is most important as well. Water safety education is also as important. As part of the physical education curriculum, all Primary school students are taught water safety knowledge and basic swimming skills. This is done through the SwimSafer 2.0 programme, in partnership with SportSG. SportSG has also been actively carrying out water safety outreach and education programmes to raise public awareness. Management corporations of condominiums that also wish to participate in these programmes, or seek water safety advice in general, can also contact the management team at SportSG directly.",3,159,2019-02-11-T-006-S-00159
2019-02-11-T-006,Irene Quay Siew Ching,Ms Irene Quay Siew Ching (Nominated Member),"Despite what has been done, we are still seeing about 10 cases over five years. Do you think there is something more we can do about it? For example, to include mandating some of these pool fences in private swimming pools. Is this something doable?",1,160,2019-02-11-T-006-S-00160
2019-02-11-T-006,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"I thank the Member for her query. Mr Speaker, based on the statistics reported, five of the children who had died were at pool parties. So, technically, the adults were also there. It is unclear for the others how the situation occurred. But in those cases that I mentioned, the provision of a child restraint barrier, even if mandated, would not have been sufficient in avoiding these incidents. What is important then would be adult supervision, which is still the most effective means in ensuring the safety of young children when they use the pool.",1,161,2019-02-11-T-006-S-00161
2019-02-11-T-006,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"We have to balance the risk as well as the obligations that we want to put on private and public pool owners, for example, in terms of putting up barriers. Ultimately, it is quite onerous for some of these pool owners, as the pools can be quite big in condominium developments, for example. Today, even without a mandatory requirement, MCSTs and condominium owners could potentially pass a resolution to put barriers in place. Private pool owners could also do so, and I think mandating could be quite difficult to implement.",2,162,2019-02-11-T-006-S-00162
2019-02-11-T-006,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Having said that, it could be something we can review. The cases have to be reviewed in more detail to see what the root causes are. But again, as I stressed earlier on, adult supervision is the most important aspect. And of course, as they move to Primary school, we do have programmes in place to ensure that our students are well educated and have greater safety awareness when they use pools and water bodies.",3,163,2019-02-11-T-006-S-00163
2019-02-11-T-007,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider making Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) mandatory for all construction works near national parks or nature reserves and making such EIA reports publicly available.,1,164,2019-02-11-T-007-S-00164

2019-02-11-T-007,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I thank Minister for the reply. I understand that he said that only the findings are released, bearing in mind that some of these reports might contain some sensitive data. Taking the Tengah case for example, where there are some disputes on the ground with regards to the findings of the study, whether releasing the full report minus the sensitive data, will help to clarify some of the concerns on the ground and also provide more assurances on the ground?",1,168,2019-02-11-T-007-S-00168

EIA reports have been gazetted in full to make very clear to interested parties, including the environmental groups, what the findings are and what the impact is. For Tengah, the findings of the environmental baseline study were shared with the public through the media in October last year.

The numbers are quite big. One child or one elderly victim is one too many. At this point in time, what is the extent of the effects of such abuse on, especially the young children or even the elderly victims that are held by MSF and their partners? And have the victims been able to recover from the abuse and have they managed to resume normalcy in their lives after intervention by MSF and its partners?",1,189,2019-02-11-T-009-S-00189

For example, I received a message from one Singaporean who shared that one of her children has this issue and it is not only about that child. It is about the issue of inter-generational family violence that had been experienced by the great-grandfather, to the grandfather and down the line until today. So, I am very happy that because of this awareness campaign, we realise that more of them are thinking, coming forward and we have been able to help many Singaporeans.",3,193,2019-02-11-T-009-S-00193

The median rental is $2,000 per month. This is in line with the median rental of stalls in comparable existing hawker centres at $1,700 per month, after accounting for the larger stall size, better-designed stalls and amenities at the new centres. The rentals of non-subsidised stalls at comparable existing centres range from $640 to $3,900 a month.",1,199,2019-02-11-T-010-S-00199

These costs are comparable at both new and existing centres. For example, the S&CC at the new centres are between $110 and $350 a month, which is within the range of $130 to $450 a month at our existing centres.

Unlike stallholders in the majority of existing centres, stallholders in the new centres have access to centralised dishwashing (CDW) services and thus enjoy manpower and utilities savings. CDW services also enhance the cleanliness of the hawker centres and the rate of table turnover, which benefit both hawkers and patrons. Stallholders can focus on their cooking as they need not worry about hiring assistants to wash their crockeries. On the other hand, stallholders without access to centralised dishwashing may have to hire dishwashers which could cost up to $1,500 a month, not to mention that these hawkers often have difficulties hiring and retaining such hawker assistants.",3,201,2019-02-11-T-010-S-00201

The cabin is 2.3 metres in height, 2.44 metres from front to rear, and 2.64 metres from side to side. That gives you the dimensions of the cabin within. The gun barrel, which, on the left-hand side of the screen is now in the inclined position and therefore is lowered in the rear, divides the cabin into two.

The gun barrel is usually tilted upwards for firing but needs to be lowered for some types of maintenance work. When the gun is lowered, the flick rammer at the rear end of the barrel goes up and ends about 10 cm below the top rim of the cabin. I will have some more pictures to make it more clear later.

Prior to his first surgery, CFC(NS) Pang was conscious and speaking. At the first operation, the surgical team found that a number of organs were damaged and treated them accordingly. After the first surgery, CFC(NS) Pang did not require any ventilation and his vital signs were stable.

2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"I propose now to deal with Members' questions which fall in three broad categories  first, what was the experience and state of the maintenance crew? I have the second slide. CFC(NS) Pang had arrived in New Zealand on 6 January 2019 and had begun maintenance work from 10 January 2019. So, on 6 January, he arrived; he began maintenance work on 10 January. This was CFC(NS) Pang’s seventh In-Camp Training (ICT). He had been trained to perform maintenance and repair for the SSPH since he was a full-time national serviceman. In addition, during his previous ICT in February 2018, he had attended a two-day refresher Maintenance Vocation Training on the basic functional checks and troubleshooting for the SSPH. That course also included safety procedures during gun movements. Before participating in Exercise Thunder Warrior this year, CFC(NS) Pang had undergone refresher training on maintenance tasks in New Zealand. For this exercise, CFC(NS) Pang was involved in the preparation of more than 10 SSPHs, which included servicing and maintaining of the guns. The other two servicemen were also similarly qualified. The Gun Commander was in his eighth ICT and had undergone refresher training prior to his deployment in the exercise. The Regular technician has eight years of working experience on the SSPH and it was his sixth time participating as a technician in Exercise Thunder Warrior.",5,221,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00221
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Let me explain how maintenance work on the SSPH is conducted when the unit is deployed in the field. There are two levels of maintenance support – basic and higher. Basic support is provided by the SSPH battalion's organic Forward Maintenance Platoon, made up of national servicemen. CFC(NS) Aloysius Pang was part of this Forward Maintenance Platoon. If the repair works exceed the scope of the Forward Maintenance Platoon, more complex maintenance is requested from and performed by technicians in the higher maintenance echelon, and this is called the Forward Support Group, who are made up of Regulars. So, basic support made up of national servicemen, more complex maintenance made up of Regulars in the Forward Support Group.",6,222,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00222
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"In this particular incident, CFC(NS) Pang was first activated. But as he was unable to resolve the fault, CFC(NS) Pang requested and received the help of Regular technicians from the Forward Support Group. CFC(NS) Pang and one Regular technician of ME2 rank were inside the cabin of the SSPH with the Gun Commander, a Third Sergeant NSman, when the incident happened. These are the three persons I referenced in the beginning of my Statement.",7,223,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00223
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Second, the adequacy of safety protocols and whether the maintenance crew were familiar with them during this ICT. A number of Members of Parliament have asked for this, Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling, Prof Fatimah Lateef, Mr Darryl David, Miss Cheng Li Hui, Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong and Ms Joan Pereira. Let me show a third slide. I will focus on the relevant safety instructions during maintenance work, because this is the reason for the presence of these three people in the SSPH, and in particular when the gun is lowered. There are safety procedures taught to all maintenance and SSPH operating crew. The ME2 regular technician is overall in charge because he comes from the Forward Support Group and he is in charge of more complex repair works – so he is in charge. For the repair work in this case, the maintenance manual indicates that it is the responsibility of the technician in charge to ensure that the gun has been lowered and fixed in place before any maintenance works can begin.",8,224,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00224
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Further, the safety instructions specify safe positions within the SSPH cabin for soldiers to occupy during the gun lowering, as well as safety precautions to be taken. In operations or during maintenance, it is the Gun Commander who lowers the gun. From his Safe Position 1, indicated in the middle of this slide, the picture of the tank with the gun pointing forward or pointing up, the Gun Commander must first check to ensure that the gun barrel area is free from obstacles and that no persons are in the travel path of the barrel.",9,225,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00225
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The other persons in the cabin are to occupy Safe Positions 2 or 3, on the left side and the right side respectively. The Gun Commander then gives the signal ""clear away"", ""clear away"" to warn the technicians about the barrel movement. He should visually check to ensure no persons are in the travel path of the barrel and all crew are in Safe Positions. After which, the gun commander should shout ""standby"" before moving the barrel. In the event of any danger, there are also three emergency stop buttons in each of the safe positions inside the SSPH and they are indicated as the red buttons in each of the Safe Positions. There are three of them.",10,226,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00226
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"In the operators' manual, there is a standard warning, and I quote it, it is boxed in the Safety Manuals, printed in bold, quote, ""Failure to observe the above warnings, may result in serious injury or death to crew"". The warning is repeated for a variety of drills that the SSPH crew must undertake.",11,227,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00227
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Next, I will show a video of this safety drill prescribed during the gun lowering – and it will be shown in actual speed, with your permission, Mr Speaker. [A video was shown to hon Members.]",12,228,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00228
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"It takes about nine seconds for the gun to be lowered to the horizontal position for maintenance. All three persons who were in the cabin in this incident had been trained specifically on the SSPH and had conducted similar maintenance on it in the past. During this exercise, both CFC(NS) Pang and the Regular technician had conducted maintenance works on the guns daily.",13,229,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00229
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Following the incident, the SAF's immediate task was to ensure that there was no systemic machine malfunction of the SSPH, which would otherwise have put maintenance crews at risk. Inspections of the SSPH have not detected any machine malfunction of the gun lowering mechanism.",14,230,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00230
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Third, was there a design flaw of the SSPH? Member Assoc Prof Daniel Goh asked this. The SSPH was designed and developed to international military standards for System Safety and Human Factor Engineering. Many other militaries operate tracked 155mm guns with similar gun lowering mechanisms, this includes the United States, South Korea and Germany. The SSPH prototype platform underwent extensive trials and evaluations from Year 2000 to 2002 before its introduction in 2003.",15,231,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00231
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"So, it has been in operation for the last 15 years. Over the last 15 years, more than 1,000 national servicemen and Regulars have been trained to operate the SSPH, and about 12,500 rounds fired. There has not been any reported injury of servicemen due to the gun lowering for maintenance, or operating in or firing of the SSPH.",16,232,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00232
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"I have stated the facts that MINDEF/SAF are aware of, in reply to Members' questions. They include Mr Christopher de Souza, Mr Pritam Singh and Er Dr Lee Bee Wah. We must now leave it to the independent five-member COI led by the State Court judge to determine the factors which led to the death of CFC(NS) Pang. The COI has full access to material and witnesses to determine the facts for themselves. For avoidance of doubt, let me reiterate that the COI need not take into account anything in my Statement in Parliament today.",17,233,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00233
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Everything asked for by the COI will be released to them. I do not foresee needing to withhold any information for security reasons. The COI will also make specific recommendations to rectify any systemic or human lapses found. In the meantime, the two other servicemen deployed from have been re-deployed from their operational roles. We owe it to CFC(NS) Pang and his family, indeed to all Singaporeans, to get to the bottom of what happened, and make things right, to ensure the safety of the NS training system as a whole. I ask that all of us respect these objective and impartial processes that are underway, to reserve our judgement and wait for the conclusions of the COI, which will be presented in Parliament subsequently.",18,234,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00234
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Let me now share the COI's findings on CFC Liu who died on 3 November 2018 after a Bionix reversed into a Land Rover of which he was the driver. As explained earlier in the House, the COI is enabled and governed by the SAF Act. Its mandate is fact finding and not to determine culpability of individuals.",19,235,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00235
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"To determine culpability, separate and independent from the COI, Police investigations are on-going. Thereafter the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) will decide if any persons should be prosecuted. Internally, MINDEF will conduct its own investigations and may charge persons who breach military law in the Military Court, even if the AGC does not file criminal charges.",20,236,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00236
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,The COI of CFC Liu Kai will take into account findings from these various judicial processes before finalising its report.,21,237,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00237
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"On 3 November 2018, the 42nd Battalion Singapore Armoured Regiment (42 SAR) was conducting a two-sided company mission exercise at the Jalan Murai training area. As with all such exercises, a Regular trainer of Captain rank from the Active Unit Training Centre was assigned to evaluate the exercise troops. The trainer used a Land Rover whose driver was CFC Liu, a Transport Operator.",22,238,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00238
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Let me orientate Members to the Bionix's crew. [Slides were shown to hon Members.] This is the Bionix and the crew comprises four persons. For this particular incident, a full-time national serviceman who was in the position of the vehicle commander (Second Lieutenant), a rear guide when the vehicle reverses, he was the Third Sergeant NSF, the driver and the gunner who were both Corporals.",23,239,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00239
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The COI determined that the servicemen involved were qualified to participate in the exercise having undergone the requisite training for their roles. On 2 November 2018 the trainer met the Bionix vehicle commander to understand their manoeuvre plan for the next day’s exercise. The COI was of the view that the servicemen involved had had their rest in accordance to the Training Safety Regulations (TSR), and that their mental and physical states were fit for participation in the activity and did not appear to have an effect on their attention to safety protocols.",24,240,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00240
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,The COI also found that the Land Rover that CFC Liu was driving was serviceable.,25,241,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00241
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,The Land Rover has two cameras – one that records events in front of the vehicle and the second that records events inside the cabin of the Land Rover. The COI was able to piece together a detailed chronology from these camera recordings and statements from multiple witnesses. I will bring Members through the events in detail by showing a series of graphics.,26,242,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00242
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The exercise started on the morning of 3 November 2018 at 7 o'clock. CFC Liu and the trainer were in the Land Rover following their assigned Bionix. At around 9.58, the Bionix crew spotted several vehicles passing by at the junction ahead of it and stopped the Bionix, as ordered by the vehicle commander. Responding to this, the Land Rover driven by CFC Liu also stopped.",27,243,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00243
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The COI found that the trainer had instructed CFC Liu to move the Land Rover forward to overtake the Bionix. Just as CFC Liu started to move forward slowly, shots were fired as part of the exercise. Upon hearing the gunshots, CFC Liu stopped the Land Rover behind the Bionix and based on the COI's calculations, this final position of the Land Rover would have been at a distance of ""at most 19.8m from the Bionix, but short of the safety distance of 30m stated in the Training Safety Regulations (TSR).""",28,244,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00244
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Four seconds after the Land Rover had stopped, the Bionix started to reverse as part of the extrication drill ordered by the Bionix vehicle commander, in responding to the shots. Let me explain a little bit about extrication drills. How well and quickly armour combat crews can extricate themselves when fired upon, can make a big difference as to whether they survive an enemy onslaught or are captured or destroyed. The COI acknowledged the need for this type of training, even though it is high risk.",29,245,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00245
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The Bionix as part of the prescribed drill had to reverse so that its guns could continue to fire forward at the enemy. As the driver of the Bionix is unable to see behind him or behind the vehicle, the rear guide directs the driver in reversing the vehicle. You remember the picture I showed the Bionix with the driver in front – he can see forward. It is the rear guide who must guide him in reversing. As the Bionix reversed, the Land Rover was initially not in its path. The COI found that the Bionix had ""drifted"" in reversing and the driver made a slight steer to correct this drift. This steer brought the Land Rover into the path of the Bionix. The COI did not find any mechanical problems with the Bionix's steering equipment.",30,246,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00246

The COI found that the rear guide issued stop commands into the intercom of his helmet set when the Bionix started reversing and did so repeatedly. The intercom of the helmet is the rear guide’s only means of communication with the other crew members in the Bionix. However, the Bionix continued to reverse.",31,247,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00247

The COI noted that the intercom system was working earlier in the exercise. The COI has asked for an independent technical assessment report on whether the intercom system was working properly all the time. In parallel, Police investigations too are also focused on the communications between the Bionix crew and whether this was affected by the equipment.

2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Second, from March this year, rear-view cameras will be progressively installed into our training fleet of Bionix vehicles, so that the driver can see during reversing. The Army will study if these new features – the safety horns and the camera, the rear-view camera – ought to be incorporated for the operational vehicles as well. All heavy-wheeled vehicles, such as five-tonners, will also be progressively installed with rear-view cameras and mirrors to reduce blind spots.",44,260,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00260

In an exercise area, vehicles are used for a variety of administrative, safety and training purposes. The current distance of 30 metres was prescribed after evaluation and tests and in general, assessed to be adequate for safety and still allow supporting elements to be responsive to events on the ground. But where vehicles have to reverse such as in extrication drills, the Army has put in new measures to enhance safety.",49,265,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00265

The Office will be headed by the SAF Inspector-General. The Chief of Staff-Joint Staff (COS-JS), which is an existing appointment of a Service Chief equivalent, will concurrently be the Inspector-General. This dual function is synergistic as the COS-JS has an overview of all operations and as Inspector-General, will have the authority to ensure that Safety First habits and processes are incorporated at all levels of training. More safety officers will be deployed to assist individual units and supervise training activities. There will be more safety audits of units by inspection teams in the Services and supervised by the Inspector-General Office (IGO).",54,270,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00270

The SAF's safety system is aligned to international frameworks and regulations, such as the Occupational Health and Safety System framework (OHSAS 18001). It comprises  rules that mitigate safety risks in the conduct of all training; processes and training to build up competency of our servicemen and to make sure that the rules are properly applied; inspections and reporting mechanisms to ensure that the rules are followed; and consequences if they are not followed.",57,273,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00273
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Quite a few Members – Prof Fatimah Lateef, Miss Cheng Li Hui, Ms Joan Pereira and Miss Cheryl Chan – have asked even with safety instructions are adequately in place, how do we ensure that national servicemen are familiar and safety conscious. It is an important question. And also if the SAF has taken into account the abrupt switch from civilian environment to military training where there are much larger and potentially dangerous equipment. Another good question.",58,274,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00274
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,These are important issues that need to be factored into our safety systems. One suggestion has been to outsource all maintenance work with heavy vehicles or machinery. This is not possible. Complex maintenance tasks that require specialised tools and equipment are already outsourced. But we still need national servicemen technicians to be with their units to perform basic maintenance so that their equipment can function during operations.,59,275,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00275
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"We do cater time for NSmen soldiers to adjust from their civilian settings. Before any activity commences, a safety brief is held and inspections conducted to check that soldiers are in good physical state, and that vehicles and equipment are serviceable. Soldiers must also complete an individual risk assessment checklist and raise safety concerns to their superiors for mitigation before any activity begins.",60,276,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00276
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"NS training is conducted progressively starting with refresher training for individual skills and proficiencies before any operations are conducted. Prior to their deployment, further training, such as with a simulator, is conducted. I think one Member asked about this.",61,277,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00277

2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Members have asked, and this includes a question from Member Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, if we punish safety lapses, even when they do not lead to injury. Over the past three years, an average of 2% of servicemen a year was punished under the SAF Act for safety lapses – 2 %. Their punishments ranged from a fine to detention and administrative penalties such as delays in promotion and reduction in benefits.",63,279,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00279
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"At the same time, we reward servicemen who demonstrate safe behaviour. Units and individuals are recognised during the Service’s respective annual Safety Day. Member Mr Mohamed Irshad enquired about this.",64,280,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00280
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"If we are to achieve zero fatalities during NS training, we must have a strong safety culture in all our units and safety consciousness down to the last soldier. Commanders and supervisors must lead by example to emphasise safety and all commanders undergo safety training, and must know that safety lapses will affect their performance review. Safety Officers who are former senior commanders help ensure the safe conduct of training. Experienced Regular trainers partner the national servicemen commanders to design training and safety plans. Soldiers must have a strong respect for safety rules, take care of one another and speak out on safety concerns. Incentives and disincentives must be aligned to achieve the right safety outcomes. Our safety system must weed out unsafe practices, even when they do not lead to accidents. This was a point, I think, in the question of Member Ms Irene Quay Siew Ching.",65,281,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00281
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Individual soldiers are encouraged to report unsafe practices and risky behaviour to their superiors without fear of reprisal, or regardless of rank, to call for an immediate stop to training. We do not reward, nor should signal that we reward adventurous behaviour. And this is in the Training Safety Regulations. So, let me quote it in full. It is in chapter 1, section 2, paragraph 11  ""Anyone who spots a safety breach or unsafe practice can call for an immediate stop to it, rectify when possible and report to the Conducting Officer. Once notified, the Conducting Officer should verify the report and when necessary rectify the safety breach or unsafe practice.

2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Ultimately, safety is both a command and individual responsibility and everyone needs to play their part because precious lives depend on it. It is not true that we cannot train safely if we want to train realistically.",69,285,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00285
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"If we have a strong safety culture and safety systems, it will give soldiers greater confidence to train hard and realistically.

But from 2013 to 2016, we had none. How did this turnaround occur? This was probably due to multiple factors, but I think the new safety measures we put into place after the devastating incidents of 2012 had an effect. If we put our minds and efforts to achieve zero training fatalities, it can be achieved.",74,290,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00290

As deep as the hurt, as great the loss, we must not forget why we suffer them. When the founding generation pledged themselves to build a strong SAF, they were fully conscious that a strong military is only possible with fully committed national servicemen drawn from every family in Singapore. They knew the costs and sacrifice that would be required. Not only in resources that we invest in at every Budget, but much more precious would be the time, the sweat, the tears, even the lives of precious sons.",75,291,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00291
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Inherently, military training poses risk. On any given day within the SAF, thousands of national servicemen train hard, amid moving tonnes of steel, bullets, munitions and other explosives. Why do our national servicemen do it? They do it to protect Singapore. Because without national servicemen, we cannot have an SAF or the Home Team that can deter terrorists from attacking Changi Airport or Jurong or harming innocent civilians in shopping malls and crowded places. Without national servicemen and the SAF, potential aggressors would not shy away from simply marching into and occupying today’s affluent Singapore, as Iraq did to Kuwait. Without a strong defence, our air and shipping routes in and out of Singapore could easily be blocked – as Qatar now faces. These are not imaginary security threats that our national servicemen train for but real – they have happened elsewhere and can occur to Singapore too.",76,292,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00292
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"We must never give up on National Service that forms the backbone of our SAF for national defence. This imperative of National Service and our national defence does not absolve or reduce the accountability of MINDEF and the SAF in any way, to ensure safe training. On the contrary, it compels MINDEF and the SAF to do all that is humanly possible to prevent training deaths for national servicemen because precious sons have been entrusted to us by their families. MINDEF and the SAF will hold ourselves accountable for every single national serviceman entrusted to us. I am deeply sorry for the loss of four precious national servicemen in the last 17 months. The SAF will strengthen its safety systems. Even as we honour those who died in service of our country, we must soldier on, to build a strong defence, to protect Singapore and to protect every national serviceman during training. Thank you, Speaker.",77,293,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00293
2019-02-11-T-011,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),I thank the Minister for his comprehensive response and Ministerial Statement. I have three supplementary questions.,1,294,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00294
2019-02-11-T-011,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"With regard to the safety timeout called this time for CFC(NS) Aloysius Pang, how does this compare to the length of time of safety timeout called for previous training incidents, and whether there were any reasons for calling for a longer or shorter timeout?",2,295,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00295
2019-02-11-T-011,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"I also understand that from 7 February, the safety timeout is progressively being lifted. With the time that has passed since the incident and the timeout was originally called for, I do hope that the SAF and the commanders will also observe as much safety precautions as possible as men catch up on the training that they have missed out during this period of time.",3,296,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00296
2019-02-11-T-011,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"The second question is with regard to further assuring Singaporean parents. CFC(NS) Aloysius Pang was my resident. Fellow residents in my constituency knew him well. Over the course of the last few weeks, as I visited families in their flats as we held gatherings, many parents have come up to me and asked about safety, about reassurances for their children. But what I am heartened by is that none of the parents that have spoken to me have ever said we should do away with National Service. Many of them prefaced their statement by saying that we have also served and we know that the SAF takes safety seriously. But with four recent incidents, they are worried. So, how do we reassure them that safety is paramount, that their children will be taken care of.",4,297,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00297
2019-02-11-T-011,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Lastly, I welcome Minister's announcement that rear-view cameras, reverse cameras, will be installed in the Bionix as well as the five-tonners. I was previously with the Transport Section of the 328th Battalion Singapore Combat Engineers. I looked after the five-tonners as well as other transport equipment. These equipment are huge. Although we go through vigorous training and we ensure that there is always a vehicle commander or a safety officer to ensure that when we reverse these vehicles, there are occasions where lapses do occur and minor accidents do happen, fortunately not involving human lives.",5,298,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00298
2019-02-11-T-011,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"So, I do ask if the SAF will consider installing these cameras in all our SAF vehicles eventually, so that it includes an additional safety element for the driver on top of all the other safety features, as well as the vehicle commander and safety officers that we already practise today.",6,299,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00299
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mr Speaker, let me take the questions in turn.",1,300,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00300
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"How different is this timeout from previous timeout? It is significantly different. Previously, there was a period and then units would revert back to their original activity. But as the Member rightly pointed out, after four deaths, old practices must be changed. You must start with the basis that there might be something wrong and look for that factor, whatever that factor is, and that is just a precaution.",2,301,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00301
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"So, the difference is units on operations carry on. We had a period of safety timeout but it has been lifted only for certain activities. More complex ones, more high-risk ones, CDF and his commanders want to be satisfied that not only are the training safety regulations in place, but that there is adequate behaviour, adequate culture in that unit, before you undertake them; and I fully support that. So, there is not as if after a certain period, behaviours will automatically correct.",3,302,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00302
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Rear-view cameras for all vehicles. Intuitively and in principle, it makes sense. But as you can well imagine, the SAF runs platforms of various generations. In fact, the most recent generations, the Terrexes, even our Leopard tanks, have rear-view cameras. But you inherit a long tail and the Bionix was in operation since, I think, the 1990s. With this incident, we decided that we will do it for training vehicles; we are reviewing if we should also do it for operational. So, I would say, in principle, yes, but there are other considerations. But, in principle, I think that is what we want to do and, certainly, as I said, for those that need to reverse, that are reversing, we will put in not only rear-view cameras but mirrors to reduce blind spots.",4,303,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00303
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"There was another question of reassurance of parents. How do you reassure parents that their sons will be safe? And I am glad what the Member Mr Alex Yam has said, that no parent has come to him to say they want to do away with NS. The parents want to know that you are doing your level best, and that you will pay attention. Singaporeans are reasonable, they know that we want to train.",5,304,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00304
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"But let me give you another perspective as well. In these two incidents and a number of incidents that I shared in this House. I shared with you the incident of Gavin Chan, who was training overseas as well when his Bionix overturned. And I gave you the findings of the COI. When asked by his crew to switch on the headlights, he said ""We should not do it. It would give our position away to the enemy"". In the case of Dave Lee, the heatstroke, he pushed himself beyond what he was able. In this case, Liu Kai, they wanted to be realistic, extrication drills.",6,305,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00305
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"We have come very far when national servicemen say, ""I want to train as realistically as I can"". What if we had the reverse situation where everyone attends training but nobody trains? I think we have to take what is good in our system and respond practically. The results must be the ultimate comfort for parents. We will do as much as we can practically each time our COIs tell us there is a lapse or a weakness that needs to be addressed, but I need at every level a safety consciousness, a safety culture. And I tell you, it does not come overnight and may not come even after many years, to raise the level of safety culture.",7,306,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00306
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"I had been the Minister for Manpower, and you will remember the particular period, the Nicoll Highway collapse, the Fusionopolis incident, the COIs that we had. In order to strengthen our system, we went overseas to the Nordic countries, to some European countries, which have higher standards than us. They told me a very interesting example of a particular bridge that was built by two Nordic countries. I will not name them because there are implications which will be explained once I have shared. Two Nordic countries building a bridge to connect the two. Same specifications, they will meet in the middle. One country had half the number of deaths and injuries of the other country. All comes down to culture. And who decides the culture? It is all of us, our children, our friends, our relatives.",8,307,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00307
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"I have said very clearly and in no uncertain terms that anyone can stop unsafe training. If you think it is unsafe for your buddies, for yourself, raise it. If you think that somebody is pushing beyond his means to physical harm, do so. I think, that way, we maintain realistic training and give comfort to our parents.",9,308,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00308
2019-02-11-T-011,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Minister for his answers. The Minister mentioned that for the commanders of units where there are some safety breaches, there will be a mark on their record. Can I ask the Minister at what level would this be? Would it be at the battalion level, the brigade, or the division, formation level?",1,309,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00309
2019-02-11-T-011,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Related to this, I note that the NS training deaths in recent years have involved different vocations, different formation and command. I think in some of these cases where disciplinary actions have been taken, they were taken against junior or mid-level commanders. Moreover, each COI usually does not go beyond the remit of that particular incident in question. So, at what point and at what stage would the Government think that it would be necessary to send a signal to the entire Force when they recognise that there may be a problem at the systemic or a greater level requiring a senior officer, whether at formation, army, SAF or beyond, to take responsibility on this?",2,310,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00310
2019-02-11-T-011,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"I say this, bearing in mind some examples from overseas. In 2013, a Taiwanese conscript died after being physically punished by his superiors. Four officers were charged and the Defence Minister was also quick to take responsibility. In 2017, the US Pacific Seventh Fleet commander was relieved of his command after four accidents involving the Seventh Fleet. The reason given was that there was a loss of confidence in his ability to command. At the same time, while each of these four incidents is unique, they cannot be viewed in isolation – that was the reason given. Also, the US Navy went on to say that there will be a deliberate reset of all the ships, focus on navigation, mechanical systems and bridge resource management.",3,311,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00311
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mr Speaker, there are two main questions, one for commanders with safety lapses. As I have said, even those that do not lead to accidents will affect their performance review, and so that signal is quite clear. How high should you go up? I think we want to be careful that we do what we think works and makes a difference. If senior leadership has to go because they have been involved or have been derelict, then I do not think our population will stand for that. And if you think that that improves the system, push for it. But let us deal with the issue on the ground. I have presented the facts as much as I can. We have had independent reviews, people outside the SAF and MINDEF all looking into the problem. And if they decide that a change of the most senior leadership makes a difference, well it is up to them to recommend. But, for MINDEF and the SAF, we want to deal with day-to-day issues, aligning our incentives and disincentives so we get the whole system moving and making sure that the effect is felt on the ground, rather than posturing or politicking.",1,312,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00312
2019-02-11-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I thank the Minister. As a serving NSman, I think incidents like this move us very strongly because we know it could be us or any other people serving with us. In relation to this, I have two questions  in any organisation like the army, we know the work we do is inherently risky and if any human error is made, incidents can happen. Are there any other models of other armies, for example, where they have been able to achieve zero training deaths? I think Minister mentioned as Minister for Manpower, he looked at other countries – are there any armies we can learn from? That is the first question.",1,313,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00313
2019-02-11-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"And the second, if this incident is the result of, say, human error rather than systemic lapses, is there a need to halt training across the whole system? My concern, of course, is the message we may send to other parties who would be looking at us to see whether the Singapore army is able to deal with adversity? I think most serving NSmen I have spoken to remain ready to serve and ready to go forward.",2,314,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00314
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"I thank Mr Vikram Nair for his reassuring comments. Can we learn from other militaries? We have looked at figures to see what injury and fatality rates for other militaries are. And, of course, we want to benchmark and make sure that we are somewhere there. But that is difficult because you cannot compare like and like. Systems with conscript systems, Taiwan and South Korea, their data is shared in different ways so that is not comparable. There is a military that we can sort of compare training and that is the UK but that is not conscript, that is regular service. And over a 10-year period, our safety records are just slightly better than theirs but that is not a reflection. They may have different terrain and so on and so forth.",1,315,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00315
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"I think we have to ask ourselves, where is our system at? Is this a systemic flaw? And when we ask these questions, remember as you said, so many of us here have or are serving National Service. We know what it is about and some of you even blog your experiences when you go to NS. It is not divorced from reality where there is one group doing National Service and another group just commenting on it. The very people who comment are the ones who do it every year when you go in and you know what the reality is. If you think that the system has degraded to a point, point out where it is and we will fix it.",2,316,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00316
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"But, if we are experiencing injuries and deaths as a result, as the Member said, human error, then neither should we punish indiscriminately, even those who are not involved nor degrade what has taken years for us to achieve. That does not bring anyone any comfort or positive results.",3,317,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00317
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Deal with the issue, strengthen the system bit by bit and it will take years. You know how it is with some commercial companies. Before every board meeting, they repeat the same thing over and over again – the safety instructions, they tell you where the exits are. And I was told that even in some countries, the safety officer saw some chap walking up the stairs not using the stair rail and says, ""This is a safety breach – you should use the stair rail because you can fall."" You say it may be overboard, but there is a meaning to it, I think. And I think that can help. You need to have proper instructions and each time something happens, we must be open, we will review it, get independent parties to look at it, and then strengthen it.",4,318,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00318
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Do we want a system where everyone is afraid? You walk into a room and everyone is frightened that if anything happens, his head will be chopped, more heads will be chopped, up, down. I have dealt with many organisations, both in my private life and in Government. I noticed that the best organisations run not ones which are on tenterhooks, fearful of reprisals so that they dare not do anything, and not ones that are slack. In fact, a slightly busy outfit is the best outfit. Too little, some things happen, too busy. You go into any organisation, you want people who are professional, who know what they do, who are conscious, who are not out just to punish unfairly, but to say how do I make this system better because it will take time, it will take effort, and it will take the part of everybody in their organisation to do so.",5,319,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00319
2019-02-11-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I thank the Minister for his strong statement. Indeed we must strive to marry safety and creating a real operational environment. As a suggestion, would MINDEF consider re-employing retired officers and specialists who have operational and safety experience to train our NSFs and NSmen on what risks to look out for prior to on-the-ground missions? These retired or near to retirement SAF officers and Specialists have a wealth of experience to share; this could be a body separate from the IGO.",1,320,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00320
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mr Speaker, not only will we take up the suggestion, we are already doing it. That is exactly one of the resources that we looked upon. But even that is in short supply – retired, experienced WOs, officers. And you remember the committee to strengthen National Service that we started up a couple of years ago where we wanted to put more trainers instead of national servicemen, we wanted to put those with the experience and that is exactly what we did. We extended the terms of service for the retired Warrant Officers because they serve as a valuable resource. So, because of this, we have redeployed, put safety as a priority, but we will also look for other avenues where we can put more experience on the ground to help our national servicemen as well as young officers build up the training and safety capabilities.",1,321,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00321
2019-02-11-T-011,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, just two questions for the Minister. My first pertains to the non-operational responsibilities on NSmen and NSFs such as NDP and Army Half Marathon. Some would be of the view that some aspects of organising such events could be undertaken by the private sector. To that extent, is MINDEF, as part of this safety review, looking into the time NSFs and NSmen have, to focus on training, maintenance and other operational responsibilities? So, that is the first question.",1,322,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00322
2019-02-11-T-011,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second one pertains to the handout that Minister gave. This was the External Review Panel's report on the Committee of Inquiry's preliminary findings on the death of CFC Liu Kai. Paragraph 6(b) states that the SAF's medical response is based on the concept of rapid evacuation to the next echelon of care, however, such a response may not be adequate when a casualty cannot be evacuated promptly as in CFC Liu Kai's case. Can the Minister share why CFC Liu Kai was not evacuated promptly even though it does state earlier in the report that even if he could have been evacuated, he probably still would have demised from his injuries.",2,323,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00323
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"I agree with the Member that we want to be careful as we are moving in this safety journey to allow time for units to focus on safety and if they are administrative aspects that deter them from it, then we should be prepared to relook. But this is a Command decision. CDF, the Commanders, the COs of the units must themselves come to and decide which is the tempo and you are quite right. For certain activities, they have relooked it, I will leave it to them to announce what they are not going to do so that it gives them enough bandwidth to focus on safety. That is a clear response to that.",1,324,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00324
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"For CFC Liu Kai's extrication, Members will understand why I have not gone into details but it was difficult to extricate.",2,325,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00325
2019-02-11-T-011,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"I would like to ask Minister, just now Minister mentioned that anybody can stop training if they find that it is not safe. I would like to ask, how to stop training, is there a hotline, or is there a whistle-blower hotline? How to assure them that they will not be dealt with unfairly later on if they were to report or being ""tekan""?",1,326,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00326
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"I think the reassurance is what the Members have asked in this House and what I have said, I stated very clearly there is a TSR that anyone can stop. On the ground, usually in activities, you have a safety officer and a conducting officer. But even the CO of the activity who is supervising and the other conducting officers, if you bring it up to them, we want to have a culture where the person can assess the safety and risks. So, on the ground, there are avenues, that is in real time. But apart from that, if there is a recurrent safety lapse or risky behaviour, we have safety hotlines which you can call anonymously or you can write and we will take action. I think the message is very clear to the units after this Statement. It has always been, but if it needs to be clearer because of the reiteration, then remember that unsafe practices will not be tolerated.",1,327,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00327
2019-02-11-T-011,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"I met a family of a deceased soldier about two years ago and his mother told me it is hard for the pain to go away. In fact, she told me, it will never go away. As a mother, I felt for her and I can understand fully her pain. I know Minister highlighted earlier about the support through grief counsellors given to the platoon mates and to the families of the deceased soldiers. However, I would like to know if such emotional and psychological support is sufficient and if, indeed, more can be done to provide such support to the families?",1,328,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00328
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,All of us can imagine how difficult it is for any parent and mothers to have to lose their sons. And all we can do is to pray that there will be some comfort. I have already shared how we provide relief by grief counsellors but even our efforts need to be very sensitive. Not all families can accept it at the time but we should always just be there to offer the help and be consistently there if it is needed. This is an area which you want to retain people in and yet you hope that you do not need their services. We are striking that balance and I have asked them to train a cadre of grief counsellors that can have institutional memory and that can help others in this similar type of vocation be able to assist those who have been bereaved.,1,329,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00329
2019-02-11-T-011,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"I have two questions. The first one is when can we expect the findings of the COI on CFC (NS) Pang's case, if there is an indication to when the findings will be released?",1,330,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00330
2019-02-11-T-011,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"The second is, we all know there cannot be total safety without psychosocial safety. Could the Minister share a little bit of the elements within this safety culture we are building that relates to the psychosocial safety climate, please?",2,331,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00331
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The COI is independent, so they take as much time as they need and I have no control over how fast or how quickly they want to conclude it. If they find that they need more information or facts, we will give them the fullness of time that they require. But normally, as was the case with CFC Liu Kai, it takes a number of months, from anything from two to four months.",1,332,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00332
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The psychosocial aspect is incredibly important and we are not dealing with something which is esoteric. Safety cultures occur in many industries. The need for safety, whether it is construction, heavy machinery, and the same challenges we face in the workplace also apply to both military and civilian settings. So, it is a science and there are experts at it; and there are benchmarks. As I have said, this is intangible of safety culture. And in these conversations like I had, like many of you had over this Chinese New Year period when we talked about why this is happening, and there is always somewhat a tendency to say, ""Well, one generation is different from the other.""",2,333,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00333
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"In the Merdeka Generation, in the Pioneer Generation, it is more of aware of risks, because when we grew up, when we crossed roads, it was always a run or very hazardous. But a newer generation lives in a more structured environment. I do not know what the truth is. We will just have to deal with it and keep strengthening and keep tightening where we feel that it has to be and continue to move it. And if more people buy into this safety culture, I think it will help. But it cannot be dependent on that. It is very clear this is a Command responsibility. Commanders will be taken to task if they ignore safety instructions or have a poor safety culture.",3,334,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00334

Also, being a Director of Quality, Clinical Service and Patient Safety in Emergency Medicine and Trauma, so that really has got a synergy between the two. The fact that the Minister mentioned that the incorporation of safety culture practices into the whole organisation is welcomed.",1,336,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00336
2019-02-11-T-011,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"But more than that, I think, looking at the examples given by the Minister and the whole description, it is actually about human factors – human factors and human errors. So there are people who study human factors, human factor science, human factor analysis and perhaps, this is one area of focus, not just after an incident happens but also perhaps as a preventive measure to get human factor specialists to actually study some of the more high-risk activities. Probably, you will not be able to study all the activities that go on in the SAF just as we cannot do it in medicine but perhaps the more high risk activities that people are going to be involved in, and especially, compared to medicine, you are involved with more heavy machinery and equipment. So, how do we use human factor specialists to help us with this?",2,337,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00337
2019-02-11-T-011,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The Member has raised a very important, relevant point and it is incorporated. Some of you would remember that the RSAF in the 1990s, had a spate of very difficult incidents. It was gut-wrenching – pilots. And today, the RSAF is a far cry from that. And that is exactly what they have incorporated, where they report near misses for equipment and near misses arising from human error. They separate it because the solutions are different. All our services do it, to some extent, but Army is a much larger machinery. Many tens of thousands people running around. But we have got to get that into our system at every level. And it will be up to commanders and they are going to give it their all because they know this is their moral responsibility; this is their professional accountability and this is something that we must get right.",1,338,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00338

2019-02-11-T-011,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Secondly, the Minister mentioned about servicemen being able to report near misses or incidents. I know some servicemen, for some reasons, may not want to report some of these incidents because of unit cohesion and other matters as well. Can I ask the Minister  is there a way, whether MINDEF or SAF would, maybe go directly to the servicemen to do surveys to get an overall sense of training risks and then from there, perhaps to get to be more aware of incidents that could happen on the ground?",2,341,2019-02-11-T-011-S-00341

And yes, there is much on the cards where you do safety audits and you check; you have now hotlines that people can call in. So, that will be part of the menu of things that we will have to ramp up.

We will also provide guidance on the obligations and procedures to address the varying degrees and levels of risks, to help regulated dealers mitigate risks of ML/TF, whilst at the same time also managing compliance costs. The Registrar may give written directions to regulated dealers under certain circumstances, such as to stop a particular employee who has been negligent in performing AML/CFT measures on multiple occasions from conducting any part of the regulated dealer’s business. This is necessary to enable the Registrar to immediately address any activity which contravenes requirements in the Bill or which may pose an ML/TF risk.",24,381,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00381

Upon conviction, non-compliance with the Bill may lead to fines not exceeding $100,000 and imprisonment terms of up to three years, depending on the nature and severity of the particular contravention. This is also in line with penalties introduced in other Acts, such as the Pawnbrokers Act, as the culpability of persons who commit ML/TF offences would be similar.",25,382,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00382

This allows regulated dealers who are already covered under other AML/CFT regimes to be exempted. For example, it is intended for all MAS-regulated financial institutions to be exempted from registration and AML/CFT requirements under the Bill, where they are already subjected to MAS regulations. Classes of financial institutions that conduct regulated dealing, for example banks, insurers, stored value facilities, will continue to be supervised by MAS.",26,383,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00383

2019-02-11-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, in the international web of money laundering and terrorism financing, it is important that Singapore does its part to create an environment in which crime does not pay. As the way these syndicates and perpetrators work is dynamic, it is important not to leave a gap in our preventive framework which they can exploit. Therefore, this Bill is timely to bolster our anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures by increasing the standard of such practices in the industry, and, also, to protect the many hardworking merchants who operate within the industry.",1,387,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00387
2019-02-11-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Precious stones and precious minerals are highly valued yet relatively compact, making it easy and desirable to store or smuggle. Their worldwide demand makes it easy to convert their value into money and vice versa. Their form is versatile and easily changed, making it difficult to trace. For instance, in ""Operation Meltdown"" overseen by the United States Homeland Security Investigations, proceeds from drug trafficking were money laundered through gold. Part of the scheme involved converting gold bullion into nuts, bolts and other items, enabling them to declare them as “gold pigment"". These characteristics make precious stones and precious minerals especially susceptible to be used for money laundering and terrorism financing. Therefore, in order to increase anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures in this industry, this Bill seeks to regulate precious stones and precious minerals dealers. I have a few questions on the scope of the Bill.",2,388,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00388
2019-02-11-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Firstly, the definition of regulated dealers says ""a business of regulated dealing; or business as an intermediary for regulated dealing."" What does ""business"" refer to? From paragraph (e) of the definition of ""regulated dealing"" under clause 2, this Bill seeks to regulate the purchasing of precious stones, precious mineral or precious product for the purpose of resale. Would it include individuals who buy precious stones and precious minerals who make a one-off sale, for instance, to the pawnshop? What if there is more than one purpose for purchase? For instance, gold pieces are often bought during wedding preparation both as a gift but also as an investment. Would that be considered purchase for the purpose of resale? Also, what kinds of situations is paragraph (b) involving ""intermediary"" envisaged to cover?",3,389,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00389
2019-02-11-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Secondly, how will the question of whether a product is a precious product according to the definition be worked out? If the value is referring to retail value, how will it be determined whether 50% of the value is attributable to precious stone or precious material or to the branding of a product or the craftsmanship that goes into it? As luxury brands may carry a range of products – some with precious stones and precious metals which may fall under regulated dealing. It is necessary that there be sufficient clarity and guidance on what is or is not a precious product. Clarity is important for compliance and effective regulation, yet it is also vital that these new regulations do not unduly curb in businesses' creativity when designing products.",4,390,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00390
2019-02-11-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Thirdly, clause 6 says that ""a person must not act or hold out to act as a regulated dealer unless the person is a registered dealer."" Would this Bill apply to persons or businesses who are based overseas but who engage in regulated dealing with individuals or dealers in Singapore? For instance, if a manufacturer based overseas buys scrap metal from Singapore, would that overseas manufacturer require registration?",5,391,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00391
2019-02-11-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"This Bill adopts a risk-based approach to regulation. This is good because of money laundering and terrorist financing, both dynamic, always looking for new loopholes to exploit. The common, fundamental principle running through the whole variety of players in the precious stones and precious minerals industry is that of identifying and addressing risks appropriately.",6,392,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00392
2019-02-11-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"How that works for each business may differ. For instance, the kinds of risk that a person in the scrap metal business faces and a jeweller faces are different. As such, it is important that the objective is clear and expectations communicated so that each of the different sectors can comply meaningfully. There needs to be input from each sector of the industry so that the guidelines will make sense for the kinds of situations they may face. This Bill will help ease the transition of working current informal checking processes into regulatory framework that is sensible and robust.",7,393,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00393
2019-02-11-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Further, there needs to be training and education so that regulated dealers and their employees will be able to effectively implement the appropriate guidelines. If the regulated dealers understand the process but are unable to articulate it to the employees, the regulatory framework will not be as effectively implemented. As risk profiles may change due to the dynamic nature of money laundering and terrorism financing, there needs to be a two-way feedback on what works, what does not, how things need to be changed. That is why it is good that the Bill allows for adjustment of guidelines, standards and codes of practice under clause 35.",8,394,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00394
2019-02-11-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"These guidelines need to be flexible enough to allow discretion to be applied to individual situations, yet they need to provide sufficient guidance for them to be effective. The idea is not to be too burdensome for legitimate transactions but, at the same time, be sufficiently robust to identify and deter illegitimate transactions.",9,395,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00395
2019-02-11-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"As the effects of this Bill will be felt at all levels of the precious metal and precious stones market, including the individual buyers, anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing need to be an ongoing conversation requiring regulator-industry cooperation. For instance, there are concerns that customers will not understand why identity or proof of ownership may be important. Some customers may feel uncomfortable, threatened or put off by needing to answer so many questions. Lack of understanding of certain terms used in risk-profiling, such as ""politically exposed persons"" (PEP), may also be a hindrance to obtaining the requisite information. These concerns of regulated dealers overstepping and intruding into customers' details unnecessarily cannot be treated lightly. Indeed, this is part of the feedback that has come from the industry, that is, whether or not the questions to be asked of potential customers are overly intrusive.",10,396,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00396
2019-02-11-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"To this end, what will be done to raise awareness among the general public about what to expect and the importance of such processes? How will regulated dealers be supported in complying with the guidelines, for instance, giving them the power to ask for certain private information or building capacity so that they will be able to search in the relevant ""watchlists"" should such actions become necessary? Further, what will be done to address concerns that private information will not be obtained unnecessarily and that private information obtained will remain secure and confidential if eventually not needed for any anti-money-laundering or counter-terrorism financing investigations?",11,397,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00397
2019-02-11-T-015,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Regarding the information gathered, clause 29 of the Bill provides for disclosure of information or documents to a foreign authority. This is good because international cooperation in this area is vital to effectively identify which transactions are riskier.",12,398,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00398

2019-02-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Singapore's position as a major financial hub brings with it greater exposure to transnational economic crime. To counteract this, Singapore has developed and implemented a robust anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism framework to target, prevent and confiscate the proceeds of crime, particularly within the financial sector and the Senior Minister of State has mentioned some aspects of it in his earlier speech.",2,400,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00400
2019-02-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"This House had, as recently as in October last year, passed the Serious Crimes and Counter-Terrorism Bill, to strengthen our ability to detect and deter criminals.

2019-02-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"However, we are only as safe and strong as our weakest link. The Financial Action Task Force, in its evaluation of Singapore's AML framework in 2016, has identified the precious stones and precious metal dealers (PSMD) sector as a risk area for controls to be improved. The PSMD sector in Singapore is not currently subject to any specific AML/CFT controls. This is a gap that criminals may exploit and may even be presently exploiting. The PSMD sector is particularly vulnerable, as identified by Mr Christopher de Souza, because of the fact that precious stones and metals are easily transported, concealed and converted into cash. This can be used by criminals to launder monies to hide their illicit sources of funds.",4,402,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00402
2019-02-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The case of an errant lawyer in 2006 is a good example. He had used approximately $2 million that he held on trust for his client to purchase various pieces of jewellery and precious stones from a jeweller and absconded with all these items. The payments were first made by way of a telegraphic transfer from his firm’s client account and, subsequently, a cash cheque was issued in the name of the firm’s client account. His clients subsequently tried to recover their losses from the jeweller via a civil action before the Singapore courts. In doing so, the clients alleged that the jeweller ought to have known from the circumstances of the transactions that he was using monies belonging to another in breach of trust.",5,403,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00403
2019-02-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The Singapore Court of Appeal, in its 2010 decision, considered that whilst there were some circumstances surrounding the transaction which arguably might have raised cause for concern about the probity of the transaction, the jeweller did not cross the boundaries of reasonable commercial conduct in relation to the first transaction paid through telegraphic transfer of monies. In arriving at its decision, a key consideration of the Court of Appeal was that there was no pre-existing practice of jewellers questioning customers on the source of funds, such that it would not be fair to criticise the jeweller’s staff for their failure to query the source of purchaser’s funds.",6,404,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00404
2019-02-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),The Court of Appeal's comments in this regard were particularly pertinent and exemplifies the gap in our present regulatory scheme. It said,7,405,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00405
2019-02-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"""Clearly, it is not the usual practice for jewellers and retailers in general, to ask their clients searching questions about the source of their funds. As rightly pointed out by the Judge, indeed, there are usually cogent reasons for not asking questions. Genuine clients would feel offended, the transaction might be unreasonably delayed, and costs incurred. Admittedly, in certain types of commercial transactions, there might well be a practice of exercising due diligence…In Singapore, unlike the United States and the United Kingdom, there are currently no rules that require jewellers, gem dealers and precious metal dealers to implement anti-money laundering programmes… ...This is why the Judge quite correctly remarked that most honest retailers would not bother to check on the background or standing of their customers even for very large purchases; there is simply no general practice of making inquiries and imposing such an invariable requirement on large transactions might jeopardise completion of large numbers of legitimate transactions.""",8,406,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00406

2019-02-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The first area concerns how the Ministry intends to ensure that jewellers, bullion traders, jewellery wholesalers and retailers, auctioneers and secondhand goods dealers – who would be regulated dealers under the Act – would be adequately equipped to understand their obligations under the Act, such as their obligations to conduct customer due diligence (CDD) and filing of suspicious transaction reports (STRs).",12,410,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00410
2019-02-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Such dealers may be tradesmen who may not be familiar with or have experience in carrying out such AML controls, or whose current business models would need to be adapted to allow such controls to be implemented. What are some of steps that the Ministry has taken or plans to take to ensure that regulated dealers will have the necessary training and will be well versed with their obligations under the Act and understand the consequences of non-compliance? For example, ongoing industry engagement through industry bodies such as the Singapore Jewellers Association?",13,411,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00411
2019-02-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Next, it should also be noted that PSMDs are generally not as well resourced as banks. Would the Ministry be providing support to enable PSMDs to build capacity to conduct CDD? In comparison, I recall it was announced that the MAS was working with the banking sector to develop a common screening platform for CDD purposes. This has a salutary effect of ensuring common standards as well as ensuring that compliance costs are kept in check.",14,412,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00412
2019-02-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I wonder how the Ministry would deal with possible situations arising where purchasers could spread their purchases with PSMDs to escape detection by transacting below the threshold amount of $20,000 so as to escape CDD requirements. What expectations will be placed on PSMDs to find out whether such multiple purchases were or will be made? It may not be practical to require PSMDs to share information of purchasers’ identities with their competitors. But on the other hand, there could be scope for pooling information amongst affiliated PSMDs or outlets of the same PSMDs. I welcome the Senior Minister of State's clarification on this.",15,413,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00413
2019-02-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Finally, section 18 of the Act requires a regulated dealer to keep prescribed documents and information for a prescribed period of time. The Bill does not specify what this period of time is, save to say that the different periods may be prescribed for different classes of regulated dealers, different types of designated transactions or different documents and information. Presumably these requirements will be specified through secondary legislation.",16,414,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00414

2019-02-11-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr de Souza asked what the definition of ""business"" is in the Bill. We would draw from the Business Names Registration Act (2014) and I would just like to define it as such  ""'Business' would include every form of trade, commerce and profession and any other activity that is carried on for the purposes of gain but does not include any office, employment or occupation"". So, it refers, for example, to companies, partnerships and sole proprietorships which sell precious metals, stones and products, such as jewellery.",2,418,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00418
2019-02-11-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr de Souza also asked whether the definition of ""regulated dealing"" covers purchases of precious stones, metals and products for multiple purposes, including for the purpose of resale. It is not the intention of the regime to cover individuals who make one-off purchases and subsequently may decide then at some stage to sell their items to a second-hand goods dealer. Whilst such activities may be carried on for the purposes of gain, these are conceivably not matters that fall within the definition of ""business"". But, of course, if this happens once too often and there is a pattern of such activity, then all of that would be taken into account when looked at and considered in the context of the definition as to whether there is activity that generates gain under the definition. So, from the individual's perspective, I have addressed Mr de Souza's point, but from the perspective of the regulated dealers, as well as those who purchase the second-hand items from these individuals, they would have to perform the AML/CFT measures where appropriate.",3,419,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00419
2019-02-11-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On intermediaries, Mr de Souza asked what situations specific to limb B of the definition of regulated dealings involving intermediaries do we envisage we would cover. Intermediaries, as defined in clause 2 of the Bill, such as precious stones and metals exchange or auctioneer, would be covered under the Bill and we need to cover the intermediaries because, otherwise, the intermediaries would immediately provide a way in which you would enable anonymity in the transactions, if one uses the intermediary to deal with the transactions in these precious stones or metals. Such intermediaries may import the items from overseas suppliers and perform the sale in Singapore on behalf of their overseas suppliers. Depending on the mode of transaction through the intermediary, it may not be possible for suppliers to perform the AML/CFT measures required, for example, to verify the identity of the customer. It is, therefore, necessary to also regulate intermediaries to ensure that the appropriate AML/CFT measures are performed where necessary.",4,420,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00420
2019-02-11-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr de Souza asked if the Bill applies to persons or businesses based overseas but engaged in dealing with regulated dealers in Singapore. As stated in clause 14 of the Bill, the requirements of Part III, which deals with this aspect of Mr de Souza's concern, apply to all regulated dealers who carry on any part of their business of regulated dealing in Singapore. So, the touchstone is that, if the business is carried on in Singapore, it will apply to them. In the example that Mr de Souza cited, the manufacturers based overseas would not have to register with the Ministry or comply with the requirements of the regime when purchasing scrap metal from Singapore as long as he does not carry out any part of his business of regulated dealing in Singapore. Nevertheless, such dealers will be subject, of course, to the relevant AML/CFT verifications and processes in their home jurisdictions.",5,421,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00421

But as Mr de Souza also mentioned there needs to be a degree of flexibility in the way we look at this. Obviously, if one is too prescriptive with the definition, then the effects of the Bill will lose its flexibility and that may then, allow a loophole to be introduced. Having said that, we recognise that precious products may have different parameters to determine their value beyond just the value of the stones and metals, for example, in the branding or craftsmanship of such products.",6,422,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00422

It is possible for customers to transact with multiple, not just one, but multiple different regulated dealers and go below the threshold each time, to avoid the CDD checks.

2019-02-11-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On the record-keeping requirement, Mr Murali Pillai asked about the prescribed period. Mr Murali Pillai is right, we do intend to prescribe in the subsidiary legislation for dealers to keep records for a period of five years. This is similar to the record-keeping requirement imposed by all other sectors, including Pawnbrokers, and is also aligned with the international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force.",11,427,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00427
2019-02-11-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Murali Pillai asked for the rationale behind the power to prescribe different time periods for different classes of dealers or transactions. This is needed because the level of ML/TF risk posed by different classes of dealers or transactions may itself require different time periods for the records to be kept.,12,428,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00428

Secondly, the production and circulation of AML/CFT guidance materials. These will include details on how to perform proper customer due diligence, how to perform risk assessments, and implement internal policies, procedures and controls. And based on feedback from associations, we will also, where appropriate, provide the materials in different languages and issue templates and checklists, so as to help the ground and the smaller players within this sector to better appreciate and also implement these measures. For instance, we will issue a brochure which will contain information on the registration process to regulated dealers before registration commences.",16,432,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00432

Other than complying with the requirements in the Bill, regulated dealers also have to comply with the Personal Data Protection Act and ensure that personal information obtained is not used or disclosed for other purposes, such as marketing, without the consent of the customer.

Those are very good points and we will work with the industry to inform the public of the importance and requirements of the regime, in particular the need to obtain customer’s personal information as part of that due diligence exercise, so as to facilitate regulated dealers in their compliance with the regime. For example, we may also consider issuing posters and other guidance notes on the new requirements for regulated dealers to put up in their places of business.",20,436,2019-02-11-T-015-S-00436

In line with the broader AML/CFT framework, this Bill will strengthen AML/CFT standards in the PSMD sector through supervision and regulation. It will help to manage money laundering and terrorism financing risks within the sector, which, as Members have pointed out, is something that has been missing; this is one further piece amongst the various steps that we take.

It is also our view that the SP Proposal is consistent with Singapore's international obligations in relation to intellectual property rights. Tobacco companies' trade marks do not give them absolute rights to use their trade marks. Those rights are subject to legitimate government regulation. In this regard, it is also worth noting that a dispute settlement Panel of the World Trade Organization (WTO) has found that Australia's introduction of standardised packaging measures was not inconsistent with its international obligations under various WTO agreements, including the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and the Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreement.

The post-implementation data from Australia, which was the first country to introduce standard packaging for tobacco products in 2012, and also from France, reinforces the efficacy of such a measure. Tobacco companies and the lobby groups associated with them have decried that plain packaging would have little effect on smoking rates except to make life more vexatious for retailers and their customers, but their robust efforts to fight against standard packaging, for example, by launching lawsuits against Australia, proves that this is otherwise. The tobacco industry is running scared, thus underlining the potential impact of standard packaging legislation on smoking rates.",3,487,2019-02-11-T-016-S-00487

Children will also not be over-exposed to the sight of people smoking, preventing the normalising of smoking in their minds. At the same time, smokers’ needs are met too. The reality is that some smokers simply will not quit. They have told me that they appreciate the DSPs.

2019-02-11-T-016,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"While there is fortunately no evidence to show that social media influencers in Singapore have been targeted by tobacco companies in this way, the porous and borderless nature of the internet means that young Singaporeans can nevertheless be exposed to such images. Many social media influencers also have a global fan base so even campaigns originating from well beyond our shores can appeal to our youths if influencers with a strong following in Singapore are mobilised.

Because of the lack of transparency surrounding the algorithms that determine what content social media platforms serve us, we cannot discern why we may be seeing more of particular forms of content. Neither can we exert more active control over our social media feeds should we so choose. Young people who like, share or comment on images portraying negative behaviours as hip and trendy, with particular hashtags, may be unwittingly served more of such images on their social media feeds.",10,537,2019-02-11-T-016-S-00537

The young can be easily influenced by the positive image of smoking created by social media marketing. Such marketing is sponsored by multinational tobacco companies.

Programmes like the I QUIT Programme/Challenge to Quit Smoking during the Fasting Month of Ramadan, advertisements and others, as well as various measures by the Government, seem to have lost their effect. Health statistics show that the number of our community members who are unhealthy, in terms of having chronic diseases and a smoking habit as one of the risks, are worrying. Our Malay male smokers, for instance, start smoking at a young age, during their teens and even while in school. This is unhealthy!

2019-02-11-T-016,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Overall, the evidence supports the conclusion that the SP Proposal is likely, alongside other tobacco-control measures, to promote public health through the reduction of the prevalence of smoking in Singapore. Whilst there can be no precise prediction on future behavioural trends, or how long the impact might take to be felt, or whether other measures might become necessary to achieve even better tobacco control, the current evidence points substantially in favour of there being significant public health benefit in Singapore with the introduction of the SP Proposal.",13,594,2019-02-11-T-016-S-00594
2019-02-11-T-016,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked about the effectiveness of health warnings. The aim of graphic health warnings on tobacco products is precisely to communicate health risk and also to motivate tobacco users and, possibly, potential users, to either quit or reduce, or not even start consumption. This question has previously been addressed by MOH in this House. Members will know that there is a strong body of international evidence demonstrating the impact of graphic health warnings on knowledge of health effects, thoughts about quitting, use of Quitlines, and ultimately on quitting attempts.",14,595,2019-02-11-T-016-S-00595
2019-02-11-T-016,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Studies from Australia, Canada, the US and the UK have shown impact on behaviours, such as noticing cigarette warnings and forgoing cigarettes, predict subsequent quitting attempts among individual smokers. For example, a systematic review of 32 studies from 20 countries, including some high-income countries, with more than 800,000 participants found that graphic health warnings are associated with increased Quitline calls, reduced smoking consumption, increased quit attempts, increased short-term smoking cessation and reduced smoking prevalence.",15,596,2019-02-11-T-016-S-00596
2019-02-11-T-016,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Locally, in Singapore, a 2005 study by HPB evaluating the impact of the introduction of graphic health warnings showed that 50% of participants were more concerned and worried about their health after seeing the graphic health warnings. This also led to behaviour changes where one in four smokers were motivated to quit smoking and made efforts to abstain from smoking. Non-smokers were also affected and more than half spoke up to advise their friends and loved ones to quit smoking. This outcome and finding is also consistent with international evidence on the impact of graphic health warnings.",16,597,2019-02-11-T-016-S-00597
2019-02-11-T-016,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The evidence also suggests that the use of large and noticeable graphic health warnings can reduce smoking initiation. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that countries should consider increasing the size of graphic health warnings to cover more than 50% of tobacco packaging and replacing the images on such warnings every two to three years to increase their effectiveness. So you rotate and change the images because, otherwise, one becomes desensitised and dulled to the images. This recommendation is also in part why we have proposed that the graphic health warnings be increased to 75% of the cigarette packaging.",17,598,2019-02-11-T-016-S-00598
2019-02-11-T-016,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I would add on this point, finally, that in the dispute on plain packaging against Australia at the World Trade Organization (WTO), that I mentioned earlier, the panel concluded, and I quote, that ""there is some econometric evidence suggesting that standardised packaging, together with the enlarged graphic health warnings implemented at the same time contributed to the reduction in overall smoking prevalence as well as in cigar smoking prevalence, observed after their entry into force."" So, it is a point that we have also leaned on and taken notice of in arriving at our measures.",18,599,2019-02-11-T-016-S-00599
2019-02-11-T-016,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked whether the SP Proposal would lead to ""down-trading"" and an increase in counterfeit tobacco products. Down-trading describes a phenomenon in which there is a shift from more expensive tobacco products or brands to lower priced alternatives in the market. The tobacco industry has contended that standardised packaging will result in this phenomenon, which will in turn lead to an increase in overall tobacco demand or consumption because consumers buy more products when prices are lower.",19,600,2019-02-11-T-016-S-00600
2019-02-11-T-016,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We have looked at this with advice from our experts. This shift towards lower priced tobacco products in the Australian market was observed even before the introduction of standardised packaging, and is also observed in all other high-income countries, not just in Australia, as smoking prevalence decreases.",20,601,2019-02-11-T-016-S-00601
2019-02-11-T-016,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Much of this is attributable to pricing strategies of the tobacco industry itself, which has been known to increase the price differential between low and higher priced brands when passing on tax increases to the customer.",21,602,2019-02-11-T-016-S-00602
2019-02-11-T-016,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Our own assessment is that any acceleration in trends towards down-trading in Australia is likely to be largely attributable to the actions of the tobacco industry in differentially passing on the increases in taxes in the years following the implementation of standardised packaging. Correspondingly, the contribution of standardised packaging to down-trading is likely to only be a modest one, if at all. Any impact that down-trading may have on increasing overall demand may also be addressed by policy measures to increase the absolute price and hence reduce affordability of low-price brands, for example, by increasing tobacco taxes, if necessary.",22,603,2019-02-11-T-016-S-00603
2019-02-11-T-016,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Regarding counterfeit tobacco products, our assessment is that the introduction of standardised packaging is unlikely to materially contribute towards an increase in illicit trade in tobacco products in Singapore. We arrived at this view after having carefully considered the arguments and evidence submitted by the tobacco industry players themselves on illicit trade to the public consultation, as well as of course, the experience in Australia.",23,604,2019-02-11-T-016-S-00604
2019-02-11-T-016,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Much of the evidence submitted was in relation to Australia's experience, largely because they have had several years since they introduced the measures, have gathered a large amount of data, and also looked at the experience, in some way, with the benefit of hindsight. The same evidence was submitted to the WTO Panel, which reviewed it in detail. The WTO Panel concluded that the evidence did not demonstrate that the introduction of standardised packaging in Australia had led to an increased trade or consumption of illicit tobacco so as to undermine standardised packaging's contribution to the overall objective of improving public health.",24,605,2019-02-11-T-016-S-00605
2019-02-11-T-016,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The local context is also important. The prevailing form of illicit tobacco in Singapore is that of contraband, which is genuine but duty-unpaid cigarettes, as opposed to counterfeit cigarettes. Due to the relatively small Singapore market for cigarettes, counterfeit cigarette manufacturers are not incentivised to counterfeit cigarettes for sale in Singapore.",25,606,2019-02-11-T-016-S-00606
2019-02-11-T-016,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In Singapore, illicit tobacco products are sold on the black market rather than at licensed tobacco retailers. The aim of counterfeiting is to ""pass off"" counterfeit products as the genuine article. There has been no evidence submitted in the consultations to MOH to show that buyers on the black market will choose counterfeit products in standardised packaging over contraband, genuine products, and that really is assessment that one has to make.",26,607,2019-02-11-T-016-S-00607
2019-02-11-T-016,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Overall, therefore there is no compelling reason to believe that counterfeit products and illicit trade will increase with the introduction of standardised packaging.

I think her concern, quite rightly, was with the retailers who may have an existing stock of the older non-standardised packaging tobacco products and she asked if we could reach out to them, to help them understand the new standardised packaging requirements, hear their feedback, and also to understand any concerns they might have on the implementation deadlines and operationalising of the implementation. She also asked about the length of the transition period. These are very all pertinent issues to mitigate any harsh effects there might be, against the retailers, particularly those who operate smaller set ups.",28,609,2019-02-11-T-016-S-00609

2019-02-11-T-016,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The enforcement of Singapore's tobacco control law already falls under a specialised regulatory agency – namely, the Health Sciences Authority of Singapore. The HSA enforces the labelling requirements for tobacco products, including the existing Graphic Health Warnings, the health information, as well as the sale restriction messages on tobacco packaging. This is usually done at the importer, manufacturer and also the distributor level. Thus far, we have found the existing regulatory regime to be adequate and sufficient but we will no doubt keep in mind Mr Louis Ng's suggestion as we consider the details of implementation, if this Bill is passed.",33,614,2019-02-11-T-016-S-00614

These are all issues that we have to grapple with, not just in tobacco control but overall in terms of the messaging, and the type of information that one gleans and gathers on the social media, which is very much and very quickly proliferating. We have two responses. The first is, under our current Tobacco Control of Advertisements and Sales Act, tobacco-related advertisements in all forms of media are already banned and that can include advertisements which emanate from foreign countries overseas but which are viewed or shown in Singapore. The law is clear on this – we prohibit it but obviously with so many different influencers and the examples that Prof Lim herself cited, where one can artistically and somewhat perhaps, very carefully, design the way in which the images are portrayed, this makes detection and therefore enforcement a lot more difficult. Nonetheless, we will take on board the suggestion to work more closely with social media companies and the tech giants to ensure that this same message is passed through, which leads to my next point.",34,615,2019-02-11-T-016-S-00615

So apart from enforcing it through the rules which we have in place, we also want to amplify our public education outreach on the same platforms with the same reach and hopefully to the same target audience as what these tobacco companies are trying to do. We will continue to do so and see how we can take on board Prof Lim Sun Sun's suggestions as to how we can work more closely with these companies particularly on the point about algorithms, which is entirely valid.",35,616,2019-02-11-T-016-S-00616

Section 18 is the provision that requires any person dealing with tobacco products and that includes the importing, distributing, selling and offering for sale in Singapore to hold a valid license issued by the HSA. As mentioned earlier, the aim is to align the maximum penalties in section 18 with the maximum fines for similarly serious comparable offences pertaining to the importation, distribution, retail and possession of prohibited tobacco products and imitation tobacco products under sections 15 and 16 of the Act, respectively. With the alignment of penalties, we make it clear that offences related to unlicenced dealing of tobacco products are considered as serious offences to the same degree as offences relating to prohibited tobacco products.",36,617,2019-02-11-T-016-S-00617

So, whether duty is paid or unpaid, the fact of the matter is that if the packaging for the purposes of importation into Singapore does not comply with the regulations, then that would not be allowed.

2019-02-11-T-017,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Traditional Chinese Medicine, or TCM, forms an integral and important part of our healthcare landscape. In recent years, both our Prime Minister and our Minister for Health have remarked on the critical role that TCM can play in improving the health of our citizens, particularly within the context of an ageing population. And I too would like to put on record my appreciation to the TCM community for the contributions to Singapore's healthcare. And certainly, TCM remains a medical remedy of choice for many Singaporeans, and indeed we are seeing a new generation of TCM practitioners, with more young Singaporeans choosing TCM as a career, particularly since the introduction of NTU's double degree programme in Biomedical Science and Chinese Medicine in 2005.",1,679,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00679

Nonetheless, I am concerned that the lack of a more formal disciplinary or inquiry process, and the absence of specific schedules on penalties, and clear definitions of physical and mental fitness for work, may lead to the same issues and criticisms facing disciplinary processes by the Singapore Medical Council today.",3,681,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00681
2019-02-11-T-017,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"For instance, how robust will the renamed Inquiry Committee's decision regarding a practitioner's physical or mental fitness to practise be? This is a challenge that western medicine is also facing. For instance, in the United States, there was a much discussed case or incident where a senior surgeon in his early 70s while supervising a procedure fell asleep during the surgery. This particular surgeon was not performing the surgery itself but concerns were raised. And there were many discussions between the Board of the hospital and various communities but the problem they faced was that it was difficult to prove fitness or unfitness from a mental or physical point of view. Just by going by normal physical and mental tests alone, he passed. The case was finally resolved by the voluntary withdrawal of the physician in question from clinical practice. But these are challenges that have no easy answers. And I would like just to find out, with this Inquiry Committee, how will it deal with such cases?",4,682,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00682

I have heard instances where the cost of TCM treatment could even reach six figures and maybe five figures in many cases. What would be considered an acceptable treatment modality and what would not be considered an acceptable treatment modality, considering that TCM embraces a wide range of treatment philosophies and modalities, some of which may be at odds with one another?",5,683,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00683

I ask about this with an intent to see if we can address some of these in this latest Bill that we are discussing today.",4,698,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00698
2019-02-11-T-017,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Secondly, I support the formation of the Inquiry Committee when the need arises, versus having a permanent one in place for a certain term because it is more relevant to appoint according to the type of cases, breaches or issues that we are handling at a certain point in time. This way we can appoint the appropriate type of TCM personnel or even specialists to provide opinion and consultation or serve as an expert witness.",5,699,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00699
2019-02-11-T-017,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Thirdly, pertaining to the compulsory Continuing Professional Education (CPE), I firmly support this. I also have a few suggestions to make.",6,700,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00700
2019-02-11-T-017,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"One, to have the setup of a directory electronically for courses and training being offered for easy access and knowledge of all TCM practitioners. The usual organisers can come together to discuss and brainstorm this and see how best to execute but for those who want to offer ad hoc courses and training, there should be a body of persons looking into the suitability of these courses to ensure certain standards are met.",7,701,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00701
2019-02-11-T-017,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),There must be a secretariat to also monitor and carry out surveillance to track the number of points and warn practitioners of the shortfall if they risk not getting renewal of their practising certificates.,8,702,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00702
2019-02-11-T-017,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"There were some concerns on the cost to be borne by the practitioners themselves for these courses. In the Medical and Nursing profession, for example, established institutions have got a sponsorship scheme and other forms of support for their practitioners. Now, for large TCM groups this may be feasible to offer but for the lone TCM practitioner, there may need to be other considerations given or offer of subsidies or, perhaps, even accredit scheme. This will be for the Ministry to review and consider. Of course, some courses can be offered online though e-learning will also take time and money to set up.",9,703,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00703
2019-02-11-T-017,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Some offset can take place by offering some of these courses through SkillsFuture or other upgrading grants but that is something to be reviewed with caution. In this context, can the Ministry also update us on the use of the TCM Development Grant. What can this Grant be utilised for? Is it just for education or improvement of practice and setup?",10,704,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00704
2019-02-11-T-017,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"I note also the number of points for CPE required over two years. Can I ask if there will be some flexibility given to the TCM practitioners, especially for the first two years as the running in period? This request is with the consideration that some of our TCM practitioners are in the older generation and they are in solo practice and they may need time to adjust to this, to get used to the new guidelines as well.",11,705,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00705
2019-02-11-T-017,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Next, can I get some clarification on the term ""TCM practitioner"" as used in this Bill? Are the people who run the sinseh shops, prescribing herbal type medications in this category as well? How about those who offer massage and tuina services as practitioners as well as the dispensers in the neighbourhood shops? Are they also incorporated into this Bill under consideration?",12,706,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00706
2019-02-11-T-017,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"On the 11 members of the Board, can I suggest also that they represent TCM practitioners who are generalists and also some who are specialists in certain aspects of the practice. But I also note that we may need to have the relevant and adequate numbers of specialists in TCM area for now so, therefore, this is something, perhaps, to be considered later on.",13,707,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00707
2019-02-11-T-017,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"With TCM services the fees, we note can range from as low as $1 to $2 in the neighbourhood and community clinics to the highly priced ones in advanced centres. What is the Ministry’s view on this and will we be moving towards some range standardisation, perhaps, even into different categories of services which are being offered?",14,708,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00708
2019-02-11-T-017,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"And, finally, on the issue of Medical Certificates by TCM practitioners and their recognition by employers, this is a long-drawn issue that has been debated for very often. Are we planning to come up with some standardisation or guidelines? This has always been a controversial issue and I think it will continue to be because of the range of services as well as TCM practitioners that are out there. So, perhaps, some comment from the Ministry on this. All in all, I support the Bill.",15,709,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00709
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, I stand in support of this Bill. In recent years, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has become more popular as a career of choice. From 2012 to 2017, the number of practitioners rose by 16%.",1,710,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00710
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"However, as the profession swells in ranks, it must keep up its standards. Despite the growth in numbers, degree holders still comprise only 21% of all registered practitioners, according to 2017 data. Some 5.7% of practitioners have no formal qualifications at all.",2,711,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00711
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Practitioners must continue to learn, unlearn, and relearn to keep up with the times. This Bill mandates continuing professional education for practitioners. At the same time, it clarifies and elaborates the mechanisms used to keep practitioners in check.",3,712,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00712
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I agree with these measures, and I thank MOH for holding a public consultation and incorporating views from that consultation into this piece of legislation.",4,713,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00713
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I have five points of clarification to raise.,5,714,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00714
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My first point is about fines.,6,715,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00715
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The Bill raises the maximum fine from $10,000 to $50,000. I agree in principle with the increase, as it strengthens deterrence and punishment in an area where human lives are concerned. However, it is unclear to me why this penalty is less than that imposed on Western medical practitioners. Under the Medical Registration Act, medical practitioners face a maximum penalty of $100,000. In effect, we are saying that Western physicians get fined $100,000 for doing wrong, while TCM physicians get fined $50,000 for doing wrong.",7,716,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00716
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In its response to the public consultation, the Ministry said that that Medical Registration Act more seriously penalises Western physicians for one reason only  that they pose ""greater risk of potential harm to patients"".",8,717,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00717
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Can the Minister explain how a Western physician might be more dangerous than a TCM practitioner?,9,718,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00718
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Last September, the TCM Practitioners Board fined a physician the maximum $10,000 for recommending that a patient delay her cancer treatment or surgery. The physician conveyed a whole slew of dangerous advice to his patient. He told her that the tumor would grow slowly. He told her that surgery would make the cancer cells proliferate more quickly. He told her that her tumor was not life-threatening.",10,719,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00719
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In addition, he prescribed capsules of ginseng and herb that, at best, provided a false sense of comfort for his patient. We were lucky that the patient’s daughter interceded and that the patient went ahead, promptly, with surgery. But not every patient is so lucky.",11,720,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00720
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I am concerned about the message that this difference in fines sends. When patients sit in a physician’s office, the physician is the figure of authority. TCM physicians are in a prime position to influence the health decisions of patients. In this case, the physician took the patient down a dangerous, life-threatening course of action.",12,721,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00721
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I urge the Ministry to further explain why a TCM practitioner should face a less severe penalty than a Western medical practitioner. My second point is about continuing professional education. I am heartened that the Bill empowers the TCM practitioners board to reject the registration of practitioners who fail to comply with requirements on mandatory professional education.,13,722,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00722
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My question is whether the Board can issue such requirements as part of a punishment imposed on errant practitioners.,14,723,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00723
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In the case I previously mentioned, the Board issued only a fine and a suspension to the practitioner even though it found that he was, ""neither remorseful for his conduct nor fully aware of the danger that he posed to that patient.""",15,724,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00724
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"From that statement, it appears the practitioner did not agree or understand that what he did was wrong. What, then, is stopping him from making similar mistakes of the same nature when he returns to practice? What course of action has been taken to ensure his knowledge base is updated to what the profession demands?",16,725,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00725
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In many industries, it is common for errant professionals to undergo some programme of training or education to rectify their gap in knowledge and understanding. Can the Ministry clarify whether the TCM Practitioners Act equips the Board with powers to require offending practitioners to undergo specific courses of professional training?",17,726,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00726
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My third point is about responding to complainants. The new section 26E details an array of timelines. Upon receiving a complaint, the Board has two weeks to start a review and three months to complete that review. If they refer the matter to an Inquiry Committee, the committee has six months. All in all, it seems that the process can take just under a year, extensions notwithstanding. It is a long time for a complainant to wait.",18,727,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00727
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My questions are as follows  does the Board have an obligation to respond to the complainant with the results of its review? If the review proceeds to the stage where an Inquiry Committee is convened to investigate, must the complainant be notified about the final findings? In either case, is there a requirement that the Board relays information in any prompt manner to the complainant?",19,728,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00728
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"It is laudable that we have an extensive framework for investigating complaints. Surely, the point of these investigations is not only to be accountable but also to demonstrate accountability. It then seems important to me that the Board has a duty to reply to the complainant in a reasonably prompt fashion with a response that meaningfully addresses the complainant's concerns.",20,729,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00729
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My fourth point is about sharing the results of investigations with former patients.,21,730,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00730
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"If TCM physicians have conducted themselves in a dangerous way, it is possible that they have done it before. For instance, a physician who has given incorrect advice about how to deal with cancer might well have said similar things to other cancer patients.",22,731,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00731
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),The TCM Practitioners Act does not appear to mandate that the Board release investigation results to former patients of the errant physician.,23,732,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00732
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Historically, we have seen some cases of misconduct by TCM practitioners reported in the news media. However, it is perhaps not a stretch to say that many TCM patients may not follow the news media closely. Thus they may not be aware that the diagnosis or treatment they received was shoddy. Could the Ministry share whether, and how, it communicates with former patients when physicians are found guilty of misconduct?",24,733,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00733
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My fifth and last point relates to mental and physical condition. Section 6 of the Act bars a person from membership of the board if ""he is incapacitated by a mental or physical disability."" Section 19 contains a similar phrase. The section allows the Board to cancel the registration of a practitioner if he ""is unable to carry out the prescribed practice of TCM for which he is registered safely or effectively by reason of a mental or physical disability."" In this Bill, the phrase ""disability"" is amended to “condition.""",25,734,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00734
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I have two questions relating to this point. One, why does one use ""disability"" while the other use ""condition""? Does the Ministry mean to make a meaningful distinction between the two usages? Two, could the Ministry articulate what would constitute a mental or physical condition, or a mental or physical disability? More specifically, what would be a condition or disability that results in incapacity or inability to carry out safe and effective practice? Is a certifying doctor, Western or TCM, required to weigh in? Who is the final adjudicator on this matter of judgment?",26,735,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00735
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Clarifications on this point, I believe, will provide guidance in future when there is any such dispute.",27,736,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00736
2019-02-11-T-017,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, in conclusion, the Bill is a step in the right direction. It reflects meaningful input solicited through the Ministry's public consultation, and it provides a robust framework with which to regulate a profession that helps manage the health of many Singaporeans. Sir, notwithstanding my clarifications, I stand in support of this Bill.",28,737,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00737
2019-02-11-T-017,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Deputy Speaker, I welcome as it will help to raise the standard of professionalism in this sector and increase public confidence in TCM. Many of our elderly across different ethnic groups have been relying on TCM or a combination of TCM and western medical treatments. TCM has made significant contributions to public healthcare in our multi-racial society. It is also gaining recognition and popularity in the west.",1,738,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00738
2019-02-11-T-017,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"The introduction of compulsory Continuing Professional Education (CPE) hours per year will bring TCM professionals in line with the existing practices for our mainstream medical practitioners. I am convinced that it is also beneficial for the TCM practitioners to be kept updated about the new findings, best practices and latest technologies. These will enable them to make better and more accurate diagnosis and care for their patients better.",2,739,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00739
2019-02-11-T-017,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"I certainly support measures to enhance the Ministry's investigative powers and increase the penalties for errant TCM practitioners. Such a move is necessary for the protection of patients and will also increase the confidence of patients in TCM professionals. The reputation and image of the TCM sector will also be lifted by enhanced professionalism and higher standards as a result. For instances where there had been complaints about negligence or misconduct not directly related to the treatment aspects, will there be an avenue for mediation?",3,740,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00740
2019-02-11-T-017,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Next, I would like to ask the Minister how many complaints have been received so far each year for the past 10 years and whether the rate of such complaints had fallen after the introduction of the registration and certification of TCM. In addition, what efforts have been made to accord the accreditation to ""Tie Da"" physicians?",4,741,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00741
2019-02-11-T-017,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),I would also like to know how many patients have used TCM services each year for the past 10 years. Will MOH also look into the integration of patient records nationally for better assessment and management of patients by both mainstream and TCM medical practitioners?,5,742,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00742
2019-02-11-T-017,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Deputy Speaker, Sir, MOH is working together with top TCM organisations to provide continual training for TCM practitioners, which will benefit both the practitioners and the patients. TCM practitioners will be able to learn the most up-to-date, advanced professional knowledge and medical treatment. By doing so, Singapore can become another world-class regional medical hub.",6,743,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00743

2019-02-11-T-017,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Prof Fatimah asked if subsidies could be offered to TCMPs to defray the costs of attending CPE courses.

2019-02-11-T-017,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Prof Fatimah Lateef also asked whether there could be some flexibility given to the TCMPs during the first two years of implementation of compulsory CPE. Let me first explain that we introduced voluntary CPE some five years ago and have also undertaken extensive consultations with the industry on the implementation of compulsory CPE. Hence, the TCMPs should be familiar with the CPE framework and guidelines on points accumulation.",7,751,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00751

For those with PCs expiring in June this year, their PCs will be renewed until June 2020. This exercise is to align the existing cohort so that the CPE requirement can start at the same time for all existing TCMPs. Between now till June 2020, the Board will engage the TCMPs and CPE course providers to update them on the revised CPE assessment framework. We strongly urge all TCMPs to actively participate in CPE and familiarise themselves with the online CPE system.",9,753,2019-02-11-T-017-S-00753

2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Deputy Speaker, it has been a difficult few weeks for the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). The death of CFC(NS) Aloysius Pang and other servicemen before him has provoked one of the most wide-ranging public debates about National Service in recent memory. As suggested in the title to this Adjournment Motion, I will speak on three distinct but interlinked themes – training safety, operational readiness and the will to fight, before concluding on some areas that MINDEF should consider to improve the safety architecture in the SAF.",1,790,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00790
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"First, training safety. Members would know that the women and men in uniform in the SAF perform tasks that are inherently risky. They operate heavy machinery and weapons in difficult conditions. The work demands that they can function at the physical, psychological and emotional limits of human endurance during both training and operations. The ability to perform under pressure during training can help bolster effectiveness during operations. Hence the time-honoured military saying for soldiers in training, ""The more you sweat in peace, the less you bleed in war"". However, the risky nature of such work demands, particularly for a predominantly conscript army, that extra care and attention be devoted to safety and the management of risks during training.",2,791,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00791
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Human lives are at stake when unnecessarily risky and unauthorised training is carried out in the SAF. Injury and death of personnel during training decrease the operational effectiveness of our military. To the extent that women and men in uniform and the public do not believe that the SAF manages such risk to acceptable levels, there will be negative consequences for morale, performance and the institution of National Service. Therefore, training safety must always be of the utmost importance for MINDEF.",3,792,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00792
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"However, MINDEF's recent message to make and I quote, ""zero-training deaths the norm"" is not only unrealistic but also wishful, considering the inherent risks in training a military force that must be ready to defend the country at a moment's notice or whenever called upon to do so. As a result of the expectations created, every time a training fatality occurs, the public pressure on MINDEF and SAF commanders down the leadership chain takes on a very corrosive edge. This damages not just the SAF, but the institution of National Service too.",4,793,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00793
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In the aftermath of CFC(NS) Pang's passing, MINDEF's narrative has shifted somewhat to, I quote, ""a zero-accident mindset"". NSmen and those who are familiar with the SAF understand what MINDEF wants to achieve when it speaks of striving for zero fatalities – that MINDEF takes safety seriously.",5,794,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00794
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"But the word the public the focuses on is ""zero"", and the end-state of zero accidents or fatalities is a goal that cannot be achieved even in industries with notoriously strict safety standards and compliance requirements like aviation. For example, in October 2015, maintenance engineers did not follow established procedures to insert landing gear pins before troubleshooting a landing gear fault causing a Singapore Airlines A330's nose-wheel to collapse at the boarding gate resulting in multi-million dollars' worth of damage. It was not a minor miracle no fatalities ensued as passengers waited to board the aircraft and a technician stood just metres in front the plane.",6,795,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00795
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Deputy Speaker, no organisation let alone one that is in the business of war and defending Singapore’s sovereignty can realistically promise zero fatalities or training incidents even as the public must insist on the strictest training safety parameters for the SAF, and MINDEF strives for the same.",7,796,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00796
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Second, operational readiness. Like other organisations with a requirement to be operationally ready at a moment’s notice, military personnel must be able to complete their assigned tasks safely and effectively. But, more so than any other type of organisation, militaries like the SAF must also stress discipline and hierarchy. This enables the organisation and its members to become a lethal fighting force that can call upon a whole suite of weapons to kill the enemy and those that seek to do Singapore harm.",8,797,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00797
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To reach such a level of proficiency, training has to be tough and realistic. But tough and realistic training must strike a balance between discipline, hierarchy, risk management and safety, so as to prepare the SAF to be operationally ready for different and difficult circumstances. As much as I support the safety review currently being undertaken by the SAF, it must not lead to a public perception that the SAF has gone soft. While requirements, expectations and the training methodology must adjust to each generation of NSmen and the equipment they operate, the SAF must be mindful not to swing to an extreme where realistic training is compromised.",9,798,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00798
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In this regard, the public response to the death of CFC(NS) Pang has been far from one-way, dominated by doubts cast over MINDEF and the necessity of National Service. It has also prompted a significant counter-perspective – one that is shared by many NSmen, including amongst those who are currently fulfilling or have completed their NS requirements and commitments. They asked  in spite of the training incidents that occur from time to time, can Singaporeans envision a safe and secure Singapore without operationally-ready NSmen and an operationally-ready SAF?",10,799,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00799
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"On the latter point, the recent bilateral spat between Singapore and Malaysia was raised as an example of the possibilities that could be imposed upon Singapore if not for the strong SAF that any potential adversary has to contend with. Many online commentators focused on the Mahathir factor as a reason why the sharp deterrent edge of the SAF represents a central pillar for our existence as a sovereign nation. However, the need for a strong SAF is not personality-specific or for a particular moment in time. It is in fact, far more fundamental.",11,800,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00800
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The key determinant that necessitates a strong SAF is founded in our geopolitical realities. We are a small country of under six million surrounded by much larger neighbours in ASEAN where our two closest neighbours in particular are represented by about 300 million people combined. Putting race, religion and other fault lines aside, we live in a world where larger countries are wont to lord over the small and powerless, throwing laws and legal norms out the window particularly when there is no real price to pay for doing so. Combine this with Singapore’s peculiar circumstances – chief of which is that we are geographically very small – the need for a capable and resolute SAF becomes abundantly clear, regardless who our neighbours are.",12,801,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00801
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In such a context, Singapore’s need for a strong operationally-ready deterrent force that means business and can promise and deliver a bloody nose on any adversary becomes not just acute, but critical. The public must never forget that the institution of National Service which underpins a strong SAF stands at the delivery end of that promise.",13,802,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00802
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Finally, the will to fight. Mr Deputy Speaker the will to fight is an important concept that unites SAF personnel and NSmen, regardless of rank. It embodies our sense of national identity, why we regard Singapore as home and why we will be steadfast and resolute in defending the country. Building up the will to fight in a country which is not ethnically homogenous, generally affluent and where immigration is an important Government policy, is no mean feat and always challenging. It requires constant attention and reflection. As a result of the recent incidents, some of the discussions in the aftermath of CFC(NS) Pang's passing have the potential of damaging the institution of National Service unless MINDEF steps in to decisively address broader misgivings that are simmering in the minds of some Singaporeans.",14,803,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00803
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),Other well-meaning Singaporeans have also asked fundamental questions about National Service. One of the more well-reasoned ones has sought to question why MINDEF cannot evolve to employ an all-regular force. These questions and other similar ones do come up from time to time and it would be important for the MINDEF to establish why such an outcome is or is not realistic.,15,804,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00804
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Some years ago, on the back of a Committee of Supply cut, I proposed that MINDEF publish a detailed defence white paper outlining the strategic imperatives of the SAF. Amongst many useful purposes, such a document could serve as an important reference for all segments of the public, including our neighbouring countries, to appreciate and understand why Singapore needs a strong and world-class military that is able to defend the sovereignty of the country.",16,805,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00805
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Deputy Speaker, doubts about the necessity of National Service weakens not just the very institution but our collective will to fight. More insidiously, the ubiquity and ever-present nature of the online media is such that an adversary can weaken our will to fight without even firing a single shot in anger by identifying the pressure points in our society’s psyche. Undermining public confidence in our citizen army is a ripe and ready strategy an adversary will employ to fulfil its national aims. Should the public lose its confidence in the SAF and support for National Service is undermined, the force over-match that our military currently enjoys will be rendered irrelevant in the face of a divided public. While Singaporeans should never shy away from sharing their views and opinions on matters of public interest even if they are not mainstream, we should not lose our sense of perspective and proportion. In spite of earlier surveys highlighted in this House about the public's support for National Service, the recent spate of training deaths reminds us how the status quo can be shaken very quickly.",17,806,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00806
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To that end, the Minister’s earlier reply to my Parliamentary Question on how the current safety review in the aftermath of CFC(NS) Pang's unfortunate passing is different from earlier ones is to be welcomed.",18,807,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00807
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Nevertheless, it is not possible to rule out the likelihood that there could be a number of shortcomings in the SAF training system that disrupt the balance between safety and operational readiness. Specific areas should be looked into from a fresh perspective.",19,808,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00808
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"One approach MINDEF should consider is stretching the retirement ages of the officer and WOSE corps. Compared to many militaries around the world, there is an argument to be made that our officers, in particular, are made to retire a little too prematurely with many valuable years of experience potentially lost to make more long-lasting and valuable contributions to the organisation. The importance of deep experience for our regular commanders in foreseeing the risks of high-intensity training, mitigating for them and being better prepared to deal with unprecedented mishaps was perhaps put best by Chesley Sullenberger, the captain of the US Airways flight that landed in the Hudson River on 15 January 2009 after a catastrophic bird strike that destroyed both of plane's engines putting 155 lives at risk. Instead of returning his stricken plane the airport, Sullenberger made a decision to ditch the aircraft in the river, a decision that was later extensively scrutinised but proven to be ultimately sound. He said and I quote, ""For 42 years, I've been making small, regular deposits in this bank of experience, education and training. And on January 15, the balance was sufficient so that I could make a very large withdrawal.""",20,809,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00809
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Deputy Speaker, extending the time our senior commanders remain in their command appointments so that they are able to acquire deeper operational knowledge would have positive spin-offs in anticipating and preventing training incidents. In this regard, the SAF should also pay particular emphasis on retaining officers and WOSEs after they retire. It should consider individuals who have previously left active service to take up competitive and well-paying appointments as members of the safety inspectorate or other safety related outfits in the SAF.",21,810,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00810
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"A second area of consideration for MINDEF deals with the point that in the run-up to 2030, the cohort of 18-year olds enlisted for National Service is going to get smaller. With less manpower to execute MINDEF’s mission, machines are likely to become more important with soldiers and troops transiting to more lethal motorised and mechanised platforms with even unmanned platforms becoming a weapon of choice. Such a shift would require a soldier to be familiar with not just soldiering fundamentals but require a mastery of the new weapons and machines under his or her charge. The type of accidents that can occur may also change with risks of electrocution becoming more real than collisions and similar mishaps. This development inevitably points towards more time required for training, live-firing and maintenance-related duties. NSmen may also need more time to re-familiarise themselves with their equipment during ICT and before exercises with more oversight from safety coordinators and training facilitators – something the NS training system would have to accommodate. To this end, the SAF may have to throttle back on non-core, non-training related duties, and even national ones to focus more squarely on its core mission.",22,811,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00811
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"A final area of review must include a change in tone and culture towards safety and this must begin at the very top. From a legislative perspective, a qualitative way to facilitate this must include a review of the Government's position on section 14 of the Government Proceedings Act. The argument that removing the right of a soldier to sue MINDEF would weaken the SAF or cause commanders to hesitate to push their troops must be broadly reconsidered against armies which have removed similar laws.",23,812,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00812
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The UK for example has done so, and their military is not just involved in peacetime training, but significant combat operations. To drive home the centrality of safety for the SAF's peacetime mission, there is room for the Government to inject greater accountability into its protocols and processes by creating a specific carve-out for wilful disregard of safety factors under section 14 of the Government Proceedings Act. Such an exception would cease to extend immunity to MINDEF or to a negligent commander in the event of an egregious breach of safety.",24,813,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00813

Minister responded by suggesting that the removal of immunity may compromise training and prejudice commanders who, for example push their soldiers to complete IPPT or strive for higher performance.",25,814,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00814
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To address such legitimate concerns, a possible exception to Section 14 on the grounds of training safety would only apply if a commander behaves recklessly, maliciously or displays a wilful disregard for safety considerations. For example, if a commander had deliberately chosen to cancel a safety briefing, disregarded training safety regulations, had not catered for sufficient rest before or between training and missions without adequate reason or risk mitigation approved beforehand by a more senior commander, then the blanket immunity provided under section 14 should not apply. It would follow that a court of law should be left to determine whether MINDEF or the commander in question must be held liable.",26,815,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00815
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In many ways, Mr Deputy Speaker, such a legislative change would represent an important bellwether for the evolution of training safety management in the SAF more than 50 years after the introduction of National Service. But the significance of this proposal to tweak section 14 of the Government Proceedings Act does not lie in the fact that MINDEF or and any irresponsible commander can be sued. Paradoxically in fact, such a change – legislatively determined – would serve to protect the institution of National Service by making it more accountable instead of undermining it. It would buttress public confidence in the importance of National Service, why safety is critical, and the lengths MINDEF and any Government of the day would go to protect the institution, even if it means putting MINDEF's own reputation and that of its commanders on the line. In doing so, MINDEF would send a clear and unambiguous message – which the buck stops at the top.",27,816,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00816
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To conclude, Mr Deputy Speaker, whenever any soldier falls, we all feel a collective pain, for a life that holds so much hope and promise. We also share in the loss of their family members who live with the grief and regret of losing a son or daughter in peacetime and in service of the nation. But the question in the wake of the training deaths experienced by the SAF over the last 17 months and the years before that, is whether this House can assure mothers, fathers, husbands, wives and loved ones that SAF personnel will be safe when they enlist for National Service, when they are called up for ICT or when they serve the SAF. The answer must be an unequivocal yes.",28,817,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00817
2019-02-11-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"As a core value of the SAF, there should be no doubt that the SAF takes this safety seriously precisely because we are a largely conscripted force. There are potential safety gaps that need to be considered and improvements which need to be made. I hope that these can be swiftly and thoughtfully instituted with the professionalism the SAF is known for, so that Singaporeans can rest easy knowing our military women and men are operationally-ready to keep Singapore safe and secure at all times. Thank you.",29,818,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00818

2019-02-11-T-019,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Let me thank Mr Pritam Singh for his comments in the Adjournment Motion. As Adjournment Motions go, you reflect on them and you cannot answer every point in the 10 minutes that you are allocated. I am sure that if the House wants us to debate the various points that he has brought up, I think we can find other fora to do so.",1,820,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00820
2019-02-11-T-019,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"But let me start from where we agree, and it is very gratifying. We agree that National Service is crucial. We agree that without the NS and without the SAF, we cannot defend ourselves; that after 52 years, we are in a much better position of being able to defend our sovereignty and that we have come a long way.",2,821,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00821
2019-02-11-T-019,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"We also agree that we want to make training for national Servicemen as safe as possible. And as Mr Singh himself says, assure every mother, assure every parent, that their son will go back to them safe in the two years of NSF and in-camp trainings.",3,822,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00822
2019-02-11-T-019,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"How to achieve this? There may be some disagreement or differences. Mr Singh says ""don't aim for zero fatalities"" – that is a goal too high. You set too high expectations. And he is right in a way. But which mother shall we say can lose your son?",4,823,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00823
2019-02-11-T-019,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"I came to that view that we should aim for zero fatalities from the experiences of our own commanders. And I share with you a very good speech by previous Chief of Defence Force (CDF) Bey Soon Khiang, because when it comes to running an operation, you have to listen to your commanders, you have to see what they can do.",5,824,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00824
2019-02-11-T-019,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"So, this was a speech that Lieutenant-General (Retired) Bey Soon Khiang who was RSAF's Chief of Air Force (CAF) and then CDF gave at a safety symposium last year. I quote from him, ""So you take a look at the RSAF's mishap data in our early years, the picture is a sombre one. For the first 20 years from 1970 to 1990, we lost in terms of fighter numbers, almost the same number as our entire F-16 fleet today. For comparison, the RSAF has operated the F-16 C/Ds for more than 20 years now from about 1996/1997, and we have lost two. And the last loss occurred more than 10 years ago.""",6,825,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00825
2019-02-11-T-019,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"That is a stark difference. Just pause to think. For the first 20 years, we lost in terms of fighter numbers, almost the same number as our entire F-16 fleet today. He went on to say, ""Most significantly to me as a commander, such accidents also sapped the morale of the people unnecessarily. Each time we attended the funerals of fellow pilots and servicemen, seeing the grief of their loved ones was an emotional trauma. As a commander trying to explain to the family of the lost pilot why it happened, why they are going to continue with life without a husband or a son, grow up without a father, was most difficult. As Chief of Air Force then, I felt that I had failed to take care of my men. To me, they reported to work every day to train for war and I had failed in my duty to ensure that they trained safely so that they could return to their loved ones every day. So this, he says, ""was how Zero Accidents started.""",7,826,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00826
2019-02-11-T-019,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"""I started asking myself questions"", he continues, ""back to the basics. I asked myself  have we lost sight of the overall mission to deter? Each accident erodes deterrence. If we cannot be safe, how does it reflect on our capability? If our own Singaporeans have low confidence in the RSAF"", and in this case, RSN or even the Army, ""how can we even be a deterrent? If the RSAF is critical in the defence of Singapore, which lacks strategic depth, the situation is surely unacceptable, for before we started fighting the war, we had already lost 50 fighters. So, our peacetime exchange ratio must look quite bad. At the individual level, the whole idea of training in peacetime is to deter and when deterrence fails, be there on the first wave. But you will not be there if you kill yourself during training. Then, the training is in vain.""",8,827,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00827
2019-02-11-T-019,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Zero fatality is a very difficult target, and as Mr Pritam Singh said, may be impossible. But we have to aim for it. And as our own experience shows, in some years, we will be able to achieve it. Can anyone guarantee that there will be zero fatalities for the rest of our future? Surely not. But that zero fatality goal sears into the consciousness of every commander and every soldier that to get there, you better be careful about what you are doing, that safety lapses will not be tolerated, that it will be safety first, because, at the end of the day, I want to train you and want you to be alive to be able to fight when Singapore needs you.",9,828,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00828
2019-02-11-T-019,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Mr Singh says, ""Well, you can get the same outcome. Just allow the people to sue the Government including MINDEF."" That is a very tangential argument and misses the point. There is accountability for commanders who make a mistake. I do not need for those who want to sue the Government to do so before the commanders are held accountable. I have told you many times, and we have taken commanders or national servicemen who had been derelict, who had not done their duty, to criminal prosecution, not just civilian payouts in the courts. They go to jail. Their lives in that sense and careers are ruined; and justly so, if they deserve it.",10,829,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00829
2019-02-11-T-019,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"So, let us get back to basics. Mr Singh says, ""Oh, don't be afraid of MINDEF's reputation."" I am not afraid of MINDEF's reputation. I am more concerned about individual lives, about how our commanders, at any given moment of time, watch for the safety of their national servicemen, of their people under their charge, and yet, at the same time, conduct realistic training.",11,830,2019-02-11-T-019-S-00830
2019-02-11-T-019,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"I think this is the right way to go. I think there will be no easy shortcuts.

2019-02-11-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Asatizah Recognition Scheme, or ARS, requires all Muslim religious teachers, or asatizah, to abide by a Code of Ethics. This includes not encouraging extremism or violence, denigrating other racial and religious groups, committing ethical misconduct and promoting segregationist practices. The Asatizah Recognition Board, or ARB, oversees the ARS, supported by the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore, or MUIS.

2019-02-11-T-021,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Over the years, many Singapore companies have invested in China to ride on its growth. Singapore companies have invested across a diverse range of sectors, from manufacturing to real estate, wholesale and retail trade, to financial and insurance services. The easing of China’s economic growth has been a gradual one, and companies would have carefully made their business calculations and projections accordingly.",1,842,2019-02-11-T-021-S-00842
2019-02-11-T-021,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In our conversations with companies, there is recognition that China's economy is maturing. This includes shifting from an export-led and investment-oriented growth model towards one that is driven by domestic consumption. From rapid growth of 10.6% in 2010, growth has eased in the intervening years to 6.6% in 2018, and the IMF has projected China's 2019 GDP growth to be 6.2% as investment growth moderates and some domestic deleveraging continues. There are also uncertainties in the outlook arising from unresolved United States-China trade tensions, but the Chinese government has made clear its preparedness to bolster domestic demand.",2,843,2019-02-11-T-021-S-00843
2019-02-11-T-021,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Amidst the headwinds facing the Chinese economy, there remain opportunities as China continues to liberalise and pursue its provincial-regional strategies such as the integrated development of mega-regions like the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and Yangtze River Delta. Provinces and municipalities like Guangdong, Jiangsu and Shanghai have maintained growth rates on par with or above China's national average last year.1",3,844,2019-02-11-T-021-S-00844
2019-02-11-T-021,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"To support Singapore companies’ investments in China, Singapore has established a network of provincial business councils in Guangdong, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Tianjin, Shandong, Sichuan and Zhejiang over the years.

2019-02-11-T-022,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Generally, there is no prohibition against the resale of goods and services, including concerts and sports events tickets, subject to the terms and conditions of the original seller. The margin which resellers can command is freely determined between willing buyers and sellers. This means that the resale price can end up being higher or lower than the original price.",1,848,2019-02-11-T-022-S-00848
2019-02-11-T-022,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Government should not prescribe profit margins for ticket resales. We encourage consumers to take steps to protect themselves before making their purchases. Consumers who are purchasing tickets of concerts and sports events can, for example, check the terms and conditions of such tickets carefully before making their purchases, and compare the resale price with the original price of the tickets. If consumers are unsure about the legitimacy of the tickets they are about to buy, they should approach the official event organisers for verification to avoid paying for a ticket which may be subsequently voided by event organisers.",2,849,2019-02-11-T-022-S-00849
2019-02-11-T-022,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"If consumers have reason to believe that suppliers have engaged in unfair trading practices in the sale of tickets, for example, false and misleading claims, they can approach the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) with details of these practices for CASE to assist them in seeking redress from the suppliers. The Competition and Consumer Commission is also empowered with investigation and enforcement powers under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act to take action against errant suppliers who persist in unfair trading practices.

2019-02-11-T-025,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"On average, each school has a team of one SC, and one to two AEDs(LBS). Some schools have an additional SWO to support students with irregular attendance. AEDs have been a great help in supporting socio-emotional, counselling, and special educational needs (SEN) of our students. In terms of training and resources, all our SCs are trained in the Diploma in School Counselling or Masters in Counselling, and all our AEDs(LBS) undergo the Diploma in Special Education training.",2,861,2019-02-11-T-025-S-00861

2019-02-11-T-026,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"It is difficult for schools and teachers to get deeply involved in family matters. Hence, schools will generally work on the basis that both parents are entitled to receive information in respect of a student; that any decision conveyed by one parent reflects the views held by both parents; and any school information sent home with the student or given to one parent at school, would be communicated to both parents.",1,867,2019-02-11-T-026-S-00867
2019-02-11-T-026,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"If schools find out that a student's parents are undergoing divorce or have already divorced, their key consideration will be the child’s well-being and best interests. Disagreements or disputes between parents can impact their child's emotional state and, thus, his or her ability to learn in school. Therefore, schools will usually encourage parents to set aside their personal differences and work towards a compromise or consensus. Where schools are made aware of any court orders made in respect of a student, such orders will be taken into account in subsequent engagements with the respective parents.",2,868,2019-02-11-T-026-S-00868
2019-02-11-T-026,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Parents Gateway is a mobile application that was officially launched at the start of this year as part of MOE's on-going efforts to support our schools in their communication and engagement efforts with parents on their children's educational journey. Its design is also consistent with the approach I had stated earlier.,3,869,2019-02-11-T-026-S-00869
2019-02-11-T-026,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I am not sure that a set of rigid rules or protocols is the best way forward because every child from a broken family is surrounded by unique circumstances, and oftentimes educators will find themselves caught between parents, grandparents and other relatives. Educators will have to exercise judgement and manage each case sensibly and carefully. By abiding to the approach I mentioned, and with experience and support from their fraternity, educators will become better at handling these issues with time.",4,870,2019-02-11-T-026-S-00870

The Home Team Career Transition Office also organises regular career advisory sessions for officers to network with potential employers. Officers are provided with time-off and subsidies to attend training to enhance their employability, and to participate in employer attachment programmes. Through these efforts, some Prison officers have successfully secured second careers within and outside the Home Team, such as the Industrial and Services Cooperative Society, halfway houses and in the healthcare and social service sectors.",2,873,2019-02-11-T-027-S-00873

To support them, we have a SPED Financial Assistance Scheme, which covers school fees, textbooks, uniforms and transport subsidies. Students on the scheme SPED FAS also qualify for the School Meals Programme, which subsidises the cost of meals in school.

2019-02-11-T-038,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry will mandate developers, building owners and HDB to provide enclosed smoking rooms or pavilions in a precinct/HDB cluster, similar to what is provided in some airports and Japan, for smokers to smoke within the room and ensure that the smoke will not get into common areas affecting non-smokers.",1,929,2019-02-11-T-038-S-00929
2019-02-11-T-038,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Smoking facilities such as smoking rooms and pavilions cannot completely eliminate the risks of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke. Tobacco smoke contains pollutants that can seep out of these facilities.,1,930,2019-02-11-T-038-S-00930
2019-02-11-T-038,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Smoking facilities are also likely to become congregation points for smokers. As our housing estates are well-connected and densely built-up, it may be challenging to find appropriate locations for such facilities. Moreover, the daily sight of smokers gathering at smoking facilities could inadvertently give our youth the impression that it is normal to smoke. We want to avoid this, and therefore have no plans to mandate the provision of smoking facilities in residential precincts or housing clusters.",2,931,2019-02-11-T-038-S-00931
2019-02-11-T-038,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Our approach to protecting residents from second-hand smoke has been to progressively extend the smoking prohibition to as many public areas as possible. Within housing estates, these include places such as sheltered walkways, exercise areas, playgrounds, and common areas of residential buildings such as void decks and lift lobbies. The National Environment Agency will continue to monitor and enforce against smoking violations at these locations.",3,932,2019-02-11-T-038-S-00932

2019-02-11-T-039,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Nuisance issues at hawker centres relating to pigeons and crows arise when birds are attracted to food remnants. To address this, government agencies such as the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA) and National Environment Agency (NEA) work closely with hawkers, Hawker Associations, and Town Councils to implement preventive measures. These include public education and enforcement against pigeon feeding and littering, proper food waste management, and surveillance and bird management operations.",1,936,2019-02-11-T-039-S-00936

These include the installation of bird spikes on building structures and beams to reduce perching opportunities, and nettings at the perimeter of hawker centres to prevent birds from entering. We will continue to work closely with stakeholders to manage bird nuisance issues. Hawker Associations which face difficulties with bird nuisance issues may approach NEA for support.",2,937,2019-02-11-T-039-S-00937

This allows them to pay a smaller COE premium at the point of renewal. Vehicle owners are informed that the condition for the five-year renewal is that these vehicles must be deregistered at the end of five years, and no further renewals will be allowed.

Today nine in ten Singaporean households can watch DTV, either over the air or through their Pay TV subscriptions.

We had to reach out to more than 540,000 households to migrate them to DTV, and work with Mediacorp to install a nation-wide DTV broadcasting network. The smooth migration was made possible by an intensive outreach campaign led by IMDA, which helped 416,000 households, or 77% of eligible households, to switch over to DTV through the DTV Starter Kit programme launched in April last year. I would also like to thank agencies, grassroots advisors and the more than 2,000 volunteers for helping us through this exercise.",2,960,2019-02-11-T-044-S-00960

2019-02-11-T-055,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Third, we have been providing greater support to those with greater healthcare needs.

2019-02-11-T-056,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Health in light of more skin cancer patients under the age of 50 (a) what is being done to protect soldiers and students exposed to long hours under the sun; and (b) whether there are studies done to monitor these groups of persons as they advance to their 30s and 40s and who may fall victim to skin cancer because of their exposure to ultraviolet light.,1,1009,2019-02-11-T-056-S-01009
2019-02-11-T-056,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Skin cancer was the 9th most common cancer among Singaporeans from 2013-2017. 10% of cases were below 50 years old, although the incidence of new cases in this group increased from 1.2 to 2.7 per 100,000 persons from 1983-1987 to 2013-2017 respectively.",1,1010,2019-02-11-T-056-S-01010
2019-02-11-T-056,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Studies have linked cumulative exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light with an increased risk of skin cancer. However, exposure to sunlight has health benefits as it is important for Vitamin D formation and hence for healthy bone formation. Sufficient time outdoors can also help prevent or delay myopia in children.",2,1011,2019-02-11-T-056-S-01011
2019-02-11-T-056,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Singapore Armed Forces soldiers are provided with Personal Protective Equipment, such as head gear and long-sleeved combat uniform, that protects them from sun exposure.

2019-02-11-T-061,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Under the first scenario, the Withdrawal Agreement will include an ""Implementation Period"" that will last till 31 December 2020. This scenario offers the greatest predictability and stability while minimising disruption to businesses. This is because during the Implementation Period, the UK will continue to be functionally treated as an EU Member State, and remain a party to EU international agreements – including the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (EUSFTA) when it is ratified by the European Parliament as targeted in 2019.",3,1033,2019-02-11-T-061-S-01033

This would mean that the EUSFTA will not apply between the UK and Singapore even after its entry into force. This in itself would not impact our trading relationship with the UK as the current tariff and non-tariff regime for Singapore companies trading with the UK are based on WTO terms which would continue to apply.",4,1034,2019-02-11-T-061-S-01034
2019-02-11-T-061,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Under the third scenario, the UK's formal departure from the EU will be postponed to a date after 29 March 2019.

The prospect of an imminent no-deal Brexit would be diminished, although we may see a period of continued uncertainty.",5,1035,2019-02-11-T-061-S-01035
2019-02-11-T-061,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Singapore and the UK share substantial trade and investment linkages, with many of our businesses operating in each other's markets across sectors such as pharmaceuticals, professional services and consumer goods. MTI's assessment is that trade between the UK and Singapore will not be fundamentally impaired. Nonetheless, owing to the integrated nature of today's global supply chains as well as the extensive trade linkages that spans the UK, EU, and the rest of the world, a no-deal Brexit could weigh on consumer and business sentiments in the UK and EU, with potential negative effects on global growth.",6,1036,2019-02-11-T-061-S-01036

2019-02-11-T-062,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Insofar as there are underlying factors that affect both the public and private property markets, the two indices would tend to move together. But there have been instances of divergence in the PPI and RPI price trends. This has happened in the past, and more recently between 2Q2017 and 3Q2018. The recent divergence was largely due to euphoric sentiments in the private property market. This resulted in a sharp increase in private property prices over a very short duration. This was not sustainable as prices were increasing well ahead of fundamentals. Hence the government had moved to introduce the last round of cooling measures in July last year.",2,1042,2019-02-11-T-062-S-01042

The objective is to ensure that these individuals or families receive comprehensive help. For example, where there are families with complex needs that require interfaces with multiple agencies, SSOs can step in to facilitate discussions or convene case conferences where needed.
