2019-02-12-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health and Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Prime Minister),"Members will agree that Singapore’s politics must be for Singaporeans alone to decide. Worryingly, however, the Internet and social media have created a new, vast and easy playing field for foreign interference. Among others, we have read about foreign interference in the politics of the United States, United Kingdom, Ukraine, Australia, France, Germany, the Netherlands and New Zealand. Clandestine and sophisticated tactics were used to fracture social cohesion and influence election outcomes, through the spread of disinformation and half-truths, and exploitation of sensitive issues.",2,15,2019-02-12-T-002-S-00015
2019-02-12-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health and Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Prime Minister),"In the US, indictments by Special Counsel Robert Mueller lay out how a foreign hostile information campaign systematically and surreptitiously sought to influence the outcome of the 2016 Presidential Elections. More than two years before Election Day, a foreign organisation had started infiltrating American society. They used fake social media accounts pretending to be real Americans, and created social media groups on controversial issues likely to engage Americans. These accounts and groups gained influence over time, attracting thousands of real American followers. Social media posts by such fake foreign accounts even found their way into American mainstream media.",3,16,2019-02-12-T-002-S-00016
2019-02-12-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health and Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Prime Minister),"The foreign actor was sophisticated in its approach. It had researched the fault lines in American society and politics, and drove wedges along these lines. Its social media accounts spread falsehoods and false narratives on divisive socio-political issues such as race, LGBT rights, gun control and immigration.",4,17,2019-02-12-T-002-S-00017
2019-02-12-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health and Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Prime Minister),"The foreign actor used bots and digital advertisements to amplify its reach and viewpoints rapidly, to give the impression that they were popular. This built a false sense of reality  Americans felt that their views and concerns were echoed by others, without realising that much of the support was artificially generated by fake accounts.",5,18,2019-02-12-T-002-S-00018
2019-02-12-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health and Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Prime Minister),"Researchers later found evidence that the foreign actor had targeted hotly contested states such as Wisconsin, Virginia and Pennsylvania, through Facebook advertising campaigns on divisive issues. For example, voters in Wisconsin saw more paid ads on guns and race issues, because these issues held more sway with them. Those with household incomes of less than US$40,000 saw more paid ads on the issues of immigration and race. The campaigns riled up anger and fear, and deepened divisions in the society.",6,19,2019-02-12-T-002-S-00019
2019-02-12-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health and Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Prime Minister),"The reach was huge. Over two years, about 126 million US Facebook users were exposed to content generated by this foreign operation. Americans were also deceived to believe that they were part of spontaneous local movements, when they were in fact being manipulated by a foreign actor. In one instance, the foreign organisation cultivated two ideologically opposed fake Facebook accounts, the “United Muslims of America” and the “Heart of Texas”, and organised a protest and counter-protest at the same place and time to orchestrate discord on the streets. Real Americans in both camps turned up and demonstrated in opposition to each other. One man even brought a rifle.",7,20,2019-02-12-T-002-S-00020

Its longer term objective was to undermine America’s institutions and democracy. The campaign polarised, and generated deep suspicion within American society and against its institutions.",8,21,2019-02-12-T-002-S-00021
2019-02-12-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health and Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Prime Minister),"We saw a similar pattern of interference in the UK referendum on Brexit. Falsehoods on social media, bots and fake accounts were similarly key tools of foreign interference. Grievances over immigration and a growing sense of disenfranchisement, were exploited to turn the British people against UK and EU institutions and policies. A steady stream of anti-immigration falsehoods by foreign-linked social media accounts made people feel threatened, and built a narrative of a British government that was failing to protect its citizens. There is also research suggesting that more than 150,000 foreign-linked accounts tweeted over 45,000 pro-Brexit messages in the last 48 hours of the campaign.",9,22,2019-02-12-T-002-S-00022

Just two days before the second round of voting, nine gigabytes of data hacked from presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron’s campaign were leaked online. In just three and a half hours, the leak was tweeted 47,000 times, with some suspicious Twitter accounts, likely bots in action, posting more than 150 tweets per hour.",10,23,2019-02-12-T-002-S-00023

The same year in Germany, a hostile information campaign built upon a fabricated story about a German girl being raped by Arab migrants stirred up anti-immigrant sentiments, sparked demonstrations, and eroded public confidence in the German government’s immigration and asylum policy.",11,24,2019-02-12-T-002-S-00024
2019-02-12-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health and Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Prime Minister),"Perhaps the starkest lesson comes from Ukraine. At the hearings of the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods, Ukrainian experts shared their country’s experience. Disinformation about the Ukrainian government was spread through foreign media channels and social networks. It created the impetus for armed conflict and weakened the resolve of Ukrainians to fight. It eroded trust among Ukrainians in their public institutions. The experts highlighted their country’s experience as a cautionary tale, a threat that countries ignore at their peril.",12,25,2019-02-12-T-002-S-00025

2019-02-12-T-002,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines),"I thank the Senior Minister of State. I have two supplementary questions. The first is, have there been instances of foreign interference in Singapore? Earlier, the Senior Minister of State mentioned that Australia implemented some laws in June 2018. What are the gaps in our existing laws and whether new laws will be introduced to address foreign interference?",1,39,2019-02-12-T-002-S-00039
2019-02-12-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Speaker, foreign interference has had a long history in Singapore. In the 1970s, the Government took two newspapers to task – The Singapore Herald and The Eastern Sun – for taking foreign money and then attempting to undermine the Government. There have been and will always continue to be countries with an interest in interfering in Singapore's affairs and swaying public opinion amongst us and against us.",1,40,2019-02-12-T-002-S-00040
2019-02-12-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"More recently, Members may recall the case of Huang Jing, a Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy academic who the Government identified as an agent of influence, acting on behalf of a foreign country. He was expelled in August 2017 and had his Permanent Residency annulled. He had knowingly interacted and cooperated with intelligence organisations and agents of a foreign country to influence Singapore's foreign policy and public opinion. He had done so by engaging prominent and influential Singaporeans, and giving them what he claimed was privileged information about the foreign country so as to influence their opinions in favour of that said country. Huang also recruited others in aid of his operations.",2,41,2019-02-12-T-002-S-00041
2019-02-12-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Members will also recall the SingHealth hacking incident last year, essentially an attempt to extract health information of Singaporeans, with the Prime Minister the specific target. The Minister for Communications and Information had stated that this was the work of an advanced persistent threat group, cyber-attackers who are typically state-linked. These are not casual hackers or criminal gangs. Cyber hackings are often deployed in concert with hostile information campaigns to search for information that can be weaponised.",3,42,2019-02-12-T-002-S-00042
2019-02-12-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Testimony before the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods also showed indication of information warfare being carried out against Singapore, including the use of news articles and social media to influence the minds of segments of the Singapore population.",4,43,2019-02-12-T-002-S-00043
2019-02-12-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Foreign interference is not always easy to detect or attribute. In December last year, when bilateral issues with our immediate neighbour were at the top of the news, we noticed that a curious spike in online comments on social media made from avatar accounts – essentially anonymous accounts with profile pictures that do not show the owner's face. Many of these comments were critical of Singapore. On one such issue, jams at land checkpoints. Around 40% of the comments on alternative media outlets' pages on social media came from avatar accounts. We do not know who these suspicious accounts belong to nor do we know if they are being coordinated by foreign actors. But it is clear that these accounts had sought to give and create an artificial impression to netizens of the opposition to Singapore's position, at a time of heightened bilateral difficulties.",5,44,2019-02-12-T-002-S-00044
2019-02-12-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"That is not the only issue or instance. In such instances, it is imperative that we have the ability to identify where these accounts come from and indeed, if they are real. In our daily operations, our security agencies take it as a working assumption that we must be careful of the threat of foreign interference. The overseas examples that I have alluded to attest to this threat. But it is not convenient – for national security reasons – for me to enumerate all of these examples. Suffice to say that these threats are real, we are a target, and we must be vigilant.",6,45,2019-02-12-T-002-S-00045
2019-02-12-T-002,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"And on that score and Miss Cheng's second question, the Select Committee had recommended that the Government consider measures to address both deliberate online falsehoods and also state-sponsored campaigns that threaten our national security.

2019-02-12-T-003,S Iswaran,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mr S Iswaran),"Mr Speaker, the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) came into force in 2012. With the gathering pace of digitalisation, we recognised the need to strengthen data protection in the private sector. The PDPA establishes a baseline standard for data protection in the private sector, balanced against its need to use personal data for reasonable purposes.",1,48,2019-02-12-T-003-S-00048
2019-02-12-T-003,S Iswaran,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mr S Iswaran),"On its part, the Government has always taken seriously its responsibility to protect the data entrusted to the public sector and we continue to strengthen our data governance policies. Since 2001, the Government Instruction Manuals already include measures to govern the use, retention, sharing and security of personal data among public agencies.",2,49,2019-02-12-T-003-S-00049
2019-02-12-T-003,S Iswaran,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mr S Iswaran),"In 2018, the Public Sector (Governance) Act (PSGA) was introduced and it provided for additional safeguards for personal data in the public sector, including criminalising the misuse of data by public servants. The data protection standards in the PSGA are also aligned with the PDPA. In addition, data collected by the public sector is also protected by specific legislation such as the Official Secrets Act, the Income Tax Act, the Infectious Diseases Act and the Statistics Act. Collectively, these laws impose a high standard of responsibility on all public agencies, with additional requirements for the protection of sensitive or confidential data. Also, regular, mandatory audits are conducted to ensure that public agencies comply with the standards for data protection and the security of ICT systems.",3,50,2019-02-12-T-003-S-00050
2019-02-12-T-003,S Iswaran,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mr S Iswaran),"The PSGA allows personal data to be managed as a common resource within the public sector for better policy making and also for more responsive public services. For example, when a Singaporean applies for financial assistance at a Social Service Office, the frontline officers are able to quickly evaluate his or her eligibility for financial assistance because they have access to data from other relevant agencies. In this way, we minimise the documents that need to be submitted by the applicant and improve the delivery of public services. In contrast, each private sector organisation is expected to be individually accountable for the personal data in its possession, and there is no expectation of a similar integrated delivery of services across different commercial organisations.",4,51,2019-02-12-T-003-S-00051
2019-02-12-T-003,S Iswaran,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mr S Iswaran),"Because of these important differences, we need and have adopted different approaches to the protection of personal data in the public and in the private sectors. That is also why the PDPA applies only to the private sector, while the PSGA and other legislation govern data protection in the public sector. We will regularly review the PDPA, the PSGA and other legislation to ensure that they remain relevant and effective in safeguarding personal data in both the public and private sectors.",5,52,2019-02-12-T-003-S-00052
2019-02-12-T-003,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I have four supplementary questions for the Minister. The first question is, I acknowledge that the various statutes and the Instruction Manuals, as he mentioned, do set out standards for the Public Service to comply with. Does Minister agree however that these instruments, legislation or IMs are usually silent or weak on the recourse that citizens may have if there is a data breach. They may be strong on penalties for errant officers but generally we get silences on the rights of citizens.",1,53,2019-02-12-T-003-S-00053
2019-02-12-T-003,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Secondly, does the Minister also agree that for the PDPA itself, one of the, I suppose, advantages or assets of the PDPA is its approach to try to balance the need of organisations to collect data, and at the same time, if you look at section 3, it also recognises that personal data belongs to individuals and individuals have a right to protect that data.",2,54,2019-02-12-T-003-S-00054
2019-02-12-T-003,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The third question is, we talked recently about the SingHealth incident. Does Minister agree, because SingHealth is a body that comes within the purview of the PDPA, it is not a Public Agency as defined in the Act, and the SingHealth cyber-attack case has shown that the PDPA commission can actually play a very useful role as far as the public is concerned. The Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC)'s judgement in the cyber-attack case mentioned that members of the public complained to it, that their data had not been adequately protected by SingHealth. PDPC actually made some findings which were likely lead to improvements on the part of SingHealth and Integrated Healthcare Information Systems (IHiS) as well.",3,55,2019-02-12-T-003-S-00055
2019-02-12-T-003,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Perhaps the last question for now is that, one of the things that the PDPA does provide is a complaints procedure which I would like the Minister to confirm that this is something that is very useful to the citizens, which does not force the citizens to commence a lawsuit against a Government agency should one suffer damage and so on. So, these are very real advantages of the PDPA which I believe citizens can benefit from.",4,56,2019-02-12-T-003-S-00056

I think the key conclusion we have to draw is this  when we say exempt and that is the language that the Member has used in her question, that the public sector is exempt from the PDPA, that does not mean that the public sector is somehow subject to a different or lower standard as might be implied in terms of data security and safety. In fact, and that was the thrust of my reply, that one, the public sector and the PSGA, in particular, takes reference and it is in broad alignment with the PDPA. But having said that, there is a clear recognition, that the mode of operation and the expectation of how data is used in order to provide an effective and efficient Public Service, implies that we do need a different methodology in the way we govern public sector data governance. That is why we have this differentiated approach. In addition to the PSGA, as I had said, we do have other legislations in placed.",2,58,2019-02-12-T-003-S-00058
2019-02-12-T-003,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Just for Members' information, we are by no means alone in this approach. The Canadians, for example, at the federal level, also have different laws in terms of its application to the private sectors and its application to the public sector. So, it is not about differing standards or somehow having a different threshold when it comes to the public sector. In fact, we subject the public sector to the same kind of standards, if not higher standards. Precisely because, we know that the data that is being entrusted to the public sector is done with the confidence that it would be dealt with in a secure manner.",3,59,2019-02-12-T-003-S-00059
2019-02-12-T-003,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, many of the questions that the Member has raised pertain more to whether there are elements of the PDPA, for example, there is a complaints procedure where they can complain to the PDPC, and for example the right to data. I think the Member made the point that the PDPA strikes the balance between the right to data of the individual versus the right to use the data of the enterprises. And indeed, that is the balance we are trying to strike, whether it is in the public domain or in the private domain. Because essentially, you can say the same sets of considerations apply in the public sector – that we want to ensure individual data is protected, accorded due safeguards, but at the same time, it should be a common resource that public sector agencies can tap in order to better serve citizens. Many of the services that we take quite for granted today actually rely on that backend sharing. So, when it comes to a complaints procedure today, there is nothing stopping an individual who feels aggrieved that their data has somehow been mishandled to launch a complaint. And they have different channels for doing so.",4,60,2019-02-12-T-003-S-00060
2019-02-12-T-003,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"And on the SingHealth piece, the Member made the point that the PDPC came out with the recommendations and so on, which were very useful and so on. But, actually, if you look at the morphology of the entire incident, the key recommendations that came out of this was actually from the Committee of Inquiry (COI) which the Government established. That is the process through which we derived a whole set of very detailed recommendations. What the PDPC did, because it received the complaint early in the process, was to say that it will take reference from the COI's process in determining whether there was a breach by the relevant agencies, in this case SingHealth and IHiS, and if so, what penalty should be meted out. But the substantial portion of the recommendations were actually made through the COI process which was, in fact, initiated by the Government not mandated by any legislation but something that was because of the judgement that was exercised.",5,61,2019-02-12-T-003-S-00061
2019-02-12-T-003,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The point on recourse comes back to the same thing again. If a member of the public feels that in some way, their data has been mishandled, then they have every opportunity to lodge a complaint with the Minister, the Ministry, the relevant department and action will be taken. And you can also, if you think, a crime has been committed, make a Police report, and that will also be investigated.",6,62,2019-02-12-T-003-S-00062
2019-02-12-T-003,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, if I can summarise, we subject our public sector to the same, if not higher, rigorous standards of data governance. And we have to do that, because if we do not, then a lot of our other efforts, in terms of wanting to build a Smart Nation and delivering, harnessing the digital technologies and all these in order to deliver better public services will all be thwarted. So, that is exactly why we take this very seriously. By and large, the PSGA, in other words, the legislation that governs the public sector data governance, takes reference from the PDPA and we also have other legislation for specific sectoral matters which can also be implied in addition.",7,63,2019-02-12-T-003-S-00063
2019-02-12-T-003,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Two supplementary questions for the Minister. First, the Minister in his answer earlier, he mentioned that for members of the public who are aggrieved that their information has been mishandled by a public agency, they can always make a complaint. The question is to who. And the Minister mentioned that it could be to the Minister. Does he not agree that the PDPC itself, which is focused on public data protection or rather personal data protection, should have a role to receive such complaints because they are after all the domain expert on personal data protection.",1,64,2019-02-12-T-003-S-00064
2019-02-12-T-003,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"The second supplementary question is, Minister mentioned the issue of public sector agencies being interconnected and therefore there needs to be a different approach, but I think the SingHealth incident also illustrates some artificiality in what is actually happening in the healthcare sector. If we look at the setup of SingHealth, for example, no doubt it is not under the definition of public agency under the PDPA, but the fact is that it is very connected to MOH. In fact, it is owned by MOH Holdings, and there is a frequent, I believe, exchange of data between such healthcare bodies and the parent Ministry. So, it would come to a stage, does Minister not agree that, if my data is given to a clinic, for example, under a cluster, I may be able to complain to the PDPC; but once that data goes to the Ministry and the breach happens there, I do not have recourse under the PDPC. So, there is some artificiality in the distinction as far as the healthcare sector is concerned.",2,65,2019-02-12-T-003-S-00065
2019-02-12-T-003,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, because there will be a Ministerial Statement governing many of the matters pertaining to the public healthcare system, I will keep my comments in response to the Member's queries limited and I think we can take up clarifications after the Ministerial Statement as well. I think the key point I want to emphasise in my response to the Member is this  the term ""recourse"" for the public has been used several times in the course of this exchange.",1,66,2019-02-12-T-003-S-00066
2019-02-12-T-003,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The fact of the matter is you need recourse. It does not matter whether the recourse is under the PDPC or PDPA, the legislation, or there are other established improved mechanisms, but the key point is you must have recourse.",2,67,2019-02-12-T-003-S-00067
2019-02-12-T-003,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"And that is my point when I said that individuals, depending on where or what circumstances they find themselves in, they can make complaints. By the way, the PDPC does receive complaints sometimes pertaining to the public sector. So, as a recipient of such complaints from the public, it does not turn them away but rather, the standing arrangement is they look at it and if the jurisdiction is such that it does not come under the PDPA, they then refer it to the Government agencies involved, to then follow through. In the case of the Government, GovTech, for example, is overall in-charge of the security and safeguard systems for data. And GovTech is the agency that does many of the reviews and ensures that the Government agencies are in compliance with the Instruction Manuals and other provisions and so on. Moreover, there is also the Auditor-General's review as well, which occurs from time to time, and it includes security.",3,68,2019-02-12-T-003-S-00068
2019-02-12-T-003,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"My point is that members of the public should not at all be concerned that they do not have recourse. They do, and in fact, they have a multiplicity of recourse and I would add that in the case of the public sector, they probably have more channels and more avenues of recourse in some ways, compared to what you see in the context of the private sector. Because essentially, for private sectors, you go to the PDPC, or you take out a specific legal action against the company on your own. Here, you have got more options because you can go through the PDPC. It would be referred to the relevant agencies. You can go to GovTech, you can go to the Ministry that oversees the relevant department, you can also make a Police report if you feel that it warrants such action.",4,69,2019-02-12-T-003-S-00069
2019-02-12-T-003,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, there should be no doubt in Members' minds that we have the appropriate recourse mechanisms. There should also be no doubt in Members' minds that the public sector's data governance standards are in no way inferior to the standards that we impose on the private sector. And if anything, we impose a higher set of standards. That is the expectation that we have.",5,70,2019-02-12-T-003-S-00070
2019-02-12-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the extent of the power failure on the afternoon of 26 January 2019; (b) what are the reasons for the failure; (c) what has been the trend in occurrences of such power failures in the past five years; and (d) what steps are being taken to minimise such failures going forward.,1,71,2019-02-12-T-004-S-00071
2019-02-12-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Mr Speaker, the power failure that occurred on 26 January at 1.30 pm affected about 27,000 consumers in Ang Mo Kio, Bishan, Sin Ming, Toa Payoh and Thomson.",1,72,2019-02-12-T-004-S-00072
2019-02-12-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Based on EMA's preliminary investigations, the disruption was likely due to an equipment fault at a substation at Bright Hill. The suspected cause is a faulty voltage transformer which started a fire in the substation. Immediately after the fire was detected, electrical protective devices were automatically activated to isolate the fault so that the downstream equipment would not be damaged. This resulted in the cut in power to the affected consumers. SP Power Grid (SPPG), the national grid operator was able to restore supply to 80% of consumers within 30 minutes and fully restored power supply to the remaining 20% of consumers within 90 minutes.",2,73,2019-02-12-T-004-S-00073

Our power system remains one of the most reliable in the world. Over the past six years, Singapore's average annual disruption per consumer ranged from 12 seconds to 4.2 minutes, which includes the most recent incident. In comparison, major cities such as Osaka, New York, Hong Kong and London experienced an average disruption per consumer of between five minutes and 21 minutes in FY17.",3,74,2019-02-12-T-004-S-00074
2019-02-12-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"EMA will thoroughly investigate each incident and take appropriate regulatory action if necessary. SPPG has since adopted higher frequency of condition monitoring for the specific equipment that had failed, and will prioritise the replacement of that particular component in future rounds of substation maintenance. SPPG has also set up an internal investigation committee to investigate this incident. In addition, SPPG has engaged the Original Equipment Manufacturer's experts to review and advise if the failure was due to design, manufacturing or material defects. SPPG has also engaged an independent expert, CHUBU Electric from Japan, to review the findings and recommendations of the equipment manufacturer. EMA will continue to work closely with SPPG to ensure high standards of reliability for our power system.",4,75,2019-02-12-T-004-S-00075
2019-02-12-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for his detailed reply. Just a few supplementary questions. Firstly, could the Senior Minister of State share if the trend of such major blackouts have been on the increase or decrease over the last five years or so. That is the first question.",1,76,2019-02-12-T-004-S-00076
2019-02-12-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Secondly, based on analysis of the recent incidents, does the Government believe that there are any systemic issues that need to be addressed, whether it is in terms of equipment maintenance or training of staff or any other issues. This is, of course, bearing in mind that, according to media reports, there was another major outage affecting some regions of Singapore in September last year, and I believe about 150,000 consumers were affected by that.",2,77,2019-02-12-T-004-S-00077
2019-02-12-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Thirdly and lastly, is there a protocol that is agreed with the power suppliers for when these kinds of disruptions happen, automatically or otherwise, there is a certain time period within which the power supply must be resumed and is that something that is tested from time to time?",3,78,2019-02-12-T-004-S-00078
2019-02-12-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Speaker, as I said earlier in my reply, this is the very first incident in which a voltage transformer has failed in the past five years, so there is no trend relating to this particular component. Other incidents may have happened in the recent past but this does not necessary indicate as a systemic issue because they pertain to either different parts of the system or actually could have been just due to human error.",1,79,2019-02-12-T-004-S-00079
2019-02-12-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"On the previous incident, I have actually shared the findings in the earlier PQ reply so I will not repeat it here.",2,80,2019-02-12-T-004-S-00080
2019-02-12-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"As far as protocol to ensure that our system is robust and resilient, let me just share that SPPG's distribution control and customer service monitors and controls the distribution network around the clock to ensure that electrical supply can be restored quickly in the event of power supply disruption to our consumers. And supply could general be restored typically within three hours by switching to an alternate feed or deployment of mobile generators. This is for the distribution network resilience. On preventive maintenance, SPPA practises the combination of both time based and condition based maintenance regimes. So, that is the kind of SOP or protocol as the Member had asked. And they carry out maintenance in accordance with the Original Equipment Manufacturer's recommendation to ensure reliable operation of equipment. In addition to periodic maintenance, SPPA adopts a condition monitoring regime in sensing and tracking the health of the assets which includes technologies to detect insulation deterioration, abnormal oil contents in our electric city cables and equipment, amongst others.",3,81,2019-02-12-T-004-S-00081
2019-02-12-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"This ensures that impending failures are properly mitigated before it actually happens. But of course, as equipment gets replaced overtime, new models come on, they could well be unknown unknowns of how whether the design itself, the material itself could lead to future fault. This is where we work closely with equipment manufacturers to see if the design or the material that they use for the manufacturing could have been a cause of it. And some of these investigations will require us working very closely with the stakeholders and may take some time before we detect them.",4,82,2019-02-12-T-004-S-00082
2019-02-12-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"I thank the Senior Minister of State for his reply. Just one last supplementary question, which is on the trend in such incidents of major blackouts.

2019-02-12-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Speaker, as I said before, we would be worried about a trend if the same component or the same system within the electrical grid across different sub-stations fail repeatedly. But while they may be several incidents that happened in the recent past, they affect different parts, components, for which the OEMs are still looking at it. So, until investigations are complete, I will not draw any premature conclusions to say that there is a trend linking all these different equipment and different components together.",1,84,2019-02-12-T-004-S-00084
2019-02-12-T-005,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether there is any study conducted to ensure that the liberalisation of the retail electricity market will benefit household consumers.,1,85,2019-02-12-T-005-S-00085
2019-02-12-T-005,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Mr Speaker, the Open Electricity Market, or OEM, completes the Government's efforts since 2001 to progressively liberalise the retail electricity market for all consumers.

2019-02-12-T-005,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for his reply. I would like to ask one supplementary question. Basically, the new vendors are offering up to 30% discount for the electricity charges. What I understand is that there are some concerns about this on the ground, where some segments of the population made a claim that it shows that SP Group has been profiteering in the past. The rationale is that after the 30% discount, the new vendors can still earn an income. So, I would like to get Senior Minister of State's view on this.",1,91,2019-02-12-T-005-S-00091
2019-02-12-T-005,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Speaker, the regulated tariff charged by SP Group and approved by EMA reflects the long-term costs of producing and delivering electricity in Singapore, such as the cost of building and operating the power plants. On the other hand, the electricity rates that are offered by retailers typically reflect the current market conditions, the level of competition as well as the short-term cost of producing electricity and under this current market condition where the capacity exceeds the demand for electricity, we can therefore expect market rates to be lower than the regulated tariff.",1,92,2019-02-12-T-005-S-00092
2019-02-12-T-005,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"However, this may change over time, based on market demand and supply, and consumers should be aware that while the price plans offered by retailers are fixed for the duration of each contract, retailers, like all businesses may adjust their prices and discounts over time. So, consumers who have switched to other retailers can also switch back to buy electricity at the regulated tariff from SP Group should they feel that the prices at a different point in time may be more favourable to switch back. They should check with their retailers if there are any applicable charges when making that decision.",2,93,2019-02-12-T-005-S-00093

2019-02-12-T-005,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Speaker, from what data we have so far from the roll-out, household consumers who have switched, generally pay electricity rate of about 20% to 30% lower than the regulated tariff.

2019-02-12-T-005,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Speaker, SP's regulated tariff takes into account the long-term cost of producing and maintaining infrastructure.

2019-02-12-T-005,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira,"Given the fact that, in some areas, the switch rates are still rather modest, and there are obviously very large savings to consumers who choose to switch, would the Ministry consider implementing switching on an opt-out basis, perhaps with assignment to a panel of open electricity retailers appointed on, let us say, a competitive tendering basis, because this may allow more consumers to realise the benefits immediately rather than waiting for them to switch?",1,101,2019-02-12-T-005-S-00101
2019-02-12-T-005,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"As I explained earlier, I think it is a difficult call for the Government to impose opt-out basis because, as I said earlier, price plans do fluctuate over time. If you look at this in the similar vein to telcos and how they operate by proposing different price plans, bundling with broadband, with your cable TV, for example, the plans change over time, and I think it is hard for us to do a kind of opt-out mechanism in which consumers may then find that they are locked in to something and cannot change when they have to.

These measures can include barriers such as plantings and setback from the road to keep funeral activities discrete, and the provision of eco-friendly burners to minimise smoke emissions. Rituals and funeral processions will be confined within the site as far as possible, to minimise disturbance. The relevant agencies have assessed that the road network in this area is able to support the funeral parlour development and will require the operator to provide sufficient parking facilities within the site. NEA will also work with the other agencies and the operator to reduce the impact of hearses when they move in the area.

2019-02-12-T-006,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"First, may I ask whether distance from the housing estate is a factor to be considered in deciding which funeral site should be zoned, and if so, why is it that the Bukit Batok site was chosen, given that the nearest housing estate is about 200 metres away from the proposed funeral site?",2,111,2019-02-12-T-006-S-00111
2019-02-12-T-006,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The second question I have is whether in relation to the other three funeral parlour sites, the housing estates are as close or are they further?",3,112,2019-02-12-T-006-S-00112
2019-02-12-T-006,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),The third question I have is in relation to mitigation measures. I am glad to hear that there are proposals to consider designating hearse routes. May I ask whether hearse routes could be designated even though they are vacant or in operation?,4,113,2019-02-12-T-006-S-00113

We also advise them where are the best routes to take, to avoid the residents and HDB flats as far as possible.",1,114,2019-02-12-T-006-S-00114
2019-02-12-T-006,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The 200 metres was not the exact reason why we did it. For Bukit Batok, first, as I mentioned, there is a dearth of such facilities in the western region. If you look at the map, the nearest one is in Choa Chu Kang. It is not so accessible, very far for many people. If you do not have a car, it is quite difficult to get there. So, we think it is useful to have one in that area.",2,115,2019-02-12-T-006-S-00115
2019-02-12-T-006,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Secondly, the site is already surrounded by industrial buildings, shielded from the public view.

2019-02-12-T-006,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"And, just now, my parliamentary colleague asked about the hearse route.

2019-02-12-T-006,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I thank the Member for the supplementary question. I think one of the important things we want to recognise is that after-death facilities are important social infrastructure. We, as Singaporeans living in HDB estates, are very used to seeing funeral wakes at the void decks, and now, perhaps, more frequently than before. This is one big-hearted society where we have never minded seeing either funerals or weddings right below where we live. And, as you know, where funerals are conducted, even weddings, there are disamenities, and we have tolerated them for a long, long time, ever since we have had HDB flats. I think we should keep that sense of accommodation, that sense of respect for people who need this in times of bereavement.",1,119,2019-02-12-T-006-S-00119

HDB estates display educational materials such as posters and banners to advise the public to use the joss paper burners provided and to burn joss papers in small quantities to minimise smoke. Town Councils have also adopted joss burners that can burn more cleanly.

First, let me say that in housing estates, for the large metal cage burners, they are normally used during specific events, such as during the seventh month festival as well as funerals.

Processes have been put in place to ensure that our asatizah registered with the ARS can perform the role that the community entrusts them to do. These processes include instituting provisional periods of observation and requiring additional interviews when deemed necessary by the ARB.

Through our collective efforts, we can build a Muslim community together that is strong, confident and constantly able to contribute to our nation's progress. The asatizah’s support of ARS is a reflection of their commitment to abide by the Code of Ethics that was established according to Islamic values that are durable, progressive and moderate.

Perhaps, this might be a useful thing to be made compulsory. But knowing the numbers are big, there may be some limitations. Perhaps, the best way to assess a candidate is when you are actually able to encounter them face-to-face, interact with them and look at their non-verbal communication skills.",1,142,2019-02-12-T-008-S-00142

In a situation where the claimant is unable to afford the legal fees, the claimant can also approach the Legal Aid Bureau which offers help to those who have difficulty procuring legal representation on their own. Of course, that would require some form of means-testing. In addition to that, the claimant can also approach the Law Society of Singapore which can provide ad-hoc pro-bono services, with free legal representation on a referred basis. If the claimant wants to have some form of legal advice, they can also approach the community legal clinics at the Law Society as they do offer basic legal advice and give advice  on the possible next course of action.",1,155,2019-02-12-T-009-S-00155

Because it is not easy to get help from Legal Aid. If you earn more $1,500, you cannot get help from Legal Aid already. So, I think if everybody were to go along that direction, I think it is quite onerous, quite tough. So, perhaps if there is increasing complaints, increasing incidents, perhaps the Ministry should look into how best to address this. If the appropriate party did not turn up, that means that the other party is at fault.",1,162,2019-02-12-T-009-S-00162

Just to give a summary of how victims in PMD accidents can proceed to seek compensation, like I mentioned before, it could be in a form of either a private settlement or through mediation. Secondly, of course, it can be achieved through civil action for which some of the limitations have been highlighted by the Member.",1,163,2019-02-12-T-009-S-00163

If the victim was involved in an accident and suffered significant injuries, he is encouraged to quickly file a Police report as that would allow the Police to launch an investigation to determine if an offence has been committed. And should the AGC assess that an offence had been committed, then the Court will consider whether to order the offender to compensate the victim.

Offenders who cause obstruction on public streets are liable for a fine up to $2,000.

2019-02-12-T-011,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Mr Speaker, HDB provides up to two housing loans at concessionary interest rate to eligible Singapore Citizen households.

2019-02-12-T-011,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Nevertheless, HDB has extended a third housing loan upon careful consideration of the merits of each specific case, particularly for those with urgent need of housing but are unable to secure commercial financing options. These households must have sufficient savings and steady incomes to service the HDB loan. Last year, HDB received around 4,500 such appeals, and assisted about 20% of the appeals or about 900 households. HDB will continue to evaluate such appeals, and extend flexibility where necessary.",2,170,2019-02-12-T-011-S-00170
2019-02-12-T-011,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"I wish to ask the Minister what is preventing the HDB from giving more such loans, given that the cost of borrowing of HDB, the rate is much lower than the interest rate that HDB is getting from these loans? And if HDB is worried about the credit risks of these borrowers, can HDB consider over-collateralising the loan by basically giving less loan for every dollar of flat that the applicant is borrowing again?",1,171,2019-02-12-T-011-S-00171
2019-02-12-T-011,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, there are basically two broad categories of cases where they would not be able to get the third housing loan when they apply for such a loan from HDB.",1,172,2019-02-12-T-011-S-00172
2019-02-12-T-011,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The first would be cases where they, in fact, can get a loan from the bank. And HDB would then ask them to take a commercial loan because they are, in fact, eligible. The second would be the one that Mr Ong has referred to. They cannot get commercial loans from the bank and they are asking for a third HDB loan. And in most of these cases, the reason why HDB rejects or is unable to approve is because they have unable to service the loan to begin with. So, there is an issue of them having difficulty with incomes and the ability to service the loan is in question. So, rather than having them over-stretch themselves, I think it is more prudent for them to build up their savings, steady their incomes and then they can consider applying for a HDB loan at a subsequent stage.",2,173,2019-02-12-T-011-S-00173

2019-02-12-T-012,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Mr Speaker, HDB requires new flat buyers to pay a downpayment of 10% or 20% of the flat price when they sign the Agreement for Lease within four months of booking a flat, to ensure that applicants are financially ready to commit to the flat purchase. The balance flat price is then payable when they collect the keys.",1,175,2019-02-12-T-012-S-00175

So, it is really meant for seniors to facilitate right-sizing.",2,176,2019-02-12-T-012-S-00176

This SDS is available to first-timer young couples below the age of 30. They can qualify for such a scheme when they buy any flat type from the HDB, including 4-room and 5-room flat types. The SDS is also available to flat owners who are right-sizing to a 2-room Flexi or a 3-room flat in non-mature estates, regardless of the age of the flat owner.",3,177,2019-02-12-T-012-S-00177

It is good to know that there is such a scheme to help young homeowners. My question is  is the downpayment a form of credit protection? What is the purpose of the downpayment? If it is a form of credit protection to ensure that the flat owner does not renege on his transaction, then would it be right to say that if he already has equity in his existing flat and HDB has control over the process the sale of his existing flat and the purchase of his new flat? If HDB has control over all these things, would it be correct to say that his equity in his existing flat is sufficient downpayment and sufficient credit protection for the downpayment for his new flat?",1,179,2019-02-12-T-012-S-00179

2019-02-12-T-012,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, so long as I think the flat owner, regardless of whether they are new, first-timers or existing flat owners, when they would like to make a purchase of a new flat, I think the downpayment is an indication of commitment and an indication that the person is seriously making a commitment to purchase a flat because if they were to simply put in a free option and then renege on that option later on, they are, in fact, depriving other potential flat buyers from purchasing that flat. It will be an opportunity cost. So, we do want a downpayment policy and we want potential flat buyers to take the purchase of their flat seriously.",1,186,2019-02-12-T-012-S-00186

Therefore, we need to be very cautious in approaching this issue. We want to make sure that we are able to manage the disease environment here and to protect Singaporeans where possible. Therefore, for persons with long-term residence in Singapore, we still have a restriction on their access to Singapore. For persons who are on short-term stay, the restriction has been lifted recently. We are also not alone in this. Australia and New Zealand also have restrictions on long-term stays for persons with HIV.",2,289,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00289
2019-02-12-T-014,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Minister. I have two questions. The first is, for those who have been contacted by Brochez and do not report to MOH, and if there is any leakage of personal information, would the person be liable for prosecution? That means, if the person is contacted by Brochez, given links online to confidential information online, would the person liable for prosecution if that person did not report to MOH that correspondence, that contact?",1,290,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00290
2019-02-12-T-014,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The second question is, I am assuming that the National Public Health Unit also kept a list of people living with other infectious diseases like STDs and TB. Were any of these lists also compromised by Ler and Brochez?",2,291,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00291
2019-02-12-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Let me answer the second question. The National Public Health Unit oversees public health issues which would include infectious diseases, such as MERS, Bird Flu, TB, STDs and HIV. The Unit will handle many of these infectious diseases and that is part of the information and data that officers would be handling. As to the data that has been exposed, it is limited to the HIV Registry, as I had mentioned.",1,292,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00292
2019-02-12-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The other question on whether a person receives information or a link that is provided by Brochez, whether it is illegal to retain them, I have to consult my colleague. But my suggestion is whether it is legal or illegal, please forward it to us or to the Police so that we can follow up to investigate the implications of that.",2,293,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00293

2019-02-12-T-014,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"I have two questions for the Minister of Health. The first is, we are all aware of the painstaking efforts we have taken over the decades to allow people who have or suspect that they may have HIV to come forward for testing. So, given this latest incident, what specific measures is the Ministry taking to make sure that this decades of efforts have not been negated?",1,296,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00296
2019-02-12-T-014,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"The second question is, given the requirement for long-term residency and HIV being an issue, which obviously created that whole fraud on the part of Brochez and Ler, how many cases have we encountered so far where fake blood has been used in order to get access to our long-term residents' pass, or in the past, even short-term pass?",2,297,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00297
2019-02-12-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"I stand corrected but this is, in my memory, the first case that we have seen. I will check and provide the Member with the information.",1,298,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00298
2019-02-12-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"On the issue of HIV testing, we do encourage persons who suspect they may have HIV or who are uncertain whether they have HIV to come forward to be tested. We do have anonymous test sites across Singapore. The identity of the person will be kept anonymous and MOH will only receive an aggregated number of people who have tested. We do not get the identity. So, we will continue to encourage you to come forward and be tested so that at least you will know your status. And we also encourage you to seek treatment. When you seek treatment, we will know who you are because we need to provide treatment to the patients. We will do our utmost to protect the data and the information as much as we can. Rest assured that we will do what we can to support you.",2,299,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00299
2019-02-12-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Ministry will also continue to step up efforts on public education to reduce the stigma on HIV patients. At the same time, the effort is not just the Government's alone. The society as a whole should come together and show support for these persons living with HIV. By showing them support, it will encourage more of them to come forward for testing, and more importantly, for treatment as well.",3,300,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00300
2019-02-12-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I thank the Minister for his Statement. In the constituency I serve, there are persons with HIV. We work with them, we partner them, they are fellow Singaporeans. While I recognise that good work has already been done in this area by various organisations, such as Action for AIDS or Catholic AIDS Response Effort, will the Ministry consider formalising and bolstering this process, drawing from good initiatives in other countries. For example, Living Positive Victoria in Australia has a team of peer navigators who are themselves living with HIV, who work extensively with HIV patients and their families, one-on-one.",1,301,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00301
2019-02-12-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, some contract HIV through no fault of their own. These include babies.

2019-02-12-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Sir, I thank the Member for his suggestion. Indeed, we will learn from other countries, their experiences and share their practices on how to better support persons living with HIV. We also work with advocacy groups and support groups, as well as NGOs and VWOs, to see how we can enable them, how we can support them in the work that they do.",1,303,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00303
2019-02-12-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"As I have mentioned, many of these require collaborative efforts, not just from the Government. Some persons with HIV would feel more comfortable talking to people that they know, people they are more familiar with, and therefore, it is not just the Government doing it. We need to work with multiple agencies, whether it is Action for AIDS, SOS or other VWOs. We try to work with them and see how we can best reach out to these people who need support and provide the relevant and effective support.",2,304,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00304

2019-02-12-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Minister for his comprehensive Statement. Just three questions. Firstly, just to confirm, I believe the Minister said that although this was not the protocol previously at the time, but right now it is the protocol that where as far as sensitive data is concerned, like personal data and the HIV Registry, right now, when the public officer exports, extracts or downloads the data, there is an automatic alert that is triggered; and then someone will see that list of download attempts and they will be subject to some scrutiny. So, I just wanted to confirm that that is in place right now.",1,306,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00306
2019-02-12-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Secondly, I think the Minister explained that the individuals such as Dr Ler who had access to personalised information from the HIV Registry needed that information in order to do their work by contact tracing and so on and so forth. In hindsight, I just wanted to ask the Minister, does the Minister feel there could be more scope going forward to maybe reduce the number of people who have access to the personalised data to the absolute minimum and possibly even break up access for the entire database between different individuals, so that very few, or perhaps even no individual has access to all the personalised data, even though other individuals may have access to the aggregated data for the purpose of policy analysis? That is my second question.",2,307,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00307
2019-02-12-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"My third and last question is, based on what I heard from the Minister's timeline and I will stand corrected if I misheard this, Minister mentioned that Brochez was convicted and sentenced to 28 months in jail in March 2017 and he was released in 2018. So, I just wanted to check if he did in fact serve the full sentence as per conviction or was the sentence reduced in length or was it because he had already served time when the conviction took place?",3,308,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00308
2019-02-12-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"I think on the last question I can confirm with my colleagues but I would imagine that it is subject to the normal prison terms where you have remission of a certain period and then he was deported thereafter. So, perhaps my colleagues can confirm.",1,309,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00309
2019-02-12-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Member's question about access  in fact, access to the data has always been on a need-to-know and need-to-use basis, and the number of staff in the NPHU is actually very small; they are limited to a handful of people. Whenever they need the information, they would have to then access because they are all doing contact tracing, doing analysis, so all of them are actually working on the similar type of matters. At the same time, we also have to understand that Ler was the head of the unit. So, in his particular position, he needs to have oversight of all the work that the staff is working on, and therefore he would have access to all the information in any case. So, I think it probably does not relate to this particular incident.",2,310,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00310
2019-02-12-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The new system that we put in place has audit trail and this audit trail was not meant to watch everybody and what they do. There are certain alerts that are built into the system where if there are excessive access to the information, or where there is unusual kind of access to information, it will be flagged up. The audit trail will also allow us, when something does happen, to look back.",3,311,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00311
2019-02-12-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Therefore, let me just put in perspective, we have to take a multi-pronged approach to data security. The first level is to have a system in place to prevent abuse of data – things like encrypted thumb drives. So, those are important to allow us to prevent attempts to abuse the data or illegal access to data. The second level is for us to detect should something happen and there are some suspicious activities that are going on. These are the audit trails which are important, the documentation which is important. The third level, which is equally important, and that is deterrence. And that is why if we were to find someone who has made an illegal access or who has abused information or has been less than careful with the information that he is entrusted with, then we must take stern action and that is what happened to Ler and Brochez – that is why they were charged in Court.",4,312,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00312
2019-02-12-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Only when we do these three would we be able to have a robust system of protecting our information. So, if you bear in mind that Ler himself was the head of the unit, the safeguards that you put in place, even if it is effective, he had the right to access. Even if you have audit trails, most of the things that he did from our audit over the last few years, when we checked what he did, based on our investigation, they were legitimate work that he was doing with MOH. Whether or not he was careful in protecting the data that he was using is a separate issue. Many of these may not be able to stop Ler from doing what he did but the deterrence is an important part to make sure that those who want to try have to be mindful of the penalties that could be imposed on him if they were ever caught. Therefore, these three must work hand in hand to ensure we have a robust system of data security – protection, detection and deterrence.",5,313,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00313
2019-02-12-T-014,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"This is a very unfortunate incident. I have got two questions. One is, may I know what is the risk of potential suicide amongst the affected individuals and what MOH may be doing to provide more support to help them tide over this very difficult period?",1,314,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00314
2019-02-12-T-014,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Second, is that I think quite clearly from the whole sequence of events, these two individuals, Brochez and Ler, lacked conscience, they are recalcitrant, spiteful, committed very despicable act and as Minister have mentioned also, despite having systems and policies in place, it did not stop Ler from abusing his position and authority. It did not stop Brochez even with the different time milestones after being discovered, did not stop him from being willful and spiteful. So, I am wondering whether the current penalties are deemed to be deterrent enough and whether there is scope to enhance the penalties further to prevent such individuals from ever committing such crimes ever again?",2,315,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00315
2019-02-12-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Sir, two points. First, on the risk of suicidal tendencies. I get feedback from my medical social workers who are working on calling the patients and they do tell me that in their calls, there were patients who were suicidal and they have to manage the case very delicately. They have to sense the distress the patients are facing and they have to make a judgement how much to tell them, whether to stress them further, or to refer them for help. Often, when they come across a person who has a clear intention to do something drastic, they would refer them to the IMH for example who can manage them. Often, they would try to refer them to people whom they are familiar with, people who have been their support group so that they are able to continue to support them. But these are very delicate issues and I do not want to go into specific details for various reasons.",1,316,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00316
2019-02-12-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,On the issue of – what is Member's second question?,2,317,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00317

The first clarification is that, in this recent incident involving the NPHU, that the organisation concerned is actually within MOH and therefore I would like confirmation that it does not come under the auspices of the Personal Data Protection Act. That is the first clarification.",1,320,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00320
2019-02-12-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The second clarification is, I think earlier Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary went through the instruction manual or some policy about how the public sector safeguards personal data and if I heard him correctly, a lot of responsibility is placed on the department concerned to assess and come up with measures. My question is, in this recent incident involving the HIV leak, did any department outside MOH assess whether the arrangements that were in existence at the time when the breach occurred, whether the security arrangements were reasonable? Did anybody outside MOH come to any conclusion or inquire into the matter?",2,321,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00321
2019-02-12-T-014,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Mr Speaker, for the first point Ms Sylvia Lim is correct – the PDPA does not apply. For the second point, the answer is yes, the arrangements that the MOH team and the officers who were involved in at the time were audited to be in compliance with the standards that were set. Those are not the same standards that are present today. The standards have changed, the training of officers has changed, and the deployment and use of technology has changed.",1,322,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00322

I want to have a sensing of how big this compliance team is.",1,325,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00325
2019-02-12-T-014,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"My second question is, on the one part we talk about deterrent measures, on the other part I wonder whether for positions within the Ministry which we consider as in possession of sensitive information, whether we could improve – prior to the appointment of people to these positions, whether we could subject them to additional tests on character, things which can allow us to sharpen the process of appointing these people to these positions. I recognise there are no foolproof systems but for these positions, I would request, perhaps it is already in existence, but I would request that perhaps these appointments be subjected to more tests prior to confirmation of their appointment.",2,326,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00326
2019-02-12-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"As I mentioned, we are now expanding the data governance division. We would need to look at the scope of the work and determine what is the size that we need. Currently, it is a very small unit and it is focusing on dealing with the policies, dealing with practices and reviewing MOH's governance practices on data security. But in order for them to do the audit function, to go down to the ground, to look at practices and to enforce practices, we would need to significantly enhance resources and these would include visiting and checking on the operations and practices on the ground to ensure compliance. Policies are as good as how much they are practised on the ground and therefore it is important for us to make sure that they practise what the policy requires. So, I think we will have to continue to enhance the size of the group.",1,327,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00327
2019-02-12-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"On the recruitment for staff handling sensitive information, we will take a look, but there is no foolproof system because integrity of the person has to be tested over time. The Chinese says, ""路遥知马力，日久见人心"". So, sometimes you do the best you can in assessing a person's character, but you will never know until you have worked with him over a period of time. We also have to be careful with unnecessary discrimination when you deal with a character assessment. Some of these may not be objective. Therefore, in recruitment and selecting people, we would need to take quite a holistic approach and make a holistic assessment on the suitability of the person.",2,328,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00328
2019-02-12-T-014,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"I have two questions to ask the Minister. It was reported in the MOH website that Ler has been charged under the OSA for failing to take reasonable care of confidential information regarding HIV positive patients. So, the critical issue here is not really about failing to take reasonable care of the confidential information. The issue here is why did the MOH system at NPHU allow someone to download the entire database. You can access the database but why allow someone to download the entire database onto a thumb drive, to begin with. I seek confirmation from the Minister that there was actually no safeguard against such downloading of the entire database by authorised staff prior to 2016.",1,329,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00329
2019-02-12-T-014,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The second issue is, I also read from the MOH website that additional safeguards against mishandling of information by authorised staff were only put in place three to four years after MOH was first alerted to an allegation that Ler had misused the HIV Registry. I also understand earlier from Minister Iswaran that there are regular mandated IT audits done with regard to security of personal data at our public agencies. So, why did it take so long for MOH to implement the additional safeguards because authorised staff still can access and download the entire database like what Ler did, from 2013 to 2016 before the additional measures were put in?",2,330,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00330
2019-02-12-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Let me first respond to Mr Seah's question on Data Analytics Group, we have about 50, but the number who is looking at the governance division, we have about six. So, we will need to expand the governance division.",1,331,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00331

NPHU is compliant with the requirements stipulated in the Government's data governance policies. For example, even at that time, you were only allowed to download data onto Government-issued computers. Therefore, you were not allowed to download data into your own computers. You were allowed to have portable storage devices at that time, because the encrypted storage devices was only a requirement in 2017, as a Whole-of-Government policy, not MOH policy but Whole-of-Government.",2,332,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00332
2019-02-12-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Therefore, we were in compliance. The nature of Ler's job requires him to constantly operate on the database and, therefore, he is allowed to download the registry into his computer. Unfortunately, he did not protect the data by using an unencrypted thumb drive. At that time, we did not have the encrypted thumb drive policy, so he used a normal thumb drive and he did not protect the thumb drive. If you are using the thumb drive, you need to transfer files from computer to another Government computer to work on it, you ought to protect the thumb drive. The policy stipulates that you must ensure that your access to the confidential official information must be with you all the time. You must ensure that you have possession of the information all the time. But he was believed to have failed to keep the thumb drive with him at all times and, had therefore, contravened the OSA, and that is why he is charged on that basis.",3,333,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00333

Brochez did the blood test at the clinic where Dr Ler was a locum. So, I would like to ask the Minister what are the rules preventing doctors from carrying out test for people they know which may put them in a position of compromise or conflict of interest, or question of independence may be raised exactly in the situation like when Brochez went to take a blood test at the clinic where Dr Ler worked? And just to supplement, to this end, whether or not the Minister think that we need to strengthen the governance in this particular area.",1,336,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00336

2019-02-12-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Generally, doctors have to exercise discretion and they will have to exercise judgement too. Under the ethical codes of conduct and guidelines, they will have to assess whether they do have a conflict of interest. If they feel that they have a conflict, they ought to make it known to the patient and to then step away from whatever procedure or treatment that they may be offering to them. But we cannot have a rule to say that you are not allowed to see everybody you know. Then, you have a problem, because doctors know many people. Therefore, eventually, it is the judgement of the doctor himself to assess whether by treating you, I do have a conflict of interest.",2,338,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00338

I agree that in this case, the Government had to make a very difficult decision to balance transparency with the interest of those affected, and I do not want to second-guess that decision. But I fear that without a general Government policy on the issue, the Government will find it difficult to effectively rebut claims or conspiracy theories about Government's lack of transparency. So, I would like to ask the Government if it would find elucidating, developing a general policy on disclosure useful to enhance transparency and public trust in the Government.",1,342,2019-02-12-T-014-S-00342

There are general guidelines for the handling of data, the training of officers, the protocols that should be in place across the public sector including what are the considerations that should be taken into account after an incident occurs, with respect to the affected individuals, the processes of the agency and the broader public. So, it is not that there are no guidelines; it is not a vacuum. There is quite a lot of thoughts, considerations and processes that are in place.

2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Last July, the Government announced plans to form the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) to oversee food safety and food security from farm-to-fork. Currently, the regulation of the food industry is divided among three public sector agencies. The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) regulates food safety before retail during import, local production and manufacturing. The National Environment Agency (NEA) regulates food hygiene at the retail level. Analysis of food samples is carried out at laboratories under the Health Sciences Authority (HSA). The SFA will consolidate regulatory oversight for these different aspects of food safety and security in a single public sector agency.",2,355,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00355
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Singapore is not the first country to adopt a farm-to-fork model. We have studied other countries like Ireland, where a single agency is responsible for food safety along the entire food supply chain. There are merits to consolidate the responsibilities for food safety and security into a single agency. One, it emphasises the high priority and commitment that the Government places on food safety and security. Two, it allows uniform application of measures, faster response, and more efficient and effective use of resources and expertise.",3,356,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00356
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),NEA will however continue to develop and manage hawker centres as our community dining rooms. This arrangement will enable sharper focus by SFA and NEA in their respective roles vis-a-vis hawker centres. HSA will continue to regulate health supplements. HPB will continue to promote the consumption of healthy food. SFA will support them from the food safety angle. AVA’s remaining non-food plant and animal related functions will be transferred to the National Parks Board (NParks) via the National Parks Board (Amendment) Bill 2019. The Minister for National Development will explain this transfer during the Second Reading of the National Parks Board (Amendment) Bill 2019.,4,357,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00357
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Mr Speaker, food security is fundamental to our National Security. Let me repeat this  food security is fundamental to our National Security. We have worked hard to ensure Singapore’s food safety and security over the decades. This is critical because Singapore depends heavily on food imports. The 2018 Global Food Security Index puts Singapore as the Number 1 country in the world in ensuring that citizens have access to safe and nutritious food at affordable prices. This is testimony to the hard work by generations of our staff since AVA’s early days at the Primary Production Department in pre-independence Singapore. We have done well but cannot take the current situation for granted.",5,358,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00358
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Let me elaborate. The agriculture and food, or agri-food, landscape is changing rapidly. By 2050, global population is expected to grow another 30% to 9.7 billion. Global food demand is also projected to rise by 60% as incomes rise in developing countries, leading to greater demand for meat and proteins. Vital resources to meet the increased food demand, such as water and energy, are increasingly scarce. The World Bank estimates that agriculture accounts for 70% of global water consumption but one-third of the world’s population lives in water-stressed areas.",6,359,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00359
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Over the longer term horizon too, climate change will exacerbate these threats. Extreme temperatures, droughts, and floods from rising sea levels will affect production yield. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates widespread declines in crop yields of between 10% to 25% by 2050 due to climate change impacts. The International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines forecasts a 20% reduction in Asian rice yields for every degree of temperature rise. Rice becomes sterile if exposed to temperatures above 35 degrees Celsius for more than one hour during flowering. A heat wave during flowering season, like in Australia right now, would wipe out the entire year’s crop. Scientists from various disciplines all mark 2050 as a watershed year when projected increase in population intersects with severe decline in crop yields due to unmitigated climate change. Competition for water, energy and consequently food, will escalate conflicts if not mitigated.",7,360,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00360
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Indeed, right here in ASEAN, one of my counterparts shared with me that the impact of climate change is already being felt and has caused more frequent and severe droughts and floods in the Mekong River Delta, which is the ""rice bowl"" of Asia. Rice production can fall by more than 50%. These are real-life threats, and can hit us badly since we import more than 90% of our food. The 2007 and 2008 global food crises, which stemmed from various factors including droughts and rising oil prices, triggered spikes in food prices worldwide, and even led to street protests in Indonesia and Bangladesh. Food producing countries like India and Brazil introduced export bans. These impacts were felt in Singapore in the form of increased prices. Fortunately, we did not face food shortages.",8,361,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00361
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"We also need to manage the risks from the growing complexity in global food supply chains. Our food undergoes multiple processes involving many players in different countries, before reaching our tables. For example, the frozen pizza in our supermarkets can have more than 10 ingredients from different sources. The pineapple could have been grown in the Philippines, the ham brined in Australia, the tomato sauce canned in the US and the flour milled in Singapore. This simple example highlights the confluence of food supply and food safety, and the challenges we face. On the one hand, we get to enjoy a wide range of ingredients and cuisine.",9,362,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00362
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"On the other hand, complex global supply chains increase the potential points of failure where contamination can enter the food chain. This makes it more difficult to identify the source of the problems when they occur. Was the cause of a food poisoning incident due to poor hygiene in the restaurant or hotel? Could it have been due to high levels of pesticides on the raw ingredients? Contaminants introduced in the manufacturing process of packing and canning? Or deterioration in quality and safety during transportation?",10,363,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00363
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Such challenges will intensify. Complex supply chains will evolve as climate change affects production. Epidemiology has to keep up with changes in the survival and transmission patterns of foodborne diseases. In Singapore, Government agencies have worked well together to address food safety and security and we have a strong reputation. But we must ensure that our food safety and security regime is well ahead of the curve. It is in our DNA to constantly look ahead, anticipate trends, adapt and seize opportunities. We will consolidate NEA and AVA’s current capabilities in licensing, compliance management, investigation and testing by HSA, in SFA. SFA will be able to holistically respond to food safety incidents wherever these occur along the food supply chain.",11,364,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00364
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"For example, in the scenario of a food poisoning incident, a single team will oversee the entire food supply chain and manage investigations. Starting from the accreditation of overseas farms, to import, to intermediate processing by central kitchens and retailers, and finally to the proper storage and preparation at the retail outlet. This will allow SFA to respond more promptly to trace the source of contamination.",12,365,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00365

Strategic advantages to secure our food supply, transform our agri-food industry, develop our local enterprises, and provide good jobs to Singaporeans. Just like how we have turned our vulnerability in water into opportunity. Let me give a few examples.",13,366,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00366
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"First, new food production methods and techniques are emerging at an unprecedented pace. Modern food production has become more productive, sustainable and resilient to climate change. We can learn from others around the world, how they leverage on their strengths and overcome their constraints. The United Arab Emirates enjoys cheap and abundant energy, but struggles with a hot and dry desert climate where water is extremely scarce. On the other hand, water is abundant in the Netherlands, but energy is expensive and scarce.",14,367,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00367
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"I visited a tomato farm in Dubai last month, which channels waste carbon dioxide from air conditioning back into the glasshouse to boost plants' growth. To reduce water use, the farm recirculates the nutrient solution used to feed the crops. The farm is able to produce tomatoes at high yields consistently throughout the year, even when the temperature outside reaches 50 degrees Celsius. Last year, I visited Wageningen University & Research (WUR) in The Netherlands, and was impressed by their innovation in greenhouse technologies to reduce energy consumption in the cultivation of tomatoes. Their target is to produce net zero energy greenhouses.",15,368,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00368
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Singapore suffers scarcity at both extremes – scarcity of water and energy. We must develop our own approach to agriculture, which accounts for our deficiencies in water and energy and to add to this complexity, also land. Technology now allows us to solve this conundrum. Our future farms will be different from the farms that we are familiar with today. Rather than back-breaking physical toil under the sun, new-age farmers will work indoors in an environmentally controlled enclosure, much like the Domes at the Gardens by the Bay. Instead of shovels and hoes, they will operate computers controlling autonomous robots that plant seeds and harvest crops. With the right crops, these farms operate at much higher productivity and can sustain good jobs. Indeed, such technological innovations apply not to just land-based farming, but even aquaculture where we can increase the yield and improve the quality of our local seafood. The working environments will be almost indistinguishable from the offices or automated production lines many of us work in today.",16,369,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00369
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"In addition to regulatory oversight of the food industry, SFA will partner businesses to transform our food industry. We must seize opportunities in the agri-food sector to further enhance our food supply resilience. We must sow the seeds now for Singapore’s development into an agri-food hub. In time to come, we will harvest the benefits. A strong stable of local enterprises which can export sustainable urban food solutions to cities around the world, good jobs which will appeal to Singaporeans, and a secure supply of safe food for Singaporeans.",17,370,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00370
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Second, the emergence of new and novel food products. These have the potential to provide us with a safe and sustainable supply of food, without compromising on taste or health. One example is plant-based protein with meat-like texture and taste from companies such as Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. These new food products have a smaller environmental footprint compared to conventional meat products, and could potentially be scaled up to meet future food demand. Another example is the cultivation of insects, such as the black soldier fly, for animal feed. This will require us to make a conscious effort to position Singapore as an agri-food hub – from facilitative regulations that encourage innovation, to creating the necessary R&D eco-system and growing a pipeline of Singaporean talent.",18,371,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00371

2019-02-12-T-015,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Mr Speaker, Sir, the decision to establish a Singapore Food Agency (SFA) is timely, as we witnessed several significant lapses in food safety in the past months. With large scale food poisoning cases including one fatal case and with undesirable foreign items discovered in prepacked food, Singaporeans cannot help but wonder if our eateries and relevant Government agencies are getting things right in food hygiene management. Are F&B staff overworked, resulting in lapses in food handling hygiene? Or, are they not receiving adequate training? These are common concerns that people would raise when they see yet another news report concerning food safety lapses.",1,394,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00394
2019-02-12-T-015,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"In truth, the food landscape in Singapore and around the world is evolving rapidly. Globalisation and new business models have made food supply chains more complex than ever. International brand names are setting up restaurants on our sunny island and they are also flying in raw ingredients from overseas. Climate changes and disasters disrupt the supply of food ingredients, pressuring businesses to turn to alternative sources. Perhaps, the pressure to deliver under disruption may have compromised some safety procedures.",2,395,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00395
2019-02-12-T-015,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Domestically, more young people are turning to entrepreneurship, and considering Singaporeans' passion for food, it is not surprising that cafes and eateries are popular business choices. With the gig economy becoming increasingly mainstream, we are also seeing more freelancers making use of their talents to become home bakers and private chefs.",3,396,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00396
2019-02-12-T-015,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Food deliveries are becoming the norm for F&B establishments, from hawker centres to restaurants to grocery retailers, to deliver consumers' meals. Yet, this adds additional challenges to the food safety process – packaging, exposure to outdoor temperatures and with more people involved in handling of the food. These are all additional matters to consider in food safety management. In short, all these developments would lead to a higher probability in food safety lapses, and so there is a need for the Government to better manage food safety risks.",4,397,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00397
2019-02-12-T-015,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Mr Speaker, I am pleased to note that the SFA has pledged to improve regulatory oversight. This is being done by overseeing food safety across the entire food supply chain from farm-to-fork. The SFA has promised to harmonise regulatory and enforcement processes. Hopefully, in doing so, there can be better coordination for food-related issues, product tracing and recall, as well as engagement of stakeholders and members of the public. In the meantime, SFA will require adequate manpower and resources to implement such a large-scale process.",5,398,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00398

2019-02-12-T-015,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Meanwhile, I do not think it is practical to rely on SFA to manage every aspect of food safety for all F&B services and businesses. The onus is on business owners to provide their customers with meals that are safe to consume. I hope the newly established SFA will work closely with these businesses, including freelancers, to provide them with the education and resources they would require, staying abreast with food safety management requirements. In fact, perhaps, it would be timely to review the mandatory basic food hygiene courses that food handlers are required to undergo, and the frequency of the mandatory refresher course could be increased as well.",7,400,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00400
2019-02-12-T-015,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"We are fortunate that our country is free from natural disasters due to our prime location. Nevertheless, that does not absolve us from being at the mercy of natural disasters and disease outbreaks, that hit other countries. Most of our food products are imported from other countries. We get hit by whatever shortages and price hikes that impact our exporters. With the world climate becoming increasingly unpredictable, it is sensible of SFA to consider food security among its priorities.",8,401,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00401
2019-02-12-T-015,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"A key food security strategy is to diversify our food supply sources, much like what we did with our water supply. With the new powers that the SFA will get through this Bill, they will be able to impose diversification requirements on food importers via licensing conditions. Moreover, the ability to collect food-related data from the industry will help us to better prepare and plan for food supply disruptions. Yet while this is a good strategy, this could mean additional burdens on importers of vital food items to come up with the relevant diversification strategies. Will SFA provide any form of assistance to these importers?",9,402,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00402
2019-02-12-T-015,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),I understand that AVA has helped to organise overseas food sourcing trips and match importers to suppliers. Will SFA continue this and possibly even enhance it?,10,403,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00403
2019-02-12-T-015,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Creating our own supply of food is another vital aspect of food security. I am heartened to note that SFA intends to work with the industry and R&D partners to develop new products and solutions that can enhance food supply resilience, while overcoming resource constraints in land, energy and water. Happily, there has been growing interest in farming among young Singaporeans. There are farmers’ market events where one can purchase locally grown organic produce. We are hearing more about Singaporeans volunteering in community gardens or growing their own indoor produce.",11,404,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00404

Mr Ong said that he rarely buys vegetables and he gets his vegetables from the community garden on top of our multi-storey carpark besides our CC because that multi-storey carpark, the top level is seldom used so we converted that to community garden for residents to plant vegetables. And Mr Ong is not alone. I am sure if we can systematically harness every inch of our soil, like what we do for water, we can achieve amazing results.",12,405,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00405
2019-02-12-T-015,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Mr Speaker, by envisioning Singapore as an agri-food hub that exports sustainable urban food solutions to cities around the world, the SFA has demonstrated foresight. I am looking forward to hearing about the specific plans that SFA has in place to achieve this. We will need to have the relevant talent for sure, and I trust that SFA will be working with educational institutions to open up new education pathways for those who are interested in food science, agriculture and other relevant disciplines. By developing a new sector, we can expect to open up a new job market for Singaporeans. And, for Singaporeans who have a passion for agriculture but feel inhibited by the lack of demand, they can take heart that they may work soon be able to work towards fulfilling their dreams of going professional right here on home ground.",13,406,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00406

2019-02-12-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore Food Agency Bill seeks to create a single agency to manage food safety and security across the supply chain. The new Singapore Food Agency or SFA will subsume the food-related functions of AVA, NEA and HSA. NEA’s food hygiene arm, which has been the frontline agency dealing with the recent spate of food poisoning cases, as well as HSA’s food safety lab, will be subsumed under the SFA. As such, the SFA will be in charge of food safety and also national food security. The AVA’s remit of regulating and nurturing the farming sector will also, presumably, come under the new SFA.",1,413,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00413
2019-02-12-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The Bill creates a one-stop shop for food licensing as well as food safety inspection and response. This promises a number of benefits. For example, the fact that one agency is licensing central kitchens and caterers means that businesses may be able to save costs by not duplicating locations for these distinct facilities, cost-savings which may be passed onto consumers. Mr Speaker, Sir, as such, this Bill is a step in the right direction and I do not oppose the Bill. I do, however, have several questions and comments.",2,414,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00414

2019-02-12-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Firstly, Sir, I would like to speak about food safety. The WHO has said that unsafe food is a global threat, contributing to over 300,000 deaths in 2010 alone, for example. Most of these deaths are caused by pathogens such as salmonella, E. coli and norovirus and the majority of lives lost are in Africa and Southeast Asia.",4,416,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00416
2019-02-12-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Sir, there is a widespread perception of a recent spike in food poisoning cases at restaurants and caterers in Singapore, leading to illness and in one case death – and that case was the tragic death of the late Mr Fadli Saleh in November last year, seemingly as a result of a mass food poisoning incident. There were five reported mass poisoning incidents in the last quarter of 2018 alone.",5,417,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00417
2019-02-12-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"At the end of the day, I suspect that the problem of unsafe food from food-service outlets may come down, in many cases, to the human factor – an employee showing up for work when he or she is ill, a supervisor willing to turn a blind eye to that, individual negligence in food handling practices and so on.",6,418,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00418
2019-02-12-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Would the new SFA consider taking a long, hard look at the entire profession of food handlers, which is to say all those involved in food preparation and handling, to understand if their conditions of work, training, compensation and workplace environment are in line with global norms? If, and I stress if, poor compensation, career prospects and treatment by employers are persistently found in this industry, while it does not absolve individuals from individual responsibility, it would, perhaps, explain the root causes which need to be addressed. I would urge the new SFA to look deeply into the conditions of work of food handlers, including their economic conditions, to understand if there is more we could be doing to address the root causes of such incidents.",7,419,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00419
2019-02-12-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Having said that, penalties, enforcement and deterrence are important parts of a healthy food safety eco-system. In this regard, I note that some larger and more organised food-service outlets have their own corporate whistle-blower hotlines, though I very much doubt that the same can be said for most companies in the industry. I would like to ask whether the Government will look into making a food safety whistle-blower hotline mandatory for large food-service outlets, since detecting food safety lapses is in the interest of the companies themselves. At the very least, would the Government consider instituting protections for whistleblowers who identify legitimate food safety problems and enable their rectification. In the United States, laws exist to protect employees who blow the whistle on food safety violations. For instance, under the US Food and Drug Administration, the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 has provisions against retaliation toward whistle-blowers by food businesses. The UK, China and other countries also have similar laws and regulations.",8,420,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00420
2019-02-12-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Next, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to confirm that, in addition to sample checks of imports, the SFA will also conduct proactive surveillance of global news reports to identify potential food safety dangers among global food exporters who are exporting food into Singapore, so that proactive preventive action can be taken. This issue came to the fore in the recent case about the possibility of needles in strawberries imported from Australia.",9,421,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00421
2019-02-12-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Next, I would like to ask if the Government currently publishes the results of its sample food safety checks in aggregate form, that is to say without naming specific establishments, as this will serve as a useful barometer on how well we are doing. If this is not currently being done, can this be considered? For example, the US regularly publishes the results of its national residue programme that inspects meat, poultry and egg products for chemical residues.",10,422,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00422
2019-02-12-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"And, lastly on the subject of food safety, I would urge the SFA to look into food labelling requirements. Can nutrition labelling be made mandatory rather than being only recommended? According to the European Union’s Global Nutrition Update 2018, 26 countries, including in our neighbourhood – Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea, plus all the member states of the European Union and all the member states of the Gulf Co-operation Council, now make nutrition labelling mandatory, while 13 countries have a voluntary labelling regime of which Singapore is currently one. Allergens such as nuts should be clearly called out on food labels, given the rise in diagnosis of allergies.",11,423,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00423
2019-02-12-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Also, would the SFA consider making it compulsory for food importers to declare on the label the quantity of total and added sugar, as is now the case in the United States? Right now, the Handbook on Nutrition Labelling does not list sugar as a core nutrient that is recommended to be listed. Added sugar should be called out on labels so as not to deter consumption of natural sugars in healthy food products like fruit. The inclusion of added sugars on the label can be a tool in the effort to educate the public about the health risks associated with excessive consumption of refined, added sugars.",12,424,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00424
2019-02-12-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Next, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to speak about the farming sector. In the Government press release announcing this Bill, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos said, and I quote  ""The formation of the SFA is timely as Singapore aims to turn our food challenges into opportunities. The SFA will work closely with industry partners to develop new solutions and products... (such as) climate resilient farming solutions and advanced food manufacturing techniques.”",13,425,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00425
2019-02-12-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The SFA, I assume, will take over the role of nurturing and regulating the farm sector in Singapore. This is a subject I have spoken about in Parliament several times before and I would like to urge the SFA to focus on several key areas in this effort.",14,426,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00426
2019-02-12-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Firstly, the SFA should use all available tools to grow the high-tech, high-value-added farming sector in Singapore, especially local enterprises that are applying technology and innovation to raise yield per square metre of footprint in land-scarce Singapore. The rate of disbursement of the $63 million Agriculture Productivity Fund, launched in 2014, appears to be low. As per the answer to my Parliamentary Question in July 2018, over $13 million has been awarded to 74 farms from the Agriculture Productivity Fund (APF) to date, of which only over $7 million has been disbursed.",15,427,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00427
2019-02-12-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Secondly, in 2017, Minister of State Dr Koh Poh Koon shared that the Government's local food production targets are 10% for vegetables, 30% for hens' eggs, and 15% for food fish, and our production has generally been rising over the years. I would like to ask if we are making progress on these targets. No doubt, it is unlikely that we will ever produce all our food domestically, at least in the foreseeable future. But with recent advances in indoor farming technology and the presence of Government support, is there room to raise these targets, using the tool of the Agriculture Productivity Fund to support local farms in raising output?",16,428,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00428
2019-02-12-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Thirdly, I hope the SFA will also address a number of the issues I have spoken about in Parliament in the past relating to the farming sector – the length of leases where there has been some improvement, a level playing field for local start-ups and farm tenders and the need to promote adoption of effective insurance against both natural and man-made disasters.",17,429,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00429
2019-02-12-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir, an emerging trend in the global food industry is that of micro-brands, which is to say, start-ups developing their own unique food products and selling these online. As reported in The Economist, the biggest 25 food-and-beverage companies generated 45% of sales in America but drove only 3% of the total growth in sales between 2011 and 2015. A long tail of 20,000 companies below the top 100 produced half of all growth.

2019-02-12-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"At the same time, we should embrace relevant global trends. Food micro-brands can help increase choice and reduce cost – which micro-brands have helped bring about in other non-food categories like, for example, mattresses and shaving razors. At the same time, food micro-brands could create good jobs in Singapore and could be a domain for fruitful local entrepreneurship. Will the business of nurturing food industry companies, such as food micro-brands, be handled by SFA or will it still be driven by organisations like SPRING and the EDB?",20,432,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00432

2019-02-12-T-015,Mohamed Irshad,Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member),"Besides agrotech farms, we should be more creative in the use of our limited space by collaborating with urban planners and communities to integrate urban agriculture into the lives of Singaporeans. Allow me to cite the example of a sustainable urban farming model — the Citizen Farm. The farm was piloted in the housing estate of Queenstown in 2016. A dilapidated, abandoned former prison along Jalan Penjara was transformed into a closed-loop urban farming system that integrated natural systems with modern technology. Beyond its use of technology and innovation, the farm had its foundations in a social enterprise model, with the aim of connecting communities through farm spaces. Smaller start-up technologies and innovations were also encouraged in the farms. These included indoor microgreen harvesting, mushroom farming and an indoor fish farm, amongst others. In this way, the dilapidated, abandoned former prison was transformed into a thriving urban farming model.",11,443,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00443
2019-02-12-T-015,Mohamed Irshad,Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member),"The development of the Citizen Farm not only showcased the viability of small-scale urban farming set-ups in Singapore, but also highlighted the potential to convert underused, marginal land for interim purposes. Moreover, these farming models are designed to be moveable and, therefore, can be easily adapted to various spaces. Such set-ups could help to supplement local food production. In addition, these set-ups also provide much-needed spaces for start-ups to explore innovations in the agrotechnology sector. Moving forward, we can also look up to Japan as an example for how urban farming can be expanded and integrated into the life of our city. Sometimes, creativity and flexibility go a long way in maximising the potential of underused spaces.",12,444,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00444

Given SFA's role as a main regulator on all matters relating to food, from farm to fork, how does it concurrently intend to play a role in promoting and developing the food industry, and would there be an overlap with Enterprise Singapore? SFA can serve as a good example of how both regulatory and industry promotion functions sit within a single agency, allowing not just more pro-enterprise outcomes, but greater agility in serving the needs of the industry.",13,445,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00445

This represents an important opportunity for Singapore to capitalise from the growing global halal market by increasing international usage of its recognised standards of halal food accreditation. Thus, I would like to ask if the SFA plans to work with MUIS and relevant economic agencies to ride on this growing demand for halal products and services globally and to capture a market for Singapore.",14,446,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00446

The networks must be established, but we must also bear in mind the ring-fencing of the security of our food resources and sources is important. This is because in this age of terrorism, food can serve as a source of targeted widespread terrorist type attacks, to impact large numbers of people at one time, and we must ensure vigilance at all times. Thus, even with diversification, we need to maintain surveillance and monitoring and must never let our guard down.

But the Unit also noted that Singapore is most vulnerable to potential disruptions to our food supply due to climate change and natural resource risks.

This reflected the experience and concerns of ordinary Singaporeans, which were reported in the press. However, Minister Chan also said this increase was mitigated by other import sources, the prices of which remained stable or declined by up to 7%. On average, thus, the local retail price of eggs only increased around 4%.",7,470,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00470

I suspect the 50% increase is for the cheaper eggs imported by land and sea transport from neighbouring countries, and the other sources are much more expensive eggs air-flown from Australia and New Zealand and other places. Thus, the average retail price did not seem to have increased much. The more important point here is that the low average rise in the price of eggs conceal the fact that the lower income households are disproportionately affected by the 50% increase in the price of cheaper eggs.",8,471,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00471
2019-02-12-T-015,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Nevertheless, Minister Chan's answer points to how rising food prices can be mitigated by strategies targeted at our food supply sources. He said that, quote, ""we must continually and consciously diversify our supply sources and supply chains to avoid being held ransom by the discontinuity in any particular supply source or disruption to any supply chain.

The Lien Centre for Social Innovation researchers found that around two-fifths of the households surveyed experienced mild food insecurity, meaning that they worried about the ability to obtain food, while one-third experienced moderate insecurity, having to compromise on quality and variety of food. Around one-fifth experienced severe insecurity, cutting down on quantity consumed and experiencing actual hunger.",15,478,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00478

2019-02-12-T-015,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"First, regulations should clearly define terms used in the sale of food, such as ""best before"", ""consume by"", ""sell by"", ""use by"" and ""expiry"" dates. Presently, these terms denoting dates all have the same meaning – which is that businesses are not legally allowed to sell an item past the indicated date. However, if some of these terms in fact only denote the food manufacturer's recommended period of consumption for the food items sold, then regulations can be enacted to extend the shelf life of, for instance, processed foods on the condition that the food is donated to charities. This allows for food to be redistributed instead of being discarded.",13,496,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00496
2019-02-12-T-015,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Second, and I acknowledge that this might be controversial, the law should make it costly for businesses to throw away edible food. Donating food which remains edible but is no longer retailable costs time and manpower. Businesses therefore prefer to discard food because it is cheaper and more convenient to do so. Policies which disincentivise edible food wastage will push businesses to seek alternatives. In France, a law was enacted in 2016 exactly for this. The enactment of such regulations certainly requires much preparatory legwork such as better measurement and reporting of how much food is discarded, so commissioning a continuous collection and study of data concerning food waste would be most important and relevant to clause 5(1)(n) of the Bill. After all, if we cannot measure something, we cannot improve it. Another step could be to legislate that all food imported or grown in Singapore has to be sold or donated, with a similar concept to the Extended Producer Responsibility that is coming into effect for e-waste.",14,497,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00497
2019-02-12-T-015,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Given that such a policy would be controversial, it should be accompanied by a third complementary measure  a law which incentivises businesses to donate food to charity. This could come in the form of tax rebates from food donations. Ideally, the charities which receive food donations should be the ones to weigh the donations received and provide receipts to the businesses for their food donations. The tax rebate should also be based on weight of food donated, not price.",15,498,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00498

We know that we will not be able to feed future population growth if the world continues to produce and consume food the way we currently do. At the same time, research is also showing that with changing air quality, concentration of CO2 as well as soil quality, the levels of nutrition in our staple foods could change drastically. This dual challenge requires radical re-imagination of the world's food production systems. New farming techniques, plant-based meats, alternative protein, all these developments require adaptable food regulations that allow for rapid adoption without compromising on food safety considerations.",16,499,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00499

2019-02-12-T-015,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"First, let me start with trust. There is a trust deficit in food, especially in developing Asia. Most Asian customers do not fully trust the industry. In fact, where there are many international standards for food, both at a general and industry level, these standards are usually  one, not well understood by customers; two, too narrowly defined. For example, the important Good Manufacturing Process (GMP) standard does not provide end-to-end assurance of food products; and three, not well enforced.

Three reasons  one, in selected areas such as fresh vegetables, processed food, poultry, Singapore has gone beyond certifying food that comes to Singapore. Singapore even sending officers overseas to accredit the food supply chain across the world for these key areas. Second, Singapore has adopted food standards similar to that of the European Union. Third, we already certify food outside Singapore. A little known fact is that the China's Jilin province is collaborating with Singapore through the Jilin-Singapore Food Industry Park. Therefore, the Singapore Government has set up, I was told, a certification arm in Jilin. Over time, I was told, this certification arm will stamp the ""Approved by Singapore"" mark on those products, and these products will be eligible for import to Singapore.",7,515,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00515

Singapore has limited land available for farming, and we have limited fishing grounds as well. According to statistics from the AVA, we import over 90% of the food consumed in our country. Our local farms can produce only a small amount of food that we eat and we are heavily reliant on food sourced overseas.

It is vital for the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) to continue the good work of AVA by ensuring that we continue to have diverse and reliable sources of food imports, to prevent a situation of food shortage due to changes in the political climate of other countries, disease outbreaks, or climate change. While we were ranked first in the GFS Index, we achieved this mainly due to the affordability of our food. If we look at the Index’s other key metric on Quality and Safety, we are ranked 24th.

Food safety is a cause for concern. With the creation of SFA and the powers accorded to it, there must be enhanced measures put in place to strengthen our food safety regime. Under the current policy, food hygiene certificate holders only need to attend their first refresher training after 5 years from completing their Basic Food Hygiene Course. Subsequent refresher training courses are required only every 10 years thereafter. This is too long a gap. I am of the view that the duration between re-certification should be shortened to send a strong message to the industry on the importance of keeping a high level of food hygiene standard at the workplace.",5,524,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00524

2019-02-12-T-015,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Mr Speaker, the flip side of ensuring that we have a steady stream of food supply is ensuring that we minimise the food that we waste. According to the NEA, the amount of food waste generated in Singapore has increased by about 40% over the past 10 years. In 2017 alone, more than 676,000 tonnes of food waste was disposed. We must tackle the issue of food wastage. I am heartened to note that bigger supermarket chains such as NTUC Fairprice have started to take this issue seriously. Fairprice now packages “ugly-looking” fruits and vegetables, which are just as nutritional, and sell them at discounted rates rather than to simply dispose of them. I believe more can be done in terms of public education, and I would like the SFA to take on an active role in reducing food wastage. Another way of reducing food wastage is to better match producers of excess food to recipients who need it. Can the SFA also play a matchmaker role to link charitable organisations with those who have excess food that can be donated on a timely basis?",7,526,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00526

Singapore has diversified our water resources to ensure that we are self-sufficient. Food security is an important next step towards further self-sufficiency. Singapore imports most of our food from our immediate neighbours. We have to import widely and diversely to minimise disruption to our food supplies. Singapore aims to be friendly with our neighbours, but that is not always possible. Our neighbours have recently announced that sales of certain food products to Singapore will be curtailed.

We have Temasek rice, high-tech fish farms, high-tech vegetable farms, to name a few. All started and operated by local companies. These companies have begun to expand overseas. Where there is an abundance of land, water, labour and as the Minister mentioned, energy. This will help Singapore to further augment and secure our food supply.

2019-02-12-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.]  Some time ago, we faced issues on several matters related to national security. Just to name two, one is the issue of oil supply and the other is water. Over the years, through good strategic planning, we were able to navigate ourselves so that we are able to build ample reserves of these two resources to meet our national security needs. Today, we are addressing another one of these challenges and that is food safety and supply.",2,548,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00548
2019-02-12-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"We have seen how, in recent years, food safety and supply is in the limelight. There was the outbreak of “mad cow” or BSE, and then the avian influenza which undermined consumer confidence in the producers as well as the processors, and even in the governments where these diseases broke out. In fact, in February 2003, when SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) broke out in Singapore, it could have resulted in some serious consequences if we were unable to take swift action to get things under control. Hence, the setting up of the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) will make us better placed to look into various aspects of our food supply, from its procurement, production and hygiene to the provision of accurate information for consumers.",3,549,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00549
2019-02-12-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"We can see how, during the festive season, from Chinese New Year, Hari Raya to Deepavali, certain food items would experience a spike in prices. Sometimes, this is because supply is temporarily disrupted due to disease outbreak, and at other times, it was because of supply-demand factors.",4,550,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00550
2019-02-12-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Therefore, NTUC Fairprice and other importers, with the support from our Government, have in recent times been actively looking at alternative sources of supply. This is important so that we could be assured of a stable supply.",5,551,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00551
2019-02-12-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Can I ask the Minister, how are we tapping on our business organisations to continually look for new and reliable sources of supply? Is there a need for SFA to tap on bodies like EDB or even our Trade Consular Officers under MFA to source for new food supply? In key strategic countries, would there be a need for SFA to set up its own offices in these countries, so that we can get our man on the ground to look at the production, processing and handling, as well as testing before the food reaches our shores?",6,552,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00552
2019-02-12-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"We are also living in an age where production and farming overseas will have artificial preservatives added to foods. For example, the preservatives used to stop the browning and discoloration of food have been linked to an asthma-related sensitivity and allergy in some cases. How do we then monitor the use of artificial preservatives in food products that are imported here? Some of these synthetic preservatives are harmful to health. For example, last October, the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) removed seven synthetic flavouring substances and flavour enhancers from its list of approved Food Additives. Based on evidence presented to FDA by the various petitioners, who stated that benzophenone causes cancer in animals, the FDA amended the food additive regulations to no longer provide for its use as a plasticizer in rubber articles intended for repeated use in contact with food. So, there are many changes in the management of additives and other food related matters in the food chain, and I foresee our new food agency would have a very busy schedule ahead.",7,553,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00553
2019-02-12-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I would also like to ask the Minister how many food scientists do we have and whether we would be expanding our team of experts to cope with the role of the new food agency? Next, under the penalties for a person who is found falsifying or using without lawful authority any accreditation, certification or inspection mark, a Court trying the offenders has the power to direct that any property in respect of which the offence has been committed can be forfeited. May I ask what happens, and we know it is quite often the case, that the offender may just be a lessee or tenant of a premises, how then does the Court handle such cases? A restaurant, for example, that may not own the premises, but is merely a tenant?",8,554,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00554
2019-02-12-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Another issue which I would like to ask is that, is there any process for an owner or management of a restaurant to ensure that all its employees who are handling food are in good health? Would a restaurant be penalised if, say, its employee has a bad flu and yet he is in the kitchen handling food? Lastly, for the protection of public health and safety, how often audits or checks are made at the various eateries, restaurants, and the like, to ensure that all steps have been taken to ensure that a high hygiene standard is maintained? As we know, prevention is better than reacting and suspending a food establishment only after people fall victim to food poisoning.",9,555,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00555
2019-02-12-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Therefore, the scope of the new Agency is very wide and it would require a large team to check the food industry, from manufacturing right down to the kitchen in restaurants and other places where food is served to customers.",10,556,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00556
2019-02-12-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"With that, Mr Speaker, I support this Bill.",11,557,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00557

2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The SFA will focus on food safety and food security. These are mutually reinforcing objectives. Food safety is a pre-requisite for a resilient food supply, and key to developing a thriving agri-food industry. Allow me to outline SFA’s priorities in these two areas, and address some of the specific comments. I will start with food security.",2,560,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00560
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Ong Teng Koon referred to recent potential disruptions in our egg and seafood imports, and asked how SFA can better handle such incidents without causing alarm. The answer is that SFA will ensure our food security by developing and enhancing our three national strategies to obtain food. We call these our three ""food baskets"".",3,561,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00561
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"First, SFA will build on the existing work by AVA to diversify import sources. AVA has already expanded our import sources from 140 countries in 2004 to around 180 countries today. We take for granted apples from Poland, bananas from Ecuador, and Mandarin oranges from China in our supermarkets. These are, in fact, the fruits of a deliberate strategy to diversify our food sources.",4,562,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00562
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Imports will remain our largest food basket for the foreseeable future. SFA, in partnership with relevant Government agencies like MFA and ESG, will continue to diversify our food sources as Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Saktiandi Supaat have suggested. This includes working with importers to organise overseas sourcing trips and business matching sessions, as well as increasing the number of farms across different countries which can export to Singapore. In fact, our officers were accrediting farms in Thailand over the Lunar New Year break while many of us Singaporeans were taking a break and enjoying good food with our families. I would like to express my appreciation to our officers who have worked hard over the years to strengthen our food security and safeguard our national security.",5,563,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00563
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Our food importers are also a key node in the supply chain, and we must ensure that they are prepared to withstand potential shocks from climate change and geopolitical developments, as highlighted by Mr Mohamed Irshad. SFA will introduce requirements for importers of key food items to adopt plans to mitigate any supply disruptions. As Mr Ong Teng Koon has highlighted, food security is fundamental to national security. In the long run, securing our food supply is also the primary way to mitigate price volatility and spikes. This is a focus of SFA, which will continue to contribute to whole-of-Government efforts to provide affordable food, accessible to all Singaporeans, as highlighted by Assoc Prof Daniel Goh.",6,564,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00564
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Second, SFA will intensify efforts to grow an agri-food ecosystem in Singapore, as suggested by Mr Mohamed Irshad and Mr Melvin Yong, thereby reducing our dependence on imports.",7,565,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00565
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"This requires close coordination between SFA and other Government agencies in domains such as land planning, industry development and financing, and skills training. SFA will also partner our industry stakeholders across the food supply chain to catalyse industry transformation.",8,566,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00566
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Transforming the industry requires us to cultivate a generation of ""agri-specialists"". AVA has been working with Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) in this area. One such initiative is the ""Earn and Learn Programme"", a work study programme through which students from Temasek Polytechnic and Republic Polytechnic work at local farms and apply the knowledge and practical skills learnt in school. SFA will continue working with the industry and IHLs to enhance manpower development for the agriculture sector, as raised by Mr Melvin Yong, and create meaningful value-added jobs for our future workforce.",9,567,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00567
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Given our lack of natural resources such as land and water, the future of farming in Singapore has to be one that is technology and R&D driven, climate resilient and resource efficient with high productivity. Going forward, we expect to expand further into controlled environment agriculture in indoor vertical farming and deep sea fish farming in our waters.",10,568,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00568
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,We recognise the contributions by our existing farmers. They bring valuable experience and we will like to continue working with them to improve Singapore’s food security. We will take a pragmatic approach by helping existing farms modernise.,11,569,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00569
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In addition to productivity, we will also prioritise the environmental sustainability of food production. As part of the MEWR family, SFA will work closely with NEA and PUB to find synergies in food production, water, waste and energy. This will ensure that our local food supply will remain resilient in the face of wider trends such as resource scarcity and climate change.",12,570,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00570
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Together, we can become a world leader in agri-food solutions, just like how we have turned our constraints in water to strategic advantages. Our Water Story, which Members, including Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Ms Anthea Ong, had talked about, is well-known internationally. SFA will work together across the Government, and with industry and other stakeholders, including fellow Singaporeans, to write the Singapore Food Story.",13,571,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00571
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Third, SFA will continue supporting our companies to expand and grow overseas. These overseas-based Singapore companies will be able to overcome land constraints and even manpower constraints, and access new and bigger overseas markets. This allows them to bring down costs through economies of scale, and reduce the price of exports to Singapore.",14,572,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00572
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mr Henry Kwek has also rightly identified this as an area of tremendous economic opportunity for our local companies, especially if our companies develop expertise in highly sought-after farming technologies – resource efficient, high yield, and climate resilient.",15,573,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00573
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Barramundi Asia, which aspires to produce the fish equivalent of Kobe beef, has expanded to Brunei, where they are developing a 6,600 hectare fish farm to export an estimated 40,000 tonnes of fish back to Singapore. I hope to see more of our local farms succeeding in overseas markets.",16,574,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00574
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Our three food baskets are what I call ""supply-side strategies"". However, the demand side of the equation is equally important. SFA will continue to prioritise public education and outreach to complement the three food baskets as mentioned by Mr Mohamed Irshad. These include supporting local produce as suggested by Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Melvin Yong, and promoting the consumption of substitutes such as liquid eggs, and more sustainable foods such as plant-based protein as suggested by Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mr Mohamed Irshad. I will also like to assure Mr Saktiandi Supaat that even as we allow new food to come in, SFA will take reference from global standards, such as those set by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, in permitting food additives for use in Singapore.",17,575,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00575
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Ms Anthea Ong and Mr Melvin Yong raised an important initiative which AVA and NEA are already collaborating on – reducing food waste. In fact, food waste is one of NEA's priorities in the Year Towards Zero Waste. My Ministry recognises that Government regulations may promote the reduction of food waste, and will look further into it with our partners, taking into consideration other factors such as food safety and business costs. I urge Ms Anthea Ong, Mr Melvin Yong and other Members to continue supporting community efforts to redistribute food better so that there is no hunger even among our needy and in the process, reduce food waste.",18,576,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00576
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I will now move on to outline three strategies which SFA will adopt to ensure the safety of food in Singapore, an area which many Members have spoken about.",19,577,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00577
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"First, the formation of SFA will integrate operations related to food safety which currently reside across AVA, NEA and HSA. These range from providing a single contact point for the public to provide feedback as suggested by Ms Anthea Ong, to combining contact tracing and industry engagement operations. This will allow SFA to manage more holistically across the entire farm-to-fork supply chain to pinpoint and remedy critical points, and react more quickly to food safety incidents, as raised by Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, Prof Fatimah Lateef and Mr Saktiandi Supaat.",20,578,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00578
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,These efforts over the years have strengthened coordination across Government in response to food safety threats. I thank Mr Henry Kwek for recognising efforts by the agencies to keep swine flu out of our food supply.,21,579,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00579
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"AVA, NEA and MOH work closely under the One Health framework and follow a protocol to respond to, and address food-borne outbreaks.

2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Second, having a single agency like the SFA will support consistent administration and enforcement of the regulatory framework for food establishments balanced against supporting enterprise and job creation.",23,581,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00581
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, Mr Mohamed Irshad and Ms Anthea Ong have suggested, we can harness technology and data to make our regulatory regime more effective and efficient. Let me give an example. Joyvio, one of the largest end-to-end fruit companies in China, developed an app that tracks the product's thousand-mile journey from a vine to the supermarket shelf. With a simple scan, shoppers can tell which field the fruit came from, who was in charge of its production, what tests it went through before entering the market, and even details about the soil and water tests from the farm. This allows consumers to check that the fruit has not been contaminated anywhere along the way. Similar ideas can be applied in Singapore.",24,582,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00582
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As suggested by Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mr Saktiandi Supaat, SFA will also raise the level of accountability of operators and the food industry which must take greater responsibility for the hygiene standards at their premises to ensure food safety. This will be complemented with robust enforcement as suggested by Mr Leon Perera.",25,583,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00583
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In fact, over the last five years, NEA has conducted more than 600,000 unannounced inspections of food retail outlets. Where necessary, we will enhance regulatory oversight and penalties. As Mr Mohamed Irshad has highlighted, our regulatory regime will need to evolve with changing business models including online food sales and food delivery.",26,584,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00584
2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In addition to the emphasis on food safety, SFA will as part of its functions look into harmonising licensing standards and combining existing licences for food businesses. Our vision is for businesses across the supply chain to only have to interface with one agency. This will take time, and we will work closely with industry to put in place facilitative regulations.",27,585,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00585

2019-02-12-T-015,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Consolidation will also eliminate the need for food samples to be tested in multiple laboratories across different agencies, with different competencies. This streamlining of processes as well as the sharing of facilities and technology will allow for greater operational, testing and cost efficiencies to be achieved. This further ensures that our food continues to be safe for consumption, and standards are benchmarked internationally. The NCFS will also develop commercial laboratories to support the food safety testing needs of food businesses as production and exports increase.",34,592,2019-02-12-T-015-S-00592

With food issues as well as wildlife management and animal welfare issues are becoming more significant these days. It is important that they be managed under specific bodies with the relevant resources and expertise. The newly created Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and the expanded NParks will certainly have their work cut out for them, but this re-organisation is a step in the right direction for sure. With better defined responsibilities, they will be able to act on them more efficiently and effectively.",1,613,2019-02-12-T-016-S-00613

One woman was even bitten by a python outside her house on the second storey of an HDB flat. Wild boars, too, are a cause for concern, as there have been several cases of wild boars attacking people. And let us also not forget about the monkeys harassing residents, first in the condominiums, and now in densely populated HDB estates too. And, recently, I received several feedback from my residents monkeys are found at the bus stops and overhead bridge near Yishun Stadium. They were so worried when they have children with them. So, there would be a lot on the plate of NParks to manage as I can foresee.",3,615,2019-02-12-T-016-S-00615

Furthermore, she was told that that snake is a python, it is non-poisonous. It is correct but can you just imagine this poor grandmother in front is a snake but behind is her grandchild. By the time I came to know about it, I quickly called Town Council to send a pest controller down and catch the snake but by the time it is too late, the snake has disappeared. So, can you imagine how much stress it is causing to the resident living in that ground floor unit, not just her unit but all the neighbours on the ground floor because they do not know when will the snake appear again.",5,617,2019-02-12-T-016-S-00617

Although fishing is illegal along certain river banks, it is not uncommon to see people fishing illegally. On weekends, especially, along the Sungei Seletar in Springleaf Estate, one can see fishermen decked out in hats and fishing rods, sitting or standing on the river banks to fish. This, despite signages clearly stating ""No Fishing"" in that area. Over-fishing will result in an upset in the biodiversity of the river. And not only that, some of the fishing rods get hooked on other river animals like otters.

In Nee Soon South Zone A, many residents complaining about sighting of big, big rats and I went down at night to take a look. True enough, I can see many rats dancing about, running about and I activated NEA, AVA and Town Council. We formed a Rat Task Force. We found that the root cause actually is the food left behind by cat feeders, several cat feeders, not just one and when they walked away, the rats come and eat, the big cockroaches come and eat and I asked NEA to act, they said cannot, there was an agreement by AVA and Cat Society to leave food there for two hours. So, many cat feeders mean many two hours – how to solve the rat issue. Rats multiplied very fast well. Town Council and NEA have been working very hard. They have been treating the burrows, sealing the burrows, catch the rats at least twice a week but we do not seem to be able to solve the problem.",12,624,2019-02-12-T-016-S-00624

I have a resident who keeps many cats in her flat and does not exercise good hygiene or proper cat litter box practice. This case has been going on for more than four years and the stench from the cat faeces is unbearable for the neighbours.

2019-02-12-T-016,,,"Sir, we have been culling animals for decades. I ask that we look at this not just from an animal welfare perspective but also look at it from an effectiveness perspective. Culling has clearly not worked. If culling worked, we would not have the same animal-related problems in the same areas year after year. We spend tons of resources, including financial resources, on a solution that does not seem to produce results. Can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary also confirm whether there are any scientific studies that show that our current culling measures work?",2,661,2019-02-12-T-016-S-00661
2019-02-12-T-016,,,"As a biologist by training and having done a literature review, I have found no scientific studies that support our current culling measures. Certainly, there are no scientific studies that suggest culling based on public complaints is effective. In fact, there is scientific research that shows the contrary, that is, that culling not only fails to reduce the population, it actually leads to an increase.",3,662,2019-02-12-T-016-S-00662
2019-02-12-T-016,,,"We have to understand that with our current measures, while there is a clear reduction in numbers following a cull, at times within a few weeks, with pigeon, for example, the pigeon numbers may be back to the pre-cull numbers and, at times, exceed it. Why? Because we usually kill the adult birds who may be the non-breeding birds. The younger, healthier and stronger breeding birds survive the cull. According to the Pigeon Control Advisory Service, “pigeons control their own numbers very effectively according to the volume of food available to them. An adult pair of pigeons will usually breed four to six times a year but can breed more frequently in optimum conditions, producing two young each time. If, however, the food supply reduces and there is only sufficient food available to support the existing flock, adult birds may only breed once or twice a year or possibly not at all.",4,663,2019-02-12-T-016-S-00663
2019-02-12-T-016,,,"Pigeons will not breed if there is insufficient food to service the needs of their young. If the food supply increases for any reason, following a cull, for example, pigeons will breed continuously until the flock reaches the point where it is fully exploiting the food available to it. In other words, there is a minor population explosion each time a cull takes place. The end result is an estimated 15%-30% increment in flock size over and above the pre-cull figure.”",5,664,2019-02-12-T-016-S-00664
2019-02-12-T-016,,,"Sir, many others have used culling as a solution and have found as well that it does not work. In the City of Basel, for example, they had 20,000 pigeons in 1963. Over a period of 24 years of intensive culling, they killed 100,000 pigeons. In 1988, they did a count. Instead of having 20,000 pigeons, they now have 30,000 pigeons. Despite the culling, the population increased by 33%.",6,665,2019-02-12-T-016-S-00665
2019-02-12-T-016,,,"Clearly, culling did not work. The City of Basel then focused on a public awareness campaign to address the public feeding of pigeons. It installed pigeon lofts, removed the pigeon eggs and controlled the availability of food. Within four and a half years, the city’s pigeon population decreased to 10,000 birds. Some culling continued during this period but that was to prevent the birds from starving to death due to the lack of food. This is very different from the culling that takes place in Singapore, which takes place in response to public complaints.",7,666,2019-02-12-T-016-S-00666
2019-02-12-T-016,,,"The culling of monkeys is similarly ineffective as it is usually the young ones who get trapped. The mother monkey which lost her young goes into heat again, the male monkey mates with her and another baby is born, replacing the monkey which was killed. If we somehow manage to kill an entire troop, the neighbouring troop will then take over the territory of the troop who were killed, with more resources, they breed more and, sooner than later, we will have the same number of monkeys again.",8,667,2019-02-12-T-016-S-00667

2019-02-12-T-016,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Firstly, about the wild birds. I think we would all agree that most of us want to live and work in environments which integrate nature with man-made structures. Very few people would choose to live in a sterile estate with only concrete buildings. The challenge we face is in striking a balance between the management of wildlife and human populations.",3,673,2019-02-12-T-016-S-00673
2019-02-12-T-016,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Having birds and other creatures around us is good and necessary for our well-being. However, they can also be the sources of disamenity, such as noise pollution and animal waste. Some residents have shared their concerns over the population of wild birds with me, particularly species which are growing in numbers. Does NParks have plans to manage such wild bird populations in our estates? How would NParks tackle big populations of certain birds which appear seasonally? Would the choice of particular trees or plants help to resolve the problems of certain wild birds in our HDB estates?",4,674,2019-02-12-T-016-S-00674
2019-02-12-T-016,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Secondly, about keeping pets in HDB flats. In recent years, I have been receiving many feedback relating to problems created by increasing pet ownership in our HDB estates. Some residents complain about incessant barking; others are dismayed by the foul smell of pets’ urine along common corridors and void decks; irresponsible owners who leave pets’ faeces on the ground are also a big problem. Personally, I am quite worried about pets which are mistreated by owners who have lost interest in them, such as by confining them in small cages. I would like to ask how NParks will proceed in tackling these problems, including how it will work with other agencies and Ministries.",5,675,2019-02-12-T-016-S-00675

2019-02-12-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Let me start by addressing Members’ comments on the Bill. Mr Louis Ng expressed concerns about the limiting effect of the new definition of “animal” which replaces the present one in the National Parks Board Act. The new definition is non-exhaustive, as signified by the use of the word “includes”. The new definition in the Bill therefore allows for the inclusion of invertebrates as an animal.",2,679,2019-02-12-T-018-S-00679
2019-02-12-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Ng also asked why we split the duties of AVA’s Director-General of Agri-Food and Veterinary Services among four newly-created Director-Generals in the Animals and Birds Act, the Wild Animals and Birds Act, the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act, and the Control of Plants Act. The administration of each of these four Acts will be transferred under the Bill from AVA to NParks. Each Act has a significant different and distinct purpose and scope from the other. Hence, the Bill provides the flexibility to appoint separate technical experts for each role. But notwithstanding this, as Mr Ng has pointed out, the same person could be appointed as the Director-General for more than one role, if he or she has the right expertise. Regardless of the number of officers performing these roles, they will report to the same CEO who will ensure that there continues to be close coordination across the different teams.",3,680,2019-02-12-T-018-S-00680
2019-02-12-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Prof Fatimah Lateef asked about the staffing arrangements. The senior management of AVA and NParks have engaged their staff through several townhalls and engagement sessions to ensure that they are aware of their roles and reporting structure after the reorganisation. All AVA staff in its present food-related and non-food undertakings, including secondees, will be transferred to the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and NParks respectively. The Member may wish to refer to the new section 25(6) which is inserted by clause 7 of the Bill for AVA’s non-food undertakings. Persons on secondment in AVA’s food-related undertakings will have been transferred to the SFA under the Singapore Food Agency Bill 2019 which this House has just passed.",4,681,2019-02-12-T-018-S-00681
2019-02-12-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Members also spoke about animal management. Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Gan Thiam Poh spoke about the need for us to co-exist harmoniously with animals, birds, and other types of wildlife. Indeed, in our biophilic City in a Garden, we live in close proximity to nature and should continue to try to minimise friction in human-animal interactions. The transfer of animal-related functions from AVA to NParks will put us in a better position to do so in several ways.",5,682,2019-02-12-T-018-S-00682
2019-02-12-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"First, as Er Dr Lee suggested, we will continue to heighten public awareness regarding wildlife. Should members of the public encounter wildlife such as snakes or wild boars, they can call the existing Animal Response Centre at 1800-476-1600, which NParks will take over from AVA. This is also the hotline that Prof Fatimah enquired about. We have also put up advisories in parks where there have been previous sightings of wild boars so members of the public know how to react if they come across them. NParks will also continue to work with nature groups, town councils, as well as schools on public education and engagement programmes. For instance, AVA and NParks are members of the Long-tailed Macaque Working Group alongside volunteers from animal interest groups, such as the Jane Goodall Institute. The Working Group’s flagship community education project, the Monkey Guards Programme, teaches people how to respond to monkeys and to guide them away from residential areas.",6,683,2019-02-12-T-018-S-00683
2019-02-12-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Er Dr Lee has raised the issue about stray cat feeding. Many community cats are taken care of by regular, responsible feeders. In this regard, agencies have worked with the Cat Welfare Society to adopt a calibrated approach to allow such feeding whilst taking action to prevent disamenities. When NEA officers encountered cat feeders, they take down their particulars. If the officers return and find that the site is not cleared after a reasonable amount of time, they will be able to carry out enforcement using the particulars collected earlier. But we take the point that Er Dr Lee has raised. At locations where cat feeding has exacerbated rat problems, NEA and AVA will work with the CWS to tighten the processes. For instance, feeders may be asked to clear up immediately to mitigate the problem.",7,684,2019-02-12-T-018-S-00684
2019-02-12-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Next, NParks will build on AVA’s existing partnerships with animal interest groups, animal-related businesses and other stakeholders, as it continues to refine and implement our animal and wildlife management strategy. NParks will also work closely with other public agencies in carrying out its functions. Er Dr Lee raised the issue of illegal fishing at Sungei Seletar. NParks and PUB will continue to monitor the situation and step up enforcement where necessary. To address Dr Fatimah’s question on how NParks will partner other agencies to safeguard public health, NParks will join MOH and NEA, as well as SFA, which currently work closely together to address public health issues. This is made an express new function of NParks in clause 3(a) of the Bill. In particular, NParks will be contributing its expertise in veterinary health and zoonotic diseases to the group.",8,685,2019-02-12-T-018-S-00685
2019-02-12-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"NParks will also undertake a holistic review of the regulatory approach for animal-related businesses such as pet boarders, pet breeders, and veterinary centres. As part of this review, NParks will engage industry players and animal interest groups, to find the right balance across their various needs and interests.",9,686,2019-02-12-T-018-S-00686
2019-02-12-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Third, we will continue to take a holistic science-based approach to animal management This entails understanding the underlying drivers, putting in place appropriate public education programmes, and applying the appropriate animal-management measures for each specific case. A sustainable animal management strategy requires a holistic suite of measures. This can include removal of food sources, use of contraceptives, habitat modification and population control.",10,687,2019-02-12-T-018-S-00687
2019-02-12-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"For instance, Mr Gan and Mr Ng spoke about the management of wild birds in HDB estates. AVA has worked closely with grassroots organisations, Town Councils and NEA to educate the public about proper food waste management, as well as stepped up enforcement in problem areas where the presence of improperly disposed food waste exacerbates the situation. AVA has repeatedly highlighted in its public communications that such food sources attract birds and increases their population. This point has been carried by various media outlets, such as The Straits Times, Channel News Asia, and Today in their coverage of such issues.",11,688,2019-02-12-T-018-S-00688
2019-02-12-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Apart from controlling food sources, AVA has trialled various measures to move the birds away from trees near residential areas such as the use of lasers, natural bird repellent and passing low electrical currents through roost trees. A variety of measures are used and there is no reliance on any one single method for a quick-fix. Taking on board the lessons that AVA has learnt in dealing with wild birds, NParks will monitor the population, occurrence, diet and movement of wild birds, so as to develop effective long-term strategies to mitigate the disamenities caused by them. For example, NParks is replacing roost trees with other trees that still provide shade but are less attractive to the birds, to reduce the number of roosting sites. We have also found recently that with the pruning of potential roost trees, we are able to direct birds away from roosting closely to residential areas.",12,689,2019-02-12-T-018-S-00689
2019-02-12-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I would like to assure Members that NParks will undertake a holistic and scientific approach, and also learn appropriate lessons from experiences overseas to support our efforts in wildlife and animal management. For example, by applying population studies, active tracking and modelling techniques, NParks was able to identify the various troops of macaques in the Upper Thomson area. NParks then worked with the grassroots leaders and residents to stem habits like feeding and poor handling of household trash, and to actively drive the macaques away from residential areas. Only when a macaque has acted aggressively, will NParks step in to relocate it, or if necessary, put it down for public safety reasons.",13,690,2019-02-12-T-018-S-00690
2019-02-12-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"To address Prof Fatimah’s question about NParks’ budget for animal management, we are currently focusing on ensuring a smooth transition for all stakeholders and continuity for all existing programmes.

2019-02-12-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Prof Fatimah also asked if there would be changes to the National Biodiversity Centre, which is currently under NParks. With the reorganisation, NParks will be able to integrate its existing expertise in biodiversity, conservation and ecology with AVA’s capabilities in animal and plant health, as well as veterinary science. This will enable NParks to add new dimensions to its Nature Conservation Master Plan, which is coordinated by National Biodiversity Centre. For example, NParks will be able to better incorporate the monitoring and management of zoonotic diseases into its wildlife management and species recovery programmes.",15,692,2019-02-12-T-018-S-00692
2019-02-12-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Next, let me address Members’ comments on pets. I fully agree with Mr Gan that pet owners need to be responsible for the welfare of their pets. The Animals and Birds Act has mandated that pet owners show a duty of care to their pets. NParks will continue AVA’s good work to remind pet owners that “A Pet is for Life”. Through the Responsible Pet Ownership programme, we hope to equip potential pet owners with knowledge on the care and responsibility that comes with owning a pet. With the Bill, NParks will take over the administration of the Animals and Birds Act, and its officers will be suitably empowered to take enforcement action against anyone who commits an act of animal cruelty or fails to provide adequate care for their pets.",16,693,2019-02-12-T-018-S-00693
2019-02-12-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Gan and Mr Yee Chia Hsing highlighted the issue of irresponsible pet owners in HDB flats causing disamenities to their neighbours. In such cases, AVA, and in future, NParks and HDB will work with the flat owners, grassroots leaders and Animal Welfare Groups to resolve the issues, and to re-home the animals if necessary.",17,694,2019-02-12-T-018-S-00694
2019-02-12-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Under the Housing and Development (Animals) Rules, recalcitrant owners who refuse to allow HDB officers to enter and inspect their premises may be brought to court where they can be fined up to $4,000 upon conviction. In cases where there is reasonable cause to believe that the welfare of the pets is compromised, or there is mistreatment, AVA today has powers under the Animals and Birds Act to enter the premises for investigation. The owners, if convicted in court for failing to provide adequate care for their pets, may be liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both. AVA can also seize the animals if there are concerns about their welfare. To answer Mr Gan, NParks officers will have these same powers even after the Bill is passed.",18,695,2019-02-12-T-018-S-00695
2019-02-12-T-018,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Yee further suggested that agencies be given powers to forcibly remove pets from private homes due to disamenities arising from the pets, but added a caveat that this should only be used when all other avenues have been exhausted.

2019-02-12-T-021,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The majority of students with reported hearing loss in mainstream schools have mild symptoms, and are able to communicate with teachers and peers orally. MOE supports their learning by working with organisations such as the Singapore Association of the Deaf (SADeaf) to provide itinerant educational services to these students. MOE also provides funding for these students to use assistive technological devices such as Frequency Modulation systems to help them access the learning.",2,711,2019-02-12-T-021-S-00711
2019-02-12-T-021,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Students with moderate-to-severe hearing loss who require additional educational support have a number of options. For students who communicate orally, they may enrol in Canossian School, a SPED school offering the national curriculum. Canossian School has a satellite partnership with Canossa Catholic Primary School which enables the students with hearing loss to be fully integrated with their mainstream peers. Upon completion of their primary education, these students may articulate to designated mainstream secondary schools, namely St Anthony’s Canossian Secondary School or Outram Secondary School, where there are Resource Teachers to support the learning needs of students with hearing loss.",3,712,2019-02-12-T-021-S-00712
2019-02-12-T-021,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"For a small number of students who communicate using sign language, they may enrol in Mayflower Primary School, a designated primary school for Hearing Loss (signing) students. At the school, students with Hearing Loss learn alongside their peers, co-taught by a Specialised Teacher using Singapore Sign Language (SgSL). The school is also resourced with an Educational Interpreter who provides sign interpretation for students to access school-wide activities. Upon completion of their primary education, these HL students may progress to Beatty Secondary School, also a designated school for Hearing Loss (signing) students. For students with more complex needs such as both hearing loss and intellectual disability, they may enrol in Lighthouse School which provides a customised curriculum.",4,713,2019-02-12-T-021-S-00713

Apart from climate change impacts, temperature rise is also partly due to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect from urbanisation.",1,716,2019-02-12-T-022-S-00716
2019-02-12-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Government agencies have implemented measures to help Singapore cope with rising temperatures, and have plans to do more. For example, HDB uses urban environmental modelling to design and orient blocks of flats to maximise wind flow and shade in estates. URA, NParks and other agencies have incorporated green open spaces in our urban landscape and distributed greenery to cool the environment through shade provision and evapotranspiration. We are also encouraging the use of coatings and building materials that limit the absorption and retention of solar radiation.",2,717,2019-02-12-T-022-S-00717
2019-02-12-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"A key contributor to the UHI effect is heat generated by human activities requiring energy consumption. Hence, a key strategy under the Climate Action Plan is to improve our overall energy efficiency (EE), particularly in the industry sector which is the largest consumer of energy. I will cite a few examples.",3,718,2019-02-12-T-022-S-00718
2019-02-12-T-022,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We amended the Energy Conservation Act in 2017 to enhance the energy management practices of large industrial energy users.

2019-02-12-T-023,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"To encourage off-peak travel, rail commuters enjoy a discount of up to 50-cents if they tap in before 7.45 am under the Differential Fares Scheme. Since the discount was introduced in December 2017, the number of commuters travelling during the morning pre-peak period has increased by 12%. This is significantly higher than the ridership growth of 2%.",1,724,2019-02-12-T-023-S-00724
2019-02-12-T-023,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,More than 70% of seniors today travel during off-peak hours. Some of those who travel during the peak period are likely to do so for work.
