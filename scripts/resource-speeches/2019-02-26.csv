2019-02-26-T-001,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar,"asked the Minister for Education whether Temasek Polytechnic and Ngee Ann Polytechnic had carried out any due diligence to check the background and academic qualifications of Mikhy Farrera-Brochez who apparently had the qualifications of APA, APS, MCollT, MS DPSY, DipED and who was later convicted of having forged his educational qualifications, before employing him.",1,1,2019-02-26-T-001-S-00001
2019-02-26-T-001,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Education),"Mr Speaker, Sir, prior to employing Mr Mikhy Brochez, Temasek Polytechnic and Ngee Ann Polytechnic had conducted pre-employment checks by verifying copies of Mr Brochez’s educational certificates against the original. This is in line with the practices of the public sector, as well as many private sector companies.",1,2,2019-02-26-T-001-S-00002
2019-02-26-T-001,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Education),"In addition, Mr Brochez demonstrated a good grasp of the subject during his interviews with Polytechnics' management staff, including those with expertise in psychology. These factors led the Polytechnics to decide to hire him.",2,3,2019-02-26-T-001-S-00003
2019-02-26-T-001,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Education),"While due diligence may be conducted thoroughly, there is unfortunately, no system that is able to exhaustively keep out those who are out to lie and cheat.",3,4,2019-02-26-T-001-S-00004
2019-02-26-T-001,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Education),"Temasek Polytechnic and Ngee Ann Polytechnic have since incorporated more stringent checks, including the verification of educational certificates with the issuing institutions. However, there are practical limits to such checks. Some overseas institutions may not provide their confirmation, citing privacy reasons. We are also mindful of not going to the extremes and risk losing out valuable talents. Therefore, the role of in-service performance appraisal and regular monitoring is very important in our HR practices.",4,5,2019-02-26-T-001-S-00005
2019-02-26-T-001,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the answers. However, I find it a bit strange that the Polytechnics checked the copies with the originals. So, if the original is already falsified, then you are just checking a false document against another false document. I would think that there must be a more robust process in place, where the institution that is keen on hiring should check back with the institution that conferred those certificates in the first place. On top of that, there could also be a check with character referees that a potential employee would have worked with in the past.",1,6,2019-02-26-T-001-S-00006
2019-02-26-T-001,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),My second question is whether Temasek Polytechnic allowed Mr Mikhy Brochez to set up that Child Psychology Clinic where he had access to exceptional children through the clinic because that was what was reported. Could MOE verify that?,2,7,2019-02-26-T-001-S-00007
2019-02-26-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Mr Speaker, I would like to thank Dr Intan for her two supplementary questions. For the first, she had some queries and suggestions. Prior to making a hire, all our five Polytechnics conduct pre-employment checks. This is in line with the public sector practice and also many companies in the private sector. These checks include background checks and also checking the applicants' academic qualifications against the original certificates. Since then, Temasek Polytechnic and Ngee Ann Polytechnic have tightened their checks to verify with the issuing institutions, not just for the foreign educational qualifications of new staff but also existing staff. So, that is being done and in progress. In addition to that, since 2014, all our five Polytechnics conduct reference checks with the applicant's previous employers or referees indicated in the application. So, on the first question, I want to assure Dr Intan that MOE will continue to work closely with our five Polytechnics to continue strengthening their recruitment process.",1,8,2019-02-26-T-001-S-00008
2019-02-26-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"On the second question, Mr Brochez taught at Temasek Polytechnic for a period of two years, from February 2009 to January 2011. He taught for a much shorter period of only six months as an Adjunct Lecturer at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. During that stint in Temasek Polytechnic, he taught four modules for the first year students, three modules for second and third year students, a total of only to 85 students. At that point in time, Temasek Polytechnic had a cohort of about 15,900 students, which means the number of students whom he taught represented about 0.5% of the cohort. In Ngee Ann Polytechnic, the percentage of the students he taught was about 1.5%. His work is concentrated on delivering the modules. And even for those modules that the students attended, for Temasek Polytechnic, that comprised about 10% of their graduating requirement. For Ngee Ann Polytechnic, it is even less – it is about 3% of their graduating requirement.",2,9,2019-02-26-T-001-S-00009
2019-02-26-T-001,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar,"I wanted to ask about the plans that Temasek Polytechnic had for him to set up a Child Psychology Clinic within the Polytechnic. Did that go through? Did he have any part in doing that and did he have any access to young children through that planned clinic? And secondly, I would urge MOE to encourage not just the Polytechnics, but also across all our educational institutions, to verify the qualifications and credentials of potential employees, with the institutions that confer them as well as with character referees.",1,10,2019-02-26-T-001-S-00010
2019-02-26-T-001,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"To the first question posed by Dr Intan, his work was confined to delivering the modules, but let me check on that and I will come back to her. For the second question, I want to assure Dr Intan and Members that MOE will spare no effort to work closely with our Polytechnics, Universities and also Institute of Technical Education (ITEs) to strengthen our pre-employment checks and ensure that the standard of academic rigour is kept by our educators in our institutions.",1,11,2019-02-26-T-001-S-00011
2019-02-26-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Dr Intan, next question.",1,12,2019-02-26-T-001-S-00012
2019-02-26-T-002,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar,asked the Minister for Health whether there are stricter measures put in place to ensure blood tests cannot be forged for employment purposes.,1,13,2019-02-26-T-002-S-00013
2019-02-26-T-002,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Health),"Mr Speaker, there are processes in place to ensure the integrity of the blood tests. First, the patient’s identity is verified at several points  when the blood tests are ordered, when the blood is drawn, and when the blood specimens are labelled. At dispatch and receipt by the testing laboratories, the labelled specimens are checked against the identity of the patient recorded in the laboratory test request forms.",1,14,2019-02-26-T-002-S-00014
2019-02-26-T-002,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Health),"For HIV tests, testing laboratories only accept patients or blood specimens with a referral from a registered medical practitioner. Hence, any direct request by employment agencies, employers or prospective employees for employment purposes would be rejected by the HIV testing laboratory.",2,15,2019-02-26-T-002-S-00015
2019-02-26-T-002,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Health),"Doctors who commit fraud involving blood tests or forgery of blood test results will be dealt with sternly, including prosecution under the Penal Code. Additionally, as doctors are required to adhere to a strict code of conduct by the Singapore Medical Council (SMC), they may also be subject to disciplinary action by SMC for professional misconduct.",3,16,2019-02-26-T-002-S-00016
2019-02-26-T-002,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Health),"The process checks, ethical standards to which healthcare professionals are held to and the deterrents imposed, work in tandem to safeguard against the falsification of blood tests.",4,17,2019-02-26-T-002-S-00017
2019-02-26-T-002,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the clarification. May I ask, other than blood tests, how else would MOM monitor possible forgery of work qualifications, academic qualifications, past work experience that may be put up by applicants, especially foreign applicants?",1,18,2019-02-26-T-002-S-00018
2019-02-26-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,Can I just check with Dr Intan if she is referring to prospective employees who are employed by the healthcare sector?,1,19,2019-02-26-T-002-S-00019
2019-02-26-T-002,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar,"Sorry. Okay, for the healthcare sector. I think it was supposed to be directed to MOM.",1,20,2019-02-26-T-002-S-00020
2019-02-26-T-002,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I suppose it would be similar with the other Ministries, in that we would actually check against the authenticity of the certificate, and if necessary, even to verify with the institution that issued the certificate to the prospective employee.",1,21,2019-02-26-T-002-S-00021
2019-02-26-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider issuing guidelines on disability duration for specific injuries for the use of doctors issuing medical leave and light duties for injured workers returning to work.,1,22,2019-02-26-T-003-S-00022
2019-02-26-T-003,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Health),"Mr Speaker, in assessing the need for a medical certificate and its duration, both medical conditions and non medical circumstances need to be considered. These include the type and severity of the medical condition or injury; time needed for the treatment, rehabilitation and recovery; and work requirements and workplace conditions. The circumstances vary widely among different persons, making it difficult to come up with prescriptive guidelines.",1,23,2019-02-26-T-003-S-00023
2019-02-26-T-003,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Health),"The attending doctor should use his or her professional judgement, and when in doubt, consult fellow peers on what is needed to help the patient recover from a medical condition or injury.",2,24,2019-02-26-T-003-S-00024
2019-02-26-T-003,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Health),"To guide this, the SMC revised the Ethical Code which came into effect in 2017. This provides broad guidelines that medical certificates must be issued to patients on proper medical grounds arrived at through good clinical assessment, and doctors must not take into consideration extraneous factors such as who pays for the consultation, what benefits the patients may receive or what employers’ preferences may be. Also, when certifying that patients are fit to return to work but with limitations on their level of activity at work, doctors must first ensure that the patients’ work conditions allow this and, to the best of their ability, ensure that appropriate light duties are in fact available to the patients at their place of work.",3,25,2019-02-26-T-003-S-00025
2019-02-26-T-003,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Health),MOH will study if it is necessary to formulate specific guidance in particular settings and seek inputs from the professional bodies.,4,26,2019-02-26-T-003-S-00026
2019-02-26-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. I just wanted to check the last part. He said that MOH is going to study this issue. Is it going to conduct a review on whether we can set up more specific guidelines, rather than the broad guidelines we have in our code now?",1,27,2019-02-26-T-003-S-00027
2019-02-26-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Secondly, I am asking this in relation to the recent case where the doctor issued two days of light duty for the worker that had a broken collar bone. So, how does MOH ensure that the appropriate number of medical leave or light duty is issued after a surgery or after a work-related accident?",2,28,2019-02-26-T-003-S-00028
2019-02-26-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Mr Speaker, as alluded to in my reply, there are already existing broad guidelines issued by SMC in their ethical code which gives some guidance to doctors on what is expected of them. With regard to whether we will come up with any specific guidance, this is an area where we will consult professional bodies to study whether it is feasible or practical to even do so. However, if the professional bodies think that there may be scope to provide some kind of guidance for certain types of injury, we will take their advice into consideration.",1,29,2019-02-26-T-003-S-00029
2019-02-26-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"With regards to Mr Louis Ng's other question about the duration of Medical Certificates (MCs), this question had also been raised in the last parliamentary sitting by the Member, where a question was posed to MOM about whether MOM will be studying ways to better support the injured workers. MOM has already given the reply that they are currently reviewing it and will be conducting public consultation on this issue.",2,30,2019-02-26-T-003-S-00030
2019-02-26-T-004,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira,"asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) whether the Malaysian government's detention of Greek vessel Piraes and crew, which collided with the Malaysian vessel Polaris in Singapore territorial waters, represents an exercise of foreign sovereignty in Singapore territorial waters; and (b) what measures can be taken to ensure that vessels, crew and passengers, particularly Singapore-flagged, will not be subject to foreign authority whilst in Singapore territorial waters or for acts committed in Singapore territorial waters.",1,31,2019-02-26-T-004-S-00031
2019-02-26-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"On 9 February this year, the Greece-registered bulk carrier Pireas collided with the Malaysian government vessel Polaris in Singapore Territorial Waters off Tuas. A Singapore Police Coast Guard vessel was on-site, observed and recorded the collision. The Maritime Port Authority (MPA) was therefore notified by both the Maritime Security Task Force and by the Pireas, herself. MPA ascertained that this incident was not classified as a “very serious marine casualty” under the IMO Marine Casualty Investigation Code. The ship, Pireas, was therefore allowed to proceed with its journey to its next port of call, which in this case happened to be Tanjung Pelepas in Malaysia.",1,32,2019-02-26-T-004-S-00032
2019-02-26-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),Pireas was not detained by the Malaysian authorities in Singapore Territorial Waters.,2,33,2019-02-26-T-004-S-00033
2019-02-26-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),We will not allow foreign government vessels to assert any authority in our waters.,3,34,2019-02-26-T-004-S-00034
2019-02-26-T-004,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira.,1,35,2019-02-26-T-004-S-00035
2019-02-26-T-004,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Mr Speaker, thank you. I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for that very strong statement that Singapore will not stand for foreign government exercising sovereignty in our waters. I would like to ask if the Minister has any advice for mariners regarding travel or transit through this area? For example, should they take alternate routes and if they are given instructions from Malaysian government vessels, what should they do? Perhaps, what would our forces do if they were to observe attempts to give such instructions in the area?",1,36,2019-02-26-T-004-S-00036
2019-02-26-T-004,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Mr Speaker, these are Singapore Territorial Waters. In fact, these have now been designated Singapore Port Limits. All vessels who are passing or transiting through these waters should therefore take instructions from the MPA. Any foreign government vessels have no locus standi to be issuing any instructions. If there are any attempts to assert authority or take any unauthorised actions, our agencies, our vessels and our forces will take appropriate measures.",1,37,2019-02-26-T-004-S-00037
2019-02-26-T-005,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what are the findings from the trial of using speed-tracking devices for heavy vehicles in 2018; and (b) whether there are plans to mandate speed-tracking devices for heavy vehicles to curb speeding.,1,38,2019-02-26-T-005-S-00038
2019-02-26-T-005,Amrin Amin,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Amrin Amin) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Today, the Traffic Police (TP) already requires the use of speed limiters for heavy vehicles. One limitation, however, is that the speed limiters can be tampered with.",1,39,2019-02-26-T-005-S-00039
2019-02-26-T-005,Amrin Amin,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Amrin Amin) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Between December 2017 and August 2018, Traffic Police conducted a trial on speed-tracking devices, to assess if they might be more effective than speed limiters in discouraging heavy vehicle drivers from speeding. TP concluded from the trial that even though the speed-tracking devices were accurate in measuring vehicle speed, they were also susceptible to being tampered. They do not therefore confer significant advantages over speed limiters.",2,40,2019-02-26-T-005-S-00040
2019-02-26-T-005,Amrin Amin,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Amrin Amin) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"In addition, the cost to install the speed tracking devices is not low. TP has decided not to make the speed tracking devices mandatory. TP will continue to require the use of speed limiters in heavy vehicles.",3,41,2019-02-26-T-005-S-00041
2019-02-26-T-005,Amrin Amin,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Amrin Amin) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"TP will continue to monitor the development of other technologies that can help to discourage speeding. TP will also continue to adopt a multi-pronged strategy to getting heavy vehicle drivers to drive safely, including strict enforcement, and sustained education and engagement.",4,42,2019-02-26-T-005-S-00042
2019-02-26-T-005,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I thank Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the reply. My main concern really is when there is accident involving a heavy vehicle, the chance of fatality is very high, especially for those who are carrying a lot of people in the back. And I think we still see them speeding and I think the problem then is how we are going to tackle the people who are tampering with the speed limiters. Whether Senior Parliamentary Secretary or MHA can consider increasing the penalties for those who tamper with the speed limiters.",1,43,2019-02-26-T-005-S-00043
2019-02-26-T-005,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My second question is whether MHA will consider installing the speed counters that we have in our military vehicles. We seldom see the military vehicles speeding and whether we can consider putting those counters in our heavy vehicles?,2,44,2019-02-26-T-005-S-00044
2019-02-26-T-005,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"I thank the Member for the suggestion. We will study on whether we need to increase the penalties for tampering, but currently the penalties are quite significant. Just to share with the Member – it is an offence to tamper with a speed limiter installed on heavy vehicles. First-time offenders are liable for imprisonment term of up to three months, a fine of $1,000 or both – and this is for first-time offenders. More severe punishment is meted out to those who are repeat offenders. There are also laws that ensure heavy vehicle owners maintain the speed limiters in proper working condition. And again, there are penalties for failure to abide by this law.",1,45,2019-02-26-T-005-S-00045
2019-02-26-T-005,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"That said, we are not just stopping there, we are also looking to enhance the punishment, in particular. MHA recently announced increases in composition sums for road traffic offences which will take effect on 1 April 2019. And with this change, the composition sum for heavy vehicle drivers who exceed the speed limits by over 31 km/h would be increased from $200 today to $400.",2,46,2019-02-26-T-005-S-00046
2019-02-26-T-005,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"Also, TP engages heavy vehicle drivers regularly through education, safety dialogues and various other sessions. On the use of the speed tracking devices, that is part of the trial. In fact, what we have tested in the trial, was enhanced features where the business owners could actually track the speed of the vehicles when they are transmitted to the companies. So, the tracking device – as I have mentioned – they can be tampered with and tampering is something that is very difficult to detect. That is why we have quite serious punishment for it.",3,47,2019-02-26-T-005-S-00047
2019-02-26-T-005,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"We will continue to study what we can do better and on a good note, the accidents involving heavy vehicles have, in fact, decreased. Let me share with the Member the figures that we have. Between 2014 and 2018, the number of speeding violations involving heavy vehicles with speed limiters actually decreased by about 37%, from 1,737 in 2014 to 1,087 in 2018. And the number of speeding related accidents involving heavy vehicles decreased too; by about 37% from 27 in 2014 to 17 in 2018. But nevertheless, we agree with the Member, one accident is still too many. We will see what we can do better in this area.",4,48,2019-02-26-T-005-S-00048

2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Firstly, on growing enterprises. Budget 2019 continue to press on with efforts to build competitive enterprises within our economy with greater focus and emphasis on changes at micro‐economic level. The slew of schemes and programmes announced aims at helping enterprises deepen capabilities and to scale up.",2,60,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00060
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Besides new schemes such as Scale‐up SG, SME Co‐Investment Fund III and the Innovation Agent Programme, the Finance Minister has also extended and enhanced existing schemes such as EDG, PSG and others with the intent to boost effectiveness and reap better outcomes. Eight existing financing schemes offered by ESG were also streamlined into a single Enterprise Financing Scheme (EFS), making it simpler for businesses to apply and easier to access the loans.",3,61,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00061
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),The merged EFS is also extended to companies who have been incorporated for less than five years and may not have yet met the credit evaluation criteria or vintages as required by banks. The Government's willingness to risk share up to 70% of the loan amount significantly enhance the lending proposition which would encourage more financial institutions to participate. The ability to obtain financing means a great deal to companies especially those in the early growth phase. Being able to readily access funding and liquidity; can make or break a company. This is an essential enabler for a flourishing enterprise ecosystem to exist.,4,62,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00062
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Besides financing, companies that are in scaling up phase also often need private capital from investors who are more patient and with a longer time horizon. Hence, the additional $100 million injection to establish the SME Co‐Investment Fund III can act as a catalyst to entice even more crucial investments in these high growth potential companies. Of course, there is no guarantee of success in such co‐investments, but it is necessary to make available such risk capital so as to give promising start‐ups a lift.",5,63,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00063
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, today our economy is more innovative‐ and technology‐driven; and we do have a vibrant start‐up ecosystem. More new‐to‐economy activities have also been developed in recent years such as the proliferation of FinTechs, sharing economy apps, deep tech ventures and so on. Progressing from start‐up to scale‐up is the next logical move. Start‐ups and enterprises can only thrive when they scale up and seek greater market opportunities. To achieve this, we must be open to trying new approaches to grow our enterprises.",6,64,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00064
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"From an economic resource allocation standpoint, it makes excellent sense to help grow the sizes of our companies especially the smaller enterprises. Bigger companies enjoy better economies of scale advantages and are in better position to expand, innovate, internationalise and manage business risks. In general, larger companies tends to be bigger value contributors to the economy as a proportion and offer better job opportunities for Singaporeans.",7,65,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00065
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The new Scale‐Up SG programme is a bold move to help fast track growth for promising enterprises. I would imagine that such programme will offer highly customised assistance which may entails differentiated support and assistance, better financial support for the adoption of technology and so on. We will await more details from the MTI COS. But the instinctive question I have in mind is whether such schemes, being customised and hence selective in nature would involve some extent of picking winners? Would the Scale‐Up SG be a separate track of work from the ITMs? How do we eventually expand or scale up the Scale‐Up SG to move the needle for the economy?",8,66,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00066
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Second, on supporting our workers. Sir, I am most heartened that the Finance Minister has again committed solid budgetary support to help Singaporean workers stay employed and be re‐employed. Out of the $4.6 billion allocated to transforming the economy, a lion's share of $3.6 billion will go towards helping our workers. It underscores the Government's resolve to help workers adjust to the future economic landscape; no matter how difficult the adjustments may be. Among others, the Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) will be expanded to cover new growth areas. This would help job seekers re‐skill to transit into new occupations or sectors with good prospects and opportunities for progression. The PCP, which is part of the Adapt & Growth initiative has since achieved encouraging results; helping 76,000 jobseekers find jobs in the last three years.",9,67,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00067
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"But we should continually raise the bar here; aiming not only to help even more job seekers find new jobs but also to improve the overall experience of the job seekers. The newly harmonised Global Ready Talent Programme (GRTP) will help young Singaporeans gain overseas work experience in the key growth regional markets where we are seeking greater economic inter-dependencies; such as Southeast Asia, China and India. Under the scheme, participating local firms can receive funding support of up to 70% of costs. These are markets in our immediate neighbourhood where we need to strengthen our connectivity and to expand the talent pool of people.",10,68,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00068
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I thank the Finance Minister for extending the Career Support Programme (CSP) for another two years. The CSP is a much‐appreciated scheme; by both companies and workers. The programme encourages companies to hire mature workers who may have been in long term unemployment; by subsidising a significant share of the worker's salary. Rather than renew this programme every two to three years, I hope that the Government can turn the CSP into a permanent scheme. Of course, the terms can be refined from time to time to meet changing circumstances. It will give workers; especially mature workers who are concerned about their job security; a sense of assurance that the Government will there to help in their transition to a new job. It will also demonstrate the Government's resolve to keep long term and structural unemployment to the lowest possible level; even as our economy becomes more innovative‐ and technology‐driven.",11,69,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00069
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"To encourage employment of older workers, the Special Employment Credit (SEC) scheme and the Additional SEC have been extended by another year. The SEC provides a wage offset to employers for hiring workers aged above 55 earning up to $4,000 per month. These are consistent with our strategy to tackle the twin challenges of tightening labour market and our ageing demographics.",12,70,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00070
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The enhancement to the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme (WIS) is another piece of welcome news, especially to low-wage workers. The higher payouts of up to $4,000 per year will help low-wage workers cope with the cost of living.",13,71,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00071
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, I support the reduction of services sector S Pass Sub‐DRC to address the sharp growth of S Passes in this sector. It is not sustainable, both economically and socially, to keep having more and more foreign workers in the workforce. In particular, such mid‐level skills labour is also increasingly in demand in other countries as well and companies will, in a matter of time, face competition in getting those workers to come in. Hopefully, this tightening will also signal to companies that they need to revamp their work processes, redesign jobs and reskill their local workers.",14,72,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00072
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"There are already almost 200,000 S Pass holders in the workforce now. Our S Pass system should be structured in a way where companies are given more S Pass only if they have more local workers at mid‐ to high‐wage levels and demonstrate high value contribution to the economy. We should strengthen this linkage. Can I also suggest that the companies that have been shown to hire more displaced or retrenched local workers, for example, via WSG or E2i, be given favourable consideration for their renewal of S Passes as well. At the end of the day, we want more of the S Pass type of jobs to be undertaken by Singaporeans, whether they are seniors, ITE or Polytechnic grads or back‐to‐work mothers.",15,73,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00073
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Tightening of foreign workers quota is understandably painful to companies who are unable to find local workers. I hope that with the EDG and PSG extended and expanded, it would help firms adjust to this round of tightening of the labour market. I look forward to hearing more details at the MTI COS on the measures.",16,74,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00074
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, I like the statement from the Finance Minister that starting from 1 April 2020, all transformation efforts supported by Enterprise Singapore’s EDG must include positive outcomes for workers, such as wage increases. Growing the economy is a means to an end, and the end must be to create good jobs and better salaries for our people. We have seen how economic growth in other developed economies has not always led to better workers’ outcomes and resulting in deep divisions within their societies. At the end of the day, economic development cannot be de‐linked from the social well-being of people.",17,75,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00075
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Thirdly, on healthcare support. For many years, the Government has been highlighting the challenges of our ageing demographics and have put in place a series of long‐term policies to deal with this imminent development. One serious implication of an ageing society is that healthcare needs will grow, will increase. The Government has put its money where its mouth is. Over the years, MOH has expanded the healthcare infrastructure such as hospitals, polyclinics, senior care centres and many others.",18,76,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00076
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"At the community level, there are also more social support such as the Community Network for Seniors and the PA Wellness Programme, as well as the many VWOs working with the community organisations. The AIC and SGO are today better resourced to assist and engage seniors.",19,77,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00077
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Besides the infrastructures, healthcare support must also include providing assurance that healthcare services will be affordable and that individuals will have adequate savings and insurance coverage to meet their old age needs. Building more polyclinics and the introduction of Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) has made affordable primary care more accessible to people.",20,78,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00078
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The enhancement in CHAS to cover all Singaporeans for chronic conditions, regardless of income, is another indication of our improving social safety net. As a further icing to the cake, we now have the Merdeka Generation Package (MGP), which will have benefits better than the Blue CHAS card. I support the decision not to have means testing for the MGP, just like the PGP. These are a very special generation who went through some of the most trying times during our pre and early independence years.",21,79,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00079
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, to help with large hospital bills, we now have the enhanced MediShield Life coverage covering all Singaporeans including those with pre‐existing conditions. To protect against the uncertainties of long‐term care costs, we will soon transit into the CareShield Life. Premiums for both schemes can be paid using MediSave, which is why it is helpful that the Government constantly look to top up the MediSave account of Singaporeans whenever we have surpluses.",22,80,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00080
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Both the MediShield Life and CareShield Life are now administered by the Government. My ask to MOF and MOH is that we should continually look to enhance the terms of the coverage. Whenever there are surpluses, we should consider one‐off injection into the risk pool to continually improve the claims economics for the insured.",23,81,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00081
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Overall, credit must be given to MOH and Minister Gan for their tremendous efforts to strengthen our massive healthcare system and for giving Singaporeans much better peace of mind today.",24,82,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00082
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Fourthly, on fiscal management. Sir, Budget 2019 will have long‐lasting impact in many areas such as national security, economic transformation, helping our workers, infrastructural development and enhancing social safety net.",25,83,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00083
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"For a budget to be impactful, having the required financial resources is, of course, a given. But we also need the right strategic plans and the ability to carry out the plans coherently across financial years and across terms of government. We are in this enviable position because in each budget since our founding years, we have always been prudent and steadfast in resisting the temptation to spend more than necessary. As the base of our reserves grow, the investment returns have now become the largest revenue contributor, helping us balanced the budget, which we would otherwise run into deficits.",26,84,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00084
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Given this is the case, our budgets in recent years including Budget 2019 are, by definition, expansionary budgets, with NIRC the stimulus injection. Of course, we cannot count on NIRC to fund all our expenditures. Growing the economy to generate tax revenues and to create good jobs for our people continue to be critical to our long‐term survival.",27,85,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00085
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The Constitution requires the Government of the day to maintain a balanced budget over each term so as to ensure that public funds are allocated sustainably. This arrangement has worked well for Singapore, requiring the government of the day to be disciplined and prudent in managing our finances, and sharing of the fruits of our better economic performances whenever surpluses are generated. The surpluses are also used fund massive social and healthcare programmes like the PGP and MGP, without adding burden to future generations.",28,86,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00086

Under the Constitution, this amount not spend will be locked up as past reserves in the new term of government. With about two more years of term to go, I would like to ask the Finance Minister how he envisage the accumulated surpluses for this term of government to be utilised?",29,87,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00087
2019-02-26-T-008,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, my final point relates the recent spate of incidents and lapses involving public service and public service providers. These series of incidents has naturally raised concerns whether the standards in the delivery of public services have slackened. In each of these incidents, the Government has been transparent in getting to the root of the problem, holding the organisations or companies accountable, and each time committing to take the necessary corrective measures.",30,88,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00088

Singapore has always been effectively governed and has achieved very commendable outcomes for our people.

But we also know that the public wants their day‐to‐day services to run well too and to have minimal disruption in the delivery of services as they go about their daily lives.

This announcement on the reduction for the services sector had sent a very strong message to companies on the need to be more productive and to rely less on foreign workers.

What it means for them though is that their staff will take longer in preparing the coffee, leading to queues and longer waiting time. What they did was, they tested a solution offered by Foodster, a chatbot solution developed by DBS and Every Botty, a chatbot developer. And it allowed them to be able to let their customers chat via Facebook Messenger and order the drinks they want and pick it up and get notification when the drink is ready, to go an pick it up.

2019-02-26-T-008,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"But as with all budgets, we do have to recognise that finances are finite. To be sustainable, most support packages are means tested to ensure that they are targeted and go to those who most need it. The challenge is finding the right criteria to use for the means testing. While not perfect, per capita income and annual value of property lived in are used in Singapore to assess eligibility. For several healthcare and care support programmes as well as the cost of living relief initiatives, when there is no household income, the annual value of property is used. With an ageing population, there are many middle income seniors who live in modest private properties that will be above the $13,000 or the $21,000 annual value criterion used for means testing. They, therefore, will not be eligible for many of these support schemes. An example is the Care-giver Grant that has recently been announced. Another is the support given to lower wage seniors who work which is Workfare Income Supplement (WIS). For some of these seniors who do not own properties, they are not eligible for WIS if they live with a relative in a private property which will obviously have annual value above the criterion.",21,115,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00115

The current blanket rule of annual value of the property in relation to all who live within the same dwelling unit may miss its intent for scenarios that I had highlighted. Is it possible for there to be consideration for more flexibility in such cases to allow for eligibility?",22,116,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00116

I had not intended to speak on this but it did intrigue me and the feedback I got was quite surprising. With the increasing trend of Singaporeans travelling, and if I understand correctly, the intent of the change is to make the tax system more resilient. If this is the case, has assessment been done of how much it is going to cost to collect the tax? I believe there will be some digital methods to submit the tax. But there will be administrative cost, workload for custom officers and inconvenience to travellers. This will all increase so I hope consideration is given to that. Will the cost of collecting the tax result in net revenue from the taxes collected?

So, we must critically evaluate how Singapore can build a sustainable pipeline of local talent as well as attract the best of foreign manpower, in order to build the critical mass necessary for a thriving innovation hub.

Far too few TACs are able to lead the development of industry-wide capabilities and help their members access local and international networks.

Workfare is a key pillar of our social security system. This enhancement will provide $1 billion a year to supplement the income of 440,000 Singaporeans. I would like to ask the Government to consider qualifying more low- income Singaporeans to this uniquely Singapore scheme. With the rise of the gig economy, more Singaporeans, young and old, are engaged in work without the security of regular contributions to CPF and healthcare support. So, keeping in mind the overriding social objective of helping Singaporeans with earnings in the bottom 20%, it really would make sense to offer a form of WIS to lower income gig economy workers to also help them save for retirement and healthcare, encourage work and raise their income.",13,131,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00131

He set aside a large sum of $15.3 billion under Special Transfers, including $6.1 billion for the Merdeka Generation Fund and $5.08 billion for Long Term Care Support Fund, to meet Singaporeans’ long-term needs.

This scenario, also coupled with the Government’s differentiated fiscal strategy of using borrowings to fund major long-term infrastructure projects, should offer relief from the need for major tax increases in the near to medium term.

Singaporeans from different walks of life would inevitably have different ideas on how best to achieve this with perspectives and views shaped by one’s values and sense of justice and equality. To that end, the Workers’ Party is no different. Apart from the strategic objective of the Budget, three statements resonated strongly for me, each albeit in a different context. These were  first, developing our people on a lifelong basis; second, taking care of not just this generation but our children and their children’s generation; and, finally, that the changes ahead will be deeper and faster. My speech will use these overarching statements to cover areas where the Government should consider and reassess its approach to build the strong and united Singapore that all Singaporeans, not just the Government, must navigate towards.",1,135,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00135

The ground feel is that even though it helps our senior citizens with their medical bills, albeit less generously than the Pioneer Generation Package (PG), there are also quarters who conclude that it is pungently timed with the election cycle, giving off the odour of an unfair advantage aimed at the electoral prospects of the PAP.",2,136,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00136
2019-02-26-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Another feedback I received about periodic benefits like the PG and the Merdeka Generation Packages is the inherent inequity for some of our senior citizens who, by virtue of their year of birth, stand to miss out on a few years of medical benefits because of the interval between one-time packages. Similarly, senior citizens who missed out on the more substantial PG package when they were between the ages of 60 to 64 in 2014 also feel that the eligibility age of 60 for the Merdeka Package is inconsistent with the Pioneer Package.",3,137,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00137
2019-02-26-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To address such feedback, the Government should introduce a basic level of medical benefits through a universal and permanent senior citizen healthcare package from the age of 60. Quite rightly, the Merdeka Generation Package announcement has led some Singaporeans to enquire whether our Budget can support such a package for our senior citizens. There is good reason to opine that it can.",4,138,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00138
2019-02-26-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Firstly, the introduction of Temasek into the NIRC framework from 2016 brings an additional $5 billion a year into the mix instantly and about $25 billion across a 5-year term starting from this term of Government.

2019-02-26-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To begin with, the centre-piece of such a scheme should be aimed at alleviating the out-of-pocket expenses for primary healthcare, so as to address cost of living for all Singaporeans from the age of 60. Here, the additional subsidies for common illnesses and chronic conditions for outpatient care and meaningful discounts off subsidised bills at polyclinics and specialist outpatient clinics should be its central features.",7,141,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00141

This would also provide a sufficient buffer to allow each Government to look into addressing more unique healthcare needs of specific cohorts or categories of workers. They would include those that had taken up gig-economy jobs or, for example, to address the CPF shortages of workers who made sacrifices when the Government moved to cut the employer contribution of their CPF in 2003 to keep Singapore as a whole economically competitive.",8,142,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00142

It coheres with the values many Singaporeans hold dear, regardless of race or religion. But looking after the next generation puts the question of inter-generational equity on the table. During the course of his speech, the Minister confirmed the Government’s intention to pursue a differentiated fiscal strategy – one for major infrastructure investment and another for recurrent social and security spending.

Minister shared that while it was difficult to project such spending, some preliminary estimates had been carried out.

This objective should be an explicit goal of the Waste Masterplan. I look forward to the Masterplan and hope Singaporeans are sufficiently moved into action by it.

Researchers posited that greening, it and of itself, contributes little to mitigate the urban heat island effect. How does the Government and the upcoming URA Masterplan accommodate the drawbacks of greater urbanisation particularly rising temperatures, and how does it gel with our desire to leave a liveable Singapore behind for our children and their children’s children? If the Government is not finished building Singapore, how will it ensure that this effort will not come at the expense of our green spaces? I hope the Government addresses this matter clearly and actively welcomes a future where we place far greater emphasis on environmental impact assessments and its attendant social issues with a view to leave a sustainable Singapore for future generations of Singaporeans.",19,153,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00153

As Singaporeans of the Pioneer Generation grew up through the 1950s and as the Merdeka Generation grew up in the years after self-government, the colonial masters in the UK had earlier taken a leap of faith, ambitious and bold even if imperfect – implementing a universal healthcare system for about 50 million people as the flag of the empire was lowered across the colonies. The 50-odd years since decolonisation saw newly independent societies and governments fashioning their countries to improve the lives of their peoples. Not all succeeded to the same degree – the vast majority had to contend with extreme poverty and problems on a far greater scale and with a much larger population than Singapore’s.",21,155,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00155

Employers and SMEs, many of whom have delivered phenomenal economic success to Singapore in the past, will have to adjust and effect real change at the workplace for the benefit of Singaporeans. This would include redesigning jobs for older and more experienced Singaporeans, more part-time or half-day or work from home opportunities so as to better support our workers from mothers to senior citizens and gig-economy workers. On its part, the Government must be prepared to do more to support businesses that do so with tax relief or rebates so that the economic transformation many businesses are undertaking is directly dovetailed to jobs for Singaporeans. My colleague, Workers’ Party Chair Sylvia Lim, will speak more on the employment landscape tomorrow.",22,156,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00156
2019-02-26-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The faster and deeper changes premonitioned by the Minister would no doubt include the irreversible advance of the smart nation, the rapid evolution of technology and its disruptive and dislocative effects on jobs. But what this prospect also means is that Singaporeans must commit themselves to participate in civic affairs if we are to be united and strong.",23,157,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00157
2019-02-26-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, Singaporeans have been referred to as champion grumblers. I disagree. Singaporeans criticise because we care about the country and we care about the direction it is headed. But we also care about ourselves and our families and friends and do not want to be short-changed.",24,158,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00158
2019-02-26-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"A strong and united Singapore will not be built with some Singaporeans being made to feel that they must conform or support the Government’s narrative with little room for alternative views. This is a sure way of heralding not just a divided and insecure population, but a divisive conversation about the choices we have to make collectively.",25,159,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00159
2019-02-26-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Increasingly, as we move into the future, the Government will not have all the answers. Since the days of decolonisation, numerous countries have introduced some form of legalisation that promotes greater transparency and accountability. In fact, out of the 110 or so countries in the world today which host some form of a freedom of information law, about 80 introduced such legislation only in the last 30 years or so. While such laws are no panacea nor a silver bullet, they are but one piece of a larger citizen-centric eco-system, which move the needle forward on civic participation. If change is indeed going to be deeper and faster, then Singaporeans must be ready to become active participants of that process with the Government facilitating conversations by sharing more information. For example, insofar as the Budget is concerned enough well-meaning Singaporeans do not just want to take the Government at its word, but want to crunch the numbers themselves and better understand policy trade-offs – but they are not necessarily able to do so today.",26,160,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00160
2019-02-26-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Last year, an article in the Business Times put this quandary in stark perspective. It was appropriately titled, “Lack of data on Singapore’s reserves limits discussion on its use”. With about 20% of our budget financed by proceeds from our reserves, one can understand why this issue is a relevant one.",27,161,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00161
2019-02-26-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, there are many well-meaning Singaporeans who want to consider different roads for Singapore, without losing sight of the hard truth of being a country without any natural resources and with our human resource of fellow Singaporeans as the only real substantive competitive advantage. The bicentennial offers us an opportunity to imagine the richness and breath of conversations about the Singapore we are entering into in the years to come – a Singapore that is not just economically successful, but socially and culturally confident too with Singaporeans of all stripes proud to call it home.",28,162,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00162
2019-02-26-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In conclusion, Mr Speaker, many of the values that we hold dear – the importance of family, prudence, hard work and discipline  – are all-weather values and must stand the test of time. These values must run through whatever future we envision for our children’s generation, wherever the winds of Global-Asia lead us and wherever we lead them. They must stand the test of time even if changes come thick and fast. They are at the foundation of the Singapore we all want.",29,163,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00163
2019-02-26-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),But each generation must also be given the freedom to shape the future they seek and to feel that they are an integral part of the country. The Budget should reflect and facilitate this. The need for a confident population as opposed to an insecure one will be the “X” factor that determines how united and strong the Singapore of tomorrow will be. A confident population being one with more choices to determine its destiny; a society that accepts that it is only as strong as its weakest links and its most vulnerable; and a people – both employers and employees  – all rooted to the Singapore that will always be home for us as we transit into our golden years.,30,164,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00164
2019-02-26-T-008,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Mr Speaker, Sir, in his development and delivery of Budget 2019, our Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat, has lived up to his reputation of being both gentle and firm. This is a Budget that tries to uplift every Singaporean – the children, the youths, the seniors and in particular the Merdeka Generation. This is also a Budget that relentlessly pushes local enterprises and workers to step out of their comfort zone, and build deeper capabilities to fend the unforgiving disruptions caused by globalisation and technology.",1,165,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00165

2019-02-26-T-008,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"One is on the Dependency Ratio Ceiling (DRC) or the restrictions on foreign manpower. It has been more than six years since foreign manpower dependence was tightened to drive higher productivity and redirect foreign manpower to higher tech-content businesses and also to protect the employment of our own local workers. However, whilst automation and digitalisation have helped industries such as the construction and manufacturing sectors, the same cannot be said of the service sector. As Budget 2019 continues with the latest DRC reduction to 35% in 2021, sectors likely to be hit will be in hospitality, F&B services, the arts, entertainment and other lifestyle sectors.",5,169,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00169

Ben, who has fully used up his foreign worker quota, primarily in the housekeeping department, has tried all means to transform his business model. He has found a new market niche in highly space-efficient capsule hotel market. He has also automated his guest check-in system; and he took a leap with Government agency, IMDA, to install a communal dining ordering system in the Kampong Glam tourist belt.

Mr Andreas Sugaimin, Senior VP of Human Capital and Development of Pan Pacific Hotel group, in his efforts to employ local staff, has embarked on a programme to employ persons with disabilities. Despite this, the group is still short of manpower as shift jobs in his industry continue to be unpopular amongst Singaporeans. Andreas and his team shared that the pool of willing workers from Malaysia and China is shrinking. And these are the hard truths on the ground.",7,171,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00171

2019-02-26-T-008,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Next, on the tiered support for different tiers, different types of SMEs according to size. Instead of broad strokes, a different tiered approach is explicitly adopted in Budget 2019 to provide different strokes of help to SMEs of different sizes. Hence, high-growth large firms get more dedicated support and account management to scale and internationalise such as using the Scale-Up SG programme. Those in the mid-sized tier will get slightly less. And the biggest base comprising many of the small and micro firms are assisted through more plug and play solutions at mostly self-help platforms or the heartland SME Centres. So, very differentiated approach for different tiers.",9,173,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00173

My search on the SME Portal was interesting but it was insufficient to develop a roadmap or action plan if I were running my own business.

The training I underwent in National Service was very tough, but having lived in a kampong within a big family unit, I was able to tolerate the training regime. Along the way, I made many friends and they remain a source of strength for me up to today. The early batch of national servicemen were considered the pioneer guardians of Singapore.""

2019-02-26-T-008,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Mr Speaker, I believe service buyers can do more. Service buyers have a key role to play in uplifting the lives of our low-wage workers. NTUC has been encouraging them to adopt Outcome-Based Contracting and to place greater emphasis on quality attributes rather than contract prices. Adopting progressive procurement practices will ensure more favourable outcomes for all, including better welfare for our outsourced low-wage workers. What are these progressive practices?",7,277,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00277
2019-02-26-T-008,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"First, contracts should specify service outcomes instead of headcounts, and be evaluated more holistically based on the price-quality method, where quality has a higher weightage over price. Service buyers should avoid cheap sourcing which would lead to service providers undercutting each other in order to win contracts. Because with low margins, service providers are unlikely to provide better staff welfare beyond the statutory benefits.",8,278,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00278
2019-02-26-T-008,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Second, service buyers should consider longer contract periods. This would incentivise service providers to invest in technology since they can amortise cost over a longer period. Technology makes work easier, smarter and safer, leading to better service outcomes and higher productivity. In addition, it gives outsourced workers greater job security. Service buyers can also consider aggregating their demand to potentially enjoy economies of scale and more efficient manpower deployment.",9,279,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00279
2019-02-26-T-008,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Third, service buyers should treat their service providers as partners instead of mere contractors. They should ensure that their contracts have fair clauses and avoid unreasonable liquidated damages. When service providers have fair contracts, they are more likely to do a good job and train their workers to deliver higher service standards. Otherwise, workers would usually bear the brunt of bad contracts. This happens when service providers find ways to minimise cost at the expense of workers’ welfare.",10,280,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00280
2019-02-26-T-008,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Finally, when contracts are renewed, service buyers should consider the experience of the incumbent workers as well. These workers are more experienced and familiar with the job requirements. Thus, in awarding a new or renewed contract, service buyers should ensure that incumbent workers’ wages and benefits are not worse off than before.",11,281,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00281
2019-02-26-T-008,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),NTUC hopes to see more government bodies take the lead to adopt these Outcome-Based Contracting and progressive procurement practices.

2019-02-26-T-008,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Besides this, service buyers have a moral responsibility to look after the welfare of their outsourced workers. This includes the area of training – allowing service providers to send their workers to attend training without requesting for headcount replacements – and workplace welfare.",13,283,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00283
2019-02-26-T-008,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Therefore, I call for building owners or service buyers to provide designated rest areas for their outsourced workers. I am sure if workers are treated well, they will put in their best efforts to deliver quality service. To lead by example, I call upon all government agencies and related bodies to ensure proper rest areas are provided for outsourced workers. The unions can work with building management to propose solutions for proper rest areas to be built.",14,284,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00284
2019-02-26-T-008,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"On the part of service providers, NTUC has been vocal against the practice of price undercutting or suicide bids, because when service providers have difficulty maintaining the contract subsequently, it is their workers who suffer. Service providers should not gamble on their workers’ wages and welfare and hope that the contract they won through price undercutting will bring them profit. I urge the government ministries and service buyers to keep a look out for price undercutting and exclude such service providers from getting contracts.",15,285,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00285

2019-02-26-T-008,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),Freelancers have responded positively to the Minister for Finance's message on how the Government will help workers deepen capabilities and seek new opportunities.

2019-02-26-T-008,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Today, one in 10 workers are self-employed or freelancers. The emergence of digital platforms has created more options and easier access to an alternative or additional source of income. However, freelancers that we spoke with cited challenges, such as loss of income due to prolonged illness or injury, training gaps and unclear contracts. The Tripartite Workgroup formed by MOM has come up with recommendations to address these concerns. Some ideas implemented have had good traction, but we can do more and do it faster.",4,301,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00301
2019-02-26-T-008,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"A case in point is the formation of the National Instructors and Coaches Association (NICA). It was registered with the Registrar of Societies and became an affiliate of the NTUC just last month to represent the interests of freelancers who teach sports, enrichment and wellness.

But with the insurance cover, the payout enabled him to receive income during his recuperation. However, not many have taken up such a policy as they fear losing out on bids if not everybody takes it up. This is one area where Government Procurement entities can encourage freelance bidders to be protected.",6,303,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00303

I hope all operators will do the same for all taxi and private hire drivers to be covered under such insurance coverage. To this end, I would like to appreciate the efforts by MOM and LTA to engage these operators. It is actions such as these that will affirm their assertions that drivers' interests matter to them.",7,304,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00304
2019-02-26-T-008,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"I feel that Budget 2019 is pro-worker with initiatives like the Global Ready Talent Programme and the Professional Conversion Programmes to help workers with skills upgrading and to move into new growth areas. Freelancers also want to participate in these initiatives. They do not have easy access to courses and support. It can be extra daunting if they work in specialised fields where there are few local providers or experts. Typically, for them, training is also self-funded. Potential loss of income when they attend classes also deters some from attending such training.",8,305,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00305

2019-02-26-T-008,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Speaker, the second part of my speech deals with the impact of diesel tax. The Minister for Finance's announcement that diesel duty will be increased has caused much concern among taxi drivers. Taxi drivers wished that the Government can provide more support to help them manage higher operating costs. Why is that so?",17,314,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00314
2019-02-26-T-008,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"First, while there is some rebate to cushion the impact, they need more assistance.

2019-02-26-T-008,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"We have called upon taxi operators to help beyond just passing on this diesel rebate that the Minister has offered to the drivers. In fact, why is it that they can do more, because, firstly, they can consider reducing the daily rental of the taxis which, today, range from about $110 to $120. They can also consider cutting pump prices because they offer pump stations to their drivers. They themselves operate the pump stations. So, very different from other businesses. When their costs increase, taxi drivers cannot pass on this cost increase to commuters because they also do not set the fairs of the taxis. The fares are set by the operators. The type of vehicle is selected by the operators. I cannot choose between vehicles A or B because you have 16,000 diesel vehicles that the taxi drivers choose from. So, if the operator offers non-diesel taxis, then the taxi driver would not have to incur this additional diesel tax.",19,316,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00316
2019-02-26-T-008,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"So, a lot of the conditions seem to be favouring the operator or beyond the control of the drivers.

2019-02-26-T-008,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Perhaps, if the operators are not keen on doing more, the Government can consider issuing fuel pump licensing rights to the unions.

2019-02-26-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"The first challenge that workers face comes when selecting their courses. The Government rolled out the SkillsFuture initiative to encourage a culture of lifelong learning. This initiative has done well, with about 465,000 Singaporeans benefitting from SkillsFuture Credit training subsidies. However, there is an overemphasis on having a breadth of courses available, rather than having in-depth SkillsFuture courses to help build mastery in the domain. Some have also given me feedback that the process of course selection can be disheartening, especially when they find that a course offered by a Polytechnic or University is not eligible for reimbursement by their SkillsFuture Credit.",4,323,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00323
2019-02-26-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"The second challenge is cost. The $500 SkillsFuture Credit offered by the Government may not be sufficient for a variety of reasons. Many courses cost more than $500 and, often, going on a single one-off training course would deplete one's entire SkillsFuture Credit account. Many workers do harbour hopes of returning to school to get that diploma or degree that they did not pursue when they were younger. But the cost of these courses can be prohibitive, as they are no longer eligible for the same subsidies enjoyed by our young Singaporean students.",5,324,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00324
2019-02-26-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"The third challenge is simply the lack of time. Many working in the SMEs tell me that they do not have time to go for training as their organisations are already so manpower-lean. Those in the MNCs do not have it easier either. They tell me that while they are given the time to go for training in the day, they end up pulling what they call “double shifts” – having to still complete their work at night after class, in the office or at home. Cost and time are two of the most common reasons given by those who have yet to utilise their SkillsFuture Credits.",6,325,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00325

2019-02-26-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"First, building depth. The Government can encourage workers to go for training and build depth in their chosen fields by allowing all local Polytechnic and University courses to be automatically offset by the SkillsFuture Credit. This should cover all types of courses, be it part-time diplomas, specialist certificates, executive education programmes or one-off specialist modules. Given the more expensive nature of such courses, I would urge the Government to consider providing a top-up to the SkillsFuture Credit to encourage Singaporeans to go for these courses that provide them with more depth to support their career goals. Better still, I hope the Government can give all adult Singaporeans a second bite of the cherry by providing education subsidies to mature students who wish to pursue a diploma or degree in our local institutes of higher learning (IHLs). This will certainly cement our commitment to invest in lifelong learning.",11,330,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00330
2019-02-26-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),Helping to identify training needs and craft in-depth training courses is an area where tripartite cooperation is useful. The National Transport Workers’ Union (NTWU) has been actively working with LTA and the public transport operators to help our workers upskill and reskill. This includes setting up the Singapore Bus Academy and the Singapore Rail Academy to provide workers with relevant and timely training.,12,331,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00331
2019-02-26-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Last year, the union worked with SBS Transit (SBST) to roll out the Operator-Maintainer training course, which empowers our bus captains to perform simple vehicle repairs. At the course’s graduation ceremony, I met 63-year-old Bus Captain Varathan. He has been a bus captain for over 40 years and this was the first time he was taught to do maintenance work on his vehicle. He was one of the pioneers to complete the course and shared with me that there were plenty of hands-on practice during the course which made the training very much easier to understand. He was also appreciative of this chance to develop skills and knowledge that would come in handy in his daily work. I hope the story of Bus Captain Varathan will inspire many more workers to have a lifelong learning attitude and be open to training and upskilling.",13,332,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00332
2019-02-26-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Second, let us bring training closer to workers to support them in this lifelong learning journey. Some courses simply cannot be done online. For courses that require a physical premise, our schools and IHLs can be a convenient location for workers to go and upgrade themselves. The Labour Movement has begun taking steps to bring training closer to our workers. Let me cite an example. The United Workers of Electronics & Electrical Industries (UWEEI) has signed memorandums of understanding with three Polytechnics in the west, in the east and in the north, to provide workers with a wide variety of training courses at locations close to their workplace or their home.",14,333,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00333
2019-02-26-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"For SMEs worried about sending their employees for training over a long period of time, we can bring training closer to them by having modular courses offered online. SMEs can leverage NTUC’s e2i U Leap app. This is a mobile learning platform that allows users to learn bite-sized modules on the go, and take anywhere between 30 minutes and two hours off work to focus on learning during the week. Last year, e2i also released U Leap Enterprise – a mobile learning platform where e2i works with companies to curate specific courses for their workers, which I think is very suitable for SMEs to address their workers’ training needs. This will not only save employees’ travel time and hassle, it also minimises downtime for the company.",15,334,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00334
2019-02-26-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"To ensure that upgrading workers’ skills is seen as a priority towards a company’s transformation, training must be formalised and recognised by the management. Therefore, I encourage companies to work with the Labour Movement to make training a shared responsibility and make training real for our workers.",16,335,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00335
2019-02-26-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Mr Speaker, let me now touch on workplace safety and health (WSH). It is imperative that we continue to invest in WSH practices to ensure that our workers can return home to their families, safe and healthy, everyday. Our closely coordinated tripartite efforts in recent years have started to bear fruits. Workplace fatalities in 2018 have reached a record low of 41 cases. But despite the decrease in fatalities, the number of major and minor injuries have increased.",17,336,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00336
2019-02-26-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"There are four areas that I think we can do more to safeguard our workers’ safety and health at the workplace. First, we need to place more emphasis on workplace health. Our workforce is ageing and many have shared with me that they are increasingly facing higher stress levels at work. Recent studies have shown that poor workplace health contributes to work related injuries and fatalities. We can do more to place more emphasis on workplace health, for example, by mandating yearly health check-ups for better detection and prevention of chronic occupational diseases.",18,337,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00337
2019-02-26-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Second, to encourage employers to build safer and healthier workplaces, we need to increase the cost to companies with poor WSH track record as deterrence. Under the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA), all employees doing manual work, as well as all employees earning $1,600 or less per month need to be insured. Insurance companies should put in place a tiered insurance premium framework under WICA, where companies will have to pay higher insurance premiums if there are many claims of the same incident nature.",19,338,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00338
2019-02-26-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Third, every company must have a trained WSH representative. The current legislation only mandates for a WSH officer to be appointed in some workplaces, such as shipyards, petroleum processing plants and factories which employs over 100 people. According to the 2018 National WSH Statistics Report released last week, even lower risk sectors are not spared from WSH accidents. As such, we should consider expanding the requirement of having a trained WSH representative to all companies, to make WSH pervasive in every workplace.",20,339,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00339
2019-02-26-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Fourth, we need a National WSH Training Academy. Our workforce is diverse and it is this cultural diversity in our workforce that makes it challenging to train our local and foreign workers in workplace safety. There are currently 12 approved training providers that conduct WSH Workforce Skills Qualification courses for the construction and metal working industries, but the training resources at each of these training providers can vary significantly. Having a National WSH Training Academy will better ensure high and consistent WSH standards across all sectors, particularly in high-risk sectors like construction and manufacturing. I will speak more about this during the upcoming Committee of Supply debate.",21,340,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00340
2019-02-26-T-008,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"In conclusion, the Labour Movement is heartened by the government’s commitment and investment in our workers throughout the years, in particular the focus on deepening worker capabilities in this year's Budget. This is a government that cares for our workers. Let us continue to invest in lifelong learning and put in place strong measures for WSH to ensure a well-trained, future-ready, safe and healthy workforce. Because, I am very sure, this House will agree with me that Every Worker Matters. Mr Speaker, I support the Budget.",22,341,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00341
2019-02-26-T-008,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development and Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon),"Mr Speaker, Sir, the 2019 Budget is a strategic and forward-looking one, with measures that are meant to benefit Singaporeans of all ages. This includes strengthened support in education for young Singaporeans, as well as the Merdeka Generation Package and Bicentennial bonus that will help older Singaporeans and low- to middle income families. In particular, I was glad to see strong support for businesses and workers, with measures that will help them embrace and adapt to industry transformation.",1,342,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00342
2019-02-26-T-008,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development and Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon),"For enterprises, the Scale-up SG programme and pilot Innovation Agents programme will help firms build deeper capabilities, to innovate and grow. For workers, the extension of the Special Employment Credit (SEC) and Career Support Programme (CSP) will help them upskill so they can keep ahead of the curve and be ready for emerging jobs. Businesses and workers must embrace change together so that everyone can reap the benefits of industry transformation. While these measures and announcements are encouraging, there is more that we can do and I want to focus my speech in two areas. First, to enhance the employability and employment of our older workers and two, to make industry transformation “real” for our workers.",2,343,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00343
2019-02-26-T-008,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development and Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon),"Sir, our population is ageing. Older Singaporeans form a significant part of our workforce, which has a quarter aged 55 and above. This proportion is likely to grow as Singaporeans enjoy better healthcare and higher standards of living. Older workers are valuable assets who can contribute experience and maturity to our workforce, and we must better ensure their employability and employment. With our transition to a knowledge-based economy and the wider use of enabling technology, our workers rely less and less on physical strength and their work experience becomes an even more important asset. Our older workers with their years of industry experience are well-placed to leverage on technological tools to maximise their productivity potential.",3,344,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00344
2019-02-26-T-008,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development and Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon),"Successful Industry 4.0 transformation must be complemented by a capable and competent Worker 4.0. But this transformation is not a straight forward process. There are challenges. The key challenge is mindset change of both employers and workers. Some employers prefer hiring younger workers, while some older workers are apprehensive and resistant towards emerging technology trends. In the face of rapid technological changes and the evolving demographic profile of our local workforce, the Government, businesses and workers must all be ready to adjust their mindsets and adapt to changes.",4,345,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00345
2019-02-26-T-008,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development and Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon),"This change in mindset must be led by employers. With supportive employers coming onboard the transformation journey, workers will also be encouraged to pick up the relevant skills. Here, I would like to encourage enterprises and companies to focus greater efforts in 2 areas to integrate more older workers into the workforce. First, companies must put an emphasis on job redesign to ensure that older workers are able to adapt to new technology and to different work environments. This could mean improving the user interface of a process so that technology adoption is much easier.",5,346,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00346
2019-02-26-T-008,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development and Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon),"For example, some SMEs I have visited in the manufacturing sector have made the control of industrial robots via the use of iPads very much more intuitive. The operator does not need to understand the inner workings of the robot. He only needs to be familiar with the controls on the iPad. By using a familiar platform like the iPad as the user interface between the operator and the industrial robot, older workers found it much less daunting to adapt to robotics and automation and are able to improve on their productivity.",6,347,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00347
2019-02-26-T-008,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development and Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon),"Innovation and technology adoption do not have to be complicated for businesses or workers. We must do more to ensure that job redesign and technology adoption remains user-friendly and intuitive for our workers, both the young and old. A more conducive work environment through job redesign will attract a younger talent pipeline to enter the industry while enabling experienced older workers to expand on their job roles.",7,348,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00348
2019-02-26-T-008,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development and Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon),"Second, companies must provide better training for older workers to upskill or re-skill to leverage technology. For example, PSA has been testing and adopting many automation technologies, including unmanned automated guided vehicles (AGVs) as well as automated and remotely-controlled yard cranes. To ensure that their drivers and crane operators remain relevant and employable, PSA worked with the unions to train them for higher-skilled roles. The result is new skills, better pay and greater fulfilment for its workers, and of course, enhanced productivity for PSA.",8,349,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00349
2019-02-26-T-008,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development and Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon),"Training and reskilling is key to ensure that our older workers remain employed and employable. In 2018, more than 40% of clients served at NTUC’s e2i (Employment and Employability Institute) Career Centre were aged 50 and above, and approximately 30% of this group were Professional, Managers and Executives.(PMEs). PMEs are therefore also at risk of displacement and must continually upgrade to seize emerging job roles. NTUC has been working with government and industry partners on the Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs), Place-and-Train Programmes and Professional Development Programmes to upskill and reskill older workers. These programmes have been successful in helping many mature PMEs enter new and exciting job roles.",9,350,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00350
2019-02-26-T-008,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development and Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon),"We, therefore, welcome the Government’s move to expand PCPs into new growth areas such as blockchain, prefabrication and the development of embedded software, to support mid-career professionals entering these sectors. We will continue to work with the Government and employers to strengthen the employability of our older workers through our network of unions, social enterprises and our U Associate partners.",10,351,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00351
2019-02-26-T-008,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development and Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon),There are other funding levers that NTUC can work with the Government to better incentivise and support companies to upskill and reskill older workers. We will work with the Government on implementing the changes to the Enterprise Development Grant (EDG) and Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG) to ensure workers' outcome will be one of the key end-points of Industry Transformation Maps (ITM).,11,352,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00352

Many workers have significant financial and family commitments. Retraining incurs costs and loss of income. Therefore, many workers choose to put off picking up another skill or qualification for as long as they can. The Professional Conversion Programmes and Career Support Programmes have helped to provide these bridges. The combination of course subsidies and training allowances have lowered the barriers to career conversion. Yet, the limited number of PCP and ELP places meant that many workers would have to pay full unsubsidised fees and some workers might not qualify for the PCPs and might need longer time for them to qualify or succeed.",12,381,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00381

He has been working since graduating with a diploma in business in 2007. In his own words, he wrote to me. He said, ""I had no idea what I wanted to do after my ""O"" levels. Thus, I embarked on something very corporate. So, I did a diploma in business."" He worked in a corporate function and his job was in a polyclinic where he was inspired to become a nurse. After trying for two years, he finally obtained a place in Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Yet, he is unable to secure a tuition grant because he has already obtained a previous diploma in 2007. His yearly school fees will amount to $21,000 per year which he cannot pay. He said, ""I do have some savings but it is not enough for three years."" Yet, he still has a burning desire to serve the community.",13,382,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00382

But unfortunately, I do not come from a well-to-do family. My father is semi-retired and my mother is is a homemaker. I do not behold high hopes in life. I will be gratified enough to be a nurse. But the cost of $60,000, I believe, is too difficult for me to manage. At the end, I do have some savings to tide myself through but it is not enough for three years. However, I ain't giving up. Thus, I am seeking all forms of assistance which I can possible conquer. This is possibly my last chance and are thoroughly sincere in becoming a qualified nurse.""",14,383,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00383

We hope that more can be done for them. It is my entail expanding the number of PCP places by helping our Singaporean workers, especially younger ones to obtain a second Nitec, a diploma or degree that will help them better to adjust to structural economic changes. It will also allow workers to discover new career choices instead of those pre-determined in the earlier years.

Our ability to incorporate technology in our lives has far outstripped our ability to reason morally about the choices that we will be forced to make as a technological society.

Under the Employment Act and other labour legislation, there remains distinctions between our rank and file and PMEs and “manual” and “non-manual” work. These distinctions influence the treatment and protection of these workers. It is particularly challenging today to make these distinctions as many jobs involve a mix of both manual and non-manual work. There are also workers who have been wrongly classified as “managers and executives”, excluding them from protection under Part IV of the Employment Act. Some employers have also tried to exclude workers from union protection, under the pretext that the worker is in a conflicted position as he wields “managerial” powers.

In 1969, NTUC organised the “Trade Union Seminar on Modernisation of the Labour Movement”, in the midst of an employment crisis when the British announced that they were pulling out of Singapore.

The healthcare system secures our physical well-being, and our investment in preventive health services is paying off. In recent years, the government has been investing in long-term care to prepare for the ageing society. In an ageing society, primary care is the critical frontline service to keep our seniors in tip-top health. Preventive care is a subset of primary care. Primary care is essential for the early detection and good management of chronic diseases, which are the leading causes of disabilities and deaths worldwide. Our seniors are particularly vulnerable to chronic conditions.

Future governments will be hard-pressed into denying future generations of this benefit, not just because of the political cost, but also the sheer logic of the justification.

What makes us distinct in the animal kingdom is our desire to be creative, to work to create things that become part of our social identity. Work is therefore filled with meaning and purpose. It underpins our dignity as human beings. Life expectancy has increased so much to give us decades of extra time to age with meaning, purpose and dignity. In the post-industrial economy, our workers are skilled knowledge-based workers who are continuously learning new skills. To allow our older workers to work as long as they desire, as long as they are able to, is to allow our workers to age with independence.

Our seniors should be allowed to continue to use their skills developed in a lifetime so that they find their lives to be filled with purpose.

This will allow our workers to strengthen their socio-economic well-being and age with independence. Doing this now that the Merdeka generation is reaching the current retirement and re-employment ages of 62 and 67 is very appropriate. From the perspective of the economy and society, it is also a waste of human capital for workers to retire prematurely, when their skills and experience are still invaluable.

To enable our workers to work if they can and want to work by removing the retirement age does not mean, I repeat, does not mean to get Singaporeans to work till they die. It is to reform the system so that Singaporean do not have to worry about their finances and can retire in the their 60s if they want to, but they can also continue to work if they want to.

CPF has already been delinked from the retirement age and re-employment age.

This is a good thing, as it provides the financial basis for ageing with independence. Some will have enough savings that can be used to purchase private annuities. Many will be owners of a housing asset that can be monetised. Others will want to continue to work and they can continue to work to maintain a steady stream of income. In such a context, CPF becomes an avenue of supplementary income.",19,523,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00523

CPF is a store of a worker's savings and is akin to a fixed deposit account. We have to be unequivocal in stating that the monies in a CPF member's account belong to the CPF member, no fudging around this principle just because there is an employer contribution component and there are occasional Government top-ups. Our CPF savings are the fruits of our labour, period. Our CPF monies are our savings secured by the Government as a fixed deposit account with attractive interest rates.",20,524,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00524

These Singaporeans will not be working because they want and can, but because they have to in order to survive. For these Singaporeans, the Workfare Income Supplement is important, and they may also seek ComCare help. But while ComCare assistance is a dignified option for those who are really destitute and cannot work, it is not the same for a senior who can work. Such seniors would rather age with independence and not be dependent on state handouts.",22,526,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00526

Therefore, I would like to reiterate the Workers' Party call to lower the CPF Payout Eligibility Age to 60, so that Singaporeans can have the option of meeting their needs with this source of supplementary income. Of course, if there is no need for CPF Life payouts to act as supplementary income, seniors should have the option and be encouraged to leave their monies in their CPF account to accumulate interest and get larger payouts later. The youngest of the Merdeka generation is turning 60 years old this year. It is therefore an appropriate time to reconsider this.",23,527,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00527
2019-02-26-T-008,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Second, CPF can function as an insurance against crises. This is not unlike why many put their savings in fixed deposits. Fixed deposits can be withdrawn easily to meet urgent needs compared to less liquid investments with higher returns. Major illnesses, accidents and other crises can disrupt the normal life-course of an older Singaporean and erode his or her quality of life. One of the first things that many people do in such situations is to cut back on expenditure on quality food, which could worsen their health in the long run.

The condition ""ever continuing in any employment"" is very extreme. I would like to call on the Government to allow partial withdrawals of CPF if a member is so physically or mentally incapacitated to continue in employment for a significant period of time. Such withdrawals should be determined on a case-by-case basis, with the objective being for the withdrawal to help a member tide over the crisis with their own savings so that they can return to employment.",25,529,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00529

The fourth aspect of ageing with independence is psychological well-being. The current understanding is that ageing in place is the best option for our seniors because the stability of their community environment will provide for their psychological well-being. Urban planning and public housing policies can also facilitate this by implementing renewal in ageing estates, so that our seniors are embedded in mixed environments that encourage interaction with younger families, especially if their own children's families are living close by. Neighbourhood renewal and home improvement projects have also improved accessibility and safety to encourage active ageing.",26,530,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00530

The Merdeka Generation Package is a good opportunity to promote the scheme to our seniors, as there are still too many seniors who are unaware of the benefits of the scheme. The Government could build further incentives for Merdekas to take up the scheme into the Package. This way, no Merdeka-generation Singaporean will be forced to downgrade to smaller flats or relocate to an alien neighbourhood because of financial need. They do not have to sell their flats, just the end part of the lease back to HDB.",29,533,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00533

2019-02-26-T-008,Douglas Foo,Mr Douglas Foo (Nominated Member),"As the strategies from the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) Blueprint 2025 takes shape, Singapore businesses need to better define our competitive space and to leverage on the potential of ASEAN as an economic block. ASEAN is currently the fifth largest economy in the world by GDP, overtaking the UK in 2017. With the AEC Blueprint in place, ASEAN is, indeed, well-poised to be the fourth largest economy in the world by GDP in 2030.",17,601,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00601

2019-02-26-T-008,Douglas Foo,Mr Douglas Foo (Nominated Member),"Firstly, the median age of the ASEAN population as at 2015 is 28.9 years. This is a relatively youthful workforce when compared to the median age of more advanced nations, for example, 40.8 years for the US and 36 years for China.",19,603,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00603
2019-02-26-T-008,Douglas Foo,Mr Douglas Foo (Nominated Member),"Secondly, increases in urbanisation rates drive economic growth. The urbanisation rate in ASEAN is expected to hit 55.8% in 2030, about 12 percentage points up from 44.5% in 2010.",20,604,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00604
2019-02-26-T-008,Douglas Foo,Mr Douglas Foo (Nominated Member),"Thirdly, according to estimates from the Asian Development Bank, by the year 2030, about 65% of the ASEAN population will be classified as middle income class, up from 29% in 2010. As income rises, so will standards of living. ASEAN will, therefore, become an important market for businesses.",21,605,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00605
2019-02-26-T-008,Douglas Foo,Mr Douglas Foo (Nominated Member),"That these would take place within a short span of slightly over a decade presents our Singapore businesses with many opportunities at our doorstep. It is, therefore, increasingly imperative that our businesses are enabled to move up the value chain to generate higher value output and, more importantly, position ourselves as a gateway to the rest of ASEAN. Digitalisation and Industry 4.0 are the way forward and, with the different financial packages and assistance schemes, the Government is, indeed, helping our businesses along the journey.",22,606,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00606

The Foreign Workforce Policy to reduce the Dependency Ratio Ceiling in the services sector is definitely something that businesses are very concerned about.",23,607,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00607
2019-02-26-T-008,Douglas Foo,Mr Douglas Foo (Nominated Member),"Businesses can appreciate the policy reasons for such cuts, for example, with the declining birth rate in Singapore, having a continued inflow of foreign manpower at the current or increased rate may eventually result in a Singapore with more foreigners than locals. Businesses also note that the reduction is being rolled out progressively over two years to cushion the harshness of such a reduction.",24,608,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00608

Firstly, businesses already have to deal with global trading uncertainty, rapid changes in technology and business models changes, as well as changes in legislation. For example, last year, changes made to the Employment Act provided more protection and welfare for employees but incurs additional costs for businesses.",25,609,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00609

Being able to attract new local workers, with more welfare demands and higher costs, is yet another aspect which these businesses have to deal with.",26,610,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00610

2019-02-26-T-008,Douglas Foo,Mr Douglas Foo (Nominated Member),"While all of these are indeed legitimate interests which enterprises are also concerned about, legislating them may not necessarily be the best way forward.

It is encouraging that there is increased focus at the micro level, with support to accelerate the adoption of innovative solutions, building of global partnerships, upscaling of the workforce and business transformation. It is pro-business, pro-worker, and we look forward to a strong united Singapore. With that, I affirm my support for the Budget Statement 2019.",31,615,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00615

2019-02-26-T-008,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Many plans and schemes had already been put in place. The oft-heard ones include those relating to Artificial Intelligence (AI), Intelligent Automation (IA), Technology, Manpower, Digitalisation, Innovation and Globalisation. The wheels had been set in motion. To many Singaporeans though, these schemes appeared to be piecemeal. More can be done to highlight the vision for Singapore and strengthen the connections so that we can understand how all these schemes can together shape a new future and set us a common goal.",4,619,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00619
2019-02-26-T-008,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Driven by the rapid pace of technological advances which radically change processes and operations, many sectors are undergoing developments and changes of seismic proportions. These are critical for companies’ survival, to catch up with their peers or seize opportunities to be market leaders. To automate and digitise is also to overcome the manpower challenges arising from the reduction in the Dependency Ratio Ceilings (DRC) which are expected to put an upward pressure on labour costs for companies in the services-related industry. We still hear businesses from the service sectors feedback that many of their processes cannot be automated. The challenge is how we can successfully harness AI and IA to help these companies.",5,620,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00620

2019-02-26-T-008,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Some businesses find these restructuring steps troublesome, even counter-productive, as the time and resources required may temporarily distract them from their day-to-day operations.

For companies which have yet to implement digital plans, what are the main obstacles? What measures do we have in place to help them surmount these challenges? The seven industries were prioritised as their expected productivity gains would be the highest. May I ask if their actual gains had matched expectations? If not, what are the issues involved?",10,625,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00625

How many SMEs has ASP helped and in which sectors? Do our SMEs have enough awareness about this scheme and the necessary talents and specialists to implement the transformations? Would the Ministry share with us some of the successful cases and those which had not turned out as well? What are the lessons from those which had performed below expectations?

2019-02-26-T-008,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"In addition, employing these Singapore citizens also entitle the companies to employ more foreign workers based on the DRC. With the tightening of the DRC, companies are likely to employ more of these old workers, letting them do simple cleaning jobs, in order to employ more and better skilled foreign workers. We should note that this would also reduce their incentive to automate.",15,630,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00630
2019-02-26-T-008,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"On one hand, the WIS may boost elder employment; on the other hand, there are some concerns about these seniors in menial jobs. The sight of these seniors, as they shuffle around, hunched over, tug at our heartstrings.

There are comments that poor Singaporeans have to work to their deaths and so forth. Although these comments do not reflect Singapore’s reality, they are out there. While there might be some seniors who said that they worked to pass their time, due to the nature of these menial jobs, most people have concerns and reservations. We must also ask ourselves what is the perception our young children have of us as a society when they see frail senior citizens picking up after them, clearing tables and mopping toilets? Perhaps, it is timely for us to re-examine the implications arising from these policies.",17,632,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00632

On the first $60,000 of a CPF member’s combined balances, with up to $20,000 from the Ordinary Account (OA), an extra 1% interest is paid. Since January 2016, CPF members aged 55 and above will also earn an additional 1% extra interest on the first $30,000 of their combined balances, including up to $20,000 from the OA.

Sir, globalisation has caused fundamental transformations in our economy and has necessitated certain paradigm shifts.

One avenue that we can achieve sustainability in, is the built environment. There are frameworks that assess the eco-friendliness of buildings such as the BCA Green Mark Scheme.

The SEC’s green labelling scheme is internationally recognized under ISO 17065 and ISO 14024 for certifying products which meet stringent environmental standards and is accepted in 43 countries.",17,657,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00657

I understand that BIM is not seamlessly integrated among developers, consultants, contractors, suppliers and the authorities. This has resulted in the benefits of BIM not being fully reaped, resulting in stakeholders of construction projects suffering from redundancy.

2019-02-26-T-008,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"Sir, my final point is in regard to the perpetuation of our status as a global city. Singapore enjoys her current levels of success due to us positioning ourselves as a global city and acting as a node by which the world may become more connected. To remain a global city, it is imperative that we pay attention to both our hardware and software. Singapore must continue to upgrade its hardware through ensuring a world-class infrastructure, high levels of security and a beautiful green environment.",20,660,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00660

2019-02-26-T-008,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"To maintain our position as a global city, we can learn from fellow global city, Tokyo. The Tokyo Government formulated a plan in 2014 with the explicit aim of making Tokyo the world’s best city known as “The Tokyo Vision”. One of their strategies involves the use of the Olympics as the platform by which Tokyo may become world-renowned for arts and culture, which in turn set Tokyo on the path to becoming a world-leading cultural city. They intend to use the entire city as a stage showcasing Japanese culture.",22,662,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00662
2019-02-26-T-008,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"Sir, part of being a global city involves having a developed cultural scene, ready to be exported to the world.

We should learn from Tokyo and utilise international events as platforms by which we promote our culture, and cement our position as a global city.",23,663,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00663
2019-02-26-T-008,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"Another area in which we can learn from Tokyo is extensive and in-depth collaboration with other cities. As part of The Tokyo Vision, the Tokyo government will develop relations with 30 foreign cities. Sir, Singapore is unique in that it is a city-state. This has resulted in the blurring of lines between federal and city governance. We have strong ties with other federal Governments, and learnt and shared much with them. We should expand our networks with city and municipal governments so that our 3P sectors can learn and share their respective experiences.",24,664,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00664

2019-02-26-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"A close read of history showed that Singapore was lost not on the defence in the battles of 1941. Singapore was lost on the planning tables since 1921. After World War One (WWI), the British Empire was stretched financially. The British returned to the gold standard at a high exchange rate, which triggered deflationary monetary and fiscal policies. Wage did not adjust downwards due to union pressure, and British exports became expensive. For most of the 1920s, the British suffered a depression. The British military defense budget was cut very deeply until 1935, and her military failed to modernize. And after WWI, America and Japan competed for dominance in Asia. In 1922, America forced the British to chose a side. Britain chose to side America over Japan, its former ally. With that, Britain faced a dangerous Japan with a formidable navy.",2,667,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00667
2019-02-26-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Despite her military weakness, the British must convince Australia and India, then part of the British Empire, that the Far East can be secured. Especially so since Australian and India troops were needed to protect their Empire’s interest in Europe and the Middle East. Yet the British could not afford a Far East navy to counter Japan. To make the impossible possible, the British came up with the “Singapore Strategy”. In the event of a future world war, Britain will concentrate its entire navy to defeat its European enemies, and then sail the main fleet down to Singapore to counter the Japanese. Therefore, in 1921, the British cabinet approved the building of a new naval base out of Singapore to host its main fleet. And Singapore must be defended until the arrival of that fleet.",3,668,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00668
2019-02-26-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"The idea was sound. But the implementation of the Singapore Strategy over the next two decades can only be described as fundamentally unsound. As a 20-year sleepwalk towards disaster. First, according to historian Brian Farrell, the British never found the money to build a big naval base. The British knew they need most, if not all of their fleet to contend with the Japanese. But surprisingly, the naval base in Singapore was never designed to hold more than 20% of its fleet.",4,669,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00669
2019-02-26-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Secondly, knowing that no fleet in Far East, and knowing that they needed to defend Malaya and Singapore from a land invasion from the north in 1936, the British turned to their air force. Unfortunately, the British air defense plan was fundamentally unsound as well. The British air force built a string of airbases to the north without consulting their army. While these air bases were close to South China Sea and the Thai border – areas that they expected the Japanese to invade from – they were situated in indefensible terrain. And after all these hassle, the British incredibly never found the money to deploy an air force large or sophisticated enough. All these meant that the under-strength British Army now had to defend not just the empty naval base in Singapore in the south, but also the under-equipped airbases in the north.",5,670,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00670
2019-02-26-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"In short, the Singapore Strategy was nothing more than a “Strategic Illusion”. A plan that could never work against a determined enemy, a plan one hopes will never be tested. But hope is not a strategy. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the British stood alone in Malaya and Singapore.",6,671,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00671
2019-02-26-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"In the final years before the Japanese invasion, the British did built up the Malayan army to almost three times the size of the invading Japanese army. But decades are needed to build and sustain a strong defense. Many historians including Frank Pike concluded that the large British Malayan army was only capable of fighting fixed-piece battles of WWI, and while there were some good units, even the British official historian Woodburn Kirby concluded that most of these units were raw and unfamiliar with how to fight in the tropics. Lastly, the British army lacked comprehensive intelligence on the Japanese, and therefore, were complacent.",7,672,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00672
2019-02-26-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"In December 1941, when the Japanese swept down from the north, they destroyed the small obsolete British air force in the north within 100 hours, and sank the only two major British ships in the Far East. They then proceeded to destroy the British Army dispersed throughout Malaya, piece-meal. They defeated the British at Jitra to win Northern Malaya; overran and disperse the British at Slim River, outmaneuvered the British at Muar to win the crucial fight for Johor, and reached the gates of Singapore, all within fifty-five days. After a seven-day fight for Singapore, the divided and demoralise British army, still 100,000 men strong, chose to surrender.",8,673,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00673
2019-02-26-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"So, what can we learn from the Fall of Singapore? The obvious answer is that we can only count on ourselves to defend Singapore, regardless of security arrangements with others. But there are at least three other lessons.",9,674,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00674
2019-02-26-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"The first lesson is sustained and sufficient defense spending is necessary. In the case of the British Empire after WWI, they faced a rapidly changing world order, with the rise of Japan and Germany. The rise of air power, use of combined arms, shift from battleships to carriers, all require major investments. When the British woke up to the reality in the mid-1930s, it was too late to reverse two decades of military neglect.",10,675,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00675
2019-02-26-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"The situation for Singapore today is vastly different, but some lessons are still worth noting. The most advanced militaries today grapple with major challenges such as adapting to fifth generation aerial warfare, contenting with cyber and hybrid-warfare, dealing with disruptive innovations from drones to AI. These reserves require major and sustained investments. Therefore, I am heartened that 30% of our Budget this year goes to defense, security and diplomacy because history shows there is no substitute to deterrence.",11,676,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00676

2019-02-26-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"The second lesson is, a nation’s security depends a strong economy and ample fiscal resources to deal with the changing world. In the case of the British Empire, while it thrived in the First Industrial Revolution of steam engines and weaving looms, it failed to transform its economy, and fell behind America and Germany in the Second Industrial Revolution of chemicals and cars. Its misguided monetary and fiscal policy led to deflation and depression. It accumulated significant debt because of WWI. For an empire where the sun never sets, it never build a diverse and sustainable tax base to pay for its defense.",13,678,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00678
2019-02-26-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"In short, the world changed dramatically for the British Empire but it ran out of money to adapt to the changing world. That was then. How about our world today? Henry Kissinger recently said, “We are in a very, very grave period for the world”, and the current times can only be marked as an “end of an era”. I am more optimistic. While there are major global uncertainties ahead, there are ample opportunities for a nimble Singapore. But this require us to sustain our economy and maintain our fiscal discipline. We are in good shape today. The past year’s GDP growth is strong, unemployment and inflation are both low, and median wage increases is high. But what about our economy in ten years time? No one can guarantee that our companies can continue to thrive in the face of technology disruption and global competition. Therefore, our companies and people must tap on various programmes and grants, and press on relentlessly to transform.",14,679,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00679
2019-02-26-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"On maintaining our fiscal discipline, there are many voices asking for more government spending, and to dig deeper into our reserve income. Many of them are for deserving causes. But our reserves must anchor our economy through turbulent times. If we fail to grow our savings over time, when a major storm hits Singapore a decade or two down the road, we may find our financial anchor insufficient to stabilise our economy, which would have grown larger by then.",15,680,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00680
2019-02-26-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"At the same time, in this house, we frequently say that we are not done building Singapore.

2019-02-26-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"The third lesson and final lesson is a successful society requires its people to have shared beliefs rooted firmly on reality. The British Empire had an unworkable defense plan. Over two decades, her electorate and leaders failed to robustly debate on whether it was realistic and whether there were sufficient resources to backstop the plan. Singapore’s success to date, depends on our people's consensus on what it takes for Singapore to succeed. But the world is increasingly diverse and our people's views mirror this increasing diversity.",17,682,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00682
2019-02-26-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"To meet tomorrow's challenges, we need to strengthen our shared beliefs in many areas. For example, how can we balance giving our youth with the best we can afford, while ensuring that they remain hungry and curious for new opportunities? How can we persuade our people that keeping Singapore open to the world is to our best collective interest? How can we continue the unfinished business of tackling inequality while maintaining the core promise of meritocracy?

For example, how can individuals seek reliable health information online and how can families obtain sound advice on managing household finances? In my research on parents with school-going children, I found that some parents were daunted by the online homework their children were given, and felt deeply insecure about their inability to help their children. Indeed, our digitally-connected world is constantly expanding in complex ways, with an ever-proliferating range of apps, portals, platforms and content. As far as possible, we must offer signposts to help people navigate their way online, and make sense of the deluge of information they encounter.",12,713,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00713

I look forward to it being disseminated across the relevant industry and education sectors.

Arguably, the most ambitious dimension that this Budget, and many to follow, has to address, pertains to daunting socio-economic challenges derived from rapidly greying demographics and inequality. Of the two, inequality is a multi-dimensional and complex problem that needs to be examined more closely.

This means that in recognising the economic realities of uneven distribution of resources, fiscal policy is meant to facilitate a slightly more equitable re-distribution of resources across the economy. So, we are seeing further enhancements to fiscal transfer packages such as the ComCare Long-term Assistance, and Workfare Income Supplement, alongside longer-term commitments such as the $6.1 billion Merdeka Generation Package and $5.1 billion in long-term care support initiatives, to form a vital safety net.",10,727,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00727
2019-02-26-T-008,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"But we must go beyond to address the true, underlying causes of inequality. Short-term redistribution of wealth is not only unhelpful for the future generations, it inadvertently increases social tensions when it devolves into a zero-sum game tug-of-war between the haves and have-nots. Already, some people are asking, ""Can you do more for the middle income group?"" ""What about those who don't have jobs? They can't even benefit from WIS.""",11,728,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00728

After all, the ultimate goal of inclusive fiscal policies is not merely some variant of Robin Hood-type of social transfers. Instead, a holistic approach to inequality is incomplete without an eco-system of measures and programmes to improve social mobility; which is a far more potent catalyst of socio-economic progress than welfare.",12,729,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00729

We already have a very established system for the conventional post-secondary route consisting of JCs and Polytechnics. Enhancements in the ITE education programme is something more recent, so we will have to focus more to continue enhancing it. This segment constitutes 25-30% of the post-secondary cohort each year, and is a significant future labour force with key skillsets for us to be future ready.",17,734,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00734

For example, I know of a young boy who worked two jobs while studying because of financial woes in the family. He does not blame his lack of finances, but he regrets his poor time management which has effectively rendered his two years in ITE as a waste of time because he skipped classes.

By the time they recognise the opportunities and potential provided by the school, it is a bit late. I hope a proactive approach can be taken to counsel students, particularly new admissions; teach them how to manage their resources, help them to apply for the necessary financial help, and follow up with their progress.

The Minister has revealed plans for more funding for students at IHLs who plan to intern overseas with Singaporean firms through the new Global Ready Talent Programme (GRTP). This also benefits the high-growth Singapore firms who will receive support to send their local employees for overseas postings.

The debate about distribution of wealth and inequality tends to focus on large fortunes at the top. But the redistribution of wealth is as much about encouragement of small savings at the bottom as it is about the restriction of the excesses at the top. So, it is just as important to encourage small savings at the bottom, rather than harping on restriction of excesses at the top. The rich get richer because they have ample funds to invest, benefit from high interest rates and grow their portfolios and assets.

I note that the Minister has plans for huge infrastructure projects and other infrastructure investments to be partly funded through borrowing and embedded government guarantees. I applaud this approach as have expressed my suggestions on this in my previous Budget response last year, to ensure inter-generational equity.

The future is unpredictable, and there may be significant inequality between generations. Just because the real incomes are rising over time does not necessarily mean that those born later enjoy higher lifetime incomes. Inflation, increased costs of living and so on could have a major impact on livelihoods. In fact, researchers from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) along with economists from Stanford University, Harvard University and the University of California at Berkeley presented financial reports and comparisons indicating that millennials are doing worse off than their parents. In the UK and USA, there is growing observation of millennials living with their parents because they cannot afford their own homes. This appears to be a trend in developed economies. Thankfully we do not have such issues here in Singapore.",30,747,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00747

Part of it reflects the expectation that future generations will be better off, and so a lower valuation is attached to the better off when measuring inequality at a point in time. So, as the economic situation in various developed economies has reflected, this is a dangerous mindset and we have to steer clear of. We risk increasing income inequality for the future generations otherwise.",31,748,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00748

As an ageing population that is gearing towards automation, the amount of income taxes collected is expected to decrease along with the number of people in the work force.

Some sort of wealth-based tax may be more pertinent, and we could have different tiers of taxes. For example, impose a 10% tax on purchase of goods in the luxury tier or fine dining at a restaurant, and a much lower tax like 3% on basic necessities like rice. So, increase tax rebates for social causes – so instead of paying taxes, the wealthy may choose to donate to causes they care about.",33,750,2019-02-26-T-008-S-00750

In the accommodation industry, for example, total manpower declined by about 1% between 2013 to 2018, even though total room stock increased by 4% during the same period.

This is a universal healthcare insurance that protects Singaporeans against large hospital bills, with premium subsidies and additional premium support from Government to help low-income Singaporeans and middle-income Singaporeans pay for their premiums. So, it is not quite accurate for Assoc Prof Goh to describe it as Singaporeans pay for each other, Government saves money. Actually, Government pays quite a bit of the premiums through premium subsidies and additional premium support. This is part of the sharing.",2,815,2019-02-26-T-012-S-00815
2019-02-26-T-012,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chee Hong Tat),"The same principle is applied for CareShield Life. There are premium subsidies, there is also additional premium support, and these are part of the design of the scheme. It is not cohort-based. It is structural.",3,816,2019-02-26-T-012-S-00816
2019-02-26-T-012,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chee Hong Tat),"CHAS, we will be enhancing the coverage of CHAS to benefit even more Singaporeans, especially for chronic care. In 2017, and this is before the enhancement, more than 650,000 Singaporeans benefited from $154 million of CHAS subsidies. And we will enhance the coverage, we will enhance the help that Singaporeans can get, the benefits that Singaporeans can get under CHAS, as part of enhancing primary care and giving Singaporeans greater peace of mind.",4,817,2019-02-26-T-012-S-00817
2019-02-26-T-012,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chee Hong Tat),"In our hospitals, in our Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOCs), in our nursing homes, there are also structural subsidies. These are means tested because we want to give more help to lower and middle income Singaporeans. When we introduce packages that are cohort-based, like the Pioneer Generation Package (PGP), the Merdeka Generation Package (MGP), these are on top of the structural subsidies that are already provided in the system for all Singaporeans.",5,818,2019-02-26-T-012-S-00818
2019-02-26-T-012,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chee Hong Tat),"Mr Singh claimed that the MGP gives off a pungent odour of an unfair advantage for the electoral prospects of the PAP, I hope I heard him correctly. Now, I wonder why Workers' Party chose to use such an unpleasant description. And to focus on politicising this tribute to our MGs. The Opposition calls for the Government to give more and yet when the Government gives more to help Singaporeans, the Workers' Party criticises the move as an election tactic. You cannot have it both ways. Please make up your mind and decide where you stand.",6,819,2019-02-26-T-012-S-00819
2019-02-26-T-012,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chee Hong Tat),"As previously explained, we are setting aside funds from current Budget surpluses to give our MGs greater peace of mind and encourage them to stay active and stay healthy. It is also to show our heartfelt appreciation to our MGs for their sacrifices and contributions to Singapore during the early years of our nation building. So, let us not diminish the significance of the PGP and the MGP.",7,820,2019-02-26-T-012-S-00820
2019-02-26-T-012,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chee Hong Tat),"It is misleading to link these packages to election cycles. We have explained this point before in the House, but let me say it again, because Mr Pritam Singh brought it up. The way we derive the surpluses is that you have to earn these surpluses during the term of Government. And then you set them aside, the surpluses that you have accumulated, to fund the PGP and the MGP. You cannot do this at the start of the term because you do not know at that point how much surpluses you are going to have and how much surpluses you can set aside to fund these packages. These have been explained before. It is part of the design of our system for financial prudence and sustainability.",8,821,2019-02-26-T-012-S-00821

What is the size of the bill, where are the funds coming from, how do we achieve maximum value for money, these are important questions.",9,822,2019-02-26-T-012-S-00822
