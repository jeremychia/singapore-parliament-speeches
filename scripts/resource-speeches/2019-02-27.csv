2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand in support of Budget 2019. I support the broad principles highlighted by the Finance Minister which Budget 2019 was formulated upon. I would like to discuss three topics.",1,8,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00008
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"First, universal support and cohort-based support schemes like Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation Packages; second, investing in our future; and third, why we should have a Climate Change Bill.",2,9,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00009
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"First, like many of us in this House, my parents belong to the Pioneer Generation. I have many relatives and friends who belong to the Merdeka Generation. Both the Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation lived through turbulent times of our nation building. They have worked hard and built this nation so that the subsequent generations that follow will have a much better future. I am born in 1968. So, I belong to the next cohort, which Mr Murali Pillai had referred to as the Majulah Generation.",3,10,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00010
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"But we were coined the Post-Independence Generation when we first came into this House. The next cohort consists of those born in 1960 to 1969, which includes Mr Speaker, yourself too. I would like to call this cohort ""the Independence Generation"", because we are born plus and minus five years from Independence.",4,11,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00011
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),I do agree with Assoc Prof Daniel Goh that the Merdeka Generation and the Pioneer Generation have taught us independence. That is the reason why I think Independence Generation is a much better name than the Majulah Generation.,5,12,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00012
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),We all are here because of them. We all want our Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation seniors to enjoy their golden years and age graciously and peacefully. I support the Pioneer Generation Package and the Merdeka Generation Package.,6,13,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00013
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Some in this House has asked whether cohort-based schemes like Pioneer Generation Package and Merdeka Generation Package can be replaced by a more permanent universal system. A permanent system that automatically give subsidy based on a certain age like our transport concession for seniors. All seniors age 60 and above can apply for a senior citizen concession card. In principle, if resources are available for the long haul, I can support a universal scheme that automatically distribute the benefits of the package to all above 60 years. But is it practical and realistic for the Government or for this House to propose and implement such a health scheme? Is it sustainable, given our ageing population and growing numbers of people in this age group over the next few years?",7,14,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00014
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Cohort-based schemes like Pioneer Generation Package and Merdeka Generation Package are targeted at the needs to these cohorts. As explained during the launch of the Pioneer Generation Package, this cohort has contributed to our nation building during difficult and challenging times. Many did not have proper education and good job opportunities. They worked hard to support their families and did not have sufficient savings for retirement and healthcare because CPF and MediSave schemes were not implemented yet. The package was tailored to their needs and targeted at the concerns they have.",8,15,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00015
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"A universal scheme will be more blunt, board based and less targeted. We are not starting from zero. As it is today, we do have a universal health scheme. One may go to the MOH website to enquire about the subsidies they can enjoy. If you key in 60 years old, which means your year of birth was 1959, and key in that you are Singaporean, the website will show 15 health schemes that you may get subsidy. These 15 schemes are MediShield Life, CareShield Life, MediSave,CHAS, ElderShield, Medifund, subsidies for services and drugs at Public Healthcare Institutions, Enhanced Screen for Life, Interim Disability Assistance Programme for the Elderly, Foreign Domestic Worker (FWD) levy concession for persons with disabilities, Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund, Care-givers Training Grant, Elder Fund, Foreign Domestic work Grant, and Subsidies for Government-funded intermediate and long-term care services. These are the 15 schemes there. Primary healthcare in polyclinics are heavily subsidised and they are not means tested. Any Singaporean can enjoy subsidy there. Likewise, subsidised healthcare at public hospitals are also affordable to all Singaporeans. For those who are not able to afford, medical social workers are there to assist and there is always Medifund. So, no Singaporean will be deprived of the medical care they need.",9,16,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00016
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"There are also some who asked whether the next generation that follows, that is, those who are currently 50 to 59 years old, will get similar package when we reach 60 years old, which is in 10 years time. I and many of us in this House belong to this generation, the Independence Generation. Our generation, in fact, has already received a much bigger and better package than the previous two generations. Those in our generation were given better education, better job opportunities, better housing, better healthcare, better transport and a better Singapore by the Pioneer and Merdeka Generations. Like the previous two generations, our generation have worked hard and contributed. We grew up in a more stable and prosperous Singapore, were able to save more for our retirement and medical needs compared to preceding two generations. Our needs are different.",10,17,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00017
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),There is an important difference between a cohort-based scheme and permanent scheme – that is sustainability. A cohort-based scheme is financed by the current government and does not burden our future generations. A permanent scheme will need additional recurrent funding which future government may not be able to cope.,11,18,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00018
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"In another five to 10 years, the new, future government if it is prudent and capable, we may see an Independence Generation Package that will cater to our needs at that point in time.",12,19,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00019
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Next, investing for our future. Human resource is the only and most important resource Singapore has. Development of human resources through education and upskilling is the key. Currently, formal education – Primary and Secondary school education – are heavily subsidised. Hence, parents only pay monthly standard miscellaneous fees of $6.50 and $5 monthly school fees for Secondary school. In contrast, a four-hour MOE Kindergarten programme will cost parents $160 per month. The difference in fees is quite stark. Pre-school education is currently not compulsory, hence, it does not have the support given. All educators know the importance of early childhood education as it sets the foundation for the child. I hope the Government or the future government will make pre-school or early childhood education compulsory and provide more resources so the school fees can be free just like for Primary school.",13,20,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00020
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),Upskilling and upgrading all Singaporeans for the future is important. Will the Government consider putting more resources into SkillsFuture and top up the accounts of Singaporeans who have utilised or exhausted their credits?,14,21,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00021
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"After education and upskilling, it is important that wages have to be increased to improve their lives.",15,22,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00022
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Mr Speaker, I would also like to ask what is the difference in goals between a Progressive Wage system, a Minimum Wage or a Leading Wage system, versus the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS)? Neither encourage one to be unemployed, so is the outcome not the same? There are many countries with Minimum Wage but few countries with WIS. Why is that so? How comprehensive is WIS? Are there low-wage workers that did not benefit from WIS?",16,23,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00023
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"My last topic will be on climate change. Mr Speaker, much has been said about our commitment to climate change. We have been educating our population on the greenhouse effect, carried out various campaigns, engaged transport operators, businesses and corporations and factories to get their buy-in.",17,24,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00024
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"But we do not have a Climate Change Bill. In UK, before the Climate Change Act became law, UK was struggling to meet its very unambitious emission reduction targets. The Act set a scientifically informed, long-term target of an 80% cut in emissions by 2050, which is legally binding. In other words, it aimed to increase ambition and to ensure that ambition was met.",18,25,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00025
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"There are many countries, e.g. Sweden where the Climate Change Act contains provisions on the government’s climate policy, what the work will be aimed at and how it should be conducted; Norway where the Climate Change Act offers a framework to promote the implementation of Norway’s climate targets as part of the transition to a low carbon society in Norway in 2050. In Asia, closer to home, Japan Climate Change Adaptation Act aims at enhancing adaptation efforts in Japan. It enshrines into law the 2015 National Adaptation Plan and sets updated obligations. Even Malaysia has announced in December last year that they are drafting a Climate Change Act, which will contain adaptation and mitigation plans to climate change. It would develop a list of comprehensive risk analytic simulating scenarios in the face of a rise in global temperatures of two degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, Scotland too acknowledged the warning of rising global temperatures and last year, they sought advice to further enhance it. In fact, in Scotland, their ministers are legally required to seek expert advice on the earliest achievable date for a net-zero target at least every five years.",19,26,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00026
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"But what about Singapore? Why we do not have a Climate Change Act? To show and enshrine our commitment to mitigate Climate Change, I propose we enact a Climate Change Act.",20,27,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00027
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Can the Government share what percentage of our energy used can be harnessed from renewable sources? Will the Government consider giving incentives to private property owners to install solar panels like many other countries do? Also, what percentage of recyclable waste that was collected for recycling actually get recycled? I noticed from a documentary recently that it was a dismal 50% which means the other 50% was disposed of as waste. How can we improve this percentage? Will NEA do more public education on this and teach residents to separate the different recyclable wastes rather than to treat the recycling bins as dustbins?",21,28,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00028
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Perhaps we may have to review the current design of the recycling bin at the HDB estates, which has just one large opening, and looks almost like a normal trash bin. Why not have them designed with separate small openings for each type of recyclables, like the ones along Orchard Road?",22,29,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00029
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"And, lastly, what is our plan to adopt the use of hybrid electric cars? I would like to encourage more drivers to use electric cars, but unfortunately, there are simply no charging points around. Will the Government take the lead to install more charging points around different parts of Singapore? Will BCA consider hardcoding this requirement in all buildings including new HDB estates?",23,30,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00030
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Mr Speaker, Sir, young Singaporeans are getting more environmentally-conscious as it concerns their future. So, I hope the Government can develop more concrete measures to create a culture of environmental-consciousness in our country.",24,31,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00031
2019-02-27-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"Mr Speaker, the Budget is an important annual process that defines the focus for the country in each fiscal year, outlines the plans to be implemented and also sets the tone of how the nation’s fiscal health may be like in the years ahead. But, how many Singaporeans take a strong interest in what the Budget is and discuss how each Budget impacts the future state of the country?",1,32,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00032
2019-02-27-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"A few days ago, I overheard a conversation between two individuals about Budget 2019. Mr X asked Mr Y, “Have you checked out the Budget calculator and see what benefits you get?” Mr Y replied, “Not yet, I roughly heard some things about it, but seems there is no benefits for me or my family.” Such a conversation may sound familiar to some. It indicates a lack of interest about the Budget or the only association they can have with the Budget is a measure of one-off monetary benefits.",2,33,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00033
2019-02-27-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"The underlying message is worrisome. That the Budget is nothing more than a bag of benefits that serves some people in one year or the other. As we chart our way forward and work towards an inclusive society, this is an increasingly pertinent topic to address.",3,34,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00034
2019-02-27-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"I believe it is time for us to define who we are, what we can do as one country and what we hope the future Singapore to be. While some issues can be addressed with short term fixes, the future state of the country requires longer term strategies. And this big picture, the end state must be defined and built together with the citizens and the Government. We need participants, not by-standers in the process.",4,35,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00035
2019-02-27-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"Singapore has a growing ageing population, the external environment is more dynamic and disruptive and future scenarios are more unpredictable; these are all facts and norms of the new age. For Singapore to rise above the challenges and ensure every citizen has a place in this country, we should take a hard look at what it takes to be inclusive. How can we be inclusive unless it is consciously built into our policies, ingrained as a culture and as individuals, we think and walk them like a way of life.",5,36,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00036
2019-02-27-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"To me, building social capital and civic participation is key. In this process, the concept of sharing is fundamental; sharing of wealth, sharing of people and available resources. Let us begin by looking at what areas we need to improve to achieve a more equitable distribution of resources.",6,37,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00037
2019-02-27-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"Looking at where Singapore is, one can say that Singapore should be considered having done well as our system is built on principles of meritocracy, has a fair and progressive tax system and the redistribution of wealth has a focus on social outcomes.",7,38,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00038
2019-02-27-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"But over the last decade, there is evidence that indicates the increase in wealth inequality has become greater than income inequality. Those with the wealth are not only on a better footing to accumulate more, they have even better access to resources that helps preserve their wealth.",8,39,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00039
2019-02-27-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"To reduce the wealth inequality gap in Singapore, we tax through personal income, property and consumption. This way, the top earners and those with more assets contribute. To further encourage those who have more to give, the tax-deductible donation scheme was implemented. I believe many donate as they believe in the causes and not because of the tax deductibles. But, it is also true that since the estate duty was scrapped in 2008, the number of charitable foundations and trust funds set up has since increased three folds.",9,40,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00040
2019-02-27-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"Compared globally, Singapore has a low personal income tax rate. But with a shrinking and ageing workforce, it is impractical to consider further taxes on income. After all, the ability of an average income worker to build wealth is dependent on sheer labour. Also, the consumption tax in one way or the other does impact the lower income group to meet their basic living expenses. The GST and transport vouchers, Silver Support Scheme and other subsidies given to the lower income group do help to defray some of their costs, but overall, consumption taxes indirectly do raise the general cost of living.",10,41,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00041
2019-02-27-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"In order to maintain fiscal prudence, we need new revenue sources to sustain the many programmes that may have a long tail in the years ahead. While we look ahead and review the current tax system in entirety, should we consider the possibility of a net wealth tax and inheritance tax for the ultra-high net worth individuals who make up 1%-2% of our society? In the spirit of giving and sharing, will the ultra-high net worth individuals be willing to share more of their wealth to uplift the vulnerable and less privileged communities?",11,42,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00042
2019-02-27-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"Another case in point is the wages of the low-income workers. Many of these workers are hired in domestically focused industry like the cleaning, security and landscaping. I have come across my own residents in these sectors and they work very long hours to ensure their income can meet the family’s expenses. For these individuals, we cannot expect they would have the luxury of time to upkeep and have upgrading of theirs skills, or even to further define their career path for the long run. Over time, they are the ones who are disadvantaged by us. Us, the consumers of their services.",12,43,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00043
2019-02-27-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"While the current Progressive Wage Model and Workfare Income Supplementary Scheme are designed to help raise their wages, the question still remains if this is sufficient in today’s context to support and meet the basic needs of the low-income worker and their family. The Government has implemented multiple targeted schemes in larger quantum like ComCare, GST rebate, transport vouchers, education funds, etc to continue assisting this low-income group. There are also donations of cash in kind from the public and the voluntary welfare organisations to them. Clearly, all donations will help them in one way or the other, but are these safety nets the answer to their basic needs?",13,44,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00044
2019-02-27-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"I feel that to effectively make a difference that impacts and uplift the lower percentile group, in particular those younger families, giving them access to resources, especially a decent living wage, so that each worker at the end of the month would have more to spare, is actually more critical. Not having time only to live hand to mouth, will also allow them to have some quality time with their children or grandchildren that can foster the growth of the next generation and instill family bonding that many average family enjoys.",14,45,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00045
2019-02-27-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"This brings us to the crux of the issue – how much more are consumers and employers willing to pay them to meet the living wage? We cannot continue this path of racing to the last dollar for the value of contracts, asking for more productivity from these workers without paying for tools or environment that aid their productivity improvement, assigning more tasks to them when we can do some on our own, something even as simple as clearing our own plates and trays after a meal.",15,46,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00046
2019-02-27-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"The employers too have a fair share to play in this as they balance their profits, re-invest in the workers and give the workers a decent wage to begin with. It is not how large or small the action is, but what we are willing to do and to what extent to effect the change. This comes back to the basic question of sharing. The top and middle tiers of the economy whilst they have more opportunities and pathway to elevate, they can certainly do more for the lower income group; starting with a willingness to pay more for their services.

When we exchange information, skills and expertise, it not only creates awareness of expectations, it also serves to update the workforce of changes within the workplace and consequently trains the people.

This drain of expertise and knowledge will have its repercussions if there are no early channels for inter-generation or inter-workplace transfer. I do not doubt that millennials are learning and will develop the different new skillsets to meet the future workplace demands.

This is the best Government in the world. They have taken care of us. I am going to vote."" Needless to say, she got her way.",1,55,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00055
2019-02-27-T-002,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines),"My grandmother and her generation of pioneers as well as subsequent generations of Singaporeans witnessed what the Government had done for the country and the people, and they trusted our leaders.

This trust has been built up over the last 50, 60 years by successive PAP governments. This is what made my grandmother's generation feel grateful for a good government.",3,57,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00057
2019-02-27-T-002,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines),"Sir, this faith in the Government is something very precious. In this day and age when trust in governments worldwide has been declining, we have to continuously strive to ensure that trust in our Government is not and will not be eroded. I know we have heard this before but I still want to repeat it because it is important. Once lost, it is difficult to bring back. Unfortunately, in the last few months, a spate of accidents and incidents have grabbed the headlines and shaken this confidence in our Government. I do not need to repeat them all but there are two I wish to mention as they are of concern to my residents.",4,58,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00058

Mr Speaker, Singaporeans were told that MediShield Life was introduced to provide them with peace of mind when they face huge medical bills. When it was reported that MediShield Life only paid $4.50 out of a $4,500 bill, it was quite a shock. Some of my residents thought that there had been a big mistake. Worse still, that Government was trying to cover up or sweep the matter under the carpet. I am glad that MOH and her GPC members have come out quickly to explain. MOH has also promised to review the MediShield Life insurance claim limits, and this is how the matter should be handled.",5,59,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00059
2019-02-27-T-002,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines),"If it was a mistake, just make things right again. If it was a misunderstanding or a special case, let us lay out the facts to the people. At the end of the day, if we provide a proper explanation to the people, they will understand, and they can be reassured that MediShield Life does work as intended. If we do not do that, there would be lingering doubts on what the Government had said about MediShield Life, and this is not good for the Government because trust and confidence will be gradually eroded.",6,60,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00060
2019-02-27-T-002,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines),"Mr Speaker, I had a discussion with my activists after the Budget speech and most felt that the Government does not explain matters clearly enough. But the fact is our people also tend not to pay attention to things that concern them. For example, when I asked them what is the price of water, how much does it cost if you drink two litres of water for 365 days, no one got it right. This is despite the Government’s efforts to communicate this over the past many years. By the way, the answer is $2. It cost us $2 per year to drink two litres of water – clean safe drinking water that flows out of our taps 365 days a year.",7,61,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00061

Today, the payout eligibility age for the Retirement Sum Scheme is still 65 for those born from 1954 onwards. This has been the case since 2007. But for people to think that the Government can secretly change the age shows that some people, and I hope is a minority, do not follow the news or tend to think the worst of our Government.",8,62,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00062

2019-02-27-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Mr Speaker, Sir, Winston Churchill famously said, ""If you make 10,000 regulations, you destroy all respect for the law"". In Singapore, I have received a lot of feedback that people are getting increasingly frustrated by a host of seemingly unnecessary and irrelevant regulations that are putting the brakes on their work or their lives. In an increasingly complex society where change is happening more and more quickly, the tendency is to come up with more regulations to protect interests of many diverse groups. Of course, some regulations are necessary and are good for the society. When more people started using Personal Mobility Devices (PMDS), for instance, we had to come up with rules to protect the safety of others. Or Workfare regulations, which have been protecting older lower income Singaporean workers. But in other areas, the amount and nature of regulations might be adding more red tape and making our lives miserable for businesses. Before I elaborate, I would like to declare my interest as the CEO of ComfortDelGro Taxi business.",1,73,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00073
2019-02-27-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"My architect friends have been complaining to me about their less than pleasant experience with the Building Construction Authority (BCA) and Fire Safety and Shelter Department (FSSD). I face the same issues when I need to construct a new building, either as part of my community work or in the course of my work in my company. They have shared many stories with us. But I will cite one that is the most painful to the architects.",2,74,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00074
2019-02-27-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"On 13 March 2014, BCA issued a circular to inform building industry players that they would have to obtain approval of building plans before commencing non-structural building works. Non-structural building works include building of walls and partitions so that contractors can install pipes and wires early. Prior to 2014, contractors could start non-structural work with a good preliminary building plan and Qualified Person (QP)'s undertaking to comply with the building codes. The new requirement to obtain approval of the full building plan which has to incorporate approvals from various authorities like NEA, LTA, NParks, typically would delay the project for months. Appeals by architects to the BCA have fallen on deaf ears, for reasons best known by the BCA.",3,75,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00075
2019-02-27-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Next, I would like to turn to a Statutory Board that is closer to my heart, LTA. Every new car model has to go through a homologation process – a mouthful – by LTA to verify whether the car model is safe to be driven on the Singapore road. The homologation process is relatively manual, tedious and lengthy. For example, LTA requires motor traders to input 52 safety items into LTA's system while our closest competitor, Hong Kong need only 26 items. There are also many rounds of clarifications by LTA which has slowed down the approval process. As a result, even current models with minor improvements or facelift also takes about eight weeks to homologate instead of two to three weeks previously. Industry players have given feedback to LTA on many occasions to simplify the homologation process, which can be stretched for months. However, LTA is quite happy to keep the process lengthy. Perhaps this is the way, LTA is trying to make Singapore car-lite? More importantly, these are the difficulties arising from bureaucratic red tape which many people have been complaining about.",4,76,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00076

ABB, a large company, had been trying for six months to seek approval from the Energy Market Authority (EMA) without success to install a 50kwh DC charger to fully charge an electric car in 30 minutes. In this case, the CEO of EMA personally intervened and the DC chargers are now installed islandwide by the SP Group. But not many regulatory authorities are as progressive as EMA.

2019-02-27-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"To be objective, many industry players do not like to be regulated. Very often, private companies feel that competition will drive quality and there is no need for the regulators to impose many rules. They feel that Singapore should be as laissez-faire as Hong Kong. However, competition is often not perfect and some form of regulation is important, necessary and at times, essential. On the other hand, over-regulation can stifle creativity, slow down processes and add compliance costs without obvious benefits. A total removal of regulations could lead to many other problems like unfair competition or hurting the interest of consumers, like the Hokkien saying, 树倒猴子耍, it means that when the tree serving as a pillar falls, all hell breaks loose.",6,78,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00078
2019-02-27-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"No private company likes to be regulated, no matter how altruistic one is. Thus, it is often considered as biased, not objective and self-serving when the parties being regulated complain that the regulator is enforcing unnecessary rules. This includes myself when my industry is being regulated by LTA. However, my views changed when I was preparing for River Hongbao 2019 which has just ended. As Chairman of River Hongbao, I was a volunteer, not paid and I had nothing to gain financially. Nonetheless, I also encountered some issues with the regulators.",7,79,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00079

Many visitors, comprising mainly local residents of all races, told me they enjoyed the larger-than-life lanterns, food street, stage performances and particularly the spectacular international fireworks display. I would like to thank the organising committee, the partners, the volunteers for their hard work to make River Hongbao one of the most successful in the recent years.

2019-02-27-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"However, I would like to share that the beloved fireworks display almost could not happen. This year, we appointed an experienced fireworks vendor to arrange for the fireworks display at the River Hongbao. This fireworks vendor has been the company behind the fireworks display for the National Day parade for the past decade. It has years of experience in applying for all of the necessary fireworks permits, including getting approval from PUB, which is the custodian of the Marina Bay reservoir.",9,81,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00081
2019-02-27-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"For some reasons, this year, a PUB executive refused to issue the permit for the fireworks as late as a fortnight before the opening ceremony of the River Hongbao at which Prime Minster was the Guest-of-Honour. They asked the vendor many questions. I was of course very worried. By that time, the interest in the River Hongbao fireworks was so strong that we had already issued 100,000 fireworks tickets. Thus, the prospect of the fireworks show being cancelled was imminent and preposterous. The 100,000 ticket holders would be very disappointed. More importantly, the approval for the River Hongbao fireworks had been sought months before, with no positive reply from PUB. Fireworks shows have routinely been put up in Marina Bay, with approvals granted, with no issues before.",10,82,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00082
2019-02-27-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Fortunately, I had someone in the House that I could appeal to and we received approval from PUB within a day of appeal. I do not know what actually happened but I am grateful that the fireworks display could take place during the eigth days of River Hongbao. As a result, we had record attendance at the River Hongbao this year. I would like to say a big ""thank you"" to PUB and the higher authority, that I would not name, who helped me. But Mr Speaker, Sir, I could keep quiet and move on. My concern is, what if I had no recourse? What if the fireworks were cancelled? What if I was not able to appeal to the authority? It appears that we need the intervention by a higher authority in the case of the River Hongbao fireworks and installation of DC charger for “exceptions” to be made and before things can move ahead.",11,83,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00083
2019-02-27-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"The above industrial examples and recent episode with PUB have highlighted the frustration of many ordinary people with various Government regulatory bodies. We need to strike a balance between laws that are so general and simplistic that they become ambiguous, and regulations which go into such nitty-gritties that it becomes a nightmare to observe and abide by. We need to review regulations and strike them off when it becomes more of a hindrance than a help. The best way to get a sense of what may be obsolete is to rely on feedback. We should listen to the people who have to comply with the regulations and their reasons for why they find some legal requirements very onerous.",12,84,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00084
2019-02-27-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"However, my concern with direct feedback is that many private companies are afraid to speak up against their regulators for fear of repercussions. Many companies have told me that they experience additional hindrance when they voice out too strongly against their regulators. In fact over lunch just now, a company said, they do not just voice out against regulations at all. They just comply. Some companies told me they refrain from giving genuine feedback as they do not want to bite the hand that feeds them, especially when they have to bid for contracts from their regulators. In fact, all the companies that have provided me with feedback to the cases cited above have asked me not to name their organisations. How then could the Government obtain genuine, objective and timely feedback from the parties most affected by the regulations? Some say they should feedback to Members of Parliament and let Members be their mouth piece, which is precisely what I am doing today. This is useful but definitely not enough.",13,85,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00085
2019-02-27-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"We need more systematic ways to obtain regular, timely and objective feedback from the industry players. To overcome the fear of repercussion, perhaps the Government can establish a neutral channel, similar to the whistle-blower policy, to encourage feedback. Will such channel attract only frivolous complaints? I do not think so. Another way for us to develop and fine-tune our regulations is to have deeper understanding between the public service – which enforces those regulations – and the private sector, through work exchange programmes.",14,86,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00086
2019-02-27-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"As someone who has work experience in both the public and private sectors, I have spoken on the need for this work exchange programmes in the past. Since then, I have observed and I know for the fact that there are small but sporadic efforts to do so. Some Government agencies have started to send and pay for their staff to work at the private sector organisations that they regulate. There are many benefits for such work exchange programmes. By “walking in the other person’s shoes”, the public servant who returns to his organisation are likely to have a deeper understanding on how the private company works; what kind of regulations are necessary and effective; what kind of regulations are difficult to comply and do not serve the policy’s intent.",15,87,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00087
2019-02-27-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"The public servants with immersion experience in the private sector can also better help to design incentives schemes to encourage companies to upgrade, to adopt new technology, to embrace digital transformation and rely less on foreign labour. In addition, they can also better anticipate and detect the loopholes private companies can exploit and abuse Government incentive schemes. Had this been done earlier, schemes like the Productivity and Innovation Credit scheme (PIC), launched in 2010 to encourage businesses to invest in productivity and innovation, might not have been abused to such a large extend. In 2018, IRAS said it prosecuted 13 cases involving 37 claims amounting to $804,756 of PIC cash payouts and this could be just the tip of the iceberg. The penalties and fines totalled $2.8 million. These are the cases where regulation is absolutely necessary, but has to be developed and enforced with deep understanding of how it would be interpreted on the ground.",16,88,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00088
2019-02-27-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Private companies can also send their staff for work stints in the public service. The private sector workers can better appreciate the need for regulations, understand the complexity of taking into account the interests of various parties and help the Government to better design incentives to shape the behaviour of the private companies in the industry transformation journey. These work exchanges could last for one to two years, and the staff who are selected should be promising staff at the middle management level.",17,89,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00089
2019-02-27-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"On a more personal note, as the President of the Volleyball Association of Singapore, I have seen the benefits of such exchanges first-hand. Last year, a staff from Sport Singapore, which oversees the National Sports Associations (NSAs), was posted to work as a General Manager in the Volleyball Association – not to clean up the messes, just to be sure, but to develop the sport in the volleyball fraternity. This proves to be a hit. She has helped Sports Singapore to better understand the challenges face by the NSAs. At the same time, she can tap on her experience in managing the NSAs and her networks in Sports Singapore to help in nurturing the volleyball players, volleyball coaches, securing training and competition venues for volleyball and more. Her posting has been mutually beneficial, very good and rewarding.",18,90,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00090
2019-02-27-T-002,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"The staff exchange efforts between the public and private sectors have so far been ad hoc. Perhaps, the Head of the Civil Service can consider a more structured, scalable and sustainable programme for such work exchanges between the public and private sectors. In the larger scheme of things, such exchanges not only help to develop more relevant regulations, better enforcement policies and better incentive schemes for the private sector, the private and public sectors can also exploit the mutual learning between the two sectors for the better good of Singapore.",19,91,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00091

For that matter, I am pleased that Senior Minister of State Mr Chee Hong Tat had indicated yesterday that he would be leading efforts to simplify the regulations in the food industry. This is good news. I hope Senior Minister of State Mr Chee can review the same in other sectors as well.

2019-02-27-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"What is the best way to reduce inequality? The answer is ensuring social mobility and social mixing. In this respect, I agree with what Prime Minister Lee said in October last year  ""We must not allow social stratification to harden in Singapore.""",2,116,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00116
2019-02-27-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"We have done well to ensure that there is less social stratification where we live. The Prime Minister gave the example of our HDB towns, which mix rental blocks with owned blocks, and have flats of all sizes within the same building.

2019-02-27-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, we have a very well-respected education system that many countries aspire to emulate. The recent OECD report titled “Excellence and Equity in Education” similarly shared many positive aspects of our education system and about how disadvantaged students here do well compared with their peers around the world.

2019-02-27-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"One of the things that might prevent social mixing and harden social stratification in our Secondary schools is the practice of streaming. We introduced streaming in 1980, and I understand the rationale. It caters to the different learning needs and pace of our students and it has helped to lower our attrition rates which is now at less than 1%, compared to 30%-40% at the start of our education journey. Dr Intan also said in 2017 that streaming ""helps teachers in being more focused in their teaching so that they are able to pitch their teaching content and pedagogy that are suitable for the students they teach.""",6,120,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00120
2019-02-27-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"But the problem is that we are not just streaming our students based on their academic results. As Minister Ong has stated, ""Social economic status has become significantly correlated with PSLE results."" The reality is that students in the Normal stream tend to have a lower social economic status, as compared to those from the Express stream. We know that from 2014 to 2018, 69% of Secondary school students who received assistance from the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme were from the Normal stream.",7,121,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00121
2019-02-27-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"We also know that the percentage of students living in public rental flats is higher in the Normal streams than those in the Express stream. We all know that we hang out with our classmates much more than with our schoolmates. What streaming has possibly done is to reduce social mixing and, again, harden social stratification.",8,122,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00122
2019-02-27-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I spent the last year researching for this speech, filing questions in Parliament and I spoke with parents, students and teachers. Everyone understood why we started streaming. But quite a number of them gave pause and raised concerns when I suggested that streaming could be stratifying our schools and preventing our students from mixing across social economic backgrounds. I am sure streaming was not meant to divide our nation by social economic status, but we now see that streaming does contribute to it. We have tried so hard to prevent social stratification in our homes; we must try just as hard to do so in our schools.",9,123,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00123
2019-02-27-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The next logical question is whether students move between streams. After all, if a Normal (Technical) student can move easily to the Express stream, we could all afford to be less worried about social stratification. Unfortunately, we cannot. Each year, 530 Normal (Technical) students transfer to the Normal (Academic) stream. Of these students, only 10 to 20 of them eventually move on to the Express stream.",10,124,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00124
2019-02-27-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Here is what it means  If you are a student from the Normal (Technical) stream, you have less than 1% chance to move to the Express stream. What is worse, the stratification continues further up the education ladder. Over the past three years, Normal (Technical) graduates have made up only 5% of those who graduated from our public Polytechnics and only 1% of those who graduated from our autonomous Universities. Most finish their studies in ITE. Data provided by MOE show that ITE graduates earned a starting salary of $1,900 in the private sector in 2017. By contrast, public University graduates earned a starting salary of $3,300.",11,125,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00125
2019-02-27-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Why do students from the Normal stream struggle to move to the Express stream? One reason could be the psychological barriers that streaming imposes on Normal stream students. Minister Ng last year acknowledged concerns that streaming could inadvertently discourage students. Dr Intan also said, ""Academic streaming tends to pigeon-hole students and inadvertently places expectations about their intelligence or abilities according to the stream they are in.""",12,126,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00126
2019-02-27-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Indeed, for some students there is a strong stigma associated with being in the Normal stream. One 2006 research paper, titled ""Building Teacher Capacity in Curriculum and Pedagogical Design in Normal Technical Classrooms,"" provided this summary  ""Perhaps the most common and injurious perception associated with NT or EM3 students is stupidity. Other negative perceptions of people interviewed on the streets are  ""attitude not good"", ""Ah Beng type"", ""hopeless"", ""can't do anything, cant go anywhere"", ""unmotivated"", ""lazy"" and ""ill-disciplined"". Some students may have even internalised such negativities. It is not unusual for students in the Normal stream to blame themselves, leading to the worry that such students suffer from low self-esteem.""",13,127,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00127

She said, ""The present streaming of students in Secondary schools have much psychological impact on the youths. The Normal stream is not normal, according to how the students and parents feel. They feel that they are inferior to their academic-better fellow schoolmates. And why do we have a system that makes our youths feel inferior at a young tender age?""",14,128,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00128

Today, he is an economics teacher at a Junior College. David's success was almost not to be. His parents divorced when he was young, and he lived with his mother who was visually impaired. He went around selling tissue paper, together his mother, to make ends meet. His mother passed on when David was 12. He did not do well for his PSLE and went into the Normal (Technical) stream.

His new group of friends often hung out in the canteen to do their homework. They also helped to coach him in his studies. He had a dream of becoming a teacher, and worked hard for it for his N-levels, in hopes of eventually doing his O-Levels.

It was only through this intervention that he was able to get past the system and eventually did his O-levels. David is a success story and he worked hard to succeed. But, as he shared with me, his story is also about how social mixing made a difference for him. While we share the success stories, we also need to remember that David is not a representative of the majority of Normal (Technical) students. In fact, he is, unfortunately, a minority.

2019-02-27-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, in his speech, the Minister for Finance was right to point out the decline in support for globalisation. This decline in support is not an irrational one. There is evidence that globalisation has so far produced winners as well as losers. World Bank economist Branko Milanovic studied the distribution of incomes across the world as globalisation took root over a 20-year period from 1988 to 2008. He concludes that, for individuals, globalisation has brought about divergent changes in real income. The ""winners"" included the bottom third of income earners, the middle classes of the emerging market economies in China, India and Indonesia, and the global top 1%. The ""losers"" were the middle class of the old OECD countries, and the poorest 5%. This could offer a partial explanation for Britain voting to leave the European Union, and for the triumph of US Presidential candidate Trump's election slogan  ""America First"". Most analyses show that Asia is doing relatively well with the growth of the middle-class, but Asia faces the challenge of growing domestic inequality. Thus, it is good to see the Minister for Finance acknowledging that Singapore's long-term challenges include social mobility and inequality, which will be stressors of our social unity.",1,141,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00141

Some have argued that living standards of citizens should be equalised as much as possible, with particular attention paid to vulnerable groups, that financial markets and labour protection need to be regulated, and welfare policies implemented. It is suggested that taxation policies need to be progressive, with clampdowns on tax avoidance. On the fiscal front, there should be increased spending on health, education and social safety nets.

Across the world, the impact of Industry 4.0 on jobs has generated intense interest. Many predict major job losses due to automation. For instance, in a 2013 Oxford University study of the impact of computerisation on employment, authors Frey & Osborne predict that almost half of US workers would face risks of their jobs being automated by 2030. Economist Tyler Cowen has argued that automation could produce profound inequality as a majority of people will find their jobs taken by robots and will be forced into low-paying service work. Only a minority – those highly skilled, creative and lucky – will have lucrative jobs, and be wildly better paid than the rest. Others are less pessimistic, with MIT economist Erik Brynjolfsson noting that automation will eventually create jobs.",5,145,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00145

To this end, there have been significant efforts by the Government and the private sector to respond to disruption, as seen in the massive digitisation efforts, automation initiatives and the professional conversion programmes. The message that workers need to adapt is clear. The question is how well such initiatives are serving to give economic security to workers. For instance, we are told that from 2016 to 2018, the Adapt and Grow Initiative has enabled more than 76,000 jobseekers to find employment. While the number seems impressive, it would be useful to know whether these jobseekers who switched industry had comparable remuneration or had pay cuts, and how many of them could not find new employment even though they tried to signed up for the initiative.",6,146,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00146

This is referred to by the International Labour Organisation as Labour Under-utilisation. Today's labour market is much more diverse than when the Merdeka Generation came out to work in the 1970s. In those days, it was common to hear of employees spending their entire working lives with one employer, and ""job hopping"" was frowned upon.

2019-02-27-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"As far as underemployment is concerned, there was a recent interesting survey, published in 2017 by the Ong Teng Cheong Institute. The study discussed the issue of how to measure underemployment properly, and recognised that underemployment was too complex to measure with any single indicator. It decided to adopt a multi-factor definition of underemployment, namely, persons who were degree holders and above, in full-time work and earning less than $2,000 per month. The survey yielded an underemployment rate of 4.3%, which was higher than the MOM's rate of 3.3% based solely on time criteria. In the survey, the profile of the underemployed showed that they tended to be female, have no children and stay in HDB flats. They were employed at businesses serving mainly the domestic market, with a median age of 35 years, and with 10 to 15 years of work experience.",8,148,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00148
2019-02-27-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"As to the effects of underemployment, the study found that the underemployed reported facing challenges, such as having lower status than what they deserve, being underpaid, feeling insecure about their income and job, and lacking finances for daily expenses. This group indicated that they were in their current predicament involuntarily, as they were found to want to better their prospects by reskilling and upskilling, although they were unsure of what skills may be in demand and how to take the next step.",9,149,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00149
2019-02-27-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Turning now to MOM's figures, as at June 2018, the underemployed rate was 3.3%. The rate was derived on a time-based definition of underemployment, that is, persons working part-time and would like to work full-time. Even by MOM’s measure, the 3.3% translates into nearly 73,000 workers. The MOM statistics also suggest that underemployment affects those with less education more  while underemployment for university graduates is at 2.3%, for those with secondary education, this rises to nearly 4%, and for those with below secondary education, the underemployment rate is 5%. This may suggest that if there may be a class dimension to this as well, with the less educated more prone to underemployment.",10,150,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00150
2019-02-27-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, it is food for thought to try to reconcile the results of the survey by the Ong Teng Cheong Institute and the MOM data. In order to get a better handle of how underemployment is affecting our society, I ask the Government to continue to improve its measures of underemployment and to monitor the effects of underemployment on the well-being of different segments of society. I plan to talk more about this at the MOM Committee of Supply (COS) debate.",11,151,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00151
2019-02-27-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Finally, Sir, I wish to make a few observations about the vulnerable workforce. Over the years, I have noticed that at the Meet People Sessions, residents of lower income commonly report doing gig-economy jobs, such as furniture movers and in food delivery. Some have told me that they have few options and need the flexibility of time to attend to family issues which crop up often. They do not have paid help or family support, and find it difficult to take time off regular work to attend to personal matters. It is well-known that gig-economy jobs come with hardly any employee benefits such as paid leave or bonuses, and do not attract CPF contributions, though I am aware that the Government is looking into improving terms and conditions for gig workers.",12,152,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00152
2019-02-27-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The vulnerable workforce also has less ability to withstand the vicissitudes of life. I recently encountered a young single mother who had three children. She received no support from the children’s father whom she divorced. Due to her need to work and care for her young children, she took on a gig job, delivering food on a motorcycle. In a moment of inattention, she beat a red light and was duly notified by the Traffic Police to pay a composition fine of $200. As she did not have the funds to make the payment, she came to the Meet People Session for help. I do not know whether the law enforcement agencies have ever allowed payment of composition fines by instalments, but I know that the clock is ticking to the deadline for payment. Failure to pay will result in the case going to court and attracting higher fines. So, I did not write in to the agency, but instead found funds to assist her to pay.",13,153,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00153
2019-02-27-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Time and again, I have seen residents who do not attend court being subject to Warrants of Arrest, over regulatory matters such as parking and smoking fines.

In fostering a caring and inclusive society for all Singaporeans, this is where the role of the arts and culture can come in.

It eventually turned into an exhibition titled Digimuse Presents, which featured a diverse range of seven digitally led prototype projects to enhances the journey of cultural discovery for museum-goers; allowing visitors to explore fresh perspectives of culture and heritage via a series of immersive virtual and augmented reality exhibits, dynamic conversations enabled by AI and more.

The use of digital technology has made their shows and performances more attractive. The National Museum has introduced the Digimuse initiative to enhance visitor experience by combining technology with arts, and has attracted to close to 90,000 visitors. The Singapore Chinese Orchestra and Zaobao.sg launched the first digital Chinese orchestra concert in the world in 2017 so that audiences around the world can all enjoy the music from the Singapore Chinese Orchestra. The 2019 International Art Festival incorporated new technology elements into the stage setting which has not only increased the interactions between performers and audiences, but also created a new narrative. Local arts group Finger Players will be presenting in March this year an inclusive performance to audiences with disabilities through usage of close captioning and audio description. I firmly believe that the use of technology can not only improve efficiency in commercial field, but also serve communities from different backgrounds better.

So, I urge the Government to do away with the distribution of Budget benefits based on home type, but instead base it on income. If a citizen is a retiree with no income but staying in a private property, why should he get less GST Vouchers than someone who earns a lot more but stay in a 3- or 4-room HDB flat? Why should someone without any income not enjoy the benefits of the Bicentennial Bonus simply because his home has an annual value of more than $21,000?",10,258,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00258
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),This is unfair to the Singaporeans who had contributed to Singapore but had pursued their dreams of staying in a better home when they were younger.,11,259,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00259
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"I also call on the Government to consider a change in its policies to allow elderly singles to rent a flat alone. During my MPS, I regularly receive requests from elderly seniors who for some reason cannot get along with their family members or their children. They quarrel frequently and want to shift out so that they can preserve their dignity and not stay in an unhappy home. However, they have no where to move to.",12,260,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00260
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Much as we wish to encourage the families to look after their seniors, the reality is that relationship issues are not easily resolved. I am of the view that we should not compel an elderly person to stay with the family when he or she is clearly estranged from the family. Can the Government consider better support for our seniors by allowing them to rent a 1-room flat on a case by case basis? This would allow some of them to live in dignity in their retirement years instead of living in a hostile environment.",13,261,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00261
2019-02-27-T-002,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Finally, I urge the Government to consider changes in policies on seller's stamp duties. Last month, I filed a question to ask whether the Government can waive stamp duty for sellers in an enbloc sale if they did not agree to the sale of the property. The Government declined to do so and with respect, I feel that this is unfair. The Government should not impose a tax on owners of properties when they are unwilling sellers of their property during an enbloc sale. They are forced to sell their property due to the nature of the enbloc sale. Why should they be penalised? A review of this policy should be considered.",14,262,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00262

2019-02-27-T-002,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Mr Speaker, I rise in support of the Budget. We frequently hear residents complain about the cost of living.

2019-02-27-T-002,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),I have also met residents who are able to cope but they are unhappy because they are running harder than ever just to stand still. They feel they cannot even achieve what their parents had.,4,267,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00267
2019-02-27-T-002,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"They lament, ""We are university graduates, but our standard of living does not seem to be better than our non-graduate parents who could afford bigger houses and more luxuries when we were growing up"".",5,268,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00268

2019-02-27-T-002,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),The Minister for Finance has assured us in his Budget speech that he is keeping a close watch on the cost of living that he is alleviating cost pressures in healthcare and education. He is keeping the Singapore Dollars strong to maintain import prices and he is providing support for the needy and the low-income households.,7,270,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00270
2019-02-27-T-002,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"But I feel the most important thing that he might have done for Singaporeans is to keep our taxes low. This allows us to keep money in our pockets and decide how to spend it rather than him deciding how to spend it for us. When I was working in Japan, in an ironic way, I was unhappy every month when i got my paycheck it was a painful because 50% of it would automatically be deducted for taxes. It was the same in the US when I first started working. More than 40% of it in taxes, and paying rent and keeping the lights on, I had little to show for it. Singapore must not be like that.",8,271,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00271
2019-02-27-T-002,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Mr Speaker, for many years now, we have talked about our ageing population and low TFR being existential issues for the survival of Singapore.

2019-02-27-T-002,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"On the cost side, they face intense pressure at this stage of their lives. They have to cope with wedding expenses, paying for the house, planning for kids, trying very hard to afford a car, but on the income side, there seem to be fewer stable jobs as more companies move towards contract and freelance.",10,273,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00273
2019-02-27-T-002,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),Retrenchment is also no longer rare. Many workers in the private sector not only compete against Singaporeans in what we know as meritocracy. They also compete against nationalism as practiced in some foreign-owned or foreign-run companies and they are fighting forces beyond their control and they might not be doing well not because they are not trying hard enough. We must put ourselves in the shoes of such workers and not just simply dismiss their concerns.,11,274,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00274
2019-02-27-T-002,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"So, in such a situation, to delay or avoid having children would be altogether a very rational response. Children are expensive, they raise the minimum income any household needs each month, and from my conversations with residents in Marsiling-Yew Tee, this is the main contributing factor towards our low TFR.",12,275,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00275
2019-02-27-T-002,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"There have been countries that have been successful in reversing a low TFR. Sweden was 1.5 in the 1990s and they have gone back to 1.8.

2019-02-27-T-002,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Policies in Sweden and Norway make it easier for mothers to both work and have children.

Childcare is affordable and of an acceptable quality, and lower income inequality puts parents under less pressure to spend on enrichment and tuition to push their kids to succeed.",14,277,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00277
2019-02-27-T-002,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"In Singapore, awareness of income inequality has risen and this has given recent attention to this topic.

2019-02-27-T-002,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"So, Mr Speaker, I would like to make several suggestions in this debate for the Government to consider.",17,280,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00280
2019-02-27-T-002,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"First, pre-school fees. Residents complain that the current structure is too complicated. Instead of a working mother’s subsidy, they would rather pay less upfront. So, instead of paying the gross and then claiming a subsidy, can they just pay net? Would it be possible to charge just $10 a month for pre-school without means testing, like what we are doing in Primary school right now?",18,281,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00281
2019-02-27-T-002,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"The Government has said that different providers of pre-school services is essential to safeguard consumer choice. But many cynics would also point out that the only provider of Primary school services is MOE; there is not much choice although there are many schools. There is a growing awareness that pre-school affects our future performance and, hence, is important. So, let us put our money where our mouth is and make this truly affordable.",19,282,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00282
2019-02-27-T-002,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Second, childcare and babycare options are currently expensive, and that is assuming you can even find a vacancy. There are cheaper alternatives but quality is often not up to expectations. Some couples are lucky and may have able grandparents to help them out. But for those who do not, it is very difficult to have kids. Government subsidy needs to be increased in this segment.",20,283,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00283
2019-02-27-T-002,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Third, provide subsidised school bus. Even the little things add up. It is amazing to me that we are able to read a story in The Straits Times about exorbitant bus fares, and highlighting the need for better regulation. While some might say that this is a small amount, I would say that each straw adds up until the camel’s back breaks.",21,284,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00284
2019-02-27-T-002,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Fourth, make it easier for mothers to choose between work and motherhood. As Sweden, Norway and others have shown, work life balance for mothers can boost TFR. At a minimum, mothers would benefit from being allowed to work remotely and to have flexible hours. But how many employers are enlightened, or do they need a bit of Government nudging in the right direction to do so? A more direct solution is paid maternity leave, including a portion that is being funded by the Government. Norway has up to 35 weeks of government-funded maternity and paternity leave. We have to ask ourselves  what is the value of each additional child to Singapore? Would we consider this to be a worthwhile investment for our national resources?",22,285,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00285
2019-02-27-T-002,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Mr Speaker, in conclusion, good government is about balancing priorities.

2019-02-27-T-002,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Unfortunately, this often allows a certain portion of relatively well-off individuals who are staying in a smaller flat to receive a higher amount of grants than is fair.

Would MOH consider assigning a suitable Voluntary Welfare Organisation (VWO) in each constituency to address this pressing need? This VWO should already be involved in this field. If there is no VWO involved in this area, the Government may wish to consider collaborating with an existing VWO to provide this service. Once these seniors are identified, we can refer them to this VWO which should be within walking distance of their flats instead of requiring them to go to the Institute of Mental Health or waiting for officers to visit these seniors to render help.",13,381,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00381

Due to the less attractive job nature and remuneration, Singapore has always relied on foreign workers. Most of them are Work Permit and S Pass holders. With a rapidly ageing population, the number of elderly who need care will only increase. If we want to attract more Singaporeans to this sector, the salary must be increased, and seniors and their families will have to pay correspondingly higher care fees. As you can see, fee increase will become a problem.",17,385,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00385

Nevertheless, our SMEs face a myriad of challenges. For some, it is a matter of survival, making just enough sales to get by, while others hesitate to spend resources on something they are not sure will benefit their businesses. To me, transforming an economy is just not about economics. It is also about transforming our society, from business-owners to workers, so that at all levels of society embraces the spirit of change.

I am also involved with several networking sessions involving Malay/Muslims startups and entrepreneurs. I meet many new entrepreneurs regularly, some young, some not so young.

Before the ABC Waters programme came about, there used to be many signs across our reservoirs warning the public not to do a variety of things near or in the reservoir.

The Prime Minister in his 2018 New Year day message called for us to use the bicentennial “to reflect on how our nation came into being, how we have come this far since, and how we can go forward together”.

While there is broad-based support for the commemoration, there are also voices of concern and unease. One particular response struck me deeply. A certain Mr Osman Sidek wrote to the Straits Times and his letter was published on the 4 February 2019 issue. In it, he raised the insightful point that colonialism cannot just be presented from one community’s perspective. The impact of colonialism on the indigenous population and their sense of loss and justice need also to be acknowledged. But he cautioned that the unhappiness is not directed at history, but at the very idea of colonialism, or specifically how one could lose one’s own country to colonisers.",17,405,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00405

And yet the sacking of a once-vibrant Malacca Sultanate in 1511 by the Portuguese has also been highlighted by some historians as a turning point for this region.

While the transformative hand of the EIC and the British on Singapore is beyond doubt, there is a history of a port, settlement and island that runs far deeper than historians had surmised until about the beginning of the third millennium.

I would also add that our history is intertwined with the history of the region. Our history points to certain truths about this region and Singapore. That I think is a point that needs to be stressed more by this commemoration.

Changes which fundamentally affect our economies and way of life.

This came amidst addressing all the daily challenges of Singaporeans, like increasing cost of living, an ageing population, healthcare costs, concern over social inequality and struggles of the sandwiched class.

I had on previous occasions in this House asked for a review of CHAS. Many Members and I have highlighted the challenges faced by the elderly and the concern about recurring healthcare costs.

Chalmers turned out to be a talented artist. Empowered by this experience, she felt the need to do something for special needs children from under-privileged families. She started organising sessions for many families with special needs children to expose them to art, music and sports. I was introduced to Magdalene by one of my residents, Anita who told me that the group needed a space. I was more than happy to offer a room at the Bukit Batok East Community Club. The best part of the story is that the group has since formed a choir called the Singapore Special Voices. Since last year, they have been going to places like Alexandra Hospital and Brighthill Evergreen Home for Dementia to spread cheer to patients and the elderly. Magdalene believes that the children can give back to society in their own way and is taking the effort to make that path for them.",8,428,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00428

While women here have access to education and jobs, and we have representation of women in many key positions in leadership, there is still much that we can do. For example, there is some way to go to close the wage gap between men and women, to support women who return to the workforce after having children or when they transit from their care-giving roles by reducing structural barriers and to empower women to take up leadership positions. In doing all these, beyond setting numerical goals, it is important to get the whole community, men and women, on board to change cultural mindsets and progress together.

2019-02-27-T-002,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),The obvious answer is all around us. We have a rapidly ageing population and many of our pioneers do not have substantial retirement savings. We have an aging public transport system and we have been catching up on maintenance. We need to fulfill our commitment to the public to deliver the high quality of services they deserve.,3,507,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00507
2019-02-27-T-002,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"But the unasked question is  Why are operating expenditures needed now, when many of these systems were designed to be pre-funded? Many problems of government involve life-cycle costs. This Government has always expected and planned for the population to age. So, the question is  to what extent were our life-cycle costs anticipated and pre-funded, versus, unanticipated and therefore requiring new expenditure today?",4,508,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00508
2019-02-27-T-002,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Let us consider MediSave, although a similar story exists for rail infrastructure. When introducing MediSave, Emeritus Senior Minister Goh, who was then Second Minister for Health, announced that a 6% contribution rate to MediSave would suffice for, and I quote, ""most households to have sufficient savings in their MediSave accounts to cover their expected hospitalisation expenses.""",5,509,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00509
2019-02-27-T-002,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"The Blue Paper on the National Health Plan published in 1983 based the MediSave contribution rate on detailed computations. The Blue Paper projected that MediSave contributions from a typical three-generation family should cover the entire family’s expected hospitalisation costs, even assuming that the Government would only subsidise 50% of Class C actual costs. I note that in 1983, the Government’s operating subsidy was 90% for Class C wards. But MediSave projections were made based on a 50% subsidy only.",6,510,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00510
2019-02-27-T-002,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Thus, MediSave was part of a broader pre-funding strategy to not only cover the majority of hospitalisation expenses but also, if finances allow, to gradually rebalance the distribution of medical costs towards pre-funding and away from operating subsidies. To what extent and why has MediSave not worked out completely to plan?",7,511,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00511

For civil society – and academia – to engage Government in providing meaningful collaboration and debate on the issues that matter, we must have more access to information outside Government.

With the help of research assistants, we coded whether a question requests data, and whether that data was provided in the answer. The top five Ministries with data requests are MOM, MND, MOH, MOT and MHA. Overall, about half of the PQs in 2018 asked for data. The chart shows that three-quarters of such data requests were actually fulfilled in detail. Now, we are still studying PQs before 2018, whether the answers given are complete, and what are the reasons for not providing data. I will update hon Members later.",1,528,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00528
2019-02-27-T-002,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira,"Mr Deputy Speaker, the point I am making is that Government has been very forthcoming in providing data in response to Parliamentary Questions.

To make this a reality, I suggest we set up a whole-of-Government fund – the Transparency Fund, if you will – to cover the costs associated with such data release and to provide this data through data.gov.sg. Since most data today is already collected through administrative and on-going sources, the marginal costs are low and consist largely of setting up the system to enable release. The Transparency Fund could further provide for research that provides interpretation and guidance on how to use these data.",3,530,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00530

The Government has agreed that we must build a strong local core in academia, especially in the areas of social sciences and humanities, which are not only relevant as sources of expertise for Government policy, but also help us understand who we are. Indeed, many of the problems this Budget addresses are topics that academics in Singapore have devoted their careers to studying.",5,532,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00532

The Minister for Education noted that Singaporeans are overall reasonably well-represented in local Universities – about 50-50. However, Singapore representation is much stronger among teaching staff rather than faculty, and among older staff aged 50 and above. It is weaker among younger faculty. There are several schemes underway to encourage promising young Singaporeans to join academia. But I think it is too early to say what progress will be.",6,533,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00533

We want and must have Singaporeans in academia and in research, not to protect their jobs, not to allow for lower standards in teaching and research, but because Singaporeans must be in charge of asking the critical questions about who we are, what the problems in society are and how to solve them. We have always said that no one owes us a living. But no one owes us an answer either, about the key questions of our society and economy. We are frankly too small for experts from elsewhere to want to study us thoroughly. And in any case, we should never depend on them.",7,534,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00534

2019-02-27-T-002,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira,"The first barrier is that the academic will find it difficult to study Singapore questions without the active cooperation of the Government. Academic credibility depends on being able to publish independent research findings based on high quality data or observations. Much of this data is held by Government. Hence, research and publication often depends on Government agreement. The same principles of information disclosure I have outlined earlier for civil society will likewise help local academics contribute and build their careers. But because Government often works closely with Singapore academics in research, I also urge Government to be more accepting of research results that may be inconsistent with official narratives or policies.",9,536,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00536

Many local academics supported the Government’s rebuttal of the Oxfam study last year which ranks Singapore in the bottom 10 globally on tackling inequality. That study’s methodology was lacking. But Government must be cognisant that it has much more power than a mere academic has, and there should be room for even disagreeable academics to contribute to Singapore.",10,537,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00537
2019-02-27-T-002,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira,"Second, our Autonomous Universities must recognise that local research that contributes to policy and our understanding of society is valuable. There is a structural problem with prestige in academia. We all want high quality and internationally renowned research institutions. But university rankings are based on publications and citations in top ranked international journals, and there is simply little international interest in Singapore questions. Therefore, research on Singapore is less likely to be published in the prestigious journals.",11,538,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00538

Work outside the academy is implicitly or explicitly considered low value, and in fact, is sometimes a ""one-way door""; if you leave academia, you risk never returning as a faculty.

They have contracts signed with the old price and they are not allowed to claim for material price fluctuation. They are obviously very upset. Some of them even asked me, ""Is it because Government needs money badly?"" This tax increase might have a domino effect on other prices. For example, I understand ComfortDelgro increased its diesel price from $1.04 to $1.15 immediately after the announcement. This has eaten into the take-home pay of taxi drivers. Comfort has acted within their rights. But since Comfort made over $400 million in profit last year, I feel they missed an opportunity to show some magnanimity. At least, absorb part of the price hike. Taxi drivers already toil day and night, and they earn just enough to support their family.

They have to be realistic and avoid short-sighted measures, after all, Singapore is facing an ageing population, with the ratio of working people between 20-64-year-old vis-à-vis those over 65 falling to 4.2. We have nothing, but we can ""create something out of nothing"" and have what others cannot have. The world is a turbulent one; we face stiff competition in science and technology and we need to depend on our people's diligence and mastery of skills to forge ahead.",4,594,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00594
2019-02-27-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"So, it makes sense for the Government, on behalf of the people of the country, to pay tribute to the Pioneer and Merdeka Generations, and to allocate additional funds to cater to their needs. This is only right.",5,595,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00595
2019-02-27-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Many of our Merdeka Generation had to start work at a young age to supplement the family's income and care for their younger siblings. Their contribution is worthy of our respect. Furthermore, many of them did not get to enjoy the comprehensive benefit of the Central Provident Fund, especially after the CPF was amended and enhanced to bring better safeguards for our members.",6,596,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00596
2019-02-27-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"(In English)  Mr Deputy Speaker, the measures to assist the Merdeka Generation are quite popular and welcomed by many older residents, which leads to the next question – what about subsequent generations?",7,597,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00597
2019-02-27-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"The future is unpredictable and there may be changes beyond our control down the road, leading to certain batches of future seniors facing difficulties in their retirement years. In addition, there are usually some seniors in every cohort who would need some form of Government support. Hence, we must continue to search for more engines of economic growth and revenue resources to finance not just elder expenditures but all necessary expenses.",8,598,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00598
2019-02-27-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),Would the Government continue to encourage investment of private hospitals here and to promote medical tourism?,9,599,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00599
2019-02-27-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),Would the Government ride on our achievement in education to encourage more investments in international schools and established private universities to encourage foreigners to send their children here for further study? These would help generate income for Singapore.,10,600,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00600
2019-02-27-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Would MOF consider imposing and increasing taxes on gambling including taxes on winning proceeds which could provide a sustainable and long-term revenue to support the rising Singaporeans' social expenditure needs, leaving a rise in GST as a last resort.",11,601,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00601

2019-02-27-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),We should also consider reviewing our immigration policy to draw ultra-high and high net worth individuals who can invest substantial amounts in Singapore to create quality jobs and income for Singaporeans. Priority for grant of citizenship can be considered for applicants who have paid either significant personal or corporate income tax of at least $5 million in total for the last five years or have spent a good amount in payroll for Singaporean employees through the companies invested in Singapore for a certain period of time under review.,13,603,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00603
2019-02-27-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),We have been focusing a lot on restructuring our economy and transforming our industries. I would like to propose that we appoint a task force to look into transforming families in financial difficulties and those with problems. Let us have a concerted effort to uplift families which are struggling to cope.,14,604,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00604
2019-02-27-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Many of these families need money, quite often after an illness or death tips their finances over the edge. They need befrienders and professional counsellors to help them navigate the various assistance schemes available to them. For families struggling to get by from day to day, seeking help in the maze of many-helping-hands may be a real challenge. How can we improve our present assistance delivery system? Do we have an evaluation framework to assess how productive and efficient we are in getting help to those who need it?",15,605,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00605
2019-02-27-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"For other families with challenges, their problems are compounded by unconstructive family cultures in the way the members behave towards one another or manage their finances and resources. They can be shown and taught better alternative ways of interaction and allocation and use of finances and other assets.",16,606,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00606
2019-02-27-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"I would urge the government to prioritise assistance allocation to families with children. Investing time and resources, particularly manpower resources in the form of counsellors/guidance with a hand-holding approach, on such families will help them to break out of poverty cycles and ensure that the children live up to their highest potential.",17,607,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00607
2019-02-27-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Last but not least, I would like to appeal for an exemption of the diesel tax increase for vehicles and machinery and company's reliance on diesel for production for which there are currently no non-diesel alternatives. The doubling of the duty for diesel from 10 cents to 20 cents a litre is very substantial. For certain heavy machinery and special purpose vehicles, there are no diesel alternatives in the market and this tax increase impose an unnecessary burden on their owners and operators.",18,608,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00608
2019-02-27-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Going forward, the increase in diesel tax and the implementation of carbon tax will make more hardship in sectors where there are limited energy choices. We should continue to build the infrastructure for businesses to switch to natural gas, electricity or solar and so on and so forth as soon as possible prior to the introduction of such tax. Notwithstanding, I support the Budget.",19,609,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00609
2019-02-27-T-002,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Sir, I am an accountant by training and I must confess to an inclination for numbers. Every Budget Statement, I reach first for the Budget numbers for the Financial Year and compare them with previous years. I do so, not because Minister Heng’s annual Budget Statements are unimportant – they are always enlightening. But because, like many of my generation and those before me, fiscal sustainability and financial prudence are foremost on my mind. Numbers, I have found, give me the clearest indication of both.",1,610,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00610
2019-02-27-T-002,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Sir, there are trends that emerge from the numbers and significant decisions taken by the Government as a result. I rise today to speak on these trends and decisions.",2,611,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00611
2019-02-27-T-002,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"First, increasing expenditure. Our expenditure has increased significantly over the years. This, in and of itself, is no surprise. Minister Heng raised, in his Budget Statement, several domestic demographic issues that confront us – an ageing population, social mobility, inequality, economic transformation and climate change. I would add the need for infrastructure expansion and renewal.",3,612,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00612

2019-02-27-T-002,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"The numbers confirm this. For example, MOH’s expenditure increased from approximately $3.8 billion for Financial Year 2009 to an estimated $11.7 billion for this Financial Year.  This is about a three-fold increase in 10 years.",5,614,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00614
2019-02-27-T-002,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"This, in part, is due to our ageing population. In my constituency of Potong Pasir, more than 40% of my residents are above 50 years old, one in five above 65.  Even as I speak, we are building one nursing home and one senior day care centre within our constituency. There is a genuine need for these healthcare facilities. An ageing population is the reality on the ground. The Government needs to look after our Seniors and therefore we expect national healthcare expenditure to continue to increase in the future.",6,615,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00615

2019-02-27-T-002,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"The trend on expenditure is therefore quite clear. Increased spending is also likely required in Defence, Education and Transport, just to name three other sectors. The question is, how do we pay for these expected increases in expenditure?",8,617,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00617
2019-02-27-T-002,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"For the Financial Year 2009, overall expenditure was approximately $57 billion, in 2019, this has increased to an estimated $80.25 billion.",9,618,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00618
2019-02-27-T-002,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Every year, the Net Investment Returns (NIR) which represents returns on our invested reserves, contribute about 20% of the Budget. The fact is that, without the NIR, our Budgets will be substantially in deficit every year.",10,619,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00619
2019-02-27-T-002,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Of the total NIR every year, 50% is used to contribute to the budget and the other 50% reinvested as part of our reserves to ensure continued sustainable contribution to Budgets of the future.  There are those who advocate for more NIR to be used for the present, but I think the current arrangement is fair. As they say in Hokkein “一人一半” – half for this generation and half saved for future generations.",11,620,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00620
2019-02-27-T-002,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Sir, having said that, are there any other alternatives? In business, when expenses exceed income, we balance our budgets either by increasing revenue or reducing expenditure. But, Sir, expenditure is unlikely to decrease in the short term. Our domestic demographic dictates this and the need for infrastructure expansion and renewal is a pressing one.",12,621,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00621
2019-02-27-T-002,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"There are also no ""magic bullets"" to significantly increase revenue. Some argue that the projected increase in GST by 2% is about increasing taxes on Singaporeans to return the same to them.",13,622,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00622
2019-02-27-T-002,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"What do the numbers say? Sir, estimated GST receipts for Financial Year 2019, that is, this financial year, is about $11.7 billion. A further 2% increase in GST is expected to bring in an estimated additional $3.3 billion, at best.",14,623,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00623
2019-02-27-T-002,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"As stated earlier, our estimated expenditure for 2019 is $80.3 billion. This does not even include Special Transfers, which covers items such as, CPF and Medisave top-ups, GST Vouchers, S&CC rebates, Wage Credit Scheme and so on, which is estimated at $15.3 billion for Financial Year 2019. The projected GST increase is therefore simply only one measure to mitigate the trend of rising expenditure but, clearly, is unable to meet it in full.",15,624,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00624
2019-02-27-T-002,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"One approach raised by Minister Heng in the Budget Statement is to pay for major infrastructure investments by borrowing. As the Minister explained, this has been done before, for example, the building of our MRT lines in the 1980s. Other Statutory Boards and Government-owned companies continue to borrow to finance major infrastructure projects. The Changi Airport Group is expected to take up loans to finance the development of Terminal 5.",16,625,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00625

2019-02-27-T-002,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),I am supportive of the strategy of borrowing for our major infrastructure projects and agree with the Finance Minister that it will achieve fairer and more equitable outcomes in the allocation of resources on expenditure.,21,630,2019-02-27-T-002-S-00630
