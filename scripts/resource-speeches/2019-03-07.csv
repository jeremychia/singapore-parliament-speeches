2019-03-07-T-001,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Minister for Defence (a) so far, how many National Servicemen who were injured during NS have appealed to the Ministry to allow them to continue their insurance in addition to what has been granted under MediShield Life; and (b) what assistance and assurance have been given to them.",1,1,2019-03-07-T-001-S-00001
2019-03-07-T-001,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How) (for the Minister for Defence),"Mr Speaker, over the past five years, MINDEF has received two requests from NSmen for assistance to bridge the gap between their private medical insurance coverage and MINDEF's medical coverage for service-related injuries.",1,2,2019-03-07-T-001-S-00002
2019-03-07-T-001,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How) (for the Minister for Defence),"MINDEF provides full medical coverage for service-related injuries by paying for all necessary medical expenses incurred by the NSman at Government restructured hospitals, clinics and community hospitals, for as long as required. This includes the costs of medical supplies and equipment, as well as specialist care. Should the service-related injury be aggravated, or if there are new medical conditions arising from the injury, MINDEF will expand the scope of medical coverage to cover those conditions. MINDEF will also provide higher compensation amounts if there is an increase in the degree of permanent disability. In addition, financial assistance may be provided to injured NSmen through MINDEF's welfare schemes.",2,3,2019-03-07-T-001-S-00003
2019-03-07-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Ministry has plans to provide or to encourage the provision of night-time childcare beyond the three night-care centers run by the Morning Star charity, for low-income parents who have to work night shifts.",1,4,2019-03-07-T-002-S-00004
2019-03-07-T-002,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Mr Speaker, to cater to the needs of working parents, childcare centres are required to operate full-day services from 7.00 am to 7.00 pm on weekdays, and from 7.00 am to 2.00 pm on Saturdays. Childcare centres have the discretion to extend their services beyond standard operating hours, taking into consideration demand and resources. Currently, around 50 childcare centres operate beyond 7.00 pm on weekdays.",1,5,2019-03-07-T-002-S-00005
2019-03-07-T-002,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"The current arrangement meets the needs of most parents. But for those working shifts or on weekends, many of them arrange for other care-givers such as grandparents and relatives to help out. However, some families may face difficulties in making alternate care-giving arrangements. We will assess the need and demand for night-time childcare and the possibility of offering such programmes, particularly in areas where low-income families reside.",2,6,2019-03-07-T-002-S-00006
2019-03-07-T-002,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"The Member may also have heard us describe in the course of the announcing the roll-out of ComLink in the four areas where rental flats are, as a pilot. That will also look into programming that meets the needs of the residents in rental housing, who are mostly low-income households. These include certain kinds of care-giving that they may require. So, I think we look at requirements based on locality as well.",3,7,2019-03-07-T-002-S-00007
2019-03-07-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I thank the Minister for the reply. So, is it a confirmation that we are looking into providing more night-time childcare services in certain areas? Because I see that on the ground, that some of the parents who have to work the night shift, they leave their children at home, in fear of their safety and then, they go and work, especially for a lot of the single parents. So, I am just wondering whether we can help provide the night-time childcare in cases like these.",1,8,2019-03-07-T-002-S-00008
2019-03-07-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,There are Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) that are running programmes as pilots to provide night care-giving support. We will look at the experience and study this further.,1,9,2019-03-07-T-002-S-00009
2019-03-07-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider (i) expanding the Foreign Construction Worker Directory (FCWD) System to other sectors such as the cleaning sector and (ii) incorporating the FCWD portal on mobile applications targeted at foreign workers.,1,10,2019-03-07-T-003-S-00010
2019-03-07-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Speaker, the Foreign Construction Worker Directory System (FCWDS) was set up in 2015 by the Singapore Contractors Association Limited (SCAL) to facilitate job matching between employers and foreign workers in the Construction sector. The Construction industry finds it useful to develop the FCWDS to flexibly redeploy workers across companies given that the work is cyclical and mainly project-based.",1,11,2019-03-07-T-003-S-00011
2019-03-07-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),We have not come across another industry which has expressed interest to set up a similar directory.,2,12,2019-03-07-T-003-S-00012

2019-03-07-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I thank the Minister of State for the reply. I was just wondering whether we can extend this to the cleaning sector. Because I think the cleaning sector, like the construction sector, is quite cyclical as well. A lot of the contracts are two years. So, a lot of these cleaners who come to Singapore to work and gain their experience, sometimes, go back within the two years. I think it will benefit both the cleaners and the companies to hire the skilled workers in Singapore.",1,14,2019-03-07-T-003-S-00014
2019-03-07-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The second question I would like to ask is whether we can then incentivise the hiring of the existing workers who are in Singapore. This directory will be more effective if we can incentivise, in a sense, maybe provide a reduced foreign worker levy if they hire workers already in Singapore.",2,15,2019-03-07-T-003-S-00015
2019-03-07-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"I thank the Member for his clarification. Firstly, when we look at this, it is really to strike a balance and giving employers certainty, especially in the Services sector compared to Construction which is very project-based. Services tend to be for longer periods, for example, as mentioned, it could be two years; it depends on the length of the contract. There is a difference there. The second difference is that when you look at the Construction, for example, SCAL as an industry association, championed it and therefore, the database was set up and agreed upon by employers. We have not received requests from other industry associations. Certainly, for the cleaning sector, if the industry association is prepared to do so, we can take a look.",1,16,2019-03-07-T-003-S-00016
2019-03-07-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Specific to cases, for example, in Town Councils, where contracts change and cleaning contractors have to move around, we have facilitated some of the changed between employers. We have facilitated some of these to ensure that cleaning service is not disrupted. That is something we are prepared to do, but not as a broad-based policy, nation-wide.",2,17,2019-03-07-T-003-S-00017

2019-03-07-T-005,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Ms Sun Xueling),"Mr Chairman, I would like to begin by thanking all Members who have spoken in support of the vulnerable, the less advantaged and the lower income. They are our fellow citizens, and Singapore is a shared home where we all belong.",1,24,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00024
2019-03-07-T-005,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Ms Sun Xueling),"Several Members have asked how we can better help tenants to have homes of their own. I would first like to share that the number of public rental households who moved into home ownership flats has increased steadily. The number almost doubled over the past five years, from about 700 in 2014 to about 1,300 last year. We are committed to helping more tenants move into home ownership.",2,25,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00025
2019-03-07-T-005,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Ms Sun Xueling),"Members have asked whether we are reviewing Fresh Start. I am pleased to announce some enhancements. First, we will raise the age limit on the youngest child for Fresh Start applicants, from 16 to 18 years old. This will allow more families to benefit from the scheme. The new age limit will also apply for other schemes for parents with dependent children, namely the Parenthood Priority Scheme, and ASSIST, the Assistance Scheme for Second-Timers who are divorced or widowed parents.",3,26,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00026
2019-03-07-T-005,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Ms Sun Xueling),"Second, we will intensify support for Fresh Start families through a new Fresh Start Support Programme. We have found through our experience that closer and more regular contact with families allows for early intervention to address issues that may emerge. The Support Programme will also take a holistic approach to strengthen them in various areas, such as financial management, family functioning and overall stability. The Support Programme will be overseen by MSF, and they will appoint a service provider with social work expertise, and this will commence later this year.",4,27,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00027
2019-03-07-T-005,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Ms Sun Xueling),"Third, there are also families who applied for Fresh Start but who did not meet some of the criteria. If they are serious about Fresh Start and have good potential to meet the criteria fully, they can get special consideration to join. Once they join, they may book a BTO 2-room Flexi flat within one year – like other Fresh Start families. They will also get more intensive support under the Support Programme, focusing on the criteria that they did not meet. They will need to meet all the criteria by one year before their key collection. We estimate that this will benefit about 80 families over three years.",5,28,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00028

HDB met Mdm Narziah last year to share about Fresh Start, and she decided to apply. She welcomed the assistance under the scheme, and was appreciative that HDB officers met her in person to ask about her home ownership aspirations, and guided her through each step of buying a flat. She is now looking forward to her new flat in Tampines.",1,31,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00031

2019-03-07-T-005,,,"Miss Cheryl Chan and Mr Seah Kian Peng asked how we ensure that rents do not discourage tenants from working towards higher incomes and homeownership. Our public rental rates are structured progressively, to keep the subsidy allocation fair. Nonetheless, to mitigate cliff effects, HDB waives the rent increase for up to two terms when tenants first cross the $800 income threshold, if their income remains less than $1,500. In the last three years, about 5,200 households have benefited from this waiver.",2,34,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00034

2019-03-07-T-005,,,"I would also like to emphasise that HDB does not ask tenants to leave solely because their income has increased past the ceiling of $1,500. Instead, HDB will work with them on their homeownership options once they are ready.",4,36,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00036
2019-03-07-T-005,,,"To further encourage these households, we will not increase the rent for those who have made the downpayment for a new flat. They will continue to pay the rent they were charged at the time when they made the downpayment. This will take effect for tenancies which commence from 1 June 2019. We hope this will put households in good stead for their next milestone as homeowners.",5,37,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00037
2019-03-07-T-005,,,"Mr Lim Biow Chuan suggested allowing tenants to buy over their rental flats. We currently have no such plans, as there are many measures to help tenants buy a new flat from HDB.

2019-03-07-T-005,,,"Mr Lim also suggested improving the living environment in older rental blocks. HDB has consistently upgraded rental flats just as they do for sold flats. But we want to do more, especially for older rental blocks built in the 1960s and 1970s. As the Member highlighted, some blocks have long corridors with rental units on both sides. As a result, the natural ventilation and light is more limited than those of newer designs.",7,39,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00039
2019-03-07-T-005,,,"To address this, HDB will undertake works to create more openings along the corridors, by removing some flats on each floor of such blocks.

And this is a corridor at Blk 217 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1, where HDB piloted the upgrading works. The works made a marked difference to the inside of each block – more common space, more sunlight, more ventilation. I have visited the older blocks and an improved block myself, and I think Members will agree with me that our proposed works will be a marked improvement. We will extend these works to more rental blocks, and we will provide more details in due course.",1,43,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00043

2019-03-07-T-005,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Last year, we lifted the time bar on divorcees to facilitate their housing transition after divorce. However, some still face difficulties due to acrimony between both parties. Some cannot take action on their matrimonial flat because their ex-spouses are uncooperative and do not adhere to the Court Order. Parties whose ex-spouses are uncooperative may seek legal help to resolve the issue, for example by applying to the relevant Court to vary the Court Order to empower the Registrar to sign on behalf of the uncooperative party.",11,53,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00053
2019-03-07-T-005,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"There are also those awaiting their Final Judgment of divorce. They may be worried about their next housing arrangement, and hoping to apply for a flat earlier. This is understandable. HDB will now allow divorcing parties to apply for a new flat from HDB if they have an Interim Judgment and have settled the ancillary matters on their matrimonial property, and the custody, care and control of their children. This means they no longer have to wait until the Final Judgment in order to apply for a flat. They will just need to obtain the Final Judgment before collecting their keys, and ensure that they are still eligible for the flat that they booked. We hope this will give divorcing parties some peace of mind as they go through an emotionally difficult period.",12,54,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00054

In such cases, both parents have a shared and equal right to list their children in their flat. That is why we start by encouraging parents to agree on the listings in the best interests of their children. But we understand that there may be difficulties sometimes, and so if there are indeed difficulties, HDB will look at the case more closely, and will be prepared to exercise flexibility to help protect the interests of the children.",13,55,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00055

The Cat Welfare Society currently manages Project Love Cats, a pilot community-owned responsible cat ownership programme in Chong Pang, with the support of Government agencies. Under this pilot, CWS has been working with the community on microchipping pet cats to strengthen owner accountability. We can consider further expansion when the Chong Pang pilot meets these outcomes, and when there is strong community support in other parts of Singapore. In addition, the AVA intends to undertake a holistic review of the regulatory approach for pet issues, including how to promote responsible pet ownership and deter abandonment.",5,61,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00061

Developed in consultation with Animal Welfare Groups (AWGs) and veterinarians, TNRM is a humane way to sustainably manage the stray dog population nationwide. TNRM is being implemented in phases. Since its launch in November 2018, AVA and participating AWGs have been managing the operations at various sites across Singapore. Participating AWGs have been able to tap on SPCA's sterilisation clinic since February. In the coming months, AVA and SPCA will also set up a central pool of professional trappers to support the programme. AVA has concurrently been engaging stakeholders such as the Town Councils, People's Association, and grassroots organisations to raise awareness of TNRM and to address any concerns that may arise.

Our ability to do such detailed long-term planning is a major asset which few other countries or cities are able to do. And that is why every year, we host thousands of visitors at the Singapore City Gallery in the URA building, because they are keen to come and learn from us. Beyond planning, implementation is also important and that is why we are doing more to coordinate the implementation of new infrastructure; especially transport infrastructure which takes time to build.

Last year, we announced some significant long-term projects to rejuvenate our HDB flats and estates as they get older. They include initiatives like the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) 2 and Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS). These are major long-term undertakings and will need time to work out the details, taking feedback and suggestions and will provide an update when are ready.",4,68,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00068

It is called, ""有楼万事足"". One couple in their late 20s wanted to purchase a home but could not find something suitable within their budget. Private apartments are too expensive, and public housing options are limited. For every subsidised flat that is put out, there are close to 60 applicants vying for it. And the cheapest 3-room unit is S$440,000. That is double the price of a 3-room flat in Singapore (which is also larger in size). Flats in Singapore are larger in size and much cheaper. Not to mention that our application rates are also far lower.",6,70,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00070

But in Singapore, young couple can realise their dreams of owning their own homes. Of course, from time to time, you would hear comments where people say ""Don't compare to other cities. How about the price of HDB flats today compared with that in the 70s and 80s? Why is it so much more expensive today, compared to in the past?"" But remember, incomes have also risen considerably over this period. And we really have to look at a broader range of affordability indicators, not just a headline price.

Mr Png highlighted the example of someone who had applied six times but was still unable to get the flat. I am sure for such cases, because I have seen some of them myself, they would have applied for BTO flats in mature estates or balance flats. I cannot stop people from trying these flats – balance flats or flats in mature estates, but given the limited supply of these flats, and the limited space we have in this areas, we really cannot meet all of the demands. So, those who wish to try for a balance flat or a flat in the mature estate, will have to try their luck and hope for the best in the ballot. But if they go for a BTO flat in a non-mature estate, all of them are able to get it within two to three tries. In fact, the vast majority get it within two tries and 100% within three tries.",1,74,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00074

I asked my parents who bought their HDB flat in the 1970s. They said that, indeed, at that time, when they bought their first HDB flat, it was about $25,000, which was about the price in the 1970s. But at that time, their combined income was less than a thousand dollars per month – just a few hundred dollars – and they had to fork out almost 50% of their income every month for mortgage servicing.",3,76,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00076
2019-03-07-T-005,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Today, the mortgage servicing ratio is less than 25%, below what it used to be in the past, and it is also well within international benchmarks of affordability. Internationally, when they look at housing affordability, they would typically look at the servicing ratio of around 30% to 35%. So, we are keeping well below that, not to mention that the vast majority of these first-timers are able to service their loans entirely with CPF – that means, with zero cash. And even for those who use cash, the amount is very little. So, these are indicators which we track and our commitment is to ensure that HDB flats remain accessible and affordable for all young Singaporeans.",4,77,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00077

We have flats of different sizes for first-timer and second-timer families; also 2-room Flexi flats for singles and the elderly. We monitor the application rates closely to ensure sufficient supply. The application rates for singles are still high, as Er Dr Lee Bee Wah mentioned, but I would assure her that we are trying our best, and they have come down. When we started, application rates were about 38 times. Now, the application rates for singles is slightly over four times.

I think this will help buyers with urgent housing needs to secure a flat quickly because they do not have to wait for the next sales exercise, and the ROF pool will be there for them anytime of the year.

I thank Mr Yee Chia Hsing for his ""sales pitch"" to his residents to buy flats from the resale market. As he rightly noted, we cannot simply meet demand through new BTO flats entirely because there may be a risk of over-supply of such new flats. So, we always have to find the right balance between new flats and the resale market. That is why we have been enhancing the grants for resale flats significantly over the recent years. We have enhanced the CPF Housing Grant for first-timers; the Proximity Housing Grant (PHG) for those who live near or with their parents. Now, in total, grants of up to $120,000 are available for some families buying a resale flat. These grants could help subsidise almost half the price of their flat.",17,90,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00090

To give an illustration, five years ago, one in 10 first-timer families bought a resale flat. Today, about one in four first-timer families buy a resale flat because the grants have been enhanced and people can see that between BTO and resale, many still want BTO, but resale is quite an attractive option now with the enhanced grants.",20,93,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00093

So, we will allow the SUHG to be used when households upgrade to 2-room or 3-room flats in non-mature estates, be it new or resale.

Singles in public rental flats currently share a 1-room rental flat under the Joint Singles Scheme (JSS). We recognise that some tenants prefer privacy.

In January and February alone, just within these two months, some 160 households from 5-room and larger flats have applied for LBS. And I agree with Mr Yam that we have to do more to raise awareness of this scheme. And that is why my MND colleagues and I, over the past few months, have been going around, constituency by constituency, reaching out to grassroots leaders and residents to explain to them what are the schemes available. I think more seniors are aware of the LBS and various monetisation options today, but we will continue to do more to raise public awareness.",4,110,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00110

They opted for LBS for their 4-room flat, as they wanted to retain their flat to host their four children and 11 grandchildren when they visit. They prefer to keep their flat rather than move to a 2-room Flexi. On top of that, they have been living in the estate for the past 32 years and are familiar with the surroundings. So, with LBS, after keeping 25 years of their lease and selling the remainder to HDB, they were able to top up their respective CPF Retirement Accounts, which means they get a payout of about $950 per month for life. On top of that, they received their LBS bonus and cash proceeds of $110,000. So, it is an effective way for those who wish to monetise, and unlock the value of their flats for retirement. LBS is available for all elderly HDB flat owners.",5,111,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00111
2019-03-07-T-005,,,"We understand that LBS may not be an option suitable for everyone. Some may wish to right-size and move to a 2-room Flexi flat and so the options are available. Mr Saktiandi asked if MND can facilitate the sale of flats if seniors face difficulties, be it due to market sentiments or the Ethnic Integration Policy. We have discussed this before in this House, we recognise the concerns and HDB will continue to do its best to assist them, including by deferring key collection and giving them more time to sell.",6,112,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00112
2019-03-07-T-005,,,"One issue with regard to the purchase of older HDB flats is CPF rules, specifically the restriction in CPF usage for flats with less than 60 years of lease remaining. Some banks also take reference from these CPF restrictions when assessing how much loan to extend. As a result, both the CPF and loan quantums may be reduced for the purchase of such flats. The CPF rule is intended to safeguard the retirement adequacy of buyers who purchase older flats, but its design has led to some unintended consequences. For example, if a buyer would like to buy a 39-year-old flat, they can use full CPF, but one year later, because you hit this ""less than 60"" years requirement, the amount of CPF will be restricted. There is no good reason why this should be so just because the flat became one year older.",7,113,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00113
2019-03-07-T-005,,,"MND and MOM have been studying the issue. In fact the focus should not be on the remaining lease of the flat. What we want to ensure is that buyers purchase flats with leases that are long enough to last them for life. If that is done, then we can relax CPF usage rules, even if the remaining lease is less than 60 years. I have explained the thinking behind how we intend to change the CPF restriction. The details are being worked out, and we will announce them soon, for implementation in May this year.",8,114,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00114

SMS Amy Khor shared about this yesterday. Assisted living means ""home and care"" combined. So that is why MND and MOH must come together to offer assisted living, it is not something that one Ministry can do. When you go for assisted living, you are not just buying a flat, but a package of care services tied to the assisted living flat. That is very important. It is not just the hardware, it is the flat plus the services combined as one package. Typically, in such assisted living apartments, there will be more communal and shared spaces for residents to interact with each other, there will be services that are part of the package and the individual living units will be a bit smaller. That is a typical typology of an assisted living apartment.",10,116,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00116

We are studying potential sites to pilot these assisted living typologies which includes, as suggested by Mr Murali, the option of converting vacant school sites into retirement homes. The key here is that, when we put out these sites for private developers or private players to bid, we do not want it to be simply a property play. We do not want them to take the site, build something and sell the units because with assisted living, these have to be a package of services plus residential combined together.

In the longer term, the best way to tackle this is to ensure that every part of Singapore is well developed, and that every HDB precinct has good amenities and facilities; convenient access to transport network as well as job centres closer to home.

With regard to the difference between FSSP and FSCs, the new FSSP will focus on supporting the families to stay on track for a fresh start towards home ownership. For example, they will look at how they can help them ensure that they have enough housing budget to be able to afford the flat. For FSCs, they look at how to ensure family stability for the family unit.

On the other hand, if you want to make it affordable, then the only way is through a big discount to the BTO price but that leads to a lottery effect and the lucky guy who gets the flat get a so-called ""windfall"", compared to others who buy flats elsewhere.

We are aware that there is a WTO requirement, but I hope that the Minister of State is also aware that some of our local contractors have grown and they are ready to take on big projects like those which are $400 million and above. I hope that there are certain ways to see how we can let our bigger contractors have a bigger share of the pie of bigger projects.",6,241,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00241

But let us now start by clearing the demand for 2-room Flexi flats first. That is the priority for now, and I would not want to commit to another extension of the 3-room flats, and then have another backlog building up, and we will be running after so many different queues with insufficient supply to meet the demand. We have already brought it down to an application rate of just above four. We will focus on that before we think about any further changes.",1,243,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00243

I mentioned yesterday, that one of our goals is to help our local contractors grow, and securing Government projects is one way to grow.

So, we cannot give projects away to locals and favour locals over foreign companies.",1,248,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00248

For example, Lum Chang Building Contractors won the design and construction contract for a section of the north-south corridor tunnel. This was awarded in December 2018. The awarded value is about $800 million, much higher than the $400 million threshold that the Member cited. Woh Hup had also won in September 2017 the construction of Kim Chuan depot's extension to cater for circle line 6, which was about $1.21 billion. To a certain extent, I think there is opportunity for local firms to win large contracting projects.",2,249,2019-03-07-T-005-S-00249

That is why if you look at the announcements yesterday, for example, we announced the Build SG Transformation Fund. We hope to upskill and build up capabilities for our local firms.

2019-03-07-T-006,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"I urge the Ministry to outline a comprehensive strategy for ensuring we have both value for money and high quality in public transport operations. For buses, at the operational level, what can we do, using route design, schedule optimization, and new technology such as on-demand services, to improve efficiency? On the strategic level, how are we evaluating the GCM and the contracting environment to improve competitiveness in tendering? For rail, can we make further use of time of travel shifting measures – such as peak and off-peak fares – to reduce costly excess capacity?",6,306,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00306
2019-03-07-T-006,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Most importantly, how can we engage the fare-paying public to give them a role in determining what services they value and what they do not want to pay for?",7,307,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00307
2019-03-07-T-006,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Since my Adjournment Motion speech on 15 January 2019, train delays are still taking place. For example, a train fault at Marsiling MRT station during the morning rush hour on 22 January 2019, lasted an hour, causing delays for commuters travelling in both directions. Just yesterday, there was a train fault on Downtown Line during the morning rush hour. Mr Chairman, more can still be done to minimise train delays of any lengths. Please allow me to revisit some of the points I made in my earlier Adjournment Motion speech.",1,308,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00308
2019-03-07-T-006,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Mean Kilometers Between Failure (MKBF) has been much talked. However these MKBF statistics while an internationally recognised indicator for rail reliability does not include delays of not more than five minutes. The Ministry has been silent about keeping track of the many delays of not more than five minutes. Delays whether long or short, have potential ripple effects that can snowball, meaning that these train delays affect other activities and constitute an economic costs to all involved. Singapore must continue to drive reliability, even higher. And as I have argued previously, we need to go beyond the current MKBF metrics in our reliability measurement approach.",2,309,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00309

With rail capacity expected to double by 2030, the NCF will no doubt, be only rising, and help contribute to future, rising fare prices. We should review this. We must also pay close attention to the impact of such fare hikes on vulnerable groups.",3,310,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00310
2019-03-07-T-006,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"We need to enhance service quality including better punctuality for trains as well as more accurate and timely displays of trains delays.

2019-03-07-T-006,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),The profitability of Public Transport Operator (PTO) should also be a factor in the PTC's fare review formula. The current productivity Extraction Factors should be redefined to account for PTO's profitability. Accounting for profitability will be more equitable for commuters. Retail operations from Operators will not be profitable without the infrastructure it operates in. Mandating the level of profits from retail operations to be added to the Railway Sinking Fund and the Rail Infrastructure Fund will move us towards a more equitable development of rail infrastructure in the long-term. Similar mechanisms can be done for bus infrastructure too.,5,312,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00312
2019-03-07-T-006,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Finally, as per my Budget debate speech, I am concern as to how the huge increase in diesel excise tax will have implications for our commuters and fares. Most taxis and public buses are still running on diesel; and conversion to hybrid or electric options will still take quite a few more years for the taxis and even longer time for the buses. The short-term rebates will likely not be enough to stop Operators passing the costs to consumers. Since the Government did not push for the conversion to start earlier, it should give more reasonable timelines for bus and taxi companies to convert to to hybrid or electric options fully before applying the tax increased.",6,313,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00313

Tuas South is currently being developed for existing and new businesses. Businesses such as the Tuas Mega Port, Shipbuilding industry, Biomedical Park, Electronics firms, Logistic and cold chain companies, Petrochemical companies among others. These are mainly companies with decent pay, decent work environment and some even utilising the state of the art technologies. These are good jobs.

Enticing Singaporeans to take up employment in the Jurong Industrial Estate was also no easy feat; despite high unemployment then. Besides building public housing in Jurong, one of the things done then was to develop a public transport system to facilitate Singaporeans from other parts of the country to commute to work daily. Hence the comprehensive shuttle and trunk services; in addition to company-provided transport.",2,316,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00316
2019-03-07-T-006,Arasu Duraisamy,Mr Arasu Duraisamy (Nominated Member),"What about Tuas South? As it is, the area is rather remote to most Singaporeans. In terms of accessibility, Malaysian workers have it better compared to the locals, due to the proximity of the Tuas Second link. The nearest MRT station is Tuas West station. The distance from Tuas West station to Tuas Port Terminal Phase 1 is approximately 12 km to 13 km, with a travelling time of about 20 minutes. Currently, there is one feeder bus service from Tuas Bus Terminal serving Tuas South Ave 14. Taking a train from Ang Mo Kio to Tuas West Station, the travelling time is about 65 minutes, not factoring the time taken to travel from home to station and station to the work area. The duration is no means short for the workers who have to commute daily.",3,317,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00317
2019-03-07-T-006,Arasu Duraisamy,Mr Arasu Duraisamy (Nominated Member),"Such long distance will deter Singaporeans staying in the northern, eastern and central areas from wanting to work in Tuas South. I understand employers had a hard time getting local Singaporeans to work in Tuas area. With the companies providing transport the situation was slightly better, and it improved with the opening of the Tuas West extension line. I encountered a similar situation when the port moved to Pasir Panjang, and the workers had some challenge when transferred to the new terminals, till the opening of the Circle Line. Readily available public transport, especially our MRT train services, is a critical factor to be considered to facilitate Singaporeans to work in Tuas South area, notably when the area is being developed to provide good employment opportunities.",4,318,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00318
2019-03-07-T-006,Arasu Duraisamy,Mr Arasu Duraisamy (Nominated Member),"While businesses might provide transport for their workers, not all might do so. Singaporeans will use other means to travel to work in order to save time, and this poses a risk, especially travelling, long distance after completing the graveyard shift. Sir, I have handled cases of Malaysian union members who were involved in fatal traffic accidents after commuting from their home or while heading back home after work. Fatigue was one of the reasons.",5,319,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00319

I would humbly request the Minister of Transport to do a feasibility study on building an MRT line to Tuas South. This line can run via Jurong island as there is also a need for transport for workers working over there. If LTA aims to ensure the maximum of 45 minutes of travelling time between one’s home and work at Shenton Way, I do not see why the Government cannot consider it for workers working in an area where the future of work is.",6,320,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00320

Nevertheless, I humbly believe it is a chicken and egg problem. Without easy accessibility to an efficient public transport, Singaporeans will find it challenging take up employment in Tuas South. Businesses will find it difficult to expand or gear up their activities due to human resource constrains. Hence the ridership may not reach the so-called optimal number.",7,321,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00321
2019-03-07-T-006,Arasu Duraisamy,Mr Arasu Duraisamy (Nominated Member),"Surely when we first embarked on industrialisation in Jurong town, ridership was not the top priority or consideration when developing the transport system. It was about providing a public transport service to facilitate Singaporeans seeking employment in Jurong. For the same reason, I urge the Government to continue to do likewise and ensure every Singaporean who takes up employment in Tuas South area can do so with a safe, comfortable and efficient transport service.

It affects the lives of thousands and millions of Singaporeans on a daily basis. Speaking as a pediatric ophthalmologist and I believe my fellow pediatric colleagues will agree that besides treating or operating on a patient who is a child, what is most important is to win the confidence and trust of the parents who put the lives and well-being of their precious one in our hands.

Embracing technology and innovation will be key in strengthening our transport sectors, and creating opportunities for Singaporeans. I will share on some technologies we are harnessing in the aviation and maritime domains. Back home, we are embracing innovative commuting options such as private hire cars and active mobility devices. Senior Minister of State Janil will speak on our plans to regulate the point-to-point sector, and I will speak on active mobility.",3,423,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00423

But even before 1819, there were already records of Singapore being a thriving sea port. We were a location where East meets West, and for many centuries an important port for trading valuable spices like pepper and nutmeg.",5,425,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00425
2019-03-07-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"After Independence, our pioneers turned our location into an advantage. They built the first container terminal in Southeast Asia at Tanjong Pagar in 1972, despite the uncertainty that containerisation would even take off. Not long after, against the consultants' recommendations, they shifted our international airport from Paya Lebar to Changi, to accommodate the future expansion of the airport. Today, our buzzing sea port and Changi Airport are all part and parcel of the Singapore identity.",6,426,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00426
2019-03-07-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"But we cannot take what we have for granted. As Mr Sitoh Yih Pin rightly noted, there is much to be done for our air and sea hubs to remain relevant and competitive in the long term.",7,427,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00427
2019-03-07-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"First, aviation and maritime are international businesses. The flow of goods and people is dependent on good connectivity between different regions. A dense network of Southeast Asia nodes will enable all of us to ride on Asia's growth together. For example, since the first ASEAN Air Services Agreement was signed in 2009 to liberalise air rights for ASEAN airlines for flights within ASEAN, passenger traffic within ASEAN has grown by more than 90%. This has coincided with a period of strong growth in ASEAN tourism.",8,428,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00428
2019-03-07-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"The expansion of connectivity beyond ASEAN will further stimulate tourism growth. Since the signing of the ASEAN-China Air Transport Agreement in 2011, direct links have increased more than fivefold to over 500, providing more flexible and convenient travel options between China and Southeast Asia. In 2018, the number of Chinese tourists to Southeast Asia reached 25 million, up from 10 million before the Agreement. For Singapore, the number of Chinese tourists visiting Singapore grew from 1.6 million to 3.4 million. Singapore's extensive air links to China also connect Chinese passengers to the region – the Singapore/Malaysia/Thailand tour itinerary (新马泰游) is a popular one. The Singapore Tourism Board, Changi Airport Group and Royal Caribbean International also have a tripartite partnership to sail Chinese Fly-Cruise tourists from Singapore to Southeast Asia.",9,429,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00429
2019-03-07-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,This is why Singapore participates actively in establishing stronger links between the region and the rest of the world.,10,430,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00430
2019-03-07-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"There are on-going negotiations on air transport agreements between ASEAN and the European Union, and between ASEAN and Japan.

2019-03-07-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Similarly, maritime connectivity plays an important role in supporting the growing region. Over the past decade, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has recorded a steady rise in the Liner Shipping Connectivity Index scores of ASEAN countries. This means that the region is increasingly connected to the global shipping network. Singapore will continue to play our part. We have built a reliable and densely connected network, by anchoring key shipping lines and alliances that ply the main shipping route from Asia to Europe.",12,432,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00432
2019-03-07-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Together with our strong complementary feeder network to ASEAN ports, we ensure that goods manufactured in Southeast Asia can be delivered efficiently worldwide. We are also developing new and efficient maritime trade routes. The New International Land Sea Trade Corridor under the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative, also known as CCI-ILSTC, is one example. This new route helps businesses in Southeast Asia access Chinese markets more efficiently. For example, Indonesian paper pulp is traditionally shipped via bulk to Jiangsu and conveyed by barge into Chongqing. Now, they can be containerised and transported through the CCI-ILSTC, saving time and money for businesses.",13,433,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00433
2019-03-07-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Mr Chairman, we must also grow our connectivity in a sustainable way.

2019-03-07-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"For example, Singapore is supportive of the IMO's efforts to address the environmental impact caused by ship emissions. We will be implementing the 0.5% sulphur emission cap, and preparing our port to supply liquefied natural gas as a clean marine fuel by 2020. On the aviation front, Singapore contributed extensively to ICAO's efforts in addressing international aviation carbon dioxide emissions through the implementation of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). This global initiative will help ICAO achieve its aspirational goal of carbon-neutral growth from 2020.",15,435,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00435
2019-03-07-T-006,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"At the same time, we are working with ASEAN to push for our collective interest at international platforms. For example, Singapore is now collaborating with Malaysia and Indonesia to implement a ""Same Risk Area"" for ballast water management, following IMO's approval of the concept. The idea is to identify areas where species would be naturally transferred without using ballast water from ships as a medium, and thus regarded as having the ""same risk"". Ships operating in the ""Same Risk Area"" can then be exempted from IMO's requirement to install ballast water management systems. This makes it easier for ships operating short voyages in our region, while ensuring that we play our part in protecting the marine environment.",16,436,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00436

With these efforts, we hope the BPLRT will also become a lot more reliable in the future, and I must confess that I have a personal stake in this as one of the local Members of Parliament.",6,469,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00469
2019-03-07-T-006,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Our commuters have noticed the improvements. The independent Public Transport Council (PTC) tracks this through the annual Public Transport Customer Satisfaction Survey. I think Assoc Prof Walter Theseira referred to this in his speech.

We are grateful to the more than 7,000 Singaporeans who have contributed ideas to this plan. The LTMP Advisory Panel, which is chaired by Senior Minister of State Janil, has worked very hard to take all these views into account and submitted its recommendations to the Government on 15 February 2019.",8,471,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00471
2019-03-07-T-006,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"The Panel appreciated that a transport system does not just convey people to a place. It brings people together and, if you think about it, it forms a significant part of our daily shared lived experience. A bad commuting experience can disrupt your mood and and day, almost as much as a domestic dispute at home. So, this is why people feel so strongly about the quality, reliability and experience of travelling. The Panel has, therefore, recommended enhancing the travel experience through greater connectivity and better service for everyone. The Panel also understood that there is, ultimately, a limit to infrastructure building on our tiny island.",9,472,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00472

The Government accepts the Panel’s recommendations. Senior Minister of State Janil will elaborate on the LTMP 2040 later.,10,473,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00473
2019-03-07-T-006,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),Let me now deal with the politically-sensitive topic of fiscal sustainability. Many Members have brought this up. I agree with Mr Sitoh Yih Pin and Assoc Prof Walter Theseira that we need to exercise fiscal discipline in order to reduce costs and maximise value for money. How is this being done? Let me cite four ways in which LTA is trying to achieve this.,11,474,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00474
2019-03-07-T-006,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"First, always look out for novel design solutions. For example, LTA engineers saved about $2 billion in construction costs with the East Coast Integrated Depot. This depot is going to be a 4-in-1, with three MRT depots for the East-West Line, Downtown Line and the upcoming TEL, which are stacked one on top of another, and there is also a bus depot for 760 buses. This is the first such facility of its kind. LTA’s engineers have also saved more than $3 billion in potential construction costs by shifting the depot and the reception tracks for the Cross Island Line above ground.",12,475,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00475
2019-03-07-T-006,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"The second way – always look at life cycle costs when procuring major assets that will operate for decades. When the first generation North-South and East-West Line trains were due for renewal, LTA challenged the train manufacturers to design systems using the latest technology that would be easier and cheaper to maintain throughout the 30-year life cycle of the trains.",13,476,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00476
2019-03-07-T-006,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Third, leverage competitive market forces wherever appropriate and whenever possible. For instance, the Bus Contracting Model ensures contestability through open tenders for bus packages. This has brought down the average bus contract bid prices by about 20% since the first bus package was awarded four years ago.",14,477,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00477
2019-03-07-T-006,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Fourth, incentivise – and you will notice I use the word ""incentivise"" – commuters to change their behavior where possible and where convenient in order to optimise the overall performance of the system. This is something which I think Assoc Prof Walter Theseira has been pursuing for quite some time. I have noticed his speeches in this Chamber and he has asked about differential fares. These were introduced by PTC in December 2017. If you strip away the jargo, this is actually is about saving money and improving the travel experience by encouraging more rail commuters to travel during off-peak hours. The number of commuters traveling during the morning pre-peak period has now increased by about 12%. We will continue to look for ways to smoothen out these peaks and troughs which, Assoc Prof Theseira, as an economist, will tell you have a very important impact on overall long-term system costs but, at the same time, improves the travelling experience for people, as it is less crowded. It does so in a positive way through differential fares.",15,478,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00478
2019-03-07-T-006,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"But even as we do this, we need to be mindful that not all commuters have the flexibility to change their commuting patterns. Even with such measures in place, the brutal hard truth is that a high-quality public transport system still requires significant resources. The perennial question – and it is a political question as well – remains ""How do we strike the right balance between the costs borne by taxpayers, commuters and operators?""",16,479,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00479
2019-03-07-T-006,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"I emphasised taxpayers because every dollar that the Government puts into the public transport system ultimately comes from taxpayers. So, remember there is always a balancing act that is necessary.",17,480,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00480
2019-03-07-T-006,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Now, on the Government's side – and that means, on the taxpayers' side of the equation – we will continue to keep fares affordable by fully funding all infrastructure costs and providing significant operating subsidies. Over the next five years, the Government expects to provide $5 billion in subsidies for public bus services and around $4.5 billion to renew our rail operating assets. The Government will also spend another $26 billion to expand the bus and rail networks, also over the next five years. This is why, despite the improvements in capacity and reliability, public transport actually has become more affordable. In fact, over the last decade, monthly expenditure on public transport, as a proportion of household income for the lower income group, has come down from 4.1% to 2.7%.",18,481,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00481
2019-03-07-T-006,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"But I also want to say this. It is inevitable that fares will have to keep pace with costs. In 2018, the PTC introduced a Network Capacity Factor into the fare formula. I think Mr Dennis Tan also referred to this in his intervention earlier. Basically, this factor allows the fares to be adjusted in tandem with capacity changes of our public transport network relative to commuter demand. What I am trying to say in simple terms is this, we would all like to increase capacity to make it more convenient and improve the travel experience. But all of you here also know that an increase in capacity comes with an increase in cost. I would like, however, to assure Mr Dennis Tan that we will certainly caibrate the expansion of rail capacity so that it expands in tandem with ridership growth. It is not feasible anyway to have unlimited expansion in capacity, and I am sure that the impact of NCF will be managed in due course.",19,482,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00482
2019-03-07-T-006,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Mr Dennis Tan also suggested factoring in service quality. This is another example where I agree with his intention. I think the divergence is in the method. Service standards, including on-time performance reliability, are already regulated through existing frameworks. But these frameworks are outside the fare formula. What do I mean by that? In other words, these standards are imposed by LTA on the operators as conditions for service. In addition, operators can be penalised for breach of regulatory standards or breach of licence conditions and the penalties paid are calibrated to ensure fairness and accountability. The penalties paid accrue to the Public Transport Fund which, as you all know, is then redistributed, especially to the lower income families. This is used, therefore, to provide financial assistance on the one hand, but also to serve as a disincentive against the operators taking shortcuts.",20,483,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00483
2019-03-07-T-006,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Mr Dennis Tan also suggested factoring operators' profitability into the fare formula. The profitability of public transport operators, in fact, is already taken into consideration in the fare review mechanism. For example, the productivity gains of public transport operators are shared with commuters through the Productivity Extraction Factor in the fare formula. A lot of words. If you look up the briefing, it is in there in the formula. I think PTC will happily have this conversation with you offline.",21,484,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00484
2019-03-07-T-006,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"The point is this. The operators also contribute a portion of the fare increase into the Public Transport Fund. Typically, they contribute about 20%-50% of the expected increase in fare revenue for that year, with the more profitable public transport operators contributing more, I think this is fair.",22,485,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00485
2019-03-07-T-006,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"This puts in place a formal mechanism for the public transport operators to share their gains with commuters. Let me assure you that that the PTC will continue to keep a close watch on fare affordability for all commuters, especially for specific groups like senior citizens, low-income individuals and persons with disabilities. The PTC has done well and I am confident it will continue to strike the right balance. The key word here is ""balance"" – balance between fare affordability and the long-term fiscal sustainability of our public transport system.",23,486,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00486

In August last year, Malaysia requested to defer the HSR project. In the spirit of bilateral cooperation, we agreed to Malaysia's request, and both sides agreed to a two-year suspension up to 31 May 2020. As part of the agreement, Malaysia agreed, and I can confirm, has remitted to Singapore about S$15 million on 31 January 2019 and and this is for the abortive costs that were incurred by Singapore due to the two-year suspension.",27,490,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00490

In 1973, ICAO approved the creation of the Kuala Lumpur and Kota Kinabalu FIRs which, in fact, were carved out from the then Singapore FIR and allocated to Malaysia. At the same time, ICAO also approved the arrangements under which Singapore would provide ATS over portions of southern Peninsular Malaysia, within the KL FIR. The 1973 ICAO decision was a regional consensus, and struck a balance between the needs of both Singapore and Malaysia, and the international aviation community.

2019-03-07-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary),The Panel made three key recommendations,5,520,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00520
2019-03-07-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"First, 20-Minute Towns and a 45-Minute City. By 2040, Singaporeans can look forward to ""20-Minute Towns"" where almost all journeys to the nearest neighbourhood centre on public, active and shared transport modes can be completed within 20 minutes. Singaporeans will also be able to enjoy a ""45-Minute City"" where nine in 10 peak hour journeys on public, active and shared transport can be completed within 45 minutes.",6,521,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00521
2019-03-07-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"Public, active and shared transport is the only sustainable way forward with our land constraints. Let me explain. ""Public"" refers to, of course, our public transport system, our buses and trains. ""Active"" referring to Active Mobility – walking, cycling and personal mobility devices. ""Shared"" can refer to the other two as well. Public transport is also shared. Many active mobility services can also be shared but, specifically, we also want to include shared transport through taxis, private hire cars and shared vehicles.",7,522,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00522
2019-03-07-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"Some have asked whether this means that they will not benefit if their journeys today already take less than 20 or 45 minutes. These efforts to achieve 20-Minute Towns and a 45-Minute City will benefit all Singaporeans. It will have an impact on traffic flow, an impact on congestion an impact on how we move around our city easily, regardless of how long journey times are today. These improvements in public, active and shared transport would save the average weekday commuter 15 minutes every day by 2040.",8,523,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00523
2019-03-07-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"LTA is now studying the specific initiatives to achieve these targets and will announce them in a few months' time. Even as they do so, it remains clear that a convenient, resilient and efficient public transport network will be central to us achieving this ""20-Minute Towns and a 45-Minute City"" vision.",9,524,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00524
2019-03-07-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"To achieve 20-Minute Towns, we will have to continue to improve connectivity within the towns. Apart from enhancing infrastructure to facilitate active mobility options for shorter, intra-town commutes, we are also conducting trials of on-demand public buses (ODPBs). Mr Melvin Yong asked for an update on the on-going ODPB trial. While the technology is still evolving, the initial results are encouraging. Operated mileage has been reduced in some areas by more than 25% – one quarter – while allowing most ODPB commuters to enjoy journey times comparable to regular bus services. So, 25% reduction in operated mileage, same journey times. Ridership has also been increasing. We will continue to explore ways to improve the service by adapting these trial parameters and refining the ODPB algorithm. We will also monitor commuter feedback to assess how and if the trial can be expanded to include peak hours and weekends. This will help us to identify the key success factors for the ODPB concept, including adjustments to the way we roster our bus captains to ensure that they have sufficient rest. In time to come, we can also explore virtual bus stops. But this will require us to strike a careful balance between safety and convenience. We also will study the extent to which ODPBs can improve first- and last-mile connectivity to allow even more Singaporeans to benefit, regardless of their proximity to an MRT station. Such dynamically routed bus services have the potential to reduce travelling and waiting times for intra-town journeys and allow commuters to enjoy more seamless commutes.",10,525,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00525
2019-03-07-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"To achieve a 45-Minute City, I agree with Mr Ang Wei Neng that rail must continue to be the backbone of our public transport network. Even as we pursue our ambitions, I am happy to report that we are on track to achieve the targets set in our last LTMP. The announcement of the Jurong Region Line in 2018 and the first phase of the Cross Island Line (CRL) earlier this year puts us yet another step closer to having eight in 10 households within a 10-minute walk from a train station. This was the previous LTMP target to achieve in 2030, 10 years before the outcomes that we are hoping for in LTMP 2040. We will continue to review and expand our rail network where there is sufficient ridership.",11,526,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00526
2019-03-07-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"Mayor Low Yen Ling and her residents would be delighted, I hope, to know that we have plans to fully fit out and open Hume station on Downtown Line 2 (DTL2). [Applause.] By 2025. [Laughter.] Hume station was originally designed as a shell station on DTL2 as the pace of developments and ridership growth in the area did not warrant it opening with the other DTL2 stations. Mayor Low Yen Ling has worked hard on behalf of her residents and she has worked with our public sector agencies. She has highlighted and advocated for the potential of the area and the needs of her residents. We have worked closely with her and her community leaders to see how we can improve the commuting experience for residents in the new estates.",12,527,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00527
2019-03-07-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"Since then, these new development plans have been made, partly because of the advocacy and the engagement by Mayor Low and her community leaders – the redevelopment of the Rail Corridor and the transformation of the nearby Bukit Timah Fire Station into a Gateway Node for the surrounding nature and heritage attractions and other developments. With all these, there will be sufficient ridership to justify opening Hume station. Likewise, further addition of new bus services in Bukit Gombak will depend on the pace of development and ridership growth in the area. We are also studying other rail projects beyond 2030 that will bring us closer to the “45-Minute City”. These will be announced when the LTMP is launched in a few months.",13,528,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00528
2019-03-07-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"As Sitoh Yih Pin has pointed out, it is important that we continue to exercise financial prudence as we develop our land transport network. In deciding which areas to extend our rail network to, we will have to balance between managing costs and benefiting the most number of Singaporeans possible, taking into account the characteristics of each area.",14,529,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00529
2019-03-07-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"As an example, I would like to address the suggestion by Mr Arasu Duraisamy that we study the feasibility of a new MRT line to Tuas South and Jurong Island.",15,530,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00530
2019-03-07-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"For Tuas South, the area is still in the initial stages of development and there is not enough ridership in the near to medium term to support an MRT line. Nevertheless, we have taken steps to improve bus connectivity to the Tuas South area. With the opening of the Tuas West Extension in June 2017, LTA launched two new public bus services in the Tuas South area – services 247 and 248. When the Jurong Region Line (JRL) and Cross Island Line are completed, workers in Tuas South will benefit.",16,531,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00531
2019-03-07-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"As for Jurong Island, there are no plans to extend the MRT onto the island itself. However, workers will benefit from the future Jurong Pier Station, which is located only a short distance away from Jurong Island Checkpoint. Once the JRL is completed in 2028, they can travel on the JRL to the Checkpoint before transferring to a shuttle bus or company transport taking them through security and onwards to the various industries on the island. And, for example, if we were to put a station on Jurong Island itself, it is unlikely to create any added convenience or time savings because the workers would still have to go through the Checkpoint security and transfer to an onward last-mile shuttle to their final destination, given how spread out the developments are on the island. So, we will have to balance the effectiveness of such a solution and the costs.",17,532,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00532
2019-03-07-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"Mr Chairman, we cannot achieve our vision of 20-Minute Towns and a 45-Minute City through infrastructure developments alone. Our public transport system is built to support peak tidal travel demand during the short two-hour window on weekday mornings and evenings, as many Singaporeans living all over the island commute to jobs in the city centre. We need to optimise the distribution of jobs and housing across the island. This will reduce travel times as more people live closer to their workplace. This is, in fact, another way of redistributing peak travel demand and make better use of transport infrastructure, as noted by Prof Walter Theseira.",18,533,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00533
2019-03-07-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"Today, there are already regional centres in Tampines, Woodlands and Jurong East that are well connected to nearby amenities and jobs. We, in MOT and LTA, are collaborating with other agencies on upcoming key developments, including the Jurong Lake District, Jurong Innovation District, Woodlands North Coast and the Punggol Digital District. These will be well connected by Transit Priority Corridors – we do not have any of these yet but we are going to build some. These will have features, such as dedicated turns and lanes for public and private buses, as well as other types of connectivity, apart from the Transit Priority Corridors to link these developments, such as the new rail projects which we have already announced – the Thomson East-Coast Line and North-East Line extension. Taken altogether, the redistribution, these Transit Priority Corridors, the work that we are already doing on the MRT lines will shorten our daily commutes to work and play, and take us closer to our vision of 20-Minute Towns and a 45-Minute City.",19,534,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00534
2019-03-07-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"The second key recommendation by the Advisory Panel is to build a more Inclusive Transport System. Through the LTMP public consultation process, Singaporeans have expressed the desire for a land transport system which is inclusive and welcoming to all Singaporeans. This means a culture where commuters look out for one another, especially those who are more in need. Singaporeans acknowledged that achieving this gracious commuting culture is a shared responsibility between Government, transport operators, transport workers and commuters. I am heartened that Singaporeans are willing to play their part, and my colleague Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng will later elaborate on strategies to make our land transport system a more inclusive and friendly space for all Singaporeans.",20,535,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00535

2019-03-07-T-006,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary),"A comprehensive suite of public, active and shared transport options will reduce our reliance on privately-owned vehicles and contribute towards a healthier environment. This will complement ongoing initiatives by different Ministries to improve the health of Singapore and Singaporeans, including through the reduction of vehicle emissions. For example, we work with MEWR on the Vehicular Emissions Scheme and the Early Turnover Scheme to encourage owners to use cleaner vehicles. The electric car-sharing programme, jointly supported by LTA and the Economic Development Board (EDB), is another example. Under this, BlueSG will roll out a total of 500 charging stations equipped with 2,000 charging points nationwide. To date, BlueSG has installed 687 charging points.",22,537,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00537

By 2040, we will upgrade all our public buses to cleaner energy sources. I am pleased to announce that key industry players in the point-to-point sector are also following the Government's lead. All the taxi companies and some of the private hire car booking providers and car rental companies have committed to making their entire fleet run on cleaner energy by 2040.

Since March 2017, LTA has partnered MasterCard to test the use of contactless bankcards on public transport under the ABT initiative. The pilot was successful and LTA is now working with MasterCard and Visa on the full launch of ABT under the branding of ""SimplyGo"". Starting April 2019, all MasterCard users with compatible contactless cards or mobile phones can use these on our buses and trains. We plan for Visa to be used on public transport later this year. With ""SimplyGo"", commuters will have the option of carrying one less card for transport, or maybe no cards if they use their mobile phones, and not having to do card top-ups.",30,545,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00545

Here in Singapore, we have been relatively fortunate. Commuter satisfaction with P2P services continues to remain high. More than 99% of commuters surveyed by the Public Transport Council (PTC) were satisfied with taxi and Private Hire Car (PHC) services in 2018. Such a positive outcome is only possible with responsible operators, sensible commuters, safe drivers and sound policy. In particular, the National Taxi Association (NTA) and the National Private Hire Vehicles Association (NPHVA) have played important roles in helping our drivers adjust to technological transformation in the P2P space.",33,548,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00548

2019-03-07-T-006,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"LTA says that the recommendations of the Active Mobility Advisory Panel will be implemented on 1 February 2019. How will this be done? For example, the speed limit for PMDs and bicycles on footpaths had been reduced to 10 km/h. Sir, this is slower than a jogger taking a leisurely jog. How can an enforcement officer determine the speed of the PMD or bicycle? How about the mandatory use of helmets by cyclists on roads? Will the cyclist riding along a small road from his home to the bus stop or to the market be summoned if he does not put on a helmet? Would these rules also apply to the foreign workers riding from their dormitory to their work place?",7,582,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00582

But accidents will happen, and some of them will be so serious that they require large hefty medical fees. Without insurance, the perpetrator or victim will have trouble paying off these fees.

I know most e-scooters will not get into accidents. But the same can be said for car drivers, and motor insurance is still mandatory. And just like for cars, we need constant enforcement to make sure people stay within the rules. Residents have been giving feedback that, during morning peak hours, there are a lot of PMDs, e-scooters, bicycles zooming along covered linkways leading to the MRT station. This is very dangerous for pedestrians. Can the Minister share how much LTA has stepped up enforcement, and how LTA decides how much enforcement they should do?",4,587,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00587

I was surprised to see this, given the answer to my PQ just a month before. I enquired with LTA and LTA confirmed that Grab was not allowed to operate on public land without a licence from LTA and they said they were investigating operators who were operating without a licence. I have also seen PMDs belonging to other operators being used on public lands. The fact that these operators have been operating their PMDs in public without a licence is disconcerting. If operators behave in this way without a proper licence, how can we have confidence in such companies toeing the line after they receive a licence? We should also remember Grab’s reaction to the Competition Commission’s findings on its acquisition of Uber.",3,592,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00592
2019-03-07-T-006,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"In his reply to my PQ, Senior Minister of State Lam Pin Min set out some of the conditions which would be imposed on the shared PMD operators upon issuance of their licence. I agree with those conditions but, notwithstanding these conditions, my reservations regarding the introduction of commercial shared PMD services have remained. It has been difficult enough to ensure that all PMD owners adhere to new rules for safe use of PMDs and to be considerate to other footpath users. We are not out of the woods yet. Would it not exacerbate the present situation if we have a new category of users, namely hirers? Hirers are likely to take less ownership of the need to ride responsibly and considerately as compared to owners since they are not the owners.",4,593,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00593
2019-03-07-T-006,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Even if conditions are imposed on the operators, there is a limit as to what operators can do to ensure that correct use of PMDs is adopted by all users. While it is good to require operators to have insurance for all users, which may be helpful when there is an accident leading to a personal injury or property damage claim, this does not stop inconsiderate or unlawful behavior and, certainly, near misses.",5,594,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00594
2019-03-07-T-006,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"The biggest challenge is still of getting existing PMD owners and users to use the PMDs in accordance with the law and in a safe and considerate manner. What more can we expect from hitherto non-PMD users, namely, hirers? Already, I have seen quite a number of tourists or overseas visitors on the illegally operated PMDs, some of them even riding on the roads. What does LTA expect the operators to do to ensure that users will ride considerately and according to the regulations?

LTA is assessing the first batch of PMD-sharing licence applications and will only license operators who are capable of managing indiscriminate parking and complying with fire safety requirements, and have clear plans to educate users on proper parking, safe riding and fire safety. We will start conservatively, with new operators restricted to small fleet sizes of up to 500 PMDs under a one-year sandbox licence period. This gives LTA time to assess sandbox licensees’ ability to comply with regulatory requirements, before granting them a larger fleet size under a full licence.

We have completed 15 Silver Zones, and I am glad that accident rates in these areas have dropped by 75%. We are building another 20 Silver Zones by 2020 at areas, including Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10, Potong Pasir Avenue 1 and Tampines Street 81.

During last week’s Budget debate, Mr Ang Wei Neng said that the process takes eight weeks. I checked and I am glad to find that this is not correct. The average processing time taken by LTA was two weeks in 2018. Even if we include the time to clarify an incomplete application, the average total time taken was five weeks in 2018.

In his reply he mentioned that since the Tuas South station would still be in its development phase and the anticipated ridership would be low, could he then explain to me what is the rationale when we are about to spend a quarter of a million dollars to build the Founders Memorial station and there are no projected numbers on that particular station – I mean foot traffic.",1,693,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00693

So there is no single development or facility that will say this is the right thing to do or this is the wrong thing to do – we have to look at the total expected demand. For Tuas South, yes, in the long term, there may be a very different demand picture from what we expect today.

Thank you very much for agreeing to set up the tripartite committee for private hire drivers and with the industry. I am just wondering whether LTA or MOT sides will assist the industry to form an association because, right now, the operators are all individuals. So, when they come for the meetings, they come as an individual, rather than a collective association. So sometimes, the voices can be very disparate and they do not quite have a common position on whether the industry operators want to bring to the table to negotiate.",2,698,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00698

In fact, we have received similar feedback from Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, and I do empathise with the disamenities with regard to noise pollution for residents who are staying in the vicinity of Seletar Airport. CAAS is mindful of the noise generated by overflying aircraft and we have been reviewing and adopting best practices in noise abatement measures according to international standards. To the extent possible, CAAS will direct aircraft to land from and take off towards directions to minimise flying over residential areas. This will, hopefully, reduce the amount of noise disturbances.",1,700,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00700

Recently, based on some of the feedback from residents and from the grassroots organisations, we have since 1 January 2019 disallowed flights at Seletar Airport between 10.00 pm and 7.00 am every day, except for emergency and medical evacuation flights.

Potentially, we have a number of businesses that can get involved with the P2P space. Some would be traditional taxi companies and transport operators; some would be the very new mobility operators that we have seen coming to Singapore. But potentially, even tech companies could get into it. So, it is not a very clear industry as to who would be a partner. We will engage with them all, and if there is a need to form an association, I think we may have to look for some assistance to chair the committee and bso forth, but we will definitely be engaging Mr Ang to help us engage in this process.",2,705,2019-03-07-T-006-S-00705

My question on PMD is really on, will the errant behaviour of hirers be taken into account when the LTA assesses whether or not the relevant operator has complied with the licence operating conditions. That means, after the licence has been awarded, will the errant behaviour of their hirers be taken against them, so to speak? Also, in respect of their hirers' eligibility to continue to hire with any of the commercial operator? So, will errant behaviour, let us say if this rider has been caught riding on the road when he is not supposed to, will that actually be taken against him?

It will not be exactly fair to just penalise the operator if the operator has done its best to educate users with regards to safe riding behaviour.

It is also important for these same rules to be applied consistently to all footpaths so that users will not be confused with different rules at different areas.

So, it is in a ""live"" environment. Those vehicles, the operators that do that, have already pre-tested these in facilities like CETRAN at NTU, to establish the basic safety. The next phase, having established the on-road safety, is then to integrate these autonomous vehicles into ""live"" operations. We have committed to making that possible in three towns by 2023  Tengah, Jurong Innovation District and Punggol.

If we do not increase our agricultural yields massively over the next 30 years, the world will simply be in an economic growth-driven famine. Singapore's competition for food will only be more keen. How can we safeguard our future? It is mission critical to increase the local content of our food supplies. We have diversified our food sources to manage our risk and food cost. But only local production can protect us from short-term shocks and provide a measure of self-sufficiency. What is the Ministry's target of local production to imported food supplies over the next 10 to 30 years? We are way in meeting this target?",5,876,2019-03-07-T-007-S-00876
2019-03-07-T-007,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"In the 1960s, agricultural accounted for 3% of our GDP. Today, it no longer has a category of its own and accounts for less than 0.02% of our GDP. Has the Ministry set a target GDP rate?",6,877,2019-03-07-T-007-S-00877
2019-03-07-T-007,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"For us to succeed in this national mission, both businesses and consumers play critical roles. Locally produced food will generally cost more than imported ones. This is no different from a higher cost water produced by distillation. Yet if we do not see the value of food self-sufficiency as a national imperative, then there is no future for local production. For once, we have to literally drink and eat our way to security or disaster.",7,878,2019-03-07-T-007-S-00878
2019-03-07-T-007,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Over the years, Fairprice has made it a critical mission to build an eco-system to support local producers beyond moderating costs of food. First, it has committed to buying local. I understand that Fairprice carries close to 5,000 locally-produced items, accounting for about 20% of its total sales. In fact, 40% of eggs sold are from our local farms. Buying ""local"" also meant that Fairprice has a stronger control over quality and safety from farms to dining table. This is good for consumers.",8,879,2019-03-07-T-007-S-00879
2019-03-07-T-007,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"They also started an SME development and support programme to help 400 small companies and start-ups with the cash flow and development. It has committed to monthly ""Made in Singapore"" campaigns at its own costs.",9,880,2019-03-07-T-007-S-00880
2019-03-07-T-007,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Fairprice cannot do it alone. It is the Government, other companies and consumers to join in enhancing ed of food security. How can the Ministry support the efforts of companies such as Fairprice to build on local production capacity? The quality of soil and climate used to determine agricultural yield. Now, a technologically-driven eco-system can level the playing field.",10,881,2019-03-07-T-007-S-00881
2019-03-07-T-007,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"For example, the Netherlands is small and densely populated. It does not have most of the resources necessary for large scale agriculture. Yet, it is the globe's number two exporter of food measured by value, second only to the United States. For a sense of its achievements, the US is 270 times its land mass. What Silicon Valley has done for the US' IT industry, Food Valley has achieved the same for Dutch agriculture. Wageningen University and Research (WUR) is a crucible of innovative re-cultural developments, not unlike what MIT Alumni has done in the IT world.",11,882,2019-03-07-T-007-S-00882
2019-03-07-T-007,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"While we might not be able to go to such a scale as the Dutch, we can be the crucible of change in development in our region. Its areas include R&D and logistics, urban farming, agricultural and eco-culture, finance and insurance. We have done this water challenge. Our ambitions must now match urgency and the novelty of Singapore's food security challenge. If we can grow the industry, this will mean tremendous opportunities for economy. While it is a total economic value you can generate if we reach our target local production, how many and what types of jobs can we expect to create?",12,883,2019-03-07-T-007-S-00883
2019-03-07-T-007,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"We can only grow our agriculture industry if we have the right capital and political will. Viable businesses ultimately determine the sustainability of the industry. How can the Ministry ensure that there is sufficient capital and skilled manpower in the system to drive the growth of start-ups? Netherlands, WUR and its impact on agricultural innovation suggests that we need to invest in our local academia. We need to marry the science and the market. How does the Ministry plan to jump start and develop this field in the Institutes of Higher Learning?",13,884,2019-03-07-T-007-S-00884
2019-03-07-T-007,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Even as we go to local content of production, our legislation must be kept market-friendly without compromising our food safety. The supply chain is fraught with risks. From cultivation and harvesting, things can easily go wrong. How does the Ministry ensure that food safety is maintained throughout the supply chain and that effective co-chain is in place? How does it also ensure they monitor compliance cost keenly to minimise regulatory costs?",14,885,2019-03-07-T-007-S-00885

2019-03-07-T-007,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Thank you, Chairman. The formation of the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) will bring together the food-related functions of the Agri-Food and AVA, NEA and the Health Sciences Authority (HSA). Without a doubt, this consolidation of regulatory oversight for food safety and security under a single agency will be more efficient. The streamlining of processes and the sharing of facilities and technology will enable all the various teams to communicate more effectively, reduce red tape, and avoid duplication and work more productively.",1,887,2019-03-07-T-007-S-00887

2019-03-07-T-007,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Rising temperatures pose a particular threat to food safety in Singapore, for example, as our wet markets and hawker centres are not air-conditioned, exposing all food to higher risks of spoilage. What is the Ministry's view on this problem?",4,890,2019-03-07-T-007-S-00890
2019-03-07-T-007,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"With climate change, we can expect more unpredictable and intense rainfall. What are some of PUB's plans to mitigate flood risks in the face of this challenge?",5,891,2019-03-07-T-007-S-00891
2019-03-07-T-007,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Would the Ministry share some updates, starting with the progress of the various drainage improvement works, canals, retention and any new detention tanks around our island? How many and where are these works being done and what are the expected dates of completion? I understand that last year alone, the Ministry received about 500 submissions for plans to build retention tanks. But as of February 2018, only 158 have been completed. What is the status now for these projects?",6,892,2019-03-07-T-007-S-00892
2019-03-07-T-007,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Besides these constructions, the maintenance of our drains is equally important. From the regular inspections, what common problems were detected and how can members of the public assist to keep obstructions out of the drains?",7,893,2019-03-07-T-007-S-00893
2019-03-07-T-007,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"And lastly, as I also called for last year, would the Ministry be considering the use of innovative porous materials such as durable permeable concrete on our roads and walkways to facilitate drainage?",8,894,2019-03-07-T-007-S-00894

It says there this polo shirt is recycled from 12 bottles, pet bottles that all of us use. But I would encourage most of us to use reuseable bottles instead. It is made from these upcycled materials. In essence, what they have done is try to keep using what we have within our systems and not toss it away, in this case, into the sea.",35,937,2019-03-07-T-007-S-00937

For example, lithium-ion batteries found in almost all our electronics – handphones, laptops and even electric vehicles. Global demand is soaring, but mineral sources for lithium, cobalt and coltan are finite and costly to mine. Continuously exploiting these minerals may harm the gorillas that Mr Louis Ng was talking about.

Firstly, on whether the default taking place will affect the other water supply systems, it will not. Just like TPL, PUB has been onsite, in all the plants, we have been monitoring, we always monitor. We look at the operational readiness of these plants and then we also see whether they can key up to the capacities that they are designed for and if they should default, the same step-in rights can be invoked.",1,1081,2019-03-07-T-007-S-01081

In adopting the PPP model, we get many advantages, we are able to not invest in capital, pay only for what we need. We also can build the local capabilities of our enterprises, who can also then bring these for export purposes. At the same time, we also know there are risks involved, and therefore we have put enough measures to be able to take over the plant or own it in the event that these PPP partners are not viable anymore.

When we took steps to reduce the number of diesel vehicles, it is really to enhance and increase the quality of our air. And this is not just through the diesel tax that we increased recently. We have others. We have the VES under the COE scheme where we incentivise or disincentivise the use of pollutive or non-pollutive vehicles. We also have the Early Turnover Scheme (ETS) which encourages diesel owners or companies to turn over their old vehicles into new vehicles. And this is important because heavy goods vehicles under the Euro VI standard, are 20 times cleaner than the older ones or the oldest ones that are under the Euro I standards.

Taxis, for examples. Proportion of diesel taxis decreased from 86% in 2016 to 73% in 2018. In fact, zero new diesel taxis were registered in 2018.

WHO's Advisory tells us that PM2.5 is carcinogenic, it can cause cancer. That is part of what diesel does. The tightened industrial emission, together with these, have seen contribution of PM2.5 reducing over the years.

It is really an omnibus of various legislation that if you put together, we could call it a Climate Change Bill. In the absence of which, it is sufficient now, for what we have. With the measures that we have put in place, we believe that we will be able, in the first instance, to meet our nationally determined contribution for reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 36% by 2030, and then levelling after that.

We will also be extending MediShield Life coverage to serious pregnancy or delivery complications, which will take effect from 1 April 2019.",2,1110,2019-03-07-T-011-S-01110
2019-03-07-T-011,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"MOH has therefore decided to remove the requirement for couples to purchase ARP insurance before undergoing IVF, effective 1 April 2019. Insurers may continue to offer ARP insurance or similar products, if they assess that there is sufficient demand. Couples who wish to have additional coverage beyond MediShield Life and MediSave, can still purchase ARP insurance or other maternity insurance plans in the private insurance market to meet their needs.",3,1111,2019-03-07-T-011-S-01111
2019-03-07-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there are plans to tighten the regulation of private daycare and homecare services that do not receive Government subsidies as they currently do not have any mandatory minimum standards; and (b) whether daycare and formal homecare services should be licensed like childcare and nursing home services.,1,1112,2019-03-07-T-012-S-01112
2019-03-07-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"As the home and community care sector grows over time, we will need to continually improve the quality and standards of home and day care services.",1,1113,2019-03-07-T-012-S-01113
2019-03-07-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Healthcare professionals working in the sector, such as doctors, nurses and therapists, are already subject to licensing by their respective professional bodies. They are held to strict professional standards in areas such as code of conduct, practice standards and competencies. In 2015, MOH, in consultation with the sector, also introduced developmental service guidelines for home and day care providers covering areas such as care delivery, staff training and staff qualifications.",2,1114,2019-03-07-T-012-S-01114
2019-03-07-T-012,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"MOH will review the need for more formal regulation of the home and day care sector.

The specific timing, phasing and regulatory approach will need to be studied carefully as the sector is still nascent and evolving.",3,1115,2019-03-07-T-012-S-01115
2019-03-07-T-013,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the lithium-ion batteries used by electric bicycles, PMDs and other electric devices should be designated as controlled goods under the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations to reduce the increasing incidences of fire caused by their charging.",1,1116,2019-03-07-T-013-S-01116
2019-03-07-T-013,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Electrical devices such as Power Assisted Bicycles (""PABs"") and motorised Personal Mobility Devices (""PMDs"") should be tested for their safety as a whole, rather than having components such as lithium-ion batteries tested in isolation. Unlike most consumer electrical devices, PMDs and PABs are exposed to harsher conditions such as wet weather and uneven ground. In this regard, the testing of the device as a whole, takes into consideration of how the overall design and materials used are able to withstand expected operating conditions of the device.",1,1117,2019-03-07-T-013-S-01117
2019-03-07-T-013,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"To safeguard fire safety risks, the Land Transport Authority (""LTA"") announced earlier that it will require all motorised PMDs intended for use on public paths to be certified to the UL2272 standard from 1 January 2021. PABs that are approved after 1 February 2016 for use on public road and paths are also required to adhere to the EN15194 standard. Both the UL2272 and EN15194 standards can improve the fire and electrical safety of PMDs and PABs respectively.",2,1118,2019-03-07-T-013-S-01118

These goods have to be registered with ESG, and affixed with the Safety Mark before they can be sold in Singapore. In addition, ESG administers the Consumer Protection (Consumer Goods Safety Requirements) Regulations (""CGSR""), which requires general consumer products not regulated under any other legislations to meet applicable international or regional safety standards. ESG conducts post-market testing, and suppliers found with non compliant products will be asked to rectify or stop sale.",3,1119,2019-03-07-T-013-S-01119
2019-03-07-T-013,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Consumers should also be aware that the usage of every product will carry inherent risks. We strongly encourage consumers to exercise vigilance when purchasing and charging electrical devices. When purchasing PABs and PMDs, consumers should buy from reputable sources and be alert to prices which look too good to be true. Besides ensuring that the Safety Mark is on the adaptor, consumers should also avoid overcharging or tampering with the electrical components of their devices.",4,1120,2019-03-07-T-013-S-01120
