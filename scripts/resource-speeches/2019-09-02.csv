2019-09-02-T-001,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong,"asked the Minister for Manpower in the last five years, what are the statistics for persons with disabilities with regard to (i) their general employment rates, (ii) their employment rates by 10-year age groups and (iii) the main sectors employing them.",1,1,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00001
2019-09-02-T-001,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether he can provide an update on the progress of programmes to help companies employ and train persons with disabilities (PwDs), including the current number of companies and PwDs involved; and (b) whether there are long-term studies to monitor the effectiveness of these programmes in integrating PwDs.",1,2,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00002
2019-09-02-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Would you like to take the two questions together?,1,3,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00003
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Yes, Mr Speaker. I will take Question Nos 1 and 2 together.",1,4,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00004
2019-09-02-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,5,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00005
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Speaker, MOM recently started collecting data on the employment outcomes of persons with disabilities (PwDs) through our annual Comprehensive Labour Force Survey, with data available from 2018 onwards.",1,6,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00006
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Among PwDs in the working ages of 15 to 64, the resident employment rate was 28.6%. Another 4.2% of PwDs in this age range were without a job and actively looking for one, translating to a resident unemployment rate of 12.9%. The remaining two-thirds of PwDs aged 15 to 64 were outside of the labour force, with most of them citing poor health or disability as the main reason.",2,7,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00007
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,The Member also asked for a breakdown of employment rates by age bands. The resident employment rates for PwDs were 27.6% for those aged 15 and 39; 37.8% for those aged between 40 and 49; 26.1% for those aged between 50 and 64; and 5.9% for those aged 65 and above.,3,8,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00008
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"The sectors employing the most resident PwDs are Community, Social and Personal Services, Food Services, Administrative and Support Services and Manufacturing, which together account for more than half of PwD employment.",4,9,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00009
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Besides Mr Chong, Dr Intan had also filed a Parliamentary Question* for the next Sitting on the effectiveness of Government schemes in helping companies or employers to hire adults with disabilities. In particular, she cited the Special Employment Credit (SEC), Open Door Programme (ODP) and Workfare. I would like to take this opportunity to address Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar’s1 question as well.",5,10,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00010
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"To enable more PwDs of working age to be active in the labour force, the Government provides support in several ways. In 2012, MOM extended SEC to employers that hire Singaporeans with disabilities of all ages earning up to $4,000 a month. SEC provides an automatic wage offset of up to 16% of the employee’s monthly income for PwDs aged below 67, and up to 22% for PwDs aged 67 and over. Last year, more than 5,700 employers hiring over 8,600 Singaporeans with disabilities benefited from SEC. This number has increased from 2012, when SEC was paid to around 3,200 employers hiring about 5,000 Singaporeans with disabilities.",6,11,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00011
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Employers and PwDs can tap on the employment support services and programmes under the Adapt and Grow initiative. This includes the ODP and Career Trial. ODP, which is administered by SG Enable with funding support from Workforce Singapore (WSG), provides job placement and job support services for PwDs and their employers, and grants for training and job redesign. The ODP Training Grant provides a subsidy of up to 90% of course fees to support the training of PwDs and their co-workers. The ODP Job Redesign Grant provides employers with funding of up to 90% of the job redesign costs, capped at $20,000 per employee with disability, to help integrate PwDs at the workplace.",7,12,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00012
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Some employers and PwDs may have reservations about job fit and the suitability of the work environment. To address these concerns, Career Trial provides an opportunity for jobseekers and employers to try out each other and assess job fit through a trial. During the trial – which can be up to three months – jobseekers receive a training allowance from the Government.",8,13,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00013
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"From January 2016 to June this year, close to 780 companies have hired more than 2,000 PwDs with support from the Adapt and Grow initiative. At least 60% of these PwDs remained employed for after six months.",9,14,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00014
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Finally, the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) and Workfare Training Support (WTS) were extended to lower wage PwDs of all ages in 2012 and 2017 respectively. WIS tops up the salaries and CPF savings of lower-wage PwDs, with up to $3,600 in cash and CPF contributions annually. WTS provides support such as course fee subsidies, monetary awards and training allowances to encourage lower wage PwDs to upgrade their skills. Last year, more than 6,400 Singaporeans with disabilities benefited from WIS, up from more than 3,500 in 2012. The number of Singaporeans with disabilities who benefited from WTS training also increased last year to about 860, up from about 640 in 2017.",10,15,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00015
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"There are also on-going efforts to help PwDs integrate into the workforce. Earlier this year, MOM and SG Enable launched the Job Redesign Guide for Inclusive Employers. The Guide provides step-by-step information for companies on how they can redesign jobs to suit PwD workers – for instance, through changes to the workplace or working arrangements. SG Enable also runs disability management workshops and a biennial Inclusive Business Forum to equip employers with knowledge and skills on how to recruit PwDs and integrate them into the workforce.",11,16,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00016
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Inclusive employment requires collaboration amongst the public, private and people sectors. In March this year, MSF announced the formation of a new workgroup under the Third Enabling Masterplan to look at preparing PwDs for the future economy by enhancing access to lifelong learning opportunities and employment pathways. The workgroup is co-chaired by Minister of State for Social and Family Development Mr Sam Tan and Mayor Denise Phua. The workgroup is engaging PwDs and their care-givers, social service agencies and other disability stakeholders to better understand the needs, challenges and aspirations of PwDs. The workgroup aims to release their recommendations early next year.",12,17,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00017

2019-09-02-T-001,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister of State for sharing the data regarding employment of persons with disabilities. I just have two supplementary questions. First, would the Ministry consider extending even more incentives, such as enhanced corporate tax relief for employers, or even instituting some form of affirmative action to ensure that they employ persons with disabilities or those with special needs. Secondly, would the Ministry also consider setting up a one-stop portal to help persons with disabilities and special needs gain employment. That is, the Ministry consolidates all the job vacancies from different employers so that persons with disabilities know that there is a one-stop portal that they can go to, to look for employment or even training opportunities; likewise, for the employers to do so.",1,19,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00019
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,I thank the Member for her questions. I would just like to clarify on the first supplementary question  is she asking for more schemes or just putting in place affirmative action?,1,20,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00020
2019-09-02-T-001,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar,Both.,1,21,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00021
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"As I had mentioned, today, we have the Special Employment Credit (SEC) which already subsidises the salaries of PwDs. Other schemes, such as the Open Door Programme, help with job redesign and so forth. From the perspective of implementing schemes, I think we are quite well resourced. More can still be done to encourage employers to think about having more PwDs and being more inclusive. That is an effort that we are working quite closely with MSF and even MOE for the SPED schools, to see how we can make pathways more available. That is an area that the new workgroup that I mentioned earlier would be looking into. It is a bit premature to be talking about what upcoming policies we would need to shape. But clearly, we can do better in terms of employment outcomes. It is one area we can look at.",1,22,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00022
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"On the second question with regards to a one-stop portal, that is something we can study. Today, we have something like a Jobs Bank that Workforce Singapore already has. SG Enable enables the employment of PwDs. That is one area we could potentially study. Let me speak to the workgroup to consider your suggestions.",2,23,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00023
2019-09-02-T-001,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I thank Minister of State Mr Zaqy for that reply. It was reported that just five in 100 persons with disabilities here have jobs. Could the Minister of State please shed some light on the difference in the numbers that he has just cited, versus what was reported in the newspapers?",1,24,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00024
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"I thank the Member for his question. I had said that today's employment rate for those between the ages of 15 and 64 was 28.6% which is different from the 5% that was cited by The Straits Times in 2017. This was erroneous because the incorrect data was derived by The Straits Times using different sources of publicly available data. Back then, PwD data from our comprehensive labour force survey was not ready. Therefore, understandably, they had patched together from different sources. For example, for the number of employed PwDs, The Straits Times had used the number reported by MSF in a Parliamentary Question (PQ) reply which is a composite of PwDs in the private sector who are eligible for the SEC, as well as PwDs in the Public Service. So, they patched that together. This was an underestimate, as SEC does not cover PwDs earning $4,000 and above a month. At the same time, there were also others who were not registered with SG Enable. So, some numbers were missed out.",1,25,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00025
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"For the total number of PwDs in our population, The Straits Times applied the estimated prevalence rate from a NCSS survey of 2,000 persons. This is different from what we have for our comprehensive labour force survey which covers about 100,000-plus persons from 33,000 households. So, it is a lot more accurate view of what the population is.",2,26,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00026
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"And given the small sample survey, there is a higher margin of error in estimating the true prevalence rate. Some a small difference in the estimated and true prevalence rate would result in a significant numerical difference in the derived PwD population.",3,27,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00027
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"At the same time, The Straits Times used NCCS' estimated prevalence rate for PwDs aged 50 and over compute the population size for PwDs aged 50 to 64. This is inaccurate as the estimate is affected by PwDs aged above 64. For those above 64, you will find a higher prevalence of disability, not just because of conditions which you were born with, but also because of old age and so you have deterioration of health, stroke and other conditions that also add up to disability.",4,28,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00028
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Therefore, if you look at some of these composites that were put together, there is a difference in the numbers that came out. So, we have now used the comprehensive labour force survey which is more comprehensive. Last year was the first year for which we have available data.",5,29,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00029
2019-09-02-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Ms Anthea Ong.,1,30,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00030
2019-09-02-T-001,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"I thank the Minister of State. I have two questions. The first is, we have tracked the number of differently abled people who are employed. Do we know how long these employed people are in their employment? My personal experience is that I almost get a request for employment every other day at Hush TeaBar from the deaf community. I am wondering, as much as they are employed, how long do they actually stay in employment. The second question is, do we have any plans to commit to a national target? I want to qualify that I am not asking for an employment quota for employers, but I am asking if we as a country is committing to a national target in terms of inclusive employment, particularly for people with disabilities.",1,31,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00031
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Earlier, I mentioned that for those PwDs who came through our Adapt and Grow initiatives, at least 60% remained employed after six months. Certainly, from a settling in perspective, we also provide support through the Job Redesign Grant. It is not just to support the placement but also to support the education and cultural awareness education of fellow employees as well, to help them settle in.",1,32,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00032
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"At the same time, it is a lot of work – having spoken to members and workers from SG Enable and other VWOs who are doing this, there is quite a lot of work to do as well, to help a PwD settle into some of the workplaces. They may not be easily settled in but I think we can do better.",2,33,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00033
2019-09-02-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Overall, in terms of a national target, it is something we have considered but I do not think we are prepared to do it at this point, given that we have just got some good visibility on how the situation is. I think our commitment for now is that our employment rates can be improved and this is something for which we need to get more employers onboard in order to improve employment rate and placements for our PwDs. I hope that through greater awareness, though Members like Ms Anthea Ong and other VWOs around, we can certainly do better to bring employers onboard, create awareness and help our PwDs to be more gainfully employed.",3,34,2019-09-02-T-001-S-00034
2019-09-02-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what are the factors contributing to this year's midges outbreak at Pandan Reservoir; (b) how different is this outbreak compared to previous ones; (c) how experience from previous outbreaks has helped PUB to stay ahead of the curve in fighting the midges issue; and (d) why PUB has not been able to find a permanent solution to the occasional midges outbreaks.,1,35,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00035
2019-09-02-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what are the interventions used by PUB to counter the current midges outbreak at Pandan Reservoir; (b) how effective	have these measures been in controlling the midges population and mitigating its impact to the surrounding living environment; and (c) what additional new measures are being contemplated to help the community affected by the outbreak.,1,36,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00036
2019-09-02-T-002,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether there are other water bodies in Singapore experiencing a midges outbreak like that at Pandan Reservoir; and (b) whether PUB is able to predict, prevent and overcome such outbreaks.",1,37,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00037
2019-09-02-T-002,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu,"asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources regarding the persistent problems created by swarms of midges from Pandan Reservoir (a) what measures are being implemented to reduce the population of these chironomids; and (b) with rising temperatures, whether the Ministry will be considering long-term measures to prevent similar occurrences at this and possibly other reservoirs in the future.",1,38,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00038
2019-09-02-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,"asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what expertise and resources does PUB have to understand, monitor and prevent midges outbreaks at reservoirs; (b) what are the key indicators that PUB uses to predict and pre-empt an outbreak; and (c) how can residents living near reservoirs be better protected from the outbreaks.",1,39,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00039
2019-09-02-T-002,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Mr Speaker, can I take Question Nos 3 to 7 together.",1,40,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00040
2019-09-02-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,41,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00041
2019-09-02-T-002,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Thank you. Non-biting midges, also known as chironomids, are a type of flying insect that thrive in water bodies such as ponds, rivers and reservoirs. Midges are part of natural aquatic eco-systems and they are food for fishes and birds.",1,42,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00042
2019-09-02-T-002,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Midges can multiply very rapidly with each female adult midge laying up to 500 eggs in the water bodies. The eggs take a few days to hatch and become larvae which live at the bottom of the reservoir. After about two weeks, they develop to become pupae, swim to the water surface and emerge as adults. The adult midges live for only one to two days during which time they remain above water bodies to mate and lay eggs to continue their life-cycle.",2,43,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00043
2019-09-02-T-002,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Midges emergence occurs from time to time in several reservoirs including Pandan, Bedok, Punggol, Serangoon, Poyan, Tengeh and Marina reservoirs, as well as Punggol Waterway. Midge emergence has been known to occur at Pandan Reservoir since the late 1970s. Each emergence can be as brief as two weeks or as long as five months. There are several factors that determine the scale and duration of each emergence including the specific midge species and the environmental conditions such as rainfall, temperature and water chemistry at time of the emergence. We have just experienced a period of hot weather, with July being the second warmest July recorded since 1929. This unusual hot spell hastened the midges' growth process, resulting in the situation at Pandan Reservoir. With climate change, we will experience more extreme weather, which will have a corresponding response from nature.",3,44,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00044
2019-09-02-T-002,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Midges neither bite nor spread diseases. But they pose a nuisance to the public when they swarm in large numbers and, being weak flyers, get blown by wind into the surrounding residential estates. PUB takes a comprehensive suite of measures to mitigate this nuisance factor as far as is feasible. PUB monitors for midge emergence at reservoirs with known emergence by conducting frequent checks for larvae in samples of reservoir sediments or adult midges trapped around the reservoir vicinity. At Pandan Reservoir, PUB observed an increase in midge larvae since mid-June 2019. PUB kicked in mitigation measures swiftly when the midge emergence began in mid-July 2019.",4,45,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00045
2019-09-02-T-002,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Similar to what I explained to this House previously in 2016, PUB's mitigation measures for midges include increasing the frequency and dosage of the application of biological liquid larvicide within the reservoir to kill midge larvae; and increasing the frequency of fogging and misting around the reservoir dyke and surrounding vegetation to kill adult midges. These methods have been proven to kill midges at the relevant stages of their life cycle. PUB has also installed bright spotlights at the Pandan Reservoir pumping station and turns them on at night to attract the adult midges as they emerge from the reservoir. By keeping the midges within the reservoir area, PUB can then carry out targeted and effective measures such as fogging at these spots.",5,46,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00046
2019-09-02-T-002,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Unlike the midge emergence at Pandan Reservoir in 2016, the current dominant midge species is considered a rare one that has not been studied in great detail. This species exhibits different behaviours from other species. For example, they hide in drains and culverts in the day and swarm above the drains in the evening.",6,47,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00047
2019-09-02-T-002,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"PUB has adapted by adding to the usual suite of measures. They have greased the drain walls to trap the midges when they land to rest and have targeted these areas for fogging. PUB has explored the use of free-moving oily paper within drains to increase the capture rates of adult midges, which have worked very well according to feedback from residents. PUB has also extended the existing 0.5 km of netting on the reservoir dyke by an additional 1 km. This netting acts as a barrier to trap adult midges and reduces the number of adult midges that would otherwise be blown to the residential estate.",7,48,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00048
2019-09-02-T-002,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"PUB has worked closely with West Coast Town Council to engage affected residents through multiple channels such as dialogues, daily walkabouts and distribution of flyers and has advised affected residents on the actions they can take within their premises, such as, switching off their lights when not in use, as midges are attracted to light, as well as installing insect screens at their windows or drawing their curtains, if necessary.",8,49,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00049
2019-09-02-T-002,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"But at the end of the day, we have to recognise that man cannot control nature. Midges cannot be eradicated as they are part of the natural aquatic ecosystem and will emerge to breed, especially when aided by favourable environmental conditions. Climate change, as mentioned, will further complicate our efforts.",9,50,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00050
2019-09-02-T-002,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Our reservoirs supply drinking water to the population and we have to be careful to ensure that – and this is important – PUB's mitigation measures, both short- and long-term, do not end up compromising water quality. However, PUB remains committed to working with the Town Councils and advisors to minimise public inconvenience caused. While PUB will continue to find more effective mitigation measures, we also seek residents' understanding and tolerance, should they find these insects in their homes.",10,51,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00051
2019-09-02-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"I thank the Minister for his response. Before I raise my supplementary questions to the Minister, I would like to thank PUB and Town Council teams for the very very hard work in tackling the mass midge outbreak. Speaker, since July this year, residents living near Pandan Reservoir, have suffered greatly from the mass emergence of midges. Their homes have been invaded by the midges. Corridors, lifts and bus stops have been swamped. Cars, buses, bicycles and motorbikes have been affected. The midges stick to our clothes, really stick to your clothes, your hair, fly around your eyes, get into your nose, get into your food and they are everywhere.",1,52,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00052
2019-09-02-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"This year's outbreak is the most severe we have had witnessed yet and also persisted for the longest time impacting the daily lives of our residents. Some of likened it to being in a horror movie. Seriously, if you have visited, it is really scary. I thank residents who took time to join the dialogue sessions we have organised with PUB on the midge issues, there are some really great ideas that have been shared and I would like to raise some for the Minister's consideration in my supplementary questions.",2,53,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00053
2019-09-02-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Speaker, I have four supplementary questions. First, whilst I appreciate that fogging has been proven to be an effective way to kill adult midges, there are concerns among our residents about the health risk from exposure to chemicals from sustained fogging, particularly, as the outbreak has lasted for an extended period. I would like to ask the Minister if PUB can find more effective fogging method to target midges at the reservoir as they emerge and keep them away from residential areas.",3,54,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00054
2019-09-02-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Second, as the Minister shared, the midges issue cannot be solved or eradicated permanently. I would like to ask the Minister, how can residents be supported with insect screens for their flats as installations of such features are costly as well as other methods that PUB would consider to protect HDB flats and bus stops from the nuisance of midges?",4,55,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00055
2019-09-02-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Third, the most effective way to deal with midges is to eliminate them at source. I know PUB uses biological larvicide, BTI, and using tonnes of it this time, at the reservoir, by injecting the larvicide into the reservoir's sediment. But, you know, despite all that, the problem appears to persists. I get constant questions, that I would like to ask the Minister, how PUB determines the effectiveness of BTI in controlling larva population at the reservoir. How can the injected BTI be expected to zero in on the midge larva given the vast area of the reservoir sediment?",5,56,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00056
2019-09-02-T-002,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Fourth, besides installing nets at the reservoir to serve as barriers to midges flying towards the housing estate, I would like to ask if more trees and shrubs can be added to also serve as barriers and places for the midges to congregate, so that they do not go into people's homes.",6,57,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00057
2019-09-02-T-002,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I thank the Member for the questions. I think this is a great opportunity for us to go back to our biology lessons. Like I mentioned before, this problem is really man versus nature – the kind of war man has never been known to win. Indeed, we can only suppress, we can only do our best, but we have to live with nature. In fact, we are the ones, who are intruding into their living spaces.",1,58,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00058
2019-09-02-T-002,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Specific answers to the question on fogging. The pesticide we use is called Permethrin. This particular pesticide that we use in fogging has undergone WHO's pesticide evaluation scheme and has been certified safe and suitable for use. In addition to using a safe pesticide, we also dilute it, dilute it a lot, so that, in addition to just thinking about killing these pests, we also do not want to harm the workers who are using them. So, they are used in a way, in a frequency that is known and recommended by WHO – safe for human, safe for the operators, as well as for the people that we are trying to help.",2,59,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00059
2019-09-02-T-002,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Secondly, on the insect screens, I think this issue of what you do to help yourself in your home has been well understood. Once you own your property, you own your home, you have to do what you can to protect yourself. Sometimes, we have residents who came to get help, for example, on their leaking pipes or issues which are more pertinent to their own home living conditions. Technically speaking, they should be taking care of these issues, but I think there is no harm, we can see what we can do to help, certainly, from the advisors themselves. We can come together and look at what we can do, because, this situation does not come all the time, not every year. So, to put in something which would become a permanent fixture, this may also affect the kind of image that the reservoir or the places around the reservoir should be. So, I think we have to be very careful about the kind of solutions we want to implement with or for them.",3,60,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00060
2019-09-02-T-002,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"On BTI, the larvicide that we use to put into the water is a safe biological larvicide. It is actually a naturally occurring bacteria – soil bacteria – which produces spores, which are toxic, specifically to the digestive system of midge larvae. As we put in the larvicide, we also monitor the quality of the water. We cannot put so much to kill, just because there are more midges in the river. In the end, the quality of the water gets compromised. So, there is a trade-off between killing enough, or killing too much and we end up killing ourselves. We cannot do that either. There is a limit to which these measures can mitigate the issues that residents are facing.",4,61,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00061
2019-09-02-T-002,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Finally, on trees and shrubs, we can work with NParks to see first, whether these are actually effective ways to prevent the midges coming in. It is a more beautiful way, definitely, than putting screens, but is it an effective way to prevent the midges from coming into people's homes? We do not want to, in the end, create new problems – people having different kind of pests because of the kind of trees that we plant near their homes or around the reservoirs.",5,62,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00062

2019-09-02-T-002,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"I thank the Minister for the clarification. Just one clarification. Part of the problem is climate change and something we cannot alter. I was wondering whether we have looked at ways of changing the micro climate around the reservoirs. Because this only happens in certain reservoirs and I agree that it is because of the water, but there have been some studies that looked at the vegetation and the micro climate around the banks of the reservoirs. Can we look at that?",1,65,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00065

I understand that this is part of nature, but I think for the community that is impacted by that, it is really bad. So, I would like to propose, for the Minister's consideration and collaboration with, maybe, HDB and other agencies – given that this phenomenon cannot be eradicated, in fact, PUB says that this may happen more regularly given the climate change, I think we should really seriously consider helping residents with protection against the nuisance created by midges, whether helping, especially vulnerable families with screens, or HDB nets or definitely in public areas like bus stops, so that it is bearable for people to be in those places to take public transport. So, I urge the Minister to seriously consider this.",1,67,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00067
2019-09-02-T-002,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We will study how we can help residents. We must also take this into consideration for the kinds of things we have to spend, for when we try to tackle bigger issues in years to come, when climate change is upon us. We have not really understood properly how it will affect Singapore. What the Prime Minister has mentioned are only those things that we know can happen and should start working on from now. Issues around pests, are in fact more dangerous and I will mention it in my next Parliamentary Question (PQ) reply, around mosquitoes. They present a more imminent danger than perhaps what midges will present to us, and not to just particular areas around the reservoirs, but in fact, to the whole of Singapore.",1,68,2019-09-02-T-002-S-00068

2019-09-02-T-003,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Thank you. Based on NEA's surveillance, the surge in dengue cases this year is attributable to three key factors – an increase in mosquito population; the relatively warmer weather; and lower herd immunity in our population.",1,77,2019-09-02-T-003-S-00077
2019-09-02-T-003,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"NEA's gravitrap surveillance system has shown an increase in the Aedes aegypti mosquito population by almost three times, since the last major dengue outbreak in 2013. This persistently high Aedes aegypti mosquito population increases the risk of transmission of the dengue virus. In addition, the mean temperature for the first half of this year was 0.7 degrees higher than the same period last year. Warmer temperatures result in higher transmission of dengue due to the accelerated development of the Aedes mosquito and shorter incubation period of the dengue virus. Due to our past successes in dengue prevention, the proportion of adults who have had dengue before has progressively decreased from 59% in 2004, to 51% in 2009, and 41% in 2017. This results, however, in lower herd immunity among our population, and a large proportion of Singapore's resident population remains susceptible to dengue.",2,78,2019-09-02-T-003-S-00078
2019-09-02-T-003,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"NEA, together with agencies in the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force and Town Councils, have stepped up housekeeping measures and inspections of common areas to eliminate potential breeding areas. In the first six months of the year, NEA has conducted more than 442,000 inspections island-wide and uncovered about 8,200 mosquito breeding habitats. Sixty percent of the breeding habitats detected were found in residential premises. If we look at dengue clusters, the proportion of breeding habitats detected in residential premises is even higher at 70%. This points to an urgent need for home and premises owners to step up their efforts to eradicate mosquito breeding habitats. NEA will enforce against premises owners found with mosquito breeding and has taken about 1,200 enforcement actions against households between January and June.",3,79,2019-09-02-T-003-S-00079

Mayors, grassroots advisers, community leaders and dengue prevention volunteers have been visiting homes to share dengue prevention tips, including information on how to identify potential mosquito breeding habitats. To heighten the public's awareness and vigilance against mosquito breeding and dengue, dengue cluster alert banners, posters and notices have also been strategically placed around the estate in dengue cluster areas. Poster walkers have been deployed and dengue prevention advertorials have been displayed at high footfall areas within clusters. NEA has also reached out to the public through TV and radio commercials, as well as digital and social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.",4,80,2019-09-02-T-003-S-00080

The release area covers 84 blocks in Yishun and 60 blocks in Tampines and is 3.7 times larger than the release area when Wolbachia first started. It also focuses on the development of automation for male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito production and release, to ensure scalability of the technology. As field studies require prior systematic design, preparation and historical data for comparison, they are not suited for reacting to current dengue clusters, which are very dynamic.",10,86,2019-09-02-T-003-S-00086

So, even if we carried out more fogging, residents will usually close their windows anyway. Therefore, the best way to prevent dengue from proliferating is to destroy their habitats and most of them are within homes. But do we do fogging? Yes, we can and we must, to kill the adult mosquitoes outside.

I think everyone has to be responsible and accountable to take care of their homes, to make sure they do not breed mosquitoes. When NEA officers and dengue volunteers go in to check their homes, they are trying to help, and also point out where possible breeding habitats could be found; and then, if found, they fine them.

2019-09-02-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"We are accelerating our efforts to develop our tech talent while ensuring that Singaporeans remain at the core of our efforts. The first prong of our talent strategy, ever since we achieved Independence, has been to develop our local workforce. Our people are our most important resource and we spare no effort in nurturing them. In our efforts to widen our tech talent pool, we have been rapidly scaling up our local pipeline of tech professionals. Today, more than 74,000 training places have been taken up or committed under the TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) and this will amount to about one-third of our ICT professionals across the country.",5,106,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00106
2019-09-02-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Our Institutes of Higher Learning offer around 200 full-time tech-related courses today. In Academic Year 2018, there was an enrolment of more than 63,000 locals in these tech-related courses, which received about $1.1 billion in Government funding. We are also investing significantly in building new capabilities such as cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. Together, these efforts will increase our baseline of tech skills and capabilities.",6,107,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00107
2019-09-02-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"As we develop our base, we must also stretch the top of our Singaporean crop. We have connected Singapore to the world to secure frontier opportunities for Singaporeans through programmes such as the Global Innovation Alliance (GIA). The GIA is a global network connecting Singapore to leading innovation eco-systems and key markets around the world. Singaporeans and businesses will be able to gain overseas experience, and connect and collaborate with their overseas counterparts through the GIA.",7,108,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00108
2019-09-02-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"But even these efforts are insufficient because the demand for tech talent is far outstripping the local supply. This is not just a Singapore issue; it is a global challenge. The Straits Times recently reported that recruiting firm Michael Page said that the demand for technology jobs in Singapore rose by 20% in the last 12 months but there is a shortage of supply. Companies have also given our agencies feedback that we lack experienced software engineers and product managers. They are looking for people who can take charge of the development and roll-out of digital products at a global scale, instead of only working on specific components of the product. These are often people that can marry both technical leadership and commercial acumen, manage larger tech teams in the hundreds and thousands, and are highly valued because they are in short supply.",8,109,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00109
2019-09-02-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the reality which we will have to face or we risk diminishing our competitive edge. We need to complement our local pipeline with skilled workers from all around the world to meet the surging demand from companies that are already in Singapore and companies that we want to bring to Singapore. The presence of workers from other countries and nationalities also provides opportunities for Singaporeans to work in globally competitive teams and advance the frontiers of innovation together. In a world where multi-sectoral, cross-discipline and cross-cultural teams are increasingly common, Singaporeans must learn how to work with people from all around the world. This will increase their competitiveness as individual employees and make them more attractive to employers.",9,110,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00110
2019-09-02-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Alibaba, Grab, SAP and Taiger are examples of some companies which have plans to expand significantly in Singapore. Many of these companies have shared that the ability to complement their local workforce with global talent is essential for them to quickly scale their operations in accordance to their plans.",10,111,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00111
2019-09-02-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"This is why we launched Tech@SG to help fast-growth tech companies, both local and foreign, to grow in Singapore. This programme is intended for companies with the commitment and ability to build teams and products in Singapore. They will have to be incorporated in Singapore, have a digital or technology offering or have a business model built around proprietary technologies, research or hardware. Companies would also need to have secured more than US$10 million in Venture Capital (VC) funding cumulatively and have received funding from a Programme-recognised VC in the past 36 months. This will ensure the companies would have sufficient resources and readiness to internationalise and compete.",11,112,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00112

2019-09-02-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"We must be prepared for these fast-growth companies to recruit the skills they most require. In the short term, these skills may come from global professionals. But, we must take a strategic view on this to reap the long-term rewards for Singaporeans. We did so for the semi-conductor industry in the 1960s. At that time, many multinationals in the industry came here and set up their core team which comprised mainly foreigners. Over time, as these companies anchored themselves in Singapore, they began to rapidly grow their local pool of employees. In a span of just three years, the first three semiconductor companies in Singapore – National Semiconductor, Fairchild and Texas Instruments – created more than 7,000 jobs. They have also grown an entire generation of specialists and professionals in this area that enabled the semi-conductor industry of Singapore today.",13,114,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00114
2019-09-02-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Today, we have a similar opportunity to create a vibrant and dynamic tech sector, generating new and exciting job opportunities for yet another generation of Singaporeans – but time is running out.",14,115,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00115
2019-09-02-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"I would like to highlight some examples where we can already see the benefits to Singaporeans. Visenze, an AI and image recognition company founded by four Singaporeans, now hires more than 60 tech professionals to form multinational teams that develop and improve their AI technology. Abel Lim, a recent graduate from NUS' School of Computing, learns about applying machine learning to real-life problems from colleagues in his team who come from around the world. Together, their team makes improvements to Visenze’s algorithms.",15,116,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00116
2019-09-02-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Another example would be Mastercard. Mastercard is an MNC currently spearheading the creation of new digital technologies in payment solutions and smart mobility in Singapore, powered by artificial intelligence. These innovative activities require new capabilities that would need to be built up in the Singapore team. To that end, the company introduced the Mastercard Graduate Programme that offers Singaporean employees a structured programme of rotations, international work experience and mentorship opportunities. These equip them with new skills and allow them to work alongside senior experts from around the world. Seliyan Silvarajoo is one such Singaporean who has undergone this programme. He started out as an intern at Mastercard and is now a senior digital product specialist. Seliyan counts his experience learning from and working with a global and diverse team as critical to preparing him for his role in developing new and exciting products.",16,117,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00117
2019-09-02-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Besides companies like Mastercard and Visenze, we have a good stable of companies like the digital giants Google and Facebook that create good opportunities for Singaporeans.

2019-09-02-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"However, we must not go down the path of other countries who have started to put up barriers and take an inward-looking, protectionist approach, not just to trade but including talent. Doing so, we will only hurt Singapore whose success over the last 54 years has been built on our openness and courage to do what is necessary for our country. To this end, we will continue to do our best for each and every Singaporean while continuously building on our efforts to take Singapore into the next lap with the world as our hinterland for trade and talent.",20,121,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00121
2019-09-02-T-004,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),I thank the Minister for his response and the rationale of Tech@SG. I have three supplementary questions for the Minister.,1,122,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00122
2019-09-02-T-004,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Firstly, whether such companies in the Tech@SG programme will still be subjected to the Fair Consideration Framework as well as the triple-weak scrutiny which the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) by MOM is rolling out.",2,123,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00123
2019-09-02-T-004,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"The second question  whether the agencies concerned – rolling out Tech@SG – considered leveraging on MOM's Capability Transfer Programme to roll out some of these knowledge transfer, skills transfer and capability transfer to Singaporeans?",3,124,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00124
2019-09-02-T-004,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Thirdly, amidst this sense of uncertainty and quite dismal outlook in terms of the employment and job market, I think our focus is on helping, supporting and assisting fellow Singaporeans. I just wonder whether there are controls in place or will there be controls that will be instituted on Tech@SG to make sure that our local PMEs are not compromised or prejudiced against?",4,125,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00125
2019-09-02-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, let me respond to the three questions.",1,126,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00126
2019-09-02-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The answer to the first question is a definite yes. We are working closely with MOM, the Fair Consideration Framework applies to everyone and every firm in Singapore.",2,127,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00127
2019-09-02-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The second question  did we consider the Capability Transfer Programme? Yes, that is one of the various instruments that we use to level up our own professional knowledge. We will continue to do that and where there are opportunities, we will even step up our gear to do that. But having said that, as I have explained, even though we are churning out as many people as we can, as fast as we can, it is still not sufficient to meet the growing demand. We must make sure that we do not miss the boat by losing the professionals, the start-ups and the companies for us to form a critical mass quickly.",3,128,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00128
2019-09-02-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the third point, it is precisely because of the uncertainties with the economic outlook that we have stepped up our gear to make sure that we build the next generation of companies in this sector. At this point in time, I would say that this forms part of our overall surgical measures to help our companies transform and expand their market presence. At this point in time, the average of the economy may be about 0% to 1% percent growth but that does not mean that every sector is between 0% and 1% percent growth. We know that the current numbers are dragged down by the global electronics downturn, the wholesale and retail trade, and some of the precision engineering sectors.",4,129,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00129
2019-09-02-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the other hand, our economy is growing well in the financial services, the ICT and many of the high-tech industries. This is why we must make sure that while we try to lift the bottom, we must never cap the top. We must make sure that we can do all we can to help those companies that are growing the fastest at this point in time, suffering from the global shortage of tech talent, including many of our ICTs and AI companies, to make sure that the Tech@SG programme will give them the best chance possible to succeed and will not make them lose out to other companies from other countries who are competing for the global talent at this point in time.",5,130,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00130
2019-09-02-T-004,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"I would like to ask the Minister for a clarification. Now, we are doing Tech@SG for the tech sector. Will MTI consider or is it in the works to considering other sectors as well? Because it is not just the ICT sector that needs foreign expertise or even data analytics, data science expertise; it could be the financial sector or many other professional services, and all these contribute quite significantly this year and, moving forward, to the economic growth of Singapore.",1,131,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00131
2019-09-02-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The answer is yes. We are open to considering how we can work with the other sectors who are short of these talent at the global level. But I want to clarify. We are not talking about S Pass holders, we are not even talking about the average EP holders. We are talking about people who can manage programmers by the hundreds and thousands. These are the people who know and have the expertise to manage global teams of the hundreds and thousands of people, and these are in critical shortage.",1,132,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00132
2019-09-02-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Just to put in context how tough this competition is – China, the most populous country in the world, even China has a 千人计划 to attract the best from around the world to go back to China and help. If China, France and Thailand are all doing this, we can understand how critically short we are at the global level. So, while everybody is trying to churn out as many as they possibly can within the time, everyone is also fighting for the available talent at this point in time.",2,133,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00133
2019-09-02-T-004,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Just one supplementary question for the Minister. A few years ago, there was an initiative to increase the number of Singaporeans or work towards increasing the number of Singaporeans in leadership positions in the financial sector. Is there a similar parallel initiative that the Government has in mind for Tech@SG? I think the Minister raised some numbers about the number of students in our Institutions of Higher Learning. But more upstream, in terms of taking on roles, since this is a long runway that we are looking at, does the Government have any plans in that regard?",1,134,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00134
2019-09-02-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I thank Mr Pritam Singh for raising the financial sector. In fact, that is a very good example of how we do business. When we grew our financial sector, there will obviously be areas where we initially lack the expertise. We brought in people and experts who are globally attuned and have the exposure. Over time, we progressively make sure that those expertise is localised and we have achieved much in the financial sector, under the leadership of MAS. We will continue to do this because we will never stay static and we will never say that we have done enough to get our locals into the top leadership positions.",1,135,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00135
2019-09-02-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"This is exactly the same spirit that we intend to do for all the new sectors. That is why, just now, in answering Mr Patrick Tay's question, I talked about the Fair Consideration Framework – what Mr Patrick Tay called the ""triple-weak"". We want to make sure that every company, as they grow, are conscious of their responsibility to localise the talent and also to build up the capabilities within Singapore. That is how, progressively, we are not shy to learn from the best in the world. But as we learn from the best in the world, we want to make sure that our people have the best opportunities to learn from them, acquire those skills and maybe even go beyond. This must continue to be the Singapore way. This was how we built up the semi-conductor industry in the 1960s and 1970s and that will not change.",2,136,2019-09-02-T-004-S-00136

2019-09-02-T-005,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,asked the Minister for Education with regard to the application of the PSLE scoring system to those students exempt from studying Mother Tongue Languages (a) what are the guiding principles to determine which Achievement Level (AL) the student will score; and (b) whether there is an assessment of how the new scoring system will impact students with learning disabilities or special needs.,1,140,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00140
2019-09-02-T-005,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng,asked the Minister for Education (a) what is the rationale and principle behind according a student an exemption from Mother Tongue Language (MTL) in national exams; and (b) whether this principle aligns with the new PSLE scoring system for MTL exemption.,1,141,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00141
2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister of Education),"Mr Speaker, may I take Questions 14 to 18 together?",1,142,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00142

2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Today, more than 95% of our students take the MTL examination at the PSLE, at either the Standard or Foundation level. This reflects the centrality of MTL learning in our education system. Learning the MTLs allows us to connect with our communities, and draws on our rich ethnic heritage and culture to build our unique Singapore identity.",1,144,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00144
2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"At the same time, we recognise that for a small group of students, such as those with special educational needs (SEN) or who have been away from Singapore for prolonged periods, it may be challenging for them to study one of our MTLs. Hence, upon application, we may grant them exemption from MTL. However, there are many students with SEN or who have been away and who still take MTL, notwithstanding the difficulties they encounter.",2,145,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00145
2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"In any given year, on average, about 4.5% of our students are exempted from MTL. This group of students will take three examinations at the PSLE – English, Mathematics, and Science. Hence, they will receive only three subject scores on their results slip. The question then is how to use these scores for posting to the next course of study, given that the vast majority of their peers have a score summed up from all four subjects.",3,146,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00146
2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"That is why for purposes of posting, we assign an MTL score for these students by referencing the MTL scores of other students with similar English, Maths and Science scores, including those offering Foundation MTL. This basic approach will not change when we move from the T-score system to the new Achievement Level (AL) scoring system in 2021.",4,147,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00147
2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Ms Denise Phua asked about the underlying principles of this practice. The new AL scoring system is based on the level of attainment by the student himself, and moves us away from the approach of the T-score system where a student has to outperform his peers to register a high score. However, when it comes to Secondary school posting, the student still needs to use his PSLE score to compete with other students in order to be admitted into a school of his choice.",5,148,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00148
2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Our treatment of students exempted from MTL is aligned with these principles. For purposes of deriving AL scores, he was exempted from MTL, so no assessment of his standards took place and he has no score. But for the purposes of Secondary school posting, he needs to be compared with other applicants and so we will assign him an MTL score by referencing his peers.",6,149,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00149
2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"We can and must strike a balance between competition amongst students and self-mastery, but realistically, we cannot remove competition totally, and it is also not a reflection of the real life that we are preparing students for.",7,150,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00150
2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,What is specific to the AL system is that the assigned MTL score will range from AL6 to AL8.

2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"This includes a significant number with SEN or those who have returned to Singapore after prolonged periods overseas. Currently, about 90% of our Returning Singaporean students study an official MTL, with our schools providing support for their language learning. Seventy percent of students with SEN in mainstream schools also take MTL at PSLE. Many of them take Foundation MTL. As the score range for those taking Foundation MTL is AL6 to AL8, it would be difficult to justify to those offering it why another student who did not sit for the examination could be assigned a higher score.",9,152,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00152
2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Ms Denise Phua asked about the implications of the new scoring system on course eligibility and school choices.

2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Our simulations using the most recent PSLE results show that a similar proportion of students with SEN and are exempted from MTL, would qualify for the Express course under both scoring systems. In any case, by 2024, Express and Normal streams will be phased out. In terms of school choices, if we held choice patterns constant, about 60% of them would secure their first choice Secondary school, under both scoring systems.",11,154,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00154
2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"For those concerned about the chances of success to be admitted into specific Secondary schools, we have over the past few years, significantly expanded places in the Direct School Admission (DSA) pathway to better recognise talents and achievements across different domains beyond general academic abilities. Most schools can now admit 20% of their Secondary 1 intake via DSA, up from 10% in 2017, and many schools have yet to reach this proportion.",12,155,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00155
2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Schools are also admitting more students with different strengths and backgrounds, including those with SEN. For example, we see students with SEN who are talented in Mathematics, Science, sports and performing arts, and admitted via DSA into the schools of their choices. MOE and schools will support existing MTL-exempt students affected by the new scoring system in their transition by providing advice on their school choices, and to also explore DSA as an option.",13,156,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00156
2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"We also recognise that our students with SEN put in tremendous effort to cope with their learning. MOE has increased the resources to help students in SPED schools, and students with SEN in mainstream schools will also benefit from learning support programmes as well as allied educators for learning and behavioural support. MOE is committed to continue working with schools in providing the support needed to prepare our students for the PSLE changes.",14,157,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00157
2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Members also asked if we could delay the implementation of the scoring changes for current cohorts or consider an alternative PSLE scoring system for students with SEN. Given that we are changing the national examination scoring system, it would not be feasible for a small group to remain under the T-score system or to use an aggregate score of three scores, as their scores would not be comparable with the aggregate scores of other students for purposes of Secondary school posting.",15,158,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00158
2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Ultimately, in grading, scores have to reflect standards, instead of effort or circumstances. Those are relevant factors, but we should exercise that judgement during admission mechanisms like the DSA, instead of compromising the consistency and integrity of the assessment and grading system.",16,159,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00159
2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Speaker, performance at the PSLE is just one checkpoint in a child's education journey and it is not the final judgement of a child's ability or potential. The changes to the PSLE scoring, expansion of DSA and journey to Full Subject-Based Banding (SBB) aim to shift our education system away from an over-emphasis on academic results and encourage our students to focus on their own learning. Fundamentally, we want an education system with multiple pathways and opportunities, so that every child can maximise his or her potential and be placed in good stead for the future.",17,160,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00160
2019-09-02-T-005,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Ms Denise Phua.,1,161,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00161
2019-09-02-T-005,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),I thank the Second Minister for the comprehensive response. I totally understand the importance of MTL and that requests and approvals for exemption of Mother Tongue studies must not be taken lightly.,1,162,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00162
2019-09-02-T-005,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"But for students who are medically certified with special education needs (SEN) and especially those in special schools taking the PSLE, those who are visually impaired, those who are deaf or autistic SPED students, the PSLE score is the main currency by which they are admitted – they have a chance to go to a mainstream Secondary school and education. Cut-off points is still what many Secondary mainstream schools use to admit these students unless one is exceptional enough to qualify for Direct School Admission (DSA). And, hence, there are genuine concerns by the families and parents of these students. So, I have two supplementary questions to ask.",2,163,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00163
2019-09-02-T-005,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"One, to ask the Minister that if the reason for exemption is valid, is medical, then will MOE consider an exemption as an exemption with no conditions attached? To the layman, the definition of exemption is that it is not conditional and therefore, there is no excitement of the lower score if you are exempted. And there are some who actually fear that the students are further disadvantaged by putting them back into a pool after recognising and after all the good work that MOE has done for SEN, that by now putting these students back into the pool to compete with the rest of the others. So, that is one – can an exemption be an exemption with no conditions attached?",3,164,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00164
2019-09-02-T-005,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"The second is to do with informed choices. So, for those who are currently already in the Primary 1 to Primary 4 cohorts, so-called, in-flight, the families had not made informed decisions at the time when they appealed for Mother Tongue exemption or language studies exemption, whether under the old or the new system now. So, would MOE please consider delaying the implementation for this group and grandfathering the current P1s to P4s, start the new system preferably full and not conditional exemption from the 2020 Primary 1 cohort onwards. I know these are deep issues and that MOE has done a lot of thinking about this. But I ask you not to say ""no"" to me first but to take the time to consider these several options and let us work together to see what is the best balance decision for this group.",4,165,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00165
2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"I thank the Member for her questions and, in fact, I think the Member has reflected the concerns of parents who are genuinely worried about their children especially those with special education needs. Perhaps, what I can do is put it in perspective and give the reassurance to those parents that even under the new system, their children will be treated fairly. And let me just outline and explain it.",1,166,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00166
2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"I will take the second question first because Ms Phua asked whether those who are already in-flight might have chosen otherwise if they had known about this, and whether the current system can remain in place for them so that only the new cohorts coming in for Primary school will be under the new system.",2,167,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00167
2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The thing is this  the new PSLE AL scoring system will come into effect for the PSLE cohort in 2021. So, the students with SEN who are exempted and who are taking PSLE in 2021, they too, as part of that cohort, will need to be posted to a Secondary school. When you post, the posting has to be done in comparison with other students. So, all the students in that cohort will be posted under an AL system and you cannot remain under a T-score system. It is not possible to do comparison or to delay it. And that is the reason why you have to do it together. But recognising that you have to do it together, then this is the thought process that MOE went through and we hope that the parents will see that this does not actually disadvantage their children.",3,168,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00168
2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The first thing to remember is that actually, more than 95% of our students take MTL. It is 4.5% who are exempted, out of which about 3% includes those who have SEN. Then, out of the ones who have SEN in the mainstream schools, as I mentioned earlier, 70% actually do take MTL at PSLE. So, the ones who are exempted are actually a very small percentage. And for the SEN students who take MTL at PSLE, about 40% of them offer Standard MTL and 30% offer Foundation MTL. So, there is actually already a very large group of students with SEN who do MTL and they compare together with the others.",4,169,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00169
2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Then, for those who are exempted, I think Ms Phua asked  can an exemption be an exemption? The exemption is an exemption because if we followed the existing rule, what it would mean is that the student who, for medical reasons or otherwise, if you held very strictly to the rule, it would mean that that student has to take MTL. And we have given the exemption in recognition of the fact that such students may, because of SEN or for medical reasons, have great difficulty in coping with MTL and, therefore, have been exempted. So, an exemption is given and they do not have to do MTL.",5,170,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00170
2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"But the difficulty comes, as I explained, with posting, because with posting, it is necessary to see how that child compares with other children. And, if you apply it very strictly, then given that you did not take MTL, the correct score should actually be zero, meaning that you have the worst possible score, and we did not want to do that. So, to be fair, we have to assign a score, and we do that by taking reference from their peers, including those who take Foundation MTL.",6,171,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00171
2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, actually, the range of scores for those who take Foundation MTL, by and large, falls within AL6 to AL8. And AL6 is actually not a low score. It translates to up to 64 marks. So, do not be mistaken  AL6 is not a low score and it is still possible for these children to be able to get a place in the Express stream. Receiving an AL6 for the fourth subject does not automatically disqualify a student from accessing a particular course or his first choice Secondary school. For example, a student obtaining two AL5s and two AL6s will get a PSLE score of 22 and will still be eligible for the Express/Normal (Academic) option band.",7,172,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00172
2019-09-02-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, when we did the simulations, they indicate that, by and large, whether under the current system or whether under the new system, a similar proportion of all MTL-exempt students will be able to qualify for Express or the Express/Normal (Academic) option band and that is about 40% of these students. So, by and large, it would not be very different. Even now, you do have to assign them a score because there are MTL-exempt students today. I think at the end of the day, the key thing for the parents to ask is  some parents may be concerned about their children who do very well. They may get one for English; one for Mathematics; one for Science and then you get six for your MTL. You are well within the Express range. So, for those who are at the margins, when it comes to the choice of a particular school, there is always the DSA option. And I would ask, at the end of the day, for the parents to work with the teachers to consider what is the best thing for the child because we do want the best pathway, the best option for the child and especially children with SEN. That, MOE will certainly not compromise on because we want to make sure that whichever path they take, they have good opportunities in order to be able to achieve their aspirations.",8,173,2019-09-02-T-005-S-00173

We recognise that being severely disabled can be a stressful situation for policyholders and their care-givers. Hence, we want to make the claim process more convenient. To this end, we plan to double the number of disability assessors to about 300 by the launch of CareShield Life, and we are working with healthcare institutions to progressively expand the types of disability assessments that can be accepted for claims, so that policyholders need not undergo another disability assessment if we already have similar data on their disability status.",34,214,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00214
2019-09-02-T-008,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"To further provide convenience to policyholders, Part 8 of the Bill will enable CPF Board and AIC to access an individual’s disability-related health information and allow the information to be disclosed to authorised persons approved by the Minister, for the administration of prescribed public schemes, or provision of support to disabled persons for prescribed purposes. These provisions allow us to proactively reach out to disabled individuals to inform them of their eligibility for claims, not just for CareShield Life and ElderShield, but also for other Government disability schemes, using disability assessments already performed at our healthcare institutions.",35,215,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00215
2019-09-02-T-008,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),These provisions also allow us to access and use disability assessments already done at healthcare institutions to assess the eligibility of those born between 1970 and 1979 for the auto-enrolment exercise into CareShield Life without having to get them to be assessed again.,36,216,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00216
2019-09-02-T-008,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Nonetheless, individuals can opt-out from the access and disclosure of such disability-related health information, and we will release more details on how individuals can do so nearer the launch date. But I should point out that if they do so, if they do opt out of the access and disclosure, they will lose some convenience. For example, severely disabled individuals will not receive any proactive outreach to apply for claims because we do not know their disability status, and they may need to go for a separate disability assessment even if they had been assessed for disability recently at a healthcare institution. In addition, individuals born between 1970 and 1979 will not be auto-enrolled and may need to go for a disability assessment in order to join CareShield Life.",37,217,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00217

2019-09-02-T-008,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Mr Speaker, another key feature of CareShield Life and ElderShield is that payouts will be in cash. This gives claimants the flexibility to decide on their preferred care arrangement, so that they can remain at home or in the community if they wish and still receive the cash payouts. However, it is important that these cash payouts are safeguarded. We will balance between such flexibility and the need for safeguards in several ways.",41,221,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00221
2019-09-02-T-008,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"First, some severely disabled policyholders may lack mental capacity and are unable to manage their cash payouts, or even apply for claims in the first place.

Not doing so without reasonable excuse is an offence. If convicted, the penalty is double that for the offence of false declarations or wrongful access of information under clause 48 of the Bill, given that these are offences against vulnerable persons. This ensures that payouts are prioritised for the care of the policyholder.",46,226,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00226
2019-09-02-T-008,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Further, we will protect the payouts from creditors. Clause 20 of the Bill protects CareShield Life and ElderShield payouts from creditors, with two tight exceptions. First, the Bill allows premium debt to be netted off from the payouts, and we will use this only in the case of wilful defaulters who do not pay CareShield Life premiums, but have made claims to benefit from the Scheme. We will do so in a calibrated manner and will cap the amount of debt netted off from the payouts each month to ensure that policyholders will continue to receive the bulk of the payouts to meet their long-term care needs. The second case is where there are monies owed by the policyholder to a healthcare institution, for instance, a nursing home, arising from the care provided to the policyholder, if the policyholder or authorised applicant has already directed the payouts to this institution. This ensures that healthcare institutions providing care to the policyholder can continue to be adequately resourced to do so.",47,227,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00227

There will be means-tested premiums subsidies of up to 30% to help lower to middle-income Singaporeans with their premiums. Transitional subsidies will be given to Singapore Citizens born in 1980 or later for the first five years from CareShield Life’s commencement to ease their transition into the Scheme. For Singapore Citizens born in 1979 or earlier, they will be given participation incentives of up to $2,500, if they join CareShield Life in the first two years after the Scheme is available for sign-ups from mid-2021. This is to encourage early participation in the Scheme. In addition, seniors from the Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation will receive additional participation incentives of $1,500, so that they receive a total of $4,000 in participation incentives. The participation incentives will be netted off their premiums payable over a period of 10 years, thereby reducing the amount of premiums that the policyholders will need to pay.",50,230,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00230

To be fair to the other policyholders, we need to take a strict stance against these wilful defaulters. Therefore, Part 7 of the Bill provides for a premium recovery framework that is similar to the approach for MediShield Life. Penalties and interest can be imposed on outstanding premiums, and we intend to similarly appoint IRAS as a recovery body to recover outstanding premiums.

So, just to repeat, the support fund holds the Government funding to help the Scheme through premium subsidies and so on, whereas the insurance fund holds the monies from premium payments which is used to fund payouts from the schemes.

CareShield Life is a major step in expanding the role of insurance in the long-term care financing landscape. But the CareShield Life and Long-Term Care Bill goes beyond long-term care insurance. The Bill also enables enhancements to be made to the other two pillars of our long-term care financing system through the withdrawal of MediSave for long-term care and ElderFund.

2019-09-02-T-008,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"In concluding, I would like to ask the Ministry to what degree information will be released to the public regarding the administration of CareShield Life, and whether the Ministry would be transparent about how the fund is managed and how the premiums are priced and how payouts are disbursed. For instance, in the early years of ElderShield, it was found that claims were in fact below what was essentially projected, and rebates were, of course, duly given back to policyholders as a result. This should certainly be happy news to policyholders at that time, but it also led to questions about whether the premiums and calculations were in fact overly conservative, and secondarily, whether this could have led to excessive profits gained by the private insurers who were then underwriting the scheme.",20,272,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00272
2019-09-02-T-008,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),I look forward to the clarifications from the Ministry and I support the Bill.,21,273,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00273

This fund will ensure that the CareShield life premiums will be affordable for the majority.

2019-09-02-T-008,Lily Neo,Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar),"One, the monthly payout of $600 is inadequate for severely handicapped individuals in long-term care basic costs. While I can understand that higher payout will require higher premiums, the purpose of insurance is to give peace of mind on future unforeseen needs. In view of its inadequacy, there is a need to depend on personal savings or family help should the need arises. For better piece of mind and coverage, individuals can take extra insurance for higher payouts with private insurers. May I ask Minister whether Government can administer these ""riders"" for those who want better payouts, rather than dependence on profit-orientated private insurers?",8,281,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00281

While I agree that there will be a lot more claimants with two ADLs instead of three ADLs, thus resulting in higher premiums, my contention is that many, if not all, afflicted with two ADLs cannot continue to work as before. They would need to depend on personal savings or family members. Thus, better awareness on long-term care financing and long-term care insurance should be raised so that people can better plan ahead for possible eventualities.",13,286,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00286

May I how many of such assessors are available presently and how many more will be required going forward? May I ask how often are claimants required to go through assessments to enjoy confirmed payouts? Will Minister exempt those newly discharged from hospitals from assessment by stipulated assessors once specified by their own public hospital doctors to be having three ADLs? Can public doctors looking after their own patients endorse the three ADLs, since they know their patients well? This will greatly convenience the claimants.",14,287,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00287

The reason is that many Singaporeans do not know the various schemes available or how to apply for them. This is especially useful and convenient for those low-income patients who are already applying Medifund to pay for their hospital bills. They have already given all the eligibility information to hospitals for Medifund assistance.",15,288,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00288

2019-09-02-T-008,Lily Neo,Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar),"Sir, many Singaporeans shared that they would prefer to live at home with their families as they grow old. Home care is an important component of Long-Term Care services. It is a good alternative to institutional care setting for many reasons. But our home care in Singapore is presently inadequate. This is worrying with our fast-ageing population and the fast increasing need of home care. May I ask Minister how does he plan to expand and better equip on the availability of home care?",17,290,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00290

This number may increase in future. Could Minister expand home care quickly with the tenets of prevention of further deterioration of physical frailty and mental disorder such as depression? Ageing Gracefully at Home programme at Chin Swee supported by Agency of Integrated Care (AIC) is a good home care programme.

2019-09-02-T-008,Lily Neo,Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar),We also need to expand other home care programmes for complex long-term care needs in the community.

Such case by case basis assessment at the sole discretion of the Minister does not provide any assurance that CareShield Life is going to be inclusive for Singaporeans who need the basic protection most. And what about Singaporeans who are unable to do one or two out of three ADLs currently? Would they be able to enrol into CareShield Life or be assisted by Elderfund only as highlighted by the Minister earlier?",6,299,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00299

2019-09-02-T-008,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The affordability of CareShield Life needs to be considered in context with MediShield Life, since both schemes are made compulsory for Singaporeans.

2019-09-02-T-008,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"On the same issue of affordability, may I ask the Minister again, are the premium calculations for CareShield Life heavily influenced by the MOH estimates that one in two Singaporeans aged 65 and above could become severely disabled in their lifetime? If we were to strip away the international data from the MOH estimates, how would the percentage look like?",11,304,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00304

Would the Minister not agree that, using data that may not even trigger a claim under the proposed scheme to help calculate the corresponding premium to pay for an insured person would not be meaningful to begin with?",12,305,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00305

The Senior Minister of State had mentioned some of these factors in passing his speech on the subject last year. Factors such as the disability mortality rate, recovery rate, disability incidence and risk profile for various cohorts, to name a few, are important information for the public, not just to determine whether Singaporeans are being charged baseline premiums or way above it, but to spur them to make informed choices to live healthy.",13,306,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00306
2019-09-02-T-008,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Mr Speaker, this Government should also see considerable savings in the administration cost for CareShield Life when it takes over the respective pool of insured persons from the three private ElderShield insurers. What is the projected savings from this exercise and did the Ministry work this savings into the premium calculations? And what would be the projected profit and loss for the CareShield Life scheme under the sole administration of the CPF Board assisted by AIC?",14,307,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00307
2019-09-02-T-008,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Although this is a not-for-profit insurance scheme, it does not mean that there is no profit generated. I am sure the Ministry would have crunched the numbers in the run-up to the introduction of CareShield Life. It is in the public interest that the Ministry should release such information. I am also sure that the Ministry can easily illustrate the technical details of the actuarial model for CareShield Life in simple graphics or something easy for the general public to digest.",15,308,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00308

2019-09-02-T-008,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Firstly, starting off with a fundamental question. The CareShield Life Scheme, which is a migration from the ElderShield, is compulsory for all citizens and PRs of Singapore born on or after 1 January 1980 and are at least 30 years of age. Can the Minister explain on the decision and rationale for the cut off at 30 years? There is because, with ElderShield, we earlier saw that it started at 40 years. This is a difference of 10 years and it would be useful for us to understand the difference of 10 years and why we are starting a lot earlier with CareShield Life. From a medical perspective, I can certainly understand that, but, perhaps, maybe from a financial perspective and an administrative perspective, we can get a better understanding of this.",5,313,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00313
2019-09-02-T-008,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Secondly, what happens with a person who is eligible for CareShield Life but lives or works long-term overseas? What type of processes do they have to go through? Can the Minister also outline the steps and requirements for those who are alone and in nursing homes and for those with no next-of-kin support? Pertaining to the disability assessment, on what grounds can the assessment fees be waived? Are there steps or application forms, that the applicants will have to pay for such waiver? Please also review the process and make sure that it is simple enough because many of them can be illiterate or they may not be able to understand what is being asked. They may not even have next-of-kin.",6,314,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00314

2019-09-02-T-008,Fatimah Lateef,Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"The Minister did mention that we can have data obtained from our healthcare institutions for those people who need regular reviews, but then, again, is this sufficient or would they have to pay every time they need to have an assessment done by one of the appointed assessors?

We know that for people who have very severe psychological or psychiatric problems, they may not even be able to perform their activities of daily living (ADL).

Perhaps, I would like to urge the Ministry to consider, even for people who have less than three, perhaps two activities of daily living (ADL) that they cannot fulfil, perhaps, we can give them a case-by-case consideration because, in considering ADL, it is a spectrum. It can be from the most minor to the more severe.

How long is this amount expected to last to meet the needs of Singaporeans? On that note, I support this Bill.",18,326,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00326
2019-09-02-T-008,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"Mr Speaker, I stand in support of the Bill. When a friend of mine turned 40, she received a letter informing about the ElderShield scheme. She shared some thoughts that crossed her mind when she first saw the letter. Soon, CareShield Life (CSHL) scheme will be compulsory for those turning 30. I can imagine what many at that age would be thinking as they read the collaterals. Why the need for such scheme at this age? They are healthy, have an active income and ageing is certainly a distant concept for them. But, what many fail to think of is health issues can take many forms and impact anyone regardless of age, in particular, when one suffers disabilities as a result of illness or become mentally incapacitated. The real challenge is what happens if one is not financially prepared or does not have the means to take care of themselves in the long term. This burden inevitably falls on the family and not on themselves.",1,327,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00327
2019-09-02-T-008,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"Take dementia as a classic example. Dementia does not impact only the elderly. One can be physically normal, not disabled, but simply fails to get about their daily activities once dementia sets in. I came across a resident who, unfortunately, suffered dementia at the age of 52. Fifty-two years old in today's context is not old age, especially not so given the longer life expectancy. However, this resident who had dementia will have to depend on another person to manage his daily activities for the rest of his life. Having to care for him not only raise concerns about the cost of care on the long run, but also whom in the family would become the primary care-giver from then on.",2,328,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00328

Parents that I met with children of special needs are genuinely concerned. The parents are worried that if they themselves grow older, physically and financially taking care of their children will become a significant task. It is a worry they grapple with constantly. What more can they do to have a peace of mind that their children will not be left to fend for themselves when they are unable to care for them in the long run. Thus, I believe the CareShield Life and Long-Term Care fund will play a pivotal role in bridging at least some aspects of the care-giving.",3,329,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00329

2019-09-02-T-008,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"First, for those who are automatically covered under CareShield Life from 2021 onwards, is there a concurrent requirement for them to also apply for the Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA)? Whilst the financial aspect of their care-giving may be taken care of through CareShield Life, but if they do not have an LPA in place, in the event that they become unable to make decisions for themselves, there presents a risk that their family members will have to fork out additional legal fees to act on their behalf. While clause 16 provides option for the family members to act on their behalf if a donee or a deputy is not in place, but would it not be better if they have a LPA from the onset of joining the scheme? This would mean less likely a potential lapse in their coverage if the family is unable to afford the legal fees.",5,331,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00331

I would like to ask if the Ministry can consider including coverage for all individuals in this age group, who by birth, have physical disability and/or lack the mental capacity to function in their daily activities. This group of individuals in Singapore are not the bulk of the population. However, a universal insurance coverage of this nature will form a necessary and central support for them and, financially, it is more manageable for their families.",6,332,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00332

This Bill addresses several aspects and clause 50 seeks to focus on preventing the misuse of funds. However, clause 20 does indemnify the healthcare institutions or service providers to those with disabilities, wherein they can have access to their patients' funds after providing the service. On this note, I hope more clarity can be offered if any audit process will be instituted to verify the sums charged by the healthcare institutions or service providers are within affordable range.

This kind of transparency will ensure greater public buy-in by providing some assurance that premiums have not been set at too high a level that will tend to over reserve funds that may either need to be disbursed by way of future premium rebates or which may be retained for the benefit of future cohorts.

2019-09-02-T-008,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Firstly, holders of ElderShield supplements will continue to be served by their existing ElderShield supplement insurers. Does the Government envisage that a competitive CareShield LIfe supplement scheme market will emerge providing competitive premiums and supplements in exchange for higher or less onerously determined payouts? And, if so, are there any steps being taken to facilitate this?",12,350,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00350
2019-09-02-T-008,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Secondly, clause 15 states that in the event of premium rebates been given, refunds for grant will be recovered. Just to clarify the mechanism for this – does this mean that if the state has provided the grant to reduce the premium and future premium rebate is given to that CareShield Life policyholder, the grant plus interest will be deducted from the premium rebate and returned to the Long-term Care Fund?",13,351,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00351
2019-09-02-T-008,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"And, lastly, because the changes to this Bill concretise the optimum effects of our ageing society, we should work towards the creation of a vibrant eco-system that supports many different pathways for the rising number of Singaporeans embarking on their ageing journey. In the past, the mantra for ageing was that the family members should take care of their elderly, but with our demographic pyramid looking the way it does now, where the ratio of younger people supporting elderly people in more or less every family is much lower than it was, say, 30 years ago, it is no longer possible to view the question of an ageing society solely through the prism of family responsibility alone.",14,352,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00352
2019-09-02-T-008,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"What would such a vibrant eco-system look like? It should, of course, include employment for those who want to continue to work. This group has the right to employment opportunities unscarred by the stigma of ageism. And it should include social support for high levels of activity and social engagement for all older Singaporeans, whether working or not. The eco-system we strive for should include strong capacity for institutionalised care in nursing homes and step-down care facilities to provide care at harmonised and high levels of quality, not to mention elder-friendly facilities in existing and new HDB flats where some progress has been made. It should include pathways for ageing in place – home-care and day-care should be widely available geographically, with a variety of providers offering an environment that is competitive and rich in variety and experimentation.",15,353,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00353

2019-09-02-T-008,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"How does the system living differ from nursing homes? Please allow me to quote a short passage from Atul Gawande's moving book ""Being Mortal"", where he talked about one of the founders of assisted living Keren Brown Wilson in the US state of Oregon in 1980 in a concept she championed. I quote, ""The services were in most ways identical to the services that nursing homes provide, but here the care-providers understood they were entering someone else's home and that changed the power relations fundamentally. Her philosophy was to provide a place where residents retained their autonomy and privacy of people living in their own homes including the right to refuse strictures imposed for reasons of safety or institutional convenience.""",17,355,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00355
2019-09-02-T-008,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"For all pathways, financial assistance should be available that is means-tested and also automatically inflation-indexed based on inflation trends and fiscal resources. Facilities catering to a range of budget should be nurtured. The Korean Silver Town model, which I have spoken about in this House, includes a range of facilities, offering different prices and the different degrees of government support from government-run facilities to purely private profit-driven facilities. The facilities in such an eco-system should be provided by companies, not-for-profit VWOs and where necessary government agencies. Not all Eldercare services should be provided by or paid for by the government.",18,356,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00356
2019-09-02-T-008,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Where fiscal cost is required, it should be seen in the context of not providing such assistance. It could lead to elderly people living alone, becoming cut-off and gaining access to medical services only when it is too late when catastrophic conditions set in, for example. And this could have amount to a far greater drain on the state's coffers downstream in terms of hospital subsidies, MediShield Life, premium subsidies, Medifund disbursements and so on.",19,357,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00357
2019-09-02-T-008,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The cost of providing financial assistance should also be seen in the context of the opportunity cost of not providing it. If older Singaporeans lack help to age with purpose and dignity, we could lose out in the vital role of elderly Singaporeans as contributors to the workforce and to the economy as employees, entrepreneurs and customers. Let us not forget the significance of older Singaporeans as role models, mentors, counsellors and care-givers, even when not working. When elderly Singaporeans cannot afford to leave the house because he or she cannot afford a mobility device, for example, he may be unable to work, he may be unable to be a customer for a neighbourhood business, he may be unable to help his family.",20,358,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00358

2019-09-02-T-008,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Having said this, I have a few questions and suggestions regarding our whole-of-society approach towards successful ageing, that is of indirect but nevertheless unmistakable relevance to the concerns that underlie this Bill.",22,360,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00360
2019-09-02-T-008,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Firstly, what is the progress towards launching assisted living facilities? It seems that other countries are far ahead of Singapore in this respect to the concept dates back to the 1980s. During the COS Debate this year, Minister Lawrence Wong said ""typically, in such assisted living apartments, there will be more communal and shared spaces for residents to interact with each other. As the assisted living model is new, we will conduct focus group discussions to seek views on the proposed concept for assisted living in public housing. We will take in feedback and views from the discussions and I am sure seniors will welcome such an option where the model will be sustainable for the service providers. We will work towards a launch for an assisted living pilot site for public housing in Bukit Batok next year.""",23,361,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00361
2019-09-02-T-008,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Sir, the assisted living model is new to Singapore but far from new abroad. In advanced countries like Finland and Japan, assisted living facilities (ALFs) are growing faster than nursing homes. A 2016 survey by the Lien Foundation and Income found that nearly 50% of almost 1,000 respondents were willing to stay in ALFs. I would urge the Government to accelerate the launch of new sites. Assisted living at its best and to be sure not existing ALFs in the world present that best, by any means, but at its best, assisted living promises to marry autonomy with good quality medical care and social connectedness. It could be a key pillar for successful ageing. In building this pillar, we have the opportunity to work with local enterprises and start-ups to develop know-how in operating ALFs in the Southeast Asian cultural context. Know-how that could be exported to the region in future – where ageing is a major challenge in countries like Thailand and Malaysia – to the benefit of our economy.",24,362,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00362

In fact, productivity is a key challenge for this traditionally labour-intensive sector. Social robotics, wearable technology and other innovations are being used in the eldercare sector globally including in some countries in the region like Japan, Korea and China. What efforts are being made by the Government and non-governmental players to study these innovations and aim to bring them to Singapore by way of engagement with companies and not-for-profits, both at home and abroad.",25,363,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00363
2019-09-02-T-008,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1994, Prof William Kissick defined the set of three trade-offs that any health care system faces  cost, access and quality. We all want a health system that is low-cost, grants timely access to all who need care and ensures that healthcare is of high quality. But all three at once is impossible to achieve, so we need to choose between difficult trade-offs.",1,364,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00364
2019-09-02-T-008,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"We have, by international standards, solved the health system problem better than most. In 2000, the World Health Organization ranked Singapore sixth in the world in overall health system performance. Because this ranking was so controversial – the United States ranked 37th behind all the Western European countries – the WHO has never updated the ranking since. But if you look at more up-to-date figures we are doing well. The most recent WHO World Health Statistics 2019 reported that Singaporeans enjoy a healthy life expectancy at birth of 76.2 years – the best in the world. We also have a correspondingly high total life expectancy at birth of 82.9 years. And our healthcare is delivered efficiently. Health expenditure as a percentage of GDP was 4.5% – in the bottom quartile of countries worldwide by expenditure.",2,365,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00365
2019-09-02-T-008,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"But there are still gaps. The CareShield Life and Long-Term Care Bill will create a universal, prefunded long-term care insurance plan, at least for younger cohorts. Because CareShield Life is universal and will be supported by subsidies for low-income Singaporeans, I believe this will provide genuinely universal access to long-term care if we become severely disabled. A mandatory universal plan is particularly important because the likelihood that we will become severely disabled is quite high. As the ElderShield Review Committee Report states, one in two Singaporeans aged 62 today could become severely disabled within their lifetime.",3,366,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00366
2019-09-02-T-008,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"So, CareShield is not really an insurance scheme in the sense of protecting Singaporeans against a low risk, high cost event. It is really a pre-funding scheme for care needs that are part and parcel of old age. The mandatory nature of CareShield Life will ensure that no Singaporean – or their families – will be in desperate want for financial assistance to cope with care needs in old age. Cost effectiveness and quality will also be important, but they will have to be addressed another day.",4,367,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00367

2019-09-02-T-008,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Sir, at the risk of exaggeration, let me suggest the chief concern among many Singaporeans if they were to get sick is how they will manage their medical expenses. This is ironic, given our excellent health outcomes and our comprehensive medical financing system. Our top healthy life expectancy ranking worldwide is surely not a sign of a people who cannot afford quality healthcare. But it is not so difficult to understand once we appreciate that a fundamental policy lever we have used to manage the cost, access and quality trade-off is to emphasise individual responsibility whenever possible. It appears Singaporeans have internalised this policy principle of individual responsibility quite well. And individual responsibility has been made practical through our MediSave medical savings scheme which gives Singaporeans a nest-egg to spend on their future medical needs.",6,369,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00369
2019-09-02-T-008,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Mr Goh Chok Tong, then Second Minister for Health, said in the debate on the MediSave Scheme in 1983, and I quote  “We must therefore save when we can, put a few dollars aside every month when we are working, save as an individual, save as a nation. This is the basic idea of MediSave – to provide funds for our citizens to pay for their future health needs, for them to buy an umbrella when it rains; and even before it rains.”",7,370,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00370

If the policy problem was only pre-funding for future healthcare costs alone, it would not matter whether MediSave was collected as individual accounts or whether the Government created an endowment fund for future healthcare spending. The policy objective of MediSave was also to encourage efficiency in healthcare utilisation. MediSave achieved this by giving each Singaporean an individual financial stake in their healthcare decision-making.",8,371,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00371

Why should you put it into a common pool and everybody draws out at your expense, which is what is happening in some Western countries. The system has collapsed.""",9,372,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00372

For example, when Mdm President was a Member in this House, she filed cuts in the Budget 2006 debate to call for greater flexibility in the use of MediSave, particularly for long-term chronic illnesses.

But if you were to read Mr Lee’s statement on MediSave carefully, you will see that the other problem with individual accounts is holding the line against the Government itself. The risk is that policymakers will appropriate the funds in MediSave to finance healthcare expenditures on a universal basis, or indeed, meet any other healthcare expenditure need.",12,375,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00375

Yet the same discipline that the population is expected to exercise in using MediSave wisely, must also apply to the policymaker. The policymaker has tended increasingly to see the MediSave account as a convenient source of healthcare financing. And why should she not? As of the first quarter of 2019, the CPF Board reported that aggregate MediSave balances stood at $97 billion dollars, or about $25,000 on average, per CPF member's account. This is enough to fund the operating expenses of MOH for about 10 years.",13,376,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00376

The MediSave account has become a source of funds that the policymaker can use to adjust the balance of subsidies in healthcare financing.

Hospitalisation and long-term care subsidies as well, can be adjusted if MediSave balances are robust.",16,379,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00379

But of course, this subsidy level could fall in the future if CareShield Life payouts became more generous. I think there is nothing sinister in this. It is just a matter of whether payment is taken through the MediSave pocket or the taxpayers' pocket.

I respect this principle tremendously, but as we adapt our healthcare policies to address the challenges of an ageing society, we should take a hard look at some of the ideological principles behind healthcare financing.

It is true in theory that when healthcare coverage is provided free at the point of treatment, there will be increased demand and over-consumption. But the extent and magnitude of these effects are not settled, and the policy question is often too narrowly framed as one of medical cost management only. An array of studies from healthcare insurance coverage experiments in the United States suggests that other social outcomes matter as well, such as financial and psychological stress, and early detection and management of chronic diseases.",19,382,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00382

The issue, I think, is not the misuse or abuse of MediSave funds. I am quite sure that this Government poses no such risk. The issue, rather, is the use of MediSave to alter how healthcare financing is structured without a full and frank examination of how we should be balancing payments between pre-funding and current payments, between the individual and the taxpayer.

However, it only provides $200, and given the care needs and costs of our younger ones who may be equally ill or disabled, we ought to ensure that our other schemes support them adequately rather than discriminate against them.

Most of these schemes have an average of three eligibility criteria and these criteria differ across schemes in terms of age, extent of disability, household monthly income and more. Many of these schemes requires application through a social worker or directly to the relevant Government agency, or alternatively requires a disability assessment to be conducted.",31,425,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00425
2019-09-02-T-008,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"On the ground, awareness of these schemes is understandably an issue, and the concern will surely be for people who are severely disabled but may not have accessed touchpoints like hospitals or social service offices such that they could be directed to access this web of schemes. Even with the support of these touchpoints, applications often take up significant portions of time for either care-recipients and/or their care-givers, as well as the social service or healthcare professional assigned to support them. The sheer number of schemes, accompanied by the number and variance in eligibility criteria and the amount of supporting documents required for the application, makes it overwhelming and exhausting for all involved. Even with the Silver Generation Office Ambassadors' work, limitations remain, especially in ensuring timely access to these schemes for those who desperately need support.",32,426,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00426

Michael suffered from global aphasia and a stroke, and he was also diagnosed to suffer a permanent loss of mental capacity, ability to communicate and needed help in all ADLs. When the volunteers met the family after Michael was discharged, they found that the family had insufficient money to put food on the table, and was also struggling to find money for transport to the hospital for the required medical care and proposed rehabilitation services. The subsequent days was a chaotic navigation of our systems for both the family and the volunteers attempting to support them. They alerted, made referrals and continued to work closely with around 10 stakeholders, including the FSC, RC, AIC, SSO, HDB, ICA, CPF, the regional hospital and other service providers.",33,427,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00427

For example, if an elderly is unable to carry out three out of six daily activities due to old age, stroke or dementia, including bathing, taking medicine, changing, going to the toilet, moving around and moving from bed to chair or to a wheelchair, they can file claims and they will be able to receive $600 in cash every month for the rest of their lives to pay for long-term care until they are fully recovered.",5,440,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00440

2019-09-02-T-008,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"I have a resident who in his early 40s suffered a stroke. He was severely disabled as a result of the stroke. Before the stroke, he was gainfully employed and the dual income that he and his wife made was more than sufficient to comfortably support his family and their three young children. Not only has the stroke rendered him unable to be work, he needs to be assisted in his daily living activities. His wife’s single income is now supporting his on-going care needs as well as their children. His family does also receive financial assistance. However, financing his on-going care needs as well as supporting their family's expenses has been and continues to be financially challenging for his wife and the children. If he had had coverage similar with benefits like CareShield Life, while it would not cover all the cost required for him, the monthly payout of $600 a month for as long as he is severely disabled would have provided some financial relief.",2,448,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00448

For middle income families that do not qualify from Government subsidies, the cost is a few thousands monthly. I have witnessed many families that are not financially prepared for such expenses and face difficulty in making these payments.

With the scheme being compulsory, the risk pool will be large and it would be expected that premiums will be affordable. What assurance is there for Singaporeans that premiums will be kept low and affordable? As it has been stated that payouts will increase about 2% each year to adjust for the higher cost of long-term care in future, premiums will be expected to increase in tandem.

But, regardless, when one is already in the unfortunate position of being afflicted with disability, what help will there be to ensure that the process for disability assessment and eligibility will not be onerous? For those with two ADLs on the CareShield Life scheme, who do participate in the CareShield Life Scheme and they are not eligible for the claim payouts when they do get disabled, do they need to continue to pay future premiums for CareShield Life if they are unable to work or to continue to work?

Can MOH share how and when this cohort of older Singaporeans will be informed of the details of eligibility and the amount of premium they need to pay to participate in CareShield Life, if they choose to do so? The reason why I am asking is that, during the briefings that I conducted with our Merdeka Generation (MG) seniors, it was quite interesting because many expressed interest to participate in CareShield Life. They do, however, need to have more information to help them understand CareShield Life, most importantly to assess if they can afford it and how to participate. Some of the MG seniors I met – unfortunately, I have to say this – but many that I met were not sure whether they are on the ElderShield or not, because they said ""I do not know whether I opted in or whether I opted out"".

At the same time, the Online Calculator for CareShield Life premiums is very easy to use and very simple. The only problem is you need to have certain information, like whether you have ElderShield or not. So, for some of our seniors, they could answer all the other questions except that, so they could not estimate. I think these are very practical but important matters that I hope more clarity can be provided to our seniors soon.",11,457,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00457

How will mental health conditions and dementia, for example, be assessed? Mental illness and dementia can significantly impair cognitive and behavioural functioning and interfere with normal activities and relationships. These can be as disabling as any other physical disabilities. Dementia and mental illnesses are sometimes called invisible disabilities and may impact an individual's ability to do essential daily activities. So, I hope that we can look at how mental illness and conditions like dementia could be treated or would be assessed together with the ADLs.",12,458,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00458

While life expectancy has increased, the number of years that is spent in poor health has not decreased. Lifestyle and habits increase the risk of disabilities. The leading risk factors affecting health in Singapore in 2017 were dietary risks, tobacco, high blood pressure and high blood sugar. The leading causes of Years Lived with Disability (LYD) in Singapore were musculoskeletal disorders, mental disorders, unintentional injuries and neurological disorders.",13,459,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00459

The principle underpinning insurance is risk pooling. Hence, I do not agree that our society should go the route of differential premium by gender, causing gender divide.

2019-09-02-T-008,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, this Bill does not just implement the CareShield Life scheme, it also enables the ElderShield scheme to be administered by the Government instead of private insurance companies, it provides for the withdrawal of MediSave funds of persons who are severely disabled, it establishes the Long-Term Care Fund and puts in place offences and penalties. I will speak in favour of all these four aspects of the Bill successively.",1,491,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00491
2019-09-02-T-008,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Firstly, this Bill transfers the ElderShield scheme from private insurance companies to Government administration, similar to how CareShield Life is also Government administered. This has several advantages. The not-for profit administration increases the affordability of premiums. The centralisation of administering the scheme will streamline the application for payout process. It also allows for smoother transition for those who choose to shift from ElderShield scheme to CareShield Life scheme. It also allows for the funds to be combined into a single CareShield Life and ElderShield Insurance Fund. This allows for more flexibility in investing. Even as the monies are consolidated into a single fund, how will the Minister ensure inter-generational equity in how the schemes are administered? That is one question I have.",2,492,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00492
2019-09-02-T-008,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In relation to the transition from ElderShield to CareShield Life, will the Minister provide an indication as to when and how sign-ups can begin? Also, will Supplement Schemes for ElderShield be affected by the transfer of ElderShield to become Government-administered and change of coverage to CareShield Life instead of ElderShield should the policy-holder choose to shift over to CareShield Life?",3,493,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00493
2019-09-02-T-008,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Secondly, Sir, clause 66(5) provides for the withdrawal of MediSave funds of persons who are severely disabled. Because healthcare can come in many forms, this flexibility is valuable for families to have yet another place of resources to tap into to care for the severely disabled. But even as there is increased flexibility, it should not deplete from MediSave funds to the extent that MediSave is no longer useful for its intended purpose. This is especially acute where a child’s MediSave funds is used to pay for a parent's medical expenses, and the child has his or her own medical expenses to cover and, as a result of not marrying, the child does not have anyone else’s MediSave account to tap onto in the future.",4,494,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00494
2019-09-02-T-008,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Therefore, would the Minister address these concerns? Furthermore, the new section 16B(1)(a) of the Central Provident Fund Act found in clause 66 indicates that there is a minimum sum in the member’s account in order for cash withdrawals for long-term care to be allowed. From news reports, the minimum sum that is being looked at is $5,000. Would the Minister explain how this figure was derived such that it ensures that the account-holder still has money to pay for other healthcare needs?",5,495,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00495
2019-09-02-T-008,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Thirdly, part 10 establishes the Long-Term Care Support Fund which is used for premium subsidies and other long-term care related assistance as set out in clause 39. Would the Minister share with us what are some of the plans that the Ministry has in utilising the Funds for purposes other than subsidising CareShield Life premiums? In particular, what kind of assistance will there be for those who are severely disabled but have utilised the six years under the ElderShield scheme, those who were unable to purchase the ElderShield scheme because they had been severely disabled, and those who are low-income and do not have much in their MediSave account? How does the Minister seek to address these perceived gaps?",6,496,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00496
2019-09-02-T-008,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Fourthly, this Bill introduces offences and penalties for the administration of this scheme. Clause 49 criminalises the act of an assessor making a fraudulent disability assessment. As the integrity of the administration of CareShield Life and ElderShield schemes rests primarily on the disability assessor, this offence places a safeguard against fraudulent claims facilitated by disability assessors.",7,497,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00497
2019-09-02-T-008,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Clause 50 criminalises the act of not applying the funds for the insured person first. The new section 16B(10) of the Central Provident Fund Act also has a similar offence. This offence ameliorates the risk of cash payouts being misused. Because the person directly harmed by the act criminalised by this offence is the insured person or member, why is it that a portion of the penalty be returned to the insured person himself or herself instead of having the whole penalty be paid into the CareShield Life and ElderShield Insurance Fund?",8,498,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00498
2019-09-02-T-008,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Because the penalty is possibly more than the amount misused by a four to eight times, requiring the offender to pay the insured person or member would not remove the punitive quality of the penalty.",9,499,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00499
2019-09-02-T-008,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"An exception to the offence is reasonable excuse.

2019-09-02-T-008,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Even as this Bill seeks to provide some financial support for long-term care, financial support is only one side of the equation to ensuring that long-term care remains affordable. Another side of the equation is to expand the supply of long-term care services. This is especially important as the number of persons who are severely disabled is projected to increase to 69,000 in 2030 compared to 29,000 in 2014. That is about 140% increase in demand for long-term care services or long-term care care-giver training.",11,501,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00501

But often with long lives, though not necessarily so, comes with it some loss of the kind of life as we knew it. Needing to rely on others to carry out activities of daily living does not just affect the elderly but also affects people from all ages. Through it all, the recipient of help is still valued and valuable.",16,506,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00506

By pooling the risks among many in society, they may be able to receive more than they would have in their savings otherwise. By allowing spouses to tap onto each other's MediSave account, another resource to support each other through the difficult time is opened. By setting up the Long-Term Care Support Fund, there can be more support for those who need more help in financing long-term care options, whether it be through subsidising premiums or through other schemes. Because this Bill implements and commits to the caring for those who are severely disabled, and for the reasons I have stated, I support it.",17,507,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00507

As at 2018, life insurance sales grew at 7%. Yet, the total claim amount due to deaths and disabilities in 2018 was about 0.1% of the total sum insured.

These women may also not come from well-to-do families, who have little to contribute to their MediSave even if they wish to.

2019-09-02-T-008,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Therefore, may I humbly suggest the Government consider the following.",25,532,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00532
2019-09-02-T-008,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Firstly, consistently educating and publicising how we deal with ageing in Singapore, specifically the principles and mechanics of our Long-Term Care system. This could be done in schools as part of national education, through common touch-points in the course of our lives and, of course, the usual mass media.",26,533,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00533
2019-09-02-T-008,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Second, high touch method of engaging target groups when implementing and communicating complex schemes such as CareShield Life. For example, akin to how insurance agents make complex insurance schemes easy to understand, could there be a network of trained policy agents who would reach out to Singaporeans at the workplace or at home to explain complex schemes to them? Even the most well-meaning policies can fail if we fail to help Singaporeans understand and solicit their support.",27,534,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00534
2019-09-02-T-008,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Finally, discussions so far focused on passively dealing with the challenges of old age and severe disabilities. We should also explore prevention and ways to minimise the risk. In a 2015 report by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, it stated that there is a growing body of research literature underscoring the importance of fostering good health and habits in life to prevent or postpone the onset of morbidity at older ages. This should apply to age-related disabilities as well.",28,535,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00535
2019-09-02-T-008,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Therefore, we must continue our efforts in encouraging healthier lifestyles and to do so from young. Healthy outcomes are not just important from a financial burden perspective, but because we love life. And therefore, for those who have proven to engage in healthy activities and maintained good health past, say, 60 years old, could their premiums be reduced or could rebates be given as a way of encouragement to reinforce this very positive behaviour?",29,536,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00536
2019-09-02-T-008,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Next, may I please continue in Mandarin?",30,537,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00537
2019-09-02-T-008,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Deputy Speaker, in 2014, we had a vigorous debate on MediShield Life in Parliament and passed the Bill. The purpose of passing that Bill was to provide universal healthcare insurance coverage so that all Singaporeans can enjoy basic healthcare protection. Besides Government subsidies and our own MediSave savings, MediShield Life can help us cope with unforeseeable circumstances. The concept behind it is risk-pooling whereby everyone’s money is pooled together to allow people in need to pay for massive medical expenses. Everyone has an equal chance.",31,538,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00538
2019-09-02-T-008,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"In principle and theory, CareShield Life and MediShield Life are the same.",32,539,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00539
2019-09-02-T-008,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Our population is now ageing rapidly. Our family size is also shrinking. It is inevitable that Singaporeans must support each other through thick and thin. Moreover, statistics show that one in two Singaporeans aged 65 years and above will become severely disabled later in life. This is a very high probability. Therefore, the implementation of MediShield Life and CareShield Life is to prepare people not just for their own but others' future as well.",33,540,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00540
2019-09-02-T-008,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"I am sure we are all clear about the importance of CareShield Life after last year's and today's debate. In my view, the key to the successful implementation of CareShield Life lies upon whether the Government can communicate it well, how it can explain the scheme in a targeted manner and address queries from different groups. When MediShield was introduced, many people felt that it was a very complex policy. In truth, CareShield Life is even more complicated. Therefore, we must communicate it well. Otherwise, if people do not understand, they would not support it. If they do not support it, unhappiness may occur.",34,541,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00541
2019-09-02-T-008,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Hence, I hope that while we promote CareShield Life, we must also focus on communication and engage the people wholeheartedly. And this should not be limited to CareShield Life alone. We must let Singaporeans, young and old, to understand the concepts and methods of our eldercare system within the overall picture of the long-term care framework.",35,542,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00542
2019-09-02-T-008,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Here, I have some humble suggestions.",36,543,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00543
2019-09-02-T-008,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Firstly, the Government can consider using the various mass media channels to publicise the concepts and mechanisms of our long-term care system. For example, we can, through civic education or ways that do not require exams, allow Singapore students to understand how we cope with the challenges of ageing and how we care for the aged, so that they are prepared at a young age.",37,544,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00544
2019-09-02-T-008,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Secondly, the Government can also consider setting up a network of volunteers who are familiar with public policies to reach out to workplaces and the community to explain complicated policies to Singaporeans. Through such face-to-face in-depth explanations, I believe Singaporeans will be able to understand those important but not necessarily popular policies.",38,545,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00545
2019-09-02-T-008,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Frankly speaking, the Government has taken a great deal of pain to look after the elderly. We all can see that. In the past, the Government has introduced many eldercare schemes and programmes, including CareShield Life. Earlier this year, we introduced the Caregiver grant worth $200 every month; and in the Pioneer Generation Package, we provide additional support to the disabled among the Pioneer Generation worth $100 per month. All these various subsidies and support packages are aimed at better looking after the elderly and giving them long-term care.",39,546,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00546
2019-09-02-T-008,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Earlier on, the esteemed Member Mr Chen Show Mao mentioned that the care given under CareShield Life is not enough and that $600 can only pay for part of the expenses of the severely disabled. I am curious to learn from Mr Chen in what way can the Government do better. On a macro level, we have many different packages and subsides, I would like to know from Mr Chen what are the areas that we can improve on.",40,547,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00547
2019-09-02-T-008,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"In fact, there are many suggestions raised in Parliament, not just from Mr Chen, for the Government to consider. However, when we raise these suggestions, we must be aware that after all, someone will have to pay for it. The government need to allocate precious resources to the things we ask for and it must balance different interests and trade-offs to formulate the best possible policies to help Singaporeans. The efforts that the Government has made is not simple at all.",41,548,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00548
2019-09-02-T-008,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Lastly, when we are looking at issues pertaining to long-term care and ageing, we tend to be a bit passive. We should adopt more proactive measure, such as encouraging Singaporeans to pay attention to their diet when they are young, stay fit, so that they can have a healthy foundation as they grow old and be able to enjoy a happy retirement life. To encourage people to stay healthy, can the Government consider emulating private insurers and offer CareShield premiums rebate or discount to those who actively exercise and stay healthy after 60?",42,549,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00549
2019-09-02-T-008,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"(In English)  Sir, in English. Sir, there is a real need for Singapore to get ready for the consequences of an ageing population. My sincere hope is that we will all enjoy good health, lead a full and fulfilling life, and rather than having to spend on our care needs, are able to spend on things that we enjoy. But we can never be sure of what will happen to us in the years to come.",43,550,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00550
2019-09-02-T-008,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"It would be too late if we only start to worry or find ways to finance our care needs later in life when our familial obligations intensify; or worse, when we suffer disabilities. It is also unsustainable and unfortunate if we have to burden future generations – which is by the way shrinking because of our ageing population – to fund our own care needs.",44,551,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00551
2019-09-02-T-008,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Very importantly, CareShield Life provides better long-term care and protection for all Singaporeans. This does not mean that the Government can cut back its support; this does not exonerate individuals from exercising personal responsibility, but this does enable us to pool our risks and help our fellow countrymen through times of need. In a society that expounds the importance of compassion and inclusion, all of us will need to contribute, in ways big or small, in one way or other. With that, I support the Bill.",45,552,2019-09-02-T-008-S-00552

I will round up this debate on behalf of Minister Gan.",1,561,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00561
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"As Minister Gan has outlined, Singaporeans are living longer and healthier. However, many of us will face the risk of severe disability and require long-term care at some point in our lives. Therefore, it is important that we protect ourselves and our families. I would like to assure Members that even as we enhance our long-term care financing system, implement the CareShield Life Scheme, we are and have been enhancing existing infrastructure and the eco-system for care. We have been rolling out services to support Singaporeans in old age and we have more than doubled in this respect the home care and day-care places since 2011. We continuously look at key aspects of ageing and also the related issues around successful and active ageing, including, as Mr Perera has exhorted, the use of technology.",2,562,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00562
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"I thank the Members for the various suggestions, questions and queries in the course of this debate. I will like to use the opportunity to round up the debate and address those queries by focusing on the core principles behind the design of this financing scheme. I will anchor the response around the key principles of inclusiveness, affordability and sustainability.",3,563,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00563
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),Let me start with inclusiveness. An inclusive long-term care financing system is one that supports all Singaporeans and enables them to afford essential basic long-term care. The design architecture of the Scheme must be to achieve that goal – to support Singaporeans and be able to do so while keeping premiums affordable.,4,564,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00564
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"First, in terms of coverage, the Bill reinforces and strengthens inclusiveness by making CareShield Life universal for future cohorts of Singaporeans born in or after 1980. Such a design is essential to protect vulnerable groups, such as the lower income and those with pre-existing disability.",5,565,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00565
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"For older existing cohorts of Singaporeans, which are those born in 1979 or earlier, we have kept CareShield Life optional for them as we acknowledge that the profile of this cohort, this group, is a lot more diverse. Many have previously decided to opt out from ElderShield, or may have made other long-term care financing arrangements of their own. In addition, the older cohorts would also have fewer economically active years left to spread out their premiums, and hence face higher entry premiums. Given that the Scheme remains optional for these cohorts, members of these cohorts will need to assess their own preparations, their own provisions for long-term care, when deciding whether or not to join CareShield Life.",6,566,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00566
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"To address Dr Chia Shi-Lu's point, we will provide ample Government support and incentives to encourage their participation in CareShield Life.",7,567,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00567
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"I would also like to assure Mr Png that those who are not severely disabled in existing cohorts can still join CareShield Life when it is launched in 2021. Mr Png also sought clarifications on clause 6(4). Let me explain that. This clause is used to cater for exceptional situations such as when someone had submitted an application for CareShield Life and it is being processed but, in the interim, fell into disability before the Scheme was effected or valid for this person. This clause allows the Minister to use flexibility to still provide CareShield Life cover on compassionate grounds. So, it is used in those limited exceptional circumstances and certainly not to be used arbitrarily.",8,568,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00568
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"As CareShield Life remains optional for existing cohorts, we will not be able to cover those in the existing cohorts who are already severely disabled, and I think Mr Png understands this point. Miss Cheryl Chan had raised this as well and I also hope that this addresses the point because if you cover everyone who is already severely disabled, that has an immediate impact on the premium that has to be borne by the remaining persons who subscribed onto the Scheme at that stage.",9,569,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00569
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"These individuals with pre-existing severe disabilities will be able to make claims immediately under the Scheme and so it is going to impact on the way in which you price the premiums for the rest of the members and also have an impact on whether their peers decide to join the Scheme or not. This is not a sustainable insurance scheme design. However, we will assist these Singaporeans with pre-existing disability in other ways and I will elaborate on them.",10,570,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00570
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Prof Fatimah Lateef and Mr Christopher de Souza asked how ElderShield and ElderShield Supplement coverage will be affected. As Minister Gan has explained, ElderShield policyholders who decide not to join CareShield Life will remain covered by their existing ElderShield policy. I would also like to clarify that ElderShield Supplements will continue to be administered by the private insurers. ElderShield Supplement policyholders will remain covered by their existing Supplement policy, regardless of whether they upgrade to CareShield Life or not.",11,571,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00571
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Dr Lee Bee Wah asked about encouraging existing cohorts who would not be auto-enrolled onto CareShield Life to join CareShield Life. I will reiterate what Minister Gan has shared, individuals born between 1970 and 1979 who are ElderShield policyholders and are not severely disabled will be offered the convenience of auto-enrolment. For those born in 1969 or earlier they will not be auto-enrolled, as their individual circumstances are far more varied, as I have explained.",12,572,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00572
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"In particular, there is a significant number of ElderShield 300 and uninsured individuals in the older existing cohorts, who will have to pay a catch-up component to join and get onto CareShield Life. They may thus prefer to have the option to choose to join CareShield Life at their instance instead of being auto-enrolled and that is the thinking behind the scheme mechanism.",13,573,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00573
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Nevertheless, I agree with Er Dr Lee’s point that it is important to outreach to these groups too to help them understand, to raise awareness and certainly we are of the view that if we design a scheme that is good and well, it is of no use if people do not understand it and do not know it. So, I accept Er Dr Lee's point and I also in return urge all Members of this House to use opportunities that you have on the ground in your events to explain the policy, to explain the scheme design and to reach out and explain and deal with queries that your residents may have.",14,574,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00574
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Ms Irene Quay and Ms Anthea Ong have asked about the schemes available to help younger severely disabled Singaporeans, in fact below the age of 30, including newborns and whether it is possible to extend CareShield Life to these people. CareShield Life is primarily designed to provide financial support for Singaporeans who become severely disabled during old age, which is when Singaporeans are most likely to need long-term care and support.",15,575,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00575
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Notwithstanding that, we have other schemes available which are outside the scope of the current Bill but let me just outline some of them to help the younger severely disabled Singaporeans.",16,576,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00576
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"First, MediShield Life will help to support their bills for inpatient and selected outpatient treatments. They can also benefit from other assistance schemes such as the Assistive Technology Fund and the new Home Caregiving Grant, which I think Ms Ong mentioned, which does not have an age criterion. In addition, hospitals such as KKH and NUH offer programmes such as subsidised therapy services to help parents with children who need that specialised care. Finally, Government-funded safety nets such as MediFund and ComCare will also continue to provide additional assistance to needy Singaporeans.",17,577,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00577
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"On that score, I would like to assure Prof Fatimah that overseas Singaporeans can avail themselves of CareShield Life. They will be able to file CareShield Life claims from abroad wherever they may be, and to receive payouts to support their care costs in those chosen countries.",18,578,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00578
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"The second aspect of inclusiveness lies in making the claims process accessible and as seamless as possible, which several Members have raised queries and concerns about.

2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Beyond what Minister Gan has mentioned about increasing the number of accredited disability assessors to about 300, progressively expanding the types of disability assessments that can be accepted for claims and also proactively reaching out to disabled individuals to inform them of their eligibility for claims, we will also be waiving the first assessment fee for CareShield Life claims to further reduce any hesitation or reluctance that an individual policyholder might have in making the claim.",20,580,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00580

2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"In addition, policyholders need not pay for assessment fees for periodic disability reviews. Such periodic reviews are, however, important to ensure that we continue to make payouts only to policyholders who are and remain severely disabled, but to address Dr Neo's concern, we will be adopting a more targeted approach for periodic disability reviews. For example, policyholders who have been assessed to be clearly permanently disabled may then be exempted from further reviews.",22,582,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00582

2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"In particular, we have been working with experts to improve the disability assessment framework, to explicitly recognise the impact of cognitive impairment on physical ability.

2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"To elaborate on this, a policyholder may well be physically able to perform the various Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), but requires significant prompting or reminding as he is unable to remember what those steps might entail or how that is to be done. Under the current framework, assessors who may not be sure how to assess this policyholder might well classify him as not being disabled, being able to perform the ADLs since he can physically complete them.",25,585,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00585
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Under the new framework and revised training curriculum, assessors will be guided with more information, more teaching and learning, and will be more explicitly guided on the aspects that should be taken into consideration if a policyholder is suspected to be cognitively impaired, including whether the policyholder's problem-solving ability and memory impacts his or her ability to actually carry out the physical acts of the ADL. This will result in cognitively impaired policyholders being able to more consistently qualify for CareShield Life claims.",26,586,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00586

2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Ms Ong, in particular, asked if CareShield Life payouts could be tiered based on the extent of disability. We have previously considered this. I think Ms Ong would also know that lowering the claims criteria to two ADLs would immediately increase the CareShield Life premiums of a 30-year-old policyholder by about one-third. That is anything in the order of 25% to 33% of increment, just by dropping down to two ADLs.",42,602,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00602
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"The premium increase for CareShield Life would likely be significantly and also exponentially higher if the claims criteria is then further lowered to one ADL, given the higher incidence and length of disability. Not only will there be more persons with one or two ADLs, as opposed to three, but the period of support, which is for life, will also be for longer. Both will have an impact on the amount of premium that will have to be collected.",43,603,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00603

Increasing the starting payouts from $600 to, say, $800 a month would also increase premiums for a 30-year-old policyholder by around a third.

2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"In addition, as Members would know, CareShield Life payouts are set to increase at 2% per year for the first five years of scheme implementation. Assuming a continued increase of 2% per year after that – so that is 2% thereafter after the five years – a 30-year-old joining the Scheme in 2020 may receive around $1,200 per month should he become severely disabled at age 67 or later.

2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"So, for those reasons, we have kept the focus on basic long-term care needs, and looked at other ways to provide additional support. And I urge Members to remember that the payout from CareShield Life is intended and it is designed to be complementary. It complements the other pillars of financing support, not replace and not take over, and also not put in place and reduce others; it is to complement as an add-on. Lower and middle income Singaporeans, including those with moderate disabilities, will be supported with subsidies of up to 80% for residential and non-residential care services, and can also receive other disability grants.",47,607,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00607

2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Dr Neo asked if the Government could administer these Supplements. As I explained earlier, our approach for the Government in this Scheme is to provide basic coverage, whilst at the same time allowing the private sector to innovate in the provision of supplementary coverage.

So, that is one principle behind why 30 and not 40, which is ElderShield. A 30-year-old would have been working for some years at that age, and starting premium payment at that stage lengthens the payment duration and also reduces the annual premium payable, making CareShield Life premiums more affordable and more within reach, including for a person who has started work for some time at around 30.",54,614,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00614

2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"We facilitate them starting these preparations early, by allowing individuals to tap on their existing savings in MediSave as another financing source, instead of requiring them to use only cash which, as the Member knows, will cause a strain in their cashflow.

In addition, we will also provide incentives to encourage existing cohorts to join the scheme, and these incentives are netted off against their premiums.

2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"While at Mr Leon Perera's point, I would like to clarify clause 15 of the Bill that allows the offsetting of premium subsidies from premium refunds, for administrative ease. So, let me just illustrate it with a scenario. For example, if an auto-enrolled policyholder decides to opt out before the deadline of end 2023, which Minister Gan outlined, the premiums he had paid will be fully refunded and the mechanism that is being used is designed in clause 15. Any premium subsidies and incentives he received previously will then, of course, also be offset from this refund. So, you do not retain the subsidies whilst at the same time choosing to exit from the Scheme.",61,621,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00621
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Separately, if the Council considers at its regular adjustments to consider premium rebates, for instance, in that situation, if there is a premium rebate to be paid to a policyholder, the rebate computation will not take into account the subsidy that has been given. So, if part of what you have been paying as a premium is assisted through the subsidy, then, the rebates that are given will not take that into account in giving the rebate to the policyholder. Instead, the rebate will be retained in the fund, for the benefit of all the other policyholders; and that, we believe is the fairest arrangement.",62,622,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00622
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),Mr Png also asked if the savings from Government administration have already been reflected in the CareShield Life premiums. Let me confirm that the CareShield Life premiums from existing cohorts are based on the expected expenses under Government administration and would thus have also reflected the savings that we expect to see from such administration.,63,623,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00623
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"In any case, any further savings will be fully returned to policyholders such as in the form of higher payouts or the premium adjustments that I just spoke about.

2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),Dr Chia had a question about Additional Premium Support criteria for both CareShield Life and MediShield Life and whether we intend for it to be the same. An individual's additional premium support status will be shared across both CareShield Life and MediShield Life so that an individual would not be put through the task of having to apply for Additional Premium Support twice over.,67,627,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00627
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),Let me turn now to the third key principle which is that of sustainability. I think Members would agree that we must ensure that the long-term care financing system that we put in place must remain sustainable and must work in the long term. This is so that our children and the generations beyond that will not be unnecessarily and unduly burdened by the needs of the current generation. Let me elaborate with reference to a few points.,68,628,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00628
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"First, CareShield Life and ElderShield are designed to be self-sustaining schemes. So, that again is in the policy design. It is in fact hard wired when into the design of the schemes. So, as a result, these schemes are heavily pre-funded, with CareShield Life premiums payable until age 67 or spread over 10 years for older existing cohorts, and ElderShield premiums payable until age 65. This means that each cohort saves up for their own long-term care needs, and taps on these savings in their senior years, thereby minimising inter-generational transfers across cohorts. CareShield Life and ElderShield premiums are set based on this pre-funding principle, and in line with internationally-accepted industry standards and principles.",69,629,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00629
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Several Members – Ms Anthea Ong, Ms Irene Quay and Ms Tin Pei Ling – have asked about gender-differentiated premiums. In particular, Ms Quay expressed concern that gender-differentiated premiums could start the trend of potentially differentiating premiums in future by reference to other factors, such as race and so on. We have explained this previously the actuarial basis for this feature, but we do recognise there are other factors at play. Let me just quickly recap it and address the points raised by Members.",70,630,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00630
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Actuarially, it is recognised that women live longer, are more likely to experience severe disability, and live longer in severe disability.

2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"In 2017, the average life expectancy at birth for women is 85.2 years as compared to 80.7 years for men. As individuals are more likely to become severely disabled in old age, women have a higher probability of becoming severely disabled in their lifetime. Three in five healthy women at age 65 are expected to become severely disabled, compared to two in five healthy men at age 65.",72,632,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00632
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"In addition, when disability happens, women are also likely to remain in disability for a longer period of time than men. Women aged 60 are expected to spend 7.8 years requiring assistance with any of the ADLs, compared to 2.6 years for men. And those are based on a study done in Singapore of Singaporean numbers. This means that women stand to receive more benefits from CareShield Life if you look at it across the spectrum, and hence, their actuarially priced premiums are higher.",73,633,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00633
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),We could average out the premiums across genders. I think some Members have alluded to that. But this only works if it was a fully universal scheme where there is no option.,74,634,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00634
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"As CareShield Life is optional for existing cohorts, gender-neutral premiums could well encourage male policyholders to stay on ElderShield and buy gender-differentiated Supplements from the private insurers, which may now then appear cheaper. As Members know, the ElderShield premiums are gender-differentiated. Conversely, female policyholders would now find CareShield Life a much better deal than the existing gender-differentiated ElderShield. This increases the risk of gender skewing in the risk pool as more women than men would join the CareShield Life Scheme. The gender-neutral premiums would become increasingly unsustainable and premiums would have to increase, possibly approaching the level women would have had to pay anyway under a gender-differentiated scheme, but without covering a significant proportion of men.",75,635,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00635
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"In response specifically to Ms Irene Quay's query, I should explain that actuarial differences in claims experience by gender is well-established both locally as well as globally. However, there is limited data to support such differences based on other factors such as race or genetic factors, which is why we look at this as an actuarial factor. So does ElderShield and ElderShield is supported by a series of other private insurers. In addition, I would also like to note that ElderShield Supplement premiums are not differentiated by race or genetic factors, the same factors that Ms Quay has outlined. And my Ministry will not allow insurers to do so. Hence, the concerns I have just explained with regard to gender would not apply, and there is no impetus for us to differentiate CareShield Life premiums using these factors.",76,636,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00636
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Nonetheless, Members have raised fair concerns about affordability for women, and I think those are fair points, and the need for greater inclusiveness for a national scheme. But let me explain it this way. If you have seen the numbers that I have outlined, I would suggest that greater inclusivity also means ensuring that the actuarial integrity of the scheme in itself should be the proper basis for designing the scheme's terms and that in the long term ensures a fair long-term sustainable outcome.",77,637,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00637
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"We will, however, address affordability separately, including the points raised by Members, through the provision of means-tested premium subsidies and Additional Premium Support. The means-tested premium subsidies are intentionally designed to be based on a percentage of premiums so that lower and middle-income women will receive larger dollar quantum. So, in absolute dollar terms, the Government subsidises women more compared to the men in their age cohort and of the same income levels.",78,638,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00638
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"I would also suggest to Members in this House that a gender-neutral premium, or gender-neutral scheme design, might at first blush appear inclusive. But if you take into account the factors that I have outlined, looking at that in terms of the payouts and the expected payouts and for the period of those payouts, then in the longer term it would likely lead to women from existing cohorts opting into CareShield Life, and men choosing to stay away. We would then have a gender-skewed coverage, and this would have the unintended effect of further worsening national solidarity over the Scheme, in the longer term.",79,639,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00639

Let me assure Members that the Scheme will be transparent. Minister Gan has explained earlier, the accounts of the CareShield Life and ElderShield Insurance Fund will be made public. We will also publish relevant information on the premiums collected and payouts made for the CareShield Life and ElderShield Insurance Fund on an annual basis. The public can be assured that the information shared will be similar to that for MediShield Life, and the CareShield Life Council will also consider what other information might be useful having regard to industry norms.",80,640,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00640

For example, underlying assumptions include mortality and morbidity assumptions, and how these change over time and over age for the population.

The query, I think, centred on the statistic that in the US, 52% of elderly would require long-term care assistance and asked whether this was taken into account. This along with information coming out from the UK and Japan was not taken into account in computing the premium in this case. On the assumptions backing one in two that was shared previously – and I think that was the point Mr Png also raised – MOH had engaged the professional advice of actuaries to compute this estimate, using the assumptions, parameters and the model that I spoke about earlier.",82,642,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00642
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"The projections are based on ElderShield claims experience but also draw information from a wider range of cross-sectional and longitudinal sources, given the limited experiences at older ages. As shared previously, the actuarial pricing data we look at includes insurance schemes in the US, Taiwan and South Korea. It does not mean we used their data wholesale. It looks at the models they have there, looks at our claims experience with ElderShield, draw them together, use the models and get the expertise of the actuaries and provide the scheme design.",83,643,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00643
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"At the end of the day, I should emphasise that if the actual claims experience was better than expected – in other words to take Mr Png's point – if we were more conservative with designing the scheme, that if the premiums collected are more than what is needed, then any surpluses from any of these excess premiums will be fully returned to policyholders, for their benefit. The Council could recommend for the surpluses to be returned in a number of ways such as higher payouts over the years, reduced premium increases over the years, or premium rebates. We intend to give the Council the flexibility to study factors and to make recommendations so that they adequately respond to changing circumstances and the needs on the ground.",84,644,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00644

It provides a broad explanation of the key pricing assumptions and risks for long-term care insurance, the challenges for pricing long-term care insurance, the concept, the thinking behind the models and also, advantages of pre-funding for long-term care insurance. If Members are interested, this technical paper was recently released by the Singapore Actuarial Society.",85,645,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00645

Let me assure the Members that moneys for the schemes are placed in a common insurance fund for capital and administrative efficiency. For example, Government capital injections into the insurance fund, which are meant to support tail-end risks, can benefit the capital needs of both schemes. However, monies maintained for CareShield Life and ElderShield will be tracked and accounted for separately. I would like to emphasise that monies collected for one scheme will not be used to fund the other scheme.",86,646,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00646

In response to Dr Chia’s question on how often the premiums and payouts will be reviewed, let me assure Dr Chia that the Council will monitor the disability trends and claims experience of the schemes closely and on a regular basis. Let them decide how regular they feel they need to and it is possible that the review regularity may be more in the earlier years, as we start the administration of the scheme.

2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),Fourth – and Mr de Souza raised this point – we intend to take a strong hand against fraudulent assessments and misuse of payouts. The Bill provides that maximum fines and penalties for the offences of fraudulent assessment and misuse of payouts will be twice the maximum fine and penalty for the offence of false declaration. This is commensurate with the more severe nature of these offences and also having regard to the fact that a nominated payee is acting on behalf of someone who is disabled.,92,652,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00652
2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"To Dr Chia’s query on how we can further guard against fraudulent claims, let me assure Members that regular audits will be conducted. No audit will be 100% foolproof, but audits will be done, patterns will be studied, to sieve out potential fraudulent claims. So, for instance, we might look at cases where a claimant who was assessed to be severely disabled and then subsequently assessed not to be not disabled at all, within a short period of time. These markers will allow my Ministry to look into further cases and investigate them.",93,653,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00653

Sometimes, genuine bona fide mistakes are made, and sometimes, to answer Mr de Souza, what might be a reasonable position. One could consider a situation where a care-giver living with a policyholder who uses part of the benefits for household expenses of the policyholder’s family, when the policyholder's needs are already well taken care of. So, in other words, part of the same household, needs are already taken care of, and the funds which are fungible are applied for another reason when the basic needs of the policyholder are already taken care of. So, in those situations, we do not intend to penalise the care-giver.",96,656,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00656

But remember what I said at the outset, it must be designed for a broad majority of Singaporeans and kept affordable, and I think that has to be the design intent. I would also like to borrow Prof Theseira's point, so eloquently put, that we do have to use these schemes judiciously, we have to have an internal discipline to what can or cannot be used out of MediSave.",101,661,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00661

2019-09-02-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"As a first step, MOH has extended MediSave cash withdrawals to the severely disabled in view that their care needs are typically higher – more intensive and higher. As we recognise that the amount withdrawn can be significant depending on the length of the disability, we have started by proceeding cautiously by limiting the use of MediSave withdrawals for long-term care to the member or the member’s spouse only. This ensures that the MediSave adequacy of the severely disabled member’s children and their ability to afford current and future healthcare expenses are not impacted.

I would like to explain that the majority of the monies in this Support Fund will be directed to existing cohorts as they are older and they are expected to form the majority of CareShield Life policyholders at the start. The majority of ElderFund beneficiaries are also expected to be in these cohorts given the higher prevalence of disability in old age.,108,668,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00668

And over time, that differentiation will result in the man effectively paying for part of what the woman enjoys in the context of this scheme, which is why we made the point earlier – I think in the previous debate, last year, Minister Gan also made the point – that we try as far as possible to keep the scheme design and the terms of the scheme actuarially consistent. We look at what insurance typically do. Calculate it on the same basis, but at the same time, outside of the scheme, we look at ways and means to assist.

But while I agree with him that adverse selection is going to be a problem if you have gender-neutral premiums in the private market, I wonder what are his views on whether this would be an issue in the mandatory component of CareShield Life. Because with the mandatory component, the Ministry is, in fact, free to have gender-neutral premiums without incurring any sort of adverse selection there. I think the issue, really, is although I generally believe prices must be right, there is an element of equity here and obviously many learned Members believe that it is important for there to be some kind of cost-sharing between the genders here.

I would just like to ask him clarifications fir the question I asked earlier, which is, if someone does not qualify because of the three ADLs, but with two ADLs or even one ADL, is somewhat unable to continue to work and earn an income and therefore has difficulties paying for the premium, is he or she still expected to continue to pay the premiums, in those kinds of situations?",1,696,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00696

Just as it is an actuarial view of the risk factors, it is also a lens that we all put on to look at which risk factor or which differentiated factor we look at. Last night when I read the report again on the burden of disease, I actually looked at it from a gender differentiation lens. And therefore, I came to the same conclusion that, actuarially, it is a fair system to have that differentiation. But having heard this and hearing the point about the fact that this is a partial universal system and all that, if we took from an actuarial standpoint another factor, that is the risk factors affecting the disease burden or the disability, and I go back —",2,697,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00697

On the point about the health factors that affect Singapore in 2017, it is really dietary risk, tobacco, high blood pressure and high blood sugar.

Earlier on, there was a comparison about how high premiums could rise if we drop the qualifying criterion from three ADLs to two ADLs  that premiums will go up by one-third. Is there a similar calculation the Ministry has done if indeed there were gender-neutral premiums? How much more would men have to pay?",1,705,2019-09-02-T-010-S-00705

2019-09-02-T-011,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"First, the new framework expands the scope of reciprocal arrangements that Singapore can enter into with foreign countries, by allowing more types of judgments to be covered by these arrangements. As mentioned earlier, currently, the scope of judgments that such arrangements can cover is limited. Only two main types of judgments are covered – and I think the legal practitioners in this House will know – that the Act covers final money judgments given by foreign superior courts in civil proceedings, which would in this case, include foreign judgments that might be based on a right of action conferred by a regulatory statute but otherwise provides for compensation. So, it is the compensatory aspect that would also be caught in the current regime.",9,729,2019-09-02-T-011-S-00729

2019-09-02-T-011,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Bill will expand and modernise the framework by adding four types of judgments given in civil proceedings.

2019-09-02-T-011,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Ordinarily, the judgment creditor of a foreign non-money judgment seeking recognition and enforcement of this judgment requires the Singapore Courts' assistance so that the orders in the foreign judgment may be effected in Singapore. There may, however, be practical difficulties, or issues of policy and convenience in recognising and enforcing foreign non-money judgments, especially if given by a court from a different legal system. The Bill therefore gives our Courts the discretion to only register a non-money judgment if it is satisfied that the enforcement of the judgment would be just and convenient. If the Court is of the opinion that such enforcement would not be just and convenient, then the Court may order the registration of such amount as it considers to be the money equivalent of the relief.",16,736,2019-09-02-T-011-S-00736

2019-09-02-T-011,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"For instance, where the Court finds that it would not be just and convenient to grant specific performance or an injunction, it may then grant damages in lieu of the relief. Damages may be assessed on a compensatory or restitutionary basis, in accordance with established principles on assessment of damages, so as to arrive at a fair equivalent of what is lost by the refusal of the non-money relief. In doing so, the Court would consider the value of the foreign non-money relief being effected in Singapore, given that what the judgment creditor seeks is for the non-money relief to be effected in Singapore. So the assessment tenet is based on the performance in Singapore.",18,738,2019-09-02-T-011-S-00738

This will strengthen the enforceability of judgments, including by ensuring that assets are not dissipated before a final judgment is obtained so that the successful claimants are not left with only a ""paper"" judgment. This ties in with my earlier point, where injunctions sometimes, instead of being final in nature, are also interim or interlocutory in nature. This Bill also contemplates the recognition of this type of judgments. The ability to enforce Singapore interlocutory judgments in foreign jurisdictions – in other words, the converse – will enhance the attractiveness of Singapore Courts to litigants.",20,740,2019-09-02-T-011-S-00740

However, the precise scope of enforceable judgments will be decided and negotiated with each foreign country individually. So, the fact that we have the Act or the Bill being passed into the Act, does not automatically mean that there will be a whole series of countries that will come on board. What will happen thereafter is, armed with these amendments, we will then proceed to negotiate with foreign countries, and decide in the case of each country, what is suitable, what is appropriate and obviously, on a reciprocal basis.",22,742,2019-09-02-T-011-S-00742

This means that while the reformed REFJA will provide a broad menu of options available for negotiation, Singapore might enter into an agreement or arrangement with Country A for the reciprocal enforcement of only a limited category of judgments, whereas with Country B, there could be reciprocal enforcement of the full range of judgments under the REFJA. It really depends on what is also being negotiated and what is also being offered by the reciprocal country.",23,743,2019-09-02-T-011-S-00743
2019-09-02-T-011,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Second, to ensure that the requirement for reciprocity is not circumvented or bypassed, the Bill provides that some types of foreign judgments will not be recognised. For example, if a judgment is given by a recognised court, on appeal from a court that is not a recognised court, in other words, it is an appeal, but it originates from a court that is not a recognised Court, then this will not be recognised under the framework. Or, conversely, where a judgment registered or enforced in a recognised court but which originated from a court that Singapore has no reciprocal enforcement arrangements with, will also fall outside the scope of the framework.",24,744,2019-09-02-T-011-S-00744

Reciprocating countries currently recognised by the the RECJA are expected to be transferred over to the REFJA regime before the RECJA Repeal Bill comes into force, so it will be consolidated into one common Reciprocal Enforcement Act.",25,745,2019-09-02-T-011-S-00745

It is based on reciprocity, that is, that Singapore's judgments will be recognised and enforced in their jurisdiction and that that jurisdiction's judgment will be recognised and enforced in Singapore except for a few exceptions. This reciprocity is based on executive action, namely, through the Minister making an order under section 3 of the Act. At this stage, Sir, allow me to declare that I am practising lawyer at the Singapore Bar.",2,753,2019-09-02-T-011-S-00753

Because our judgments will be more easily enforced overseas, parties will have greater reason to choose Singapore to resolve the dispute. As more cases in Singapore are heard, Singapore's jurisprudence will develop. With more established jurisprudence and greater familiarity with Singapore law, more contracting parties will choose Singapore law as the choice of law and Singapore as the place with exclusive jurisdiction.",3,754,2019-09-02-T-011-S-00754
2019-09-02-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"This Bill streamlines the regime by removing the distinction between commonwealth and non-commonwealth countries. Although they operated in generally the same way, there were a few minor differences. For example, the tests for setting aside registration of a judgment on grounds of public policy are slightly different in section 5(a)(v) of the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgment Act and section 2(f) of the Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgment Act.",4,755,2019-09-02-T-011-S-00755

2019-09-02-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Besides formalised statutory procedures, there are also non-binding memoranda between countries that help facilitate this process of recognition and enforcement. As of September 2018, the Supreme Court of Singapore had entered into Memoranda of Guidance as to the Enforcement of Money judgments with five courts in various jurisdictions. One such example is the Memorandum of Guidance Between The Supreme People's Court of The People's Republic of China and The Supreme Court of Singapore on Recognition and Enforcement of Money Judgments In Commercial Cases signed on 31 August 2018.",6,757,2019-09-02-T-011-S-00757
2019-09-02-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Relevant to how the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgment Act supplements and does not affect other existing regimes, would the Minister explain the rationale behind the retention of section 7(1) of the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgment Act which says that ""no proceedings for the recovery of a sum payable under a foreign judgment, being a judgment to which this Part applies, other than proceedings by way of registration of the judgment, shall be entertained by any court in Singapore""? Does this mean that if a judgment could be enforced via the Choice of Court Act instead of the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgment Act that the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgment Act must be resorted to and not the Choice of Court Act? That is a question.",7,758,2019-09-02-T-011-S-00758
2019-09-02-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"As this streamlined statutory regime supplements existing regimes, this Bill also broadens the scope of the Act, making it more useful.",8,759,2019-09-02-T-011-S-00759
2019-09-02-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Firstly, it broadens the kinds of judgment that can be registered under this Act. Although retaining the limitations of certain kinds of judgments in section 2(2), clause 2 includes non-money judgement as a type of judgment. This is very helpful even for commercial matters. For instance, in cases involving intellectual property rights, the remedy may be to transfer property or to destroy infringing material. Coupled with the inclusion of interlocutory judgments as a type of judgement recognised by the Act in clause 2, global mareva injunctions can be registered and enforced without commencing a separate action. Because there may be differences in legal remedies available or some other reasons where it may be just and convenient not to strictly enforce a non-money judgment, the new section 4(3A)(b) gives the court discretion on how to enforce non-money judgments.",9,760,2019-09-02-T-011-S-00760
2019-09-02-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Secondly, clause 3(1) allows the minister to recognise judgments coming from courts besides superior courts. The previous blanket ban against recognition of subordinate courts prevented Singapore's state court judgments from being registered overseas due to the need for reciprocity.",10,761,2019-09-02-T-011-S-00761
2019-09-02-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Because of the increase in jurisdictional limit of the State Courts, cases that need to be enforced overseas have to be enforced overseas have to be transferred to the High Court. This has disadvantages. The party who needs overseas enforcement may not get High Court costs from the other party, incurring greater unrecoverable costs. So, this change to make it possible for Singapore to enter into bilateral agreements that recognise judgments from our state courts directly is ideal.",11,762,2019-09-02-T-011-S-00762
2019-09-02-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Even while this Bill expands the possibilities for enforcing judgments and interim measures from other jurisdictions, this Bill also puts in safeguards to prevent abuse. Firstly, the new section 3(4) ensures that the judgment originates from the court recognised, preventing the requirement of reciprocity from being circumvented.",12,763,2019-09-02-T-011-S-00763
2019-09-02-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Secondly, clause 4 adds another ground for setting aside a registered judgment, that is, if the judgment was discharged. According to the Explanatory Statement, an example of this is in the event of a bankruptcy. This prevents the bankruptcy regime from being circumvented.",13,764,2019-09-02-T-011-S-00764
2019-09-02-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Thirdly, the new section 4(3B) allows Singapore courts to register a judgment for the amount of compensation but not for punitive or exemplary damages. Unlike section 16 of the Choice of Court Agreements Act which provides the court the discretion to refuse to recognise or enforce the part of a judgment that exceeds compensation for the actual amount of loss or harm suffered, the position for such judgments are unclear under the Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act and the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act. In this way, this Bill makes the position under the statutory regime of registering reciprocal judgments certain and accommodates differences in legal remedies available in different jurisdictions. This is a major advantage.",14,765,2019-09-02-T-011-S-00765
2019-09-02-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"With more possibilities albeit with in-built safeguards, there will be greater flexibility to negotiate bilateral agreements on the recognition and enforcement of court judgments. No changes seem to have been made to the list of countries under the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act and Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act at least since 1999. Hopefully, more bilateral agreements to this effect would be entered into following this Bill. This would boost dispute resolution in Singapore as the ability to enforce a judgment in multiple countries can be valuable for certain commercial disputes. Would the Minister share with us any plans to negotiate and conclude such bilateral agreements, especially for interim measures which the 2005 Hague Convention on Choice of Courts does not cover?",15,766,2019-09-02-T-011-S-00766
2019-09-02-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In conclusion, Sir, this Bill opens a lot of opportunities for negotiating bilateral agreements such that Singapore's court judgments can be enforced overseas, furthering Singapore's position as a premier dispute resolution hub.

Section 7(1) states that a foreign judgment to which the REFJA applies, may only be enforceable by way of registration under the REFJA. The rationale for having and retaining this provision is to preclude judgment creditors from seeking to enforce such foreign judgments, which are contemplated and covered by the REFJA, under the common law route. So, if you have a judgment that fits within REFJA's framework, then do it by way of registration and not take up Court time and seek to deploy the common law recognition.",2,808,2019-09-02-T-013-S-00808

Having regard to what Singapore's business interest would be, what serves Singapore lawyers, Singapore business community and our interest, as a whole, best in looking out for the countries that we might want to have an arrangement with, that will be the driving consideration when we look at how we negotiate and with whom we negotiate these reciprocal arrangements.",6,812,2019-09-02-T-013-S-00812

The first is what kinds of interim and non-money judgments are contemplated to be recognised. I outlined earlier the types that are considered, so freezing orders, Mareva injunctions and so on, to preserve, on the interim basis, sometimes it is also a final injunction – the parties' assets. Injunctions requiring a party to do something, which is a mandatory injunction, or to refrain from doing something else. Orders for specific performance could also be considered. Mr Pillai raised this point about declaratory judgments, those can also be recognised. We also contemplate that orders for delivery up or the recovery of property can be recognised.",9,815,2019-09-02-T-013-S-00815

2019-09-02-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Even if some of these foreign proceedings may be classified, as a matter of labelling, as ""civil"", they are effectively in substance the enforcement of the foreign country's penal, revenue or public criminal laws.

2019-09-02-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Pillai asked what is a ""just and convenient"" test in the context of the Bill, and also for an elaboration on the factors that a Court might consider before deciding that it is just and convenient to recognise a foreign money judgment.",15,821,2019-09-02-T-013-S-00821
2019-09-02-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As I mentioned earlier, we frame the way in which this would work without prescribing the factors to the Court, to leave some room for discretion. The “just and convenient” test has itself been developed judicially in the context of enforcement under the RECJA. The Courts, in that context, have looked at factors such as whether there was a delay and whether the delay had caused any prejudice to the judgment debtor, for instance; whether the judgment creditor could give a reasonable explanation for the delay in applying to register the judgment; whether the judgment creditor had been reasonably diligent in seeking to enforce it; and what is the conduct of the judgment debtor as well, has he been obstructive, and so on. These are factors that are taken into account but those would not be the only factors.",16,822,2019-09-02-T-013-S-00822
2019-09-02-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The overarching question and consideration for the Court to determine was, where did the interests of justice lie, having regard to the factual matrix of the case. The Member will be familiar with judicial authorities that espouse those principles and elaborate on them.",17,823,2019-09-02-T-013-S-00823
2019-09-02-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In addition, we anticipate that a likely scenario where it would not be just and convenient to recognise a foreign money judgment, would be possibly an injunction which applies only to within the territory of the country of the foreign court. If a judgment practically only applies to that country, then it would not be just and convenient to also enforce it in the context of Singapore.",18,824,2019-09-02-T-013-S-00824
2019-09-02-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Another scenario would be the enforcement of the non-money judgment where that scenario could expose a person to the risk of committing an illegality or to an action for breach of a rule of privilege, for example. In other words, there is an unintended but consequential impact in terms of the enforcement. Those might also be circumstances where it is not just and convenient.",19,825,2019-09-02-T-013-S-00825
2019-09-02-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"There could also be potentially situations where the non-money judgment has got no equivalent in Singapore. It will then, of course, not be just and convenient for the local Court to enforce it, given that such remedy either does not exist or is not recognised in this form from the foreign courts.",20,826,2019-09-02-T-013-S-00826
2019-09-02-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, those are some examples but I hasten to add that the categories are not closed, and we leave the Court some room to decide, whether in the context of the appropriate case and the parties, and the background circumstances of the case, whether it is just and convenient to recognise the foreign court's judgment and enforce it.",21,827,2019-09-02-T-013-S-00827

It was the heat of the moment and they got pregnant. In the heat of the moment, just before they have sex, nobody would stop and think, ""Wait if we do this and get pregnant and don't get married, we won't be able to get a HDB flat. Let's not have sex.""",40,887,2019-09-02-T-016-S-00887
2019-09-02-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),All of us sitting here know that this will not happen. We have a policy that will not work. The only time when an unwed parent feels the impact of the policy is when he or she has a child and is looking for a roof over their heads.,41,888,2019-09-02-T-016-S-00888
2019-09-02-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),The message that we are telling the single unweds is that they should get married. But do we want to force a couple to get married so that they can get a roof over their heads. What kind of a marriage would that be? Is this really in the best interest of the child?,42,889,2019-09-02-T-016-S-00889
2019-09-02-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"There is another way out for the single unwed, which is to get married and then file for a divorce subsequently and get sole care and control of the child. They would then qualify for HDB housing. This really does not make sense. In fact, the single unwed and his or her child who previously did not qualify for public housing, will now not only qualify for public housing but might get priority to get a flat under the ASSIST scheme.",43,890,2019-09-02-T-016-S-00890
2019-09-02-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I know the Government is also concerned that if more help is given to single unweds, we will have a sudden increase in the number of single unweds. But this has not been the case, since we provided the 16 weeks of maternity leave and the CDA to single unweds and their children, there has not been an increase in the number of single unweds. In fact, there has been a decrease. There was also no public uproar when we extended these benefits to single unweds and their children.",44,891,2019-09-02-T-016-S-00891
2019-09-02-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Lastly, there might be concerns that people will have a baby just to get an HDB flat.

2019-09-02-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Our policies should cater to the majority and we should not let the majority suffer because of what we feel the minority might do to game the system.

Honestly, my wife is getting a bit worried as people now come up to me on the streets to ask if I am a single parent.

I believe Mr Ng can attest to the fact that most of the cases that he has shared with HDB have been helped by HDB. He shared earlier the case about Mary.

2019-09-02-T-016,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Ms Sun Xueling),"I would like to first explain our approach towards public rental applications. We believe home ownership provides long-term stability and progress for all Singaporeans.

2019-09-02-T-016,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Ms Sun Xueling),"Mr Ng suggested that HDB should have some clear criteria for when single unwed parents can get a public rental flat. I agree with Mr Ng that there may be some common and objective factors we can identify, for example, income. But I would like to add that income is but one indicator of the needs of the applicant. We do not rely on a few predetermined metrics to understand the applicant’s circumstances. These are guidelines, and from HDB's perspective and experience, applicants can have more differences than similarities in their circumstances.",8,914,2019-09-02-T-016-S-00914
2019-09-02-T-016,Sun Xueling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Ms Sun Xueling),"For instance, the applicant could have medical conditions, which could impede his or her ability to live independently at the point of their application to HDB.

Nevertheless, HDB is prepared to and has exercised flexibility on the age requirement for those with long term medical expenses.",1,952,2019-09-02-T-019-S-00952
2019-09-02-T-019,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,We thank the Member for his feedback and will take it into consideration as we continue to review our schemes.,2,953,2019-09-02-T-019-S-00953

2019-09-02-T-020,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the current number of households with persons with disabilities (PwDs); and (b) what measures are available to assist them financially and with respite care.,1,955,2019-09-02-T-020-S-00955
2019-09-02-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) currently does not have data on the number of households with persons with disabilities. We are working with the Department of Statistics to include this and other disability-related questions in the next population census to be conducted in 2020.,1,956,2019-09-02-T-020-S-00956
2019-09-02-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"There is a range of financial support and subsidies for persons with disabilities across different life stages. Depending on their household income and financial circumstances, they may qualify for financial assistance schemes, such as ComCare Long-Term Assistance, Short-to- Medium-Term Assistance and Student Care Subsidies. Low-income persons with disabilities and their families are also eligible for various disability schemes across life stages.",2,957,2019-09-02-T-020-S-00957
2019-09-02-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"At the pre-school stage, all Government-funded centres that offer the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC) have schemes in place to help families subsidise EIPIC fees. There is also another subsidy scheme, the Enhanced Pilot for Private Intervention Providers (PPIP), for parents with children enrolled in selected private intervention centres (PICs).",3,958,2019-09-02-T-020-S-00958
2019-09-02-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Financial subsidies are also available to caregivers of students in Government-funded Special Education (SPED) schools. This includes the SPED Financial Assistance Scheme to help eligible students get a full waiver of school fees, free textbooks and free school attire. SPED schools are also given a grant for Discretionary Financial Assistance (DFA), to be given out by the school. Like all other students, Singaporean students with disabilities in mainstream schools can also qualify for financial assistance based on their family's financial circumstances.",4,959,2019-09-02-T-020-S-00959
2019-09-02-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"After graduation, persons with disabilities may enrol in government-funded services such as Day Activity Centres (DAC) and Sheltered Workshops. While DAC fees may vary based on the programme that the client is enrolled in, low income families are given more subsidies to keep the fees affordable. Care-givers can also tap on the Foreign Domestic Worker Levy Concession and the Foreign Domestic Worker Grant for persons with disabilities to defray the cost of employing a foreign domestic worker to look after family members with disabilities. Working care-givers may also qualify for tax reliefs if they are supporting spouses, children, parents or siblings with disabilities.",5,960,2019-09-02-T-020-S-00960
2019-09-02-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"There are also several schemes administered by SG Enable to financially support persons with disabilities to live independently in their homes and the community. For instance, the Assistive Technology Fund subsidises up to 90% of the cost of buying, replacing and repairing assistive technology devices that help them to live independently. These schemes also include various transport subsidies such as the Public Transport Concession Scheme for persons with disabilities, Voluntary Welfare Organisation (VWO) Transport Subsidies, Taxi Subsidy Scheme, and the Disabled Persons Scheme to support persons with disabilities who are unable to use public transport and require a vehicle to earn a living.",6,961,2019-09-02-T-020-S-00961
2019-09-02-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Low-wage Singaporeans with disabilities can also benefit from two Workfare schemes to increase their wages and enhance their skills. The Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) tops up the salaries and CPF savings of low-wage workers, with up to $3,600 in cash and CPF contributions annually, while the Workfare Training Support (WTS) scheme provides support to encourage low-wage workers to upgrade their skills. SG Enable also helps job-ready persons with disabilities to look for employment.",7,962,2019-09-02-T-020-S-00962
2019-09-02-T-020,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,Respite care services are currently provided by nine Adult Disability Homes and three Children Disability Homes. These services are offered to families of persons with disabilities who may need short-term assistance in providing care for their loved ones. Caregivers seeking respite care services should approach SG Enable if they require information or support.,8,963,2019-09-02-T-020-S-00963
2019-09-02-T-021,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"asked the Prime Minister (a) whether there is an increasing number of cases of monies wrongly credited by a person to a bank account of an individual; and (b) whether our banks are required to freeze such monies and return them to the rightful sender and, if not, why.",1,964,2019-09-02-T-021-S-00964
2019-09-02-T-021,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"With the growth in electronic funds transfers, there have been some reported cases where monies were transferred by bank customers to unintended recipients. This can happen when a person makes typographical errors while setting out the e-payment instructions, but such instances are rare.",1,965,2019-09-02-T-021-S-00965
2019-09-02-T-021,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"When such an erroneous transfer occurs, the bank should help by engaging the recipient's bank, so that the recipient is informed and a refund can be initiated. It is an offence under the Penal Code for the recipient to retain or use the funds when he has been informed that it was sent by mistake. If the wrongful recipient refuses to return the erroneously transferred monies, the sender should make a police report.",2,966,2019-09-02-T-021-S-00966
2019-09-02-T-021,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Er Dr Lee asked whether banks are required to freeze and automatically return monies to a sender when a sender says the monies were wrongly transferred. It would not be appropriate to impose such an automatic requirement on banks. First, a bank cannot be sure that the sender made a mistake. Second, automatically returning the monies to the sender will run the risk of abuse, and does not encourage more careful use of e-payment and transfers.",3,967,2019-09-02-T-021-S-00967
2019-09-02-T-021,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"For example, a person who pays for an online purchase could subsequently ask his bank to reverse the payment upon receipt of the goods, claiming that the transaction was in error, and the banks are none the wiser.",4,968,2019-09-02-T-021-S-00968
2019-09-02-T-021,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"To address the concerns relating to erroneous transfers, MAS has issued a set of guidelines to protect e-payments users. Under the guidelines, consumers will need to play their part and be responsible for accurate payments. On the banks' part, they have to make reasonable efforts to assist the sender, as I have mentioned. And in the case of fraud, consumers should report to the Police promptly.",5,969,2019-09-02-T-021-S-00969
2019-09-02-T-021,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"MAS will continue to work with the industry to raise consumer literacy and awareness on how to minimise wrongful e-payments. As in the case of cheques, the banks' role is to ensure that all properly authenticated payment instructions are processed effectively and efficiently. And as customers, we all know we have to write our cheques accurately and properly.",6,970,2019-09-02-T-021-S-00970
2019-09-02-T-022,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak,asked the Prime Minister (a) what will be the impact of the withdrawal of market access rights to the European Union on our financial institutions; (b) what is the Government doing to mitigate the impact; and (c) how rigorous is our regulation of crediting ratings agencies as compared with that of the EU.,1,971,2019-09-02-T-022-S-00971
2019-09-02-T-022,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,asked the Prime Minister (a) what are the implications of the European Commission's decision to withdraw some market access rights of Singapore; (b) how may this affect investor confidence; and (c) what may be the interpretations of this move against the broader developments around the world.,1,972,2019-09-02-T-022-S-00972
2019-09-02-T-022,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Some media reports might have given the impression that the European Commission (EC) is reducing its market access to financial institutions in Singapore. This is not true. There continues to be no impediment, for financial services provided out of Singapore to customers in the European Union (EU). There has also been no impact on investors’ confidence in Singapore.",1,973,2019-09-02-T-022-S-00973
2019-09-02-T-022,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Let me explain. The EC's decision covers only Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) and does not extend to any other financial services. Further, the EC recognises CRAs in a third country through two approaches",2,974,2019-09-02-T-022-S-00974
2019-09-02-T-022,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"First, deeming the third country's CRA rules as equivalent to EC rules. This is called the equivalence decision;",3,975,2019-09-02-T-022-S-00975

2019-09-02-T-022,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"CRAs in Singapore have been using the endorsement approach, and the EC has confirmed that it will continue to recognise Singapore-based CRAs using this approach.",5,977,2019-09-02-T-022-S-00977
2019-09-02-T-022,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Having said that, equivalence is the highest form of market integration, which CRAs in Singapore, like those in several other jurisdictions, no longer enjoy. The reason has to do with the different approaches taken by major regulators internationally. Dr Lim asked how MAS’ regulations on CRAs compare to those in the EU. Mr Leon Perera also raised a similar question for the next Parliament Sitting.",6,978,2019-09-02-T-022-S-00978
2019-09-02-T-022,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"MAS' CRA regulatory regime is based on, and consistent with, standards promulgated by the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which is the global standard setting body. The EC has assessed MAS' CRA regulatory regime to be less prescriptive than EU rules in certain areas, such as in defining specific situations in which a conflict of interest for the CRA arises. MAS takes a more principles-based approach. It nevertheless requires conflicts of interest to be effectively addressed, and is fully in line with international standards and appropriate to our context and needs.",7,979,2019-09-02-T-022-S-00979
2019-09-02-T-022,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Singapore is in good standing with the EU. We have EC recognition on a broad range of other financial services, including for over-the-counter derivatives trading venues and central counterparties. In July 2019, we were one of the first two jurisdictions to obtain EC equivalence for financial benchmarks regulation. MAS will continue to closely engage our EU counterparts in reviewing our rules to ensure that financial institutions in Singapore continue to have access to the EU market in various financial services.",8,980,2019-09-02-T-022-S-00980

2019-09-02-T-023,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"The group leader informed the Malaysian authorities that Mdm Phua and Mr Tan were missing on the morning of 9 August 2019. When MFA was informed later that afternoon, we immediately contacted the relevant Malaysian authorities to also seek their urgent assistance for the search and rescue (SAR) operations as the incident took place in Malaysia's territorial waters. We also immediately alerted members of both families of the incident and offered our assistance.",2,983,2019-09-02-T-023-S-00983
2019-09-02-T-023,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"An intensive SAR operation was coordinated by the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) over the next 10 days. MFA officers were deployed on the ground to coordinate with the Malaysian authorities and to provide consular support to the families, at the search site. Their kayak was found on 13 August, and the body of Mdm Phua was subsequently found on 14 August. Unfortunately, the search for Mr Tan has been inconclusive. While the SAR operations have ended, the Malaysian authorities have asked vessels and fishermen to continue to look out for Mr Tan. We also remain in contact with the families in case they require further assistance in the wake of this tragic incident.",3,984,2019-09-02-T-023-S-00984

MPA, who coordinates Singapore's maritime SAR operations, reached out to its Malaysian counterpart to offer Singapore's assistance. MPA also alerted its Indonesian and Thai counterparts to look out and report any sightings, and initiated a Maritime Safety Information broadcast to the shipping community to be on the lookout.",4,985,2019-09-02-T-023-S-00985
2019-09-02-T-023,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"While our offer of assistance was not taken up, Malaysia conducted an intensive SAR operation lasting 10 days. This is beyond the usual period of their SAR operations. Malaysia deployed 5 aircrafts, 11 naval vessels and patrol boats and 155 ground personnel in very challenging conditions. They covered a vast area of waters off the Malaysian states of Johor, Pahang and Terengganu. We are especially grateful to the Malaysian government and all Malaysian agencies and personnel who were involved in the SAR operations. We were also heartened by the support and assistance of ordinary Malaysians from all walks of life, especially the fishermen in the area who played a critical role in the recovery efforts. I called Malaysian Home Affairs Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin shortly after the end of the SAR operations to personally express Singapore's deep appreciation. He also assured me that Malaysia will follow up if there is any significant new information on the search for Mr Tan.",5,986,2019-09-02-T-023-S-00986

The local cases did not have recent travel history. Preliminary genetic analysis conducted on available typhoid bacteria samples from 18 of the local cases showed that they were similar, which suggest that the cases could be linked to a common source.",1,990,2019-09-02-T-024-S-00990
2019-09-02-T-024,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"MOH and the Singapore Food Agency have been working together to investigate the cases. We have conducted checks at food establishments and caterers where the cases had consumed food from, traced food sources, collected food and water samples for testing, and screened food handlers to try to identify the source of infection. Thus far, none of the food and water samples tested, or food handlers screened, tested positive for Salmonella Typhi. No common food establishment or upstream source has been identified to date.

2019-09-02-T-025,Irene Quay Siew Ching,Ms Irene Quay Siew Ching,asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the current number of non-medical care related admissions into public hospitals; (b) what are the common conditions for which patients are admitted for non-medical care; and (c) whether a review will be carried out to ensure parity between outpatient and inpatient MediSave/Approved Integrated Shield claimable limits for these conditions so that hospital beds can be more efficiently utilised for cases requiring urgent medical attention.,1,995,2019-09-02-T-025-S-00995
2019-09-02-T-025,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Patients are hospitalised at the public hospitals only when they have a clear clinical need for admission. There have been a very small number of admissions due to non-medical circumstances. Examples include new-born babies who are well but are admitted as their mothers remained unfit for discharge after delivery, or patients who are well but unable to be discharged as they lack a caregiving arrangement. The number of these non-medical admissions have remained low at between 0.01% to 0.03% of all admissions in the past five years.",1,996,2019-09-02-T-025-S-00996

As some of these treatments may remain costly, MOH will review and consider them for MediShield Life and MediSave coverage, as appropriate. As an example, MediShield Life and MediSave can now be claimed by multiple myeloma patients who continue their autologous bone marrow transplants in the outpatient setting, potentially allowing these patients to shorten their hospitalisation stays by up to three weeks.",2,997,2019-09-02-T-025-S-00997

The amended Penal Code, which will come into force in 2020, will empower the Police and SCDF to take even firmer action, by introducing a new offence of causing or contributing to the risk of a dangerous fire, and a presumption clause. In future, should a fire happen within 60 minutes at the place where someone had illegally disposed of a cigarette butt, the person would be presumed to be culpable for the fire and duly charged.

2019-09-02-T-028,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Since the May 2019 BTO exercise, HDB has reduced the balloting time for BTO flats from six weeks to three weeks. This means that three weeks after the sales exercise, applicants will be notified of their queue number. Thereafter, they will be invited to select a unit in sequence. It takes around four to six months for the flat selection to be completed. This is because HDB has to schedule individual appointments for every applicant, and take the time to engage them, and assist them in making their flat selections.

But there was a brief surge in property prices from 2H2017 to 1H2018 as market sentiments improved. Developers, both local and foreign, were bidding more aggressively for land. So this bidding behavior was not limited to Chinese developers, who accounted for less than 10% of the private residential sites sold via the Government Land Sales programme and en-bloc sales during this period. In terms of prices, the winning bids by Chinese developers were also comparable to those of other developers.",1,1009,2019-09-02-T-029-S-01009

2019-09-02-T-047,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Food security is a national security issue that is closely linked to human life and health. Given that we import over 90% of our food, Singapore is vulnerable to volatilities in the global food market and disruptions in our food supplies. This vulnerability will become more acute in time, as global crop yields are estimated to decline by up to 25 percent by 2050 due to climate change impacts. With such challenges in mind, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) was formed in April 2019 with the mission to strengthen and ensure Singapore’s food security. SFA does so by pursuing three broad strategies, which we call our three ""food baskets"" – ""Diversify Import Sources""; ""Grow Local"" and ""Grow Overseas"".",1,1097,2019-09-02-T-047-S-01097
2019-09-02-T-047,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For our first food basket, SFA works with stakeholders such as food importers to diversify our food import sources. This ensures that we are not overly reliant on a particular country, and reduces the impact of a disruption in food supply from any one source country. To support this, SFA is accrediting more farms across different countries and geographical regions for food safety to enable them to export to Singapore, and brings importers on food sourcing trips to facilitate import tie-ups. SFA has also introduced requirements for importers of key food items, such as eggs, to adopt plans to mitigate the impact of any supply disruptions.",2,1098,2019-09-02-T-047-S-01098
2019-09-02-T-047,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Our second food basket, ""Grow Local"", will help Singapore reduce our reliance on imports and buffer the impact of overseas supply disruptions. At the Committee of Supply debate earlier this year, I announced that my Ministry has set out to achieve ""30 by 30"", to develop the capability and capacity to locally produce 30% of Singapore's nutritional needs by 2030. This is a significant jump from our current local production of less than 10%. As SFA works with our agri-food industry to adopt new solutions to raise productivity, these solutions need to also adopt circular economy approaches, to overcome our resource constraints, such as for water and energy. This way, Singapore also becomes more climate resilient.",3,1099,2019-09-02-T-047-S-01099
2019-09-02-T-047,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"SFA is committed to partnering our food producers in this journey. New farm plots have been tendered out to those with the best concepts instead of the highest bid prices. Through the Agriculture Productivity Fund (APF), SFA supports farmers in their efforts to modernise and harness innovative, sustainable technologies and advanced farming systems. For example, APF supported Singapore Aquaculture Technologies, an existing coastal fish farm, to adopt a closed-containment aquaculture system. In a closed-containment system, the water to culture the fish is separated from the sea water, enabling fish production to be resilient to fluctuations in external environmental conditions.",4,1100,2019-09-02-T-047-S-01100

The programme was jointly developed by SFA and A*STAR to grow a vibrant and forward-looking agri-tech and food ecosystem, with one of the focus areas being sustainable urban food production. Under this, SFA partners the research community to find solutions for the gaps that current technologies cannot solve. Potential research areas include the use of smart sensors in climate-resilient farming systems in tropical aquaculture and urban agriculture.",5,1101,2019-09-02-T-047-S-01101

Then-SPRING also invested in startups through the SEEDS Capital, which was started in 2001. Collectively, these schemes have made investments into more than 400 startups. Beyond funding support, the Government has taken other steps to grow a conducive environment for startups.

2019-09-02-T-081,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We thank Mr Pillai for his suggestion, and agree that the birthday of a centenarian is a significant occasion. It would be most meaningful to celebrate such an occasion via grassroots-led ground up efforts, where we celebrate not just the birthdays of centenarians, but the kinship and community bonds forged with family, neighbours, and the broader community. Grassroots and community leaders would be well-placed to organise such celebrations in an organic manner. The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and other agencies, such as the Silver Generation Office, would be happy to support these efforts, for example, through sharing of information on centenarians whom the agencies come into contact with and who would like be involved in these celebrations.",1,1258,2019-09-02-T-081-S-01258
