2020-10-05-T-001-S-00001,2020-10-05-T-001,1,Speaker,Order. I have to inform hon Members that I have on 7 September 2020 communicated to the President the Address of Thanks agreed to by resolution of this Parliament on 4 September 2020.
2020-10-05-T-002-S-00002,2020-10-05-T-002,2,Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry will consider allowing Universities and schools to return to more normalised face-to-face activities and classes when TraceTogether tokens are in widespread use with safe distancing measures in place.
2020-10-05-T-002-S-00003,2020-10-05-T-002,3,Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, students from all levels have resumed daily lessons in our schools. Lower-risk co-curricular activities or CCAs and other activities have also resumed. Likewise, the Institutes of Higher Learning or IHLs have gradually increased the number of students allowed back on campus for practicums, laboratory sessions and other classes. They are progressively allowing selected non-timetabled activities to return to campus, including project discussions and some student activities."
2020-10-05-T-002-S-00004,2020-10-05-T-002,4,Lawrence Wong,"We now have effective Safe Management Measures in place in our schools and IHLs, coupled with a system of rapid contact tracing. We have also improved capabilities to detect community cases quickly through our expanded testing regime and are exploring the monitoring of wastewater in student hostels."
2020-10-05-T-002-S-00005,2020-10-05-T-002,5,Lawrence Wong,"With these conditions in place, we are now studying ways to resume more in-person activities safely in our schools and IHLs, as the Member has suggested. These activities, together with the resumption of a wider range of CCAs and other activities, are important because we must strive to provide our students with a holistic educational experience, while keeping risks to a manageable level. MOE is working through the details and will share more in due course."
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00006,2020-10-05-T-003,6,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"asked the Minister for Health with the low number of community cases for COVID-19, what can be expected on further easing of measures for Singapore and when can this be done."
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00007,2020-10-05-T-003,7,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,asked the Minister for Health whether the Government has completed its review of work-from-home arrangements and where does Singapore stand in the Government's risk assessment in determining when to move into Phase 3 of Singapore's re-opening.
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00008,2020-10-05-T-003,8,Gan Kim Yong,"Mr Speaker, may I take Question Nos 2 and 3 together?"
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00009,2020-10-05-T-003,9,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00010,2020-10-05-T-003,10,Gan Kim Yong,"Thank you. Sir, when Singapore exited the circuit breaker period in June 2020, the Multi-Ministry Task Force or MTF set out a Three-phase Plan to resume economic and social activities. Since then, we have progressed from Phase One to Phase Two."
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00011,2020-10-05-T-003,11,Gan Kim Yong,"We have learned important lessons from other countries in easing precautionary measures for COVID-19. For example, when restrictions are lifted prematurely, or too hastily, a resurgence of cases may occur, resulting in the need to partially reimpose these restrictions. On the other hand, it is not sustainable to maintain tight restrictions for a prolonged period which will severely impact not only our economy, but also our lives. Therefore, we have taken a carefully calibrated approach in opening up our society and economy as we work towards Phase Three. This is complemented by close monitoring, extensive testing and comprehensive contact tracing to keep the situation under control, as we balance the protection of lives and livelihoods."
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00012,2020-10-05-T-003,12,Gan Kim Yong,"We have made significant moves towards restoring economic and social activities. From 28 September 2020, we allowed more employees who have been working from home to return to their workplaces, which Mr Louis Chua had asked about. However, we need to continue to keep our workplaces safe and minimise crowding. Therefore, such employees should still continue to work from home for at least half their working time and there should be no more than 50% of such employees at the workplace at any point in time. Work-related events, including conferences, seminars and meetings, have also been allowed to resume, albeit within a 50-person cap for these activities to reduce the risk of transmission. Other safe management measures should continue to be observed at workplaces."
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00013,2020-10-05-T-003,13,Gan Kim Yong,"We have also taken steps to support the resumption of a few very targeted and specific areas. We recognise the importance of key life events such as weddings and the importance of religious activities and worship to our spiritual needs. Therefore, we have allowed greater numbers of up to 100 persons to attend each of these events, in multiple zones or time slots of at most 50 persons each to limit potential risk exposure. Earlier, we had also allowed the resumption of physical exercise classes in common community spaces, and allowed an increase in capacity for cinemas and leisure attractions such as the Zoo and Bird Park. Museums and libraries have also re-opened. We are piloting live performances to prepare us to eventually be able to resume such activities safely."
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00014,2020-10-05-T-003,14,Gan Kim Yong,Ms Jessica Tan has asked what can be expected on further easing of measures going forward and when this can be done; and I understand Ms Foo Mee Har would like to know whether the social and dining group size limit of five persons will be reviewed. All these are very important questions that we ask ourselves constantly.
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00015,2020-10-05-T-003,15,Gan Kim Yong,"Sir, if all of us continue to work together and keep our guard up even as more activities resume, we will be able to keep the pandemic under control and progress towards further opening up our economy and society steadily. For instance, we could allow for general group sizes larger than five, so that larger families or groups of friends could meet and have meals together. We are particularly concerned about dining as we need to remove our masks so as to eat and drink, but we tend to also talk at the same time. The risk is considerably higher than activities which we can keep our masks on and maintain a safe distance."
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00016,2020-10-05-T-003,16,Gan Kim Yong,"We have begun pilots of events and activities with a larger number of attendees, such as trade exhibitions, conferences and religious worship to assess whether we can maintain effective precautions and safe distancing measures. If these pilots are successful, we will be able to use the lessons learnt to allow more large-scale events to proceed. We will also continue to facilitate further opening up for overseas travel in a safe and calibrated manner, which Minister Ong Ye Kung will talk about later in greater detail later."
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00017,2020-10-05-T-003,17,Gan Kim Yong,"The low number of community cases currently is not accidental but has come about due to our collective hard work and sacrifices. Even as we move towards Phase Three, the new normal will be different from what we were used to in the pre-COVID days. The MTF is working on a road map towards Phase Three and we will share more details when we are ready in the coming weeks."
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00018,2020-10-05-T-003,18,Gan Kim Yong,"As overseas travel restrictions are progressively eased and more activities resume, it has become even more critical that each of us plays our part to exercise social responsibility and adhere to the safe management measures, in order to keep our family and friends safe as we progress towards Phase Three."
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00019,2020-10-05-T-003,19,Speaker,Mr Louis Ng.
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00020,2020-10-05-T-003,20,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Thank you, Sir. I thank the Minister for the response. I note that we are now at about 50% of our work-from-home policy, but I think Minister Lawrence Wong originally said that we should embrace working from home even after the circuit breaker ends. So, can I just check whether the Government still stands by that statement?"
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00021,2020-10-05-T-003,21,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Second, I think working from home has allowed more fathers to play an active role in child care-giving duties. I am just wondering whether the Government has studies or will be studying whether our work-from-home policies can contribute towards levelling the child care-giving duties at home and hence, tackling this gender stereotype?"
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00022,2020-10-05-T-003,22,Gan Kim Yong,"I thank the Member. Let me answer the first question. Working from home will continue to be default, but we do accept and acknowledge that there are challenges both from the employers as well as from the employees' perspective. Some employees' homes may not be conducive for working from home. Therefore, we made some arrangements and provided flexibility to allow the employers and the employees to work out better, more flexible arrangements, but subject to the criteria that I have just mentioned – no more than 50% of all employees who are working from home today, can go back to the office; and for those who are working from home today, not more than half of their time should be spent in the workplace; and they should still continue to work from home if they can."
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00023,2020-10-05-T-003,23,Gan Kim Yong,"It is a flexible arrangement; we want to provide some flexibility for the workers and the employers. We also recognise that some employers do need to consult their employees, they still need to have face-to-face interactions and meetings. This is also part of the process of team bonding and is critical among the employees. We cannot totally do away with the face-to-face, physical meetings and interactions amongst employees and employers. So, we provide some flexibility but we still encourage employers and employees to work out the arrangements and to allow employees to stay at home, work from home, as much as possible. This will help to reduce overcrowding in the workplaces and at the same time, also reduce the congestion on the roads and on public transport. These are important."
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00024,2020-10-05-T-003,24,Gan Kim Yong,"As I had mentioned in my reply, even after the COVID-19 pandemic is over, whenever that happens, we will continue to encourage this flexible working arrangement. Through this period of COVID-19, we have found that working from home has a lot of advantages, like Mr Louis Ng has mentioned. You can spend more time with your family and fathers can also play a bigger role in the family setting. But this is a separate issue on family matters, which is probably more appropriate for the Member to file a separate Parliamentary Question (PQ) addressed to MSF, rather than for MOH to respond specifically."
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00025,2020-10-05-T-003,25,Gan Kim Yong,"But generally, we will continue to encourage working from home and we will continue to provide flexibility to allow flexible work arrangements between the employer and the employees."
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00026,2020-10-05-T-003,26,Speaker,"A reminder to Members to keep the supplementary questions relevant to the PQs, please. Mr Louis Chua."
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00027,2020-10-05-T-003,27,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"I thank the Minister for the detailed explanation. Specific to the roadmap that Minister had mentioned that he would be sharing over the next couple weeks, may I ask, firstly, if there will be additional parameters or guidance given to businesses and individuals such that they will be able to make their planning in advance? For example, earlier, we allowed up to 50% of the employees to work from the office, but I think that was only given five days in advance of the 28 September date."
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00028,2020-10-05-T-003,28,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"The other matter is in relation to my question on the Government's risk assessment. One specific measure would be relating to the DORSCON status. I note that we have been in DORSCON Orange since 7 February earlier this year, and remain in DORSCON Orange today, even though the number of cases has gone from about more than 1,000 a day, to right now, less than 10. Is that something which the Government will review in order to provide us with a more handy reference guide in terms of where we stand in the risk assessment?"
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00029,2020-10-05-T-003,29,Gan Kim Yong,"I thank the Member. This is a very important question. So, I thank him for the opportunity to explain and elaborate. For employment practices, we are working very closely with MOM and MTI to engage the various stakeholders. Because different sectors will have different challenges and we are working through these challenges with them. You would have noticed that for some of the announcements, the notice period is very short, basically because there is really no need to meet any deadline. For example, when you allow workers to go back to work – you can start on Monday, you can start next week, you can start next month. It is not a requirement that you must get them to go back to work and therefore, there is really no need for a lead time to prepare. You can take as long as you need to prepare yourselves, to discuss with your employees how to introduce this flexible arrangement. So, it is an on-going process."
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00030,2020-10-05-T-003,30,Gan Kim Yong,"In fact, many of the measures, you would notice, we do not accumulate them into a big package and then announce them at once, so that there are many changes at one go. We work with the sector leads to discuss how to help them, how to solve some of the challenges. As and when these issues are addressed and solved, we move ahead. Some of them may not even require a specific public announcement because it may be very sector-specific and so we would just discuss with the sector. When we come to some common understanding to make sure that safe management measures can be put in place, and we proceed with it."
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00031,2020-10-05-T-003,31,Gan Kim Yong,"So, these are differentiated approaches that we have adopted."
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00032,2020-10-05-T-003,32,Gan Kim Yong,"With regard to the DORSCON level, we have to always bear in mind that, as I have mentioned before, DORSCON level is not just determined by the number of cases alone. At this moment, particularly, we have to be very mindful that while the number of cases in Singapore is low, the cases around us, in other parts of the world, are still rising. Therefore, we cannot let our guards down. I will continue to maintain DORSCON Orange for the time being until we are quite confident that the global situation is under control."
2020-10-05-T-003-S-00033,2020-10-05-T-003,33,Gan Kim Yong,"As I had mentioned in my reply, we will be opening up our borders. We will need to continue to encourage more travels because Singapore is a hub city. So, we need to ensure that our travel hub and business hub status do not get undermined. I should not go into too much detail on this because Minister Ong Ye Kung is all ready to speak on this. I will leave it to him to elaborate. Suffice to say that until the world is safe, we will not be safe. Therefore, we have to continue to maintain the DORSCON level and to keep our guards up, so that we can continue to keep the number of cases low, especially in the community."
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00034,2020-10-05-T-004,34,Murali Pillai,asked the Minister for Home Affairs following the judgment of the High Court in
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00035,2020-10-05-T-004,35,Tan Wu Meng,asked the Minister for Home Affairs in respect of the High Court judgment in
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00036,2020-10-05-T-004,36,Tan Wu Meng,asked the Minister for Home Affairs over the last five years (a) what percentage of cases of theft as an employee has a foreign domestic worker been the accused; (b) what proportion of the above has (i) been charged in Court (ii) proceeded to trial (iii) been convicted and (iv) been acquitted respectively; and (c) what proportion of each subgroup above has had legal representation.
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00037,2020-10-05-T-004,37,Vikram Nair,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether there are any updates on its internal reviews of what happened in Ms Parti Liyani's case, and in particular the police's handling of the matter."
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00038,2020-10-05-T-004,38,Leong Mun Wai,asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether he will appoint a committee of inquiry consisting of members not affiliated to the Government to conduct a public inquiry into the conduct of the Singapore Police Force and Attorney-General's Chambers with regard to Ms Parti Liyani's case.
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00039,2020-10-05-T-004,39,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the Ministry will consider allowing foreign domestic workers and other work permit holders to be accompanied by non-legal personnel in Police interviews, similar to the Appropriate Adult Scheme."
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00040,2020-10-05-T-004,40,Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Home Affairs what has gone wrong in the chain of events related to the case of Ms Parti Liyani and what are the findings and outcomes of the review.
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00041,2020-10-05-T-004,41,Derrick Goh,asked the Minister for Home Affairs what are the root causes that led to the procedural lapses on the part of the Police in
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00042,2020-10-05-T-004,42,Vikram Nair,asked the Minister for Law whether there are any updates on the Ministry's internal reviews of what happened in Ms Parti Liyani's case and in particular the handling of the matter by the Attorney-General's Chambers.
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00043,2020-10-05-T-004,43,Leong Mun Wai,asked the Minister for Law in light of the Parti Liyani case (a) whether an expedited trial process can be created for economically vulnerable foreign accused persons; (b) whether the honorarium for volunteer lawyers under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme can be increased to signify their contributions; (c) whether an Office of Public Defender can be created to provide legal assistance to accused persons in Singapore; and (d) whether there are any steps being taken to strengthen the interpreter service in the Singapore Police Force.
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00044,2020-10-05-T-004,44,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"asked the Minister for Law whether the Government will consider providing direct legal aid to vulnerable persons or those with lesser financial means who are charged with criminal offences, in light of concerns raised about access to justice and adequate legal representation for such persons, following the case of"
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00045,2020-10-05-T-004,45,Lim Biow Chuan,asked the Minister for Law how many State Court judges have previously worked as prosecutors in the Attorney-General's Chambers and whether the Ministry will review the policy of separation of duties.
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00046,2020-10-05-T-004,46,Derrick Goh,asked the Minister for Law with regard to the case of
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00047,2020-10-05-T-004,47,Desmond Tan,"Mr Speaker, may I seek your permission to take Question Nos 4 to 11, on behalf of the Minister for Home Affairs and Question Nos 12 to 16 on behalf of the Minister for Law together, please."
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00048,2020-10-05-T-004,48,Speaker,Please proceed.
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00049,2020-10-05-T-004,49,Desmond Tan,"The agencies have considered the High Court judgment and are conducting reviews. These reviews are still in progress. As indicated by the Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law, a Ministerial Statement will be made to address the questions raised by Members after the reviews are completed. This is expected to be done at the November sitting."
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00050,2020-10-05-T-004,50,Murali Pillai,"If I may, Sir, I would like to ask the hon Minister of State, in relation to the scope of the review by the relevant agencies, what exactly is the scope of the review, and in particular, whether the subject matter of the Parliamentary Questions (PQs) in Question Nos 4 to 16 in the Order Paper, and the implications of the judgment as set out in these questions, would be covered in the review. And I have two further supplementary questions, Mr Speaker, Sir."
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00051,2020-10-05-T-004,51,Speaker,"Can you keep the supplementary questions in two, as I had mentioned at the last sitting?"
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00052,2020-10-05-T-004,52,Murali Pillai,"Yes, Sir. In relation to the issue about the disciplinary proceedings that has been commenced by Ms Parti Liyani – this was something that happened subsequent to the filing of my PQ. So, if it carries on, I wonder whether the hon Minister anticipates that he would be in a position to deal with the case and make the Statement in November 2020, if there is a prospect that leave be given for disciplinary proceedings to carry on which as the hon Minister would know, would involve the Court, and there could be a notion of sub judice in those circumstances."
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00053,2020-10-05-T-004,53,Speaker,Minister Shanmugam.
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00054,2020-10-05-T-004,54,K Shanmugam,"Sir, as regard to the questions and whether we will cover them, I will hope to cover the questions that have been raised and if I have not covered any particular part, Members can further ask some clarifications."
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00055,2020-10-05-T-004,55,K Shanmugam,"On the disciplinary proceedings, no decision has been made by the Court, and I prefer to wait until the Court has heard and decided the matter, which is, I think, in a week or so, before I comment on it."
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00056,2020-10-05-T-004,56,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister for Home Affairs that given the errors which have occurred at every level of the criminal justice system, is the independent review going to be considered within his Ministerial Statement to be delivered in November?"
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00057,2020-10-05-T-004,57,K Shanmugam,"Sir, as I have indicated, let me finish the reviews, deal with that, present an account in Parliament, and then Mr Leong can ask his questions."
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00058,2020-10-05-T-004,58,Leong Mun Wai,"Thank you, Minister."
2020-10-05-T-004-S-00059,2020-10-05-T-004,59,Speaker,Ms Yeo Wan Ling.
2020-10-05-T-005-S-00060,2020-10-05-T-005,60,Yeo Wan Ling,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what are the considerations behind the Ministry's punitive actions against the employer for the illegal deployment of Ms Parti Liyani as a foreign domestic worker; and (b) whether the actions taken are consistent with similar cases in the past.
2020-10-05-T-005-S-00061,2020-10-05-T-005,61,Gan Siow Huang,"In determining punitive actions for illegal deployment, MOM's key considerations are the degree to which the well-being of the foreign domestic worker has been compromised, and the extent of the illegal deployment. Ms Parti Liyani's case of illegal deployment was handled by MOM in accordance with these considerations."
2020-10-05-T-005-S-00062,2020-10-05-T-005,62,Gan Siow Huang,"At the conclusion of MOM's investigations in May 2018, in consultation with the Attorney-General's Chambers or AGC, the Ministry took no further action against Mr Liew. A Caution was issued to Mrs Liew and an Advisory Notice to Mr Karl Liew. The actions taken against the three individuals were in line with actions taken by the Ministry against similar cases in the past."
2020-10-05-T-005-S-00063,2020-10-05-T-005,63,Gan Siow Huang,"From 2017 to 2019, there was an average of 550 complaints of illegal deployment of foreign domestic workers each year. Of these, MOM took actions against an average of 155 employers per year for illegally deploying their foreign domestic workers. About 60 of them were issued with an Advisory Notice; 80 were issued with a Caution. On average, 16 employers were issued with financial penalties each year, ranging from $3,300 to $24,000."
2020-10-05-T-005-S-00064,2020-10-05-T-005,64,Gan Siow Huang,There is a review on-going for this particular case regarding Ms Parti Liyani's illegal deployment arising from the High Court's observations. MOM will give an update when the review is completed in due course.
2020-10-05-T-005-S-00065,2020-10-05-T-005,65,Yeo Wan Ling,"I thank the Minister of State for her response. Mr Speaker, Sir, I declare that I am the Director with the NTUC ARU unit. Usually, an employment agreement ties an employer with an employee legally. So, in this case, I understand that for Ms Parti Liyani, warning letters were issued to Mrs Liew as well as to Mr Karl Liew who were not her employers. So, in this case, may I ask if the MOM will be reviewing this and to see if the MOM would also be responding to why the letters were actually written to Mrs Liew as well as Mr Karl Liew?"
2020-10-05-T-005-S-00066,2020-10-05-T-005,66,Gan Siow Huang,"In light of the particular vulnerability of foreign domestic workers, we will review our punishment framework and action will be taken against employers in similar illegal deployment cases, regardless of whether they are aware of the illegal deployment. This is to remind the employers that they are ultimately accountable for their foreign domestic workers and should take steps to ensure that their households' deployment of the foreign domestic workers do not contravene the law."
2020-10-05-T-005-S-00067,2020-10-05-T-005,67,Speaker,Mr Louis Ng.
2020-10-05-T-005-S-00068,2020-10-05-T-005,68,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Thank you, Sir. I thank the Minister of State for the reply as well. I understand that the foreign domestic workers or FDWs can be deployed outside their registered address if they are looking after the young children and the senior parents or the elderly parents of the employers. Could I ask whether moving forward, MOM can require a documented consent from the FDW if they are going to be deployed outside the registered address? That way, I think it can sort of resolve some of the disputes that have been raised at MOM level."
2020-10-05-T-005-S-00069,2020-10-05-T-005,69,Gan Siow Huang,"Mr Speaker, I thank the hon Member for the question. The answer is yes. Currently, employers are required to notify MOM, if they intend to deploy their foreign domestic workers to an address that is different from what is stated in the work permit, particularly if they require the foreign domestic worker to take care of their charges such as young children or the elderly at a relative's home. We are considering ways to enable the employer to be able to notify MOM more effectively so that we can track and approve such cases more consistently."
2020-10-05-T-005-S-00070,2020-10-05-T-005,70,Speaker,Mr Derrick Goh.
2020-10-05-T-005-S-00071,2020-10-05-T-005,71,Derrick Goh,"Sir, I have a question for Minister of State Gan. She mentioned earlier that the review of the cases was such that there was a Caution and Advisory that was issued by MOM that was in line with other similar cases in the past. Can Minister of State Gan clarify the reason for the additional review?"
2020-10-05-T-005-S-00072,2020-10-05-T-005,72,Gan Siow Huang,"MOM's actions against Mr Liew's family were based on the information available to our investigation officer during the period of the investigation from October 2017 to January 2018. We all know arising from the High Court proceedings, there were observations made and there is a requirement for MOM to take into consideration the additional information provided to us, and hence, the review is on-going."
2020-10-05-T-006-S-00073,2020-10-05-T-006,73,Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Minister for Transport in light of the recent incident of an SBS bus driver being abused (a) what more can the Ministry do to protect our bus captains and transport service staff; (b) how can high-risk passenger management procedures be enhanced; (c) whether a public awareness campaign directed at passengers to encourage respect for bus drivers and to outline expected behaviours while travelling on public transport can be explored; and (d) whether a code of conduct for passengers can be developed.
2020-10-05-T-006-S-00074,2020-10-05-T-006,74,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, bus captains are called ""captains"" for a reason. They are in charge of the bus and ensure the safety of commuters throughout their journeys. In today's context, this includes ensuring commuters wear masks, so that public transport does not become a transmission setting."
2020-10-05-T-006-S-00075,2020-10-05-T-006,75,Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I am very concerned about the recent cases of commuters verbally or physically abusing bus captains. The actions are wrong and unacceptable. I think people all know that, and it is not a matter of writing down a code of conduct. What we need is to take a clear stand. The Government, unions, public transport operators, and I would say the great majority of Singaporeans, we stand united in taking a zero-tolerance approach towards such abusive behaviours."
2020-10-05-T-006-S-00076,2020-10-05-T-006,76,Chee Hong Tat,"The large majority of commuters treat our public transport workers and other commuters with courtesy and respect. For the small number who think they can behave badly and get away with it, let me be clear – if you abuse our public transport workers, whether verbally or physically, be prepared to face the full consequences under the law."
2020-10-05-T-006-S-00077,2020-10-05-T-006,77,Chee Hong Tat,LTA will work with the unions and public transport operators to remind commuters of the serious consequences of abusing public transport workers and to raise awareness on the responsibilities of commuters on public transport.
2020-10-05-T-006-S-00078,2020-10-05-T-006,78,Chee Hong Tat,"Commuters too can play a part when such incidents happen. For the recent case where a bus captain was attacked by a commuter who refused to wear his mask properly, three good Samaritans helped to restrain the assailant before the Police arrived. I met two of them, Mr Clement Tan and Mr Muhammad Mu’tasim. Mr Melvin Yong was there too at the recent event; he was representing the National Transport Workers' Union. Mr Tan was a commando during his National Service and Mr Mu’tasim served his National Service as a Police officer. We applaud them for their courage to step forward and do the right thing."
2020-10-05-T-006-S-00079,2020-10-05-T-006,79,Chee Hong Tat,"The best way to protect our bus captains and recognise their contributions is to have the right societal culture, one that is based on respect for our frontline workers. Let us continue to support our public transport workers, so that they can work in a safe environment and provide an essential service to keep Singapore going."
2020-10-05-T-006-S-00080,2020-10-05-T-006,80,Speaker,Mr Saktiandi Supaat.
2020-10-05-T-006-S-00081,2020-10-05-T-006,81,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat for answering my question. I have one supplementary question."
2020-10-05-T-006-S-00082,2020-10-05-T-006,82,Saktiandi Supaat,"With regard to his zero-tolerance approach to the issue, I am reassured that LTA and MOT will take this zero-tolerance approach very strongly against commuters who get offensive against the bus captains. My question is  will LTA or MOT be willing to explore doing reviews just like what was done by the state of Queensland, Australia, for example, where they did an Improving Bus Drivers' Safety Review in 2018? They came up with a few measures introduced in 2018, including anti-shatter films, driver barriers and also a release of a code of conduct for passengers in the middle of 2018. They also ran a public awareness campaign from June to December 2018. So, my question is whether LTA or MOT will be willing to explore such a review and encourage best practices between our multiple bus operators? Because, after all, a bus driver who feels safe means all passengers are safe."
2020-10-05-T-006-S-00083,2020-10-05-T-006,83,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, I thank the hon Member for his supplementary question. I welcome his question. The zero-tolerance approach that we take is towards abusive behaviours by a small number of commuters. Mr Saktiandi has touched on a very important point, which is that this requires the collective effort of Government, operators, unions and I will add commuters too. All of us as stakeholders in this public transport system can play our role. For the on-going review that we are conducting with the operators and the unions, I would welcome further suggestions on what are some of the specific measures we can put in place to offer greater protection to our frontline workers."
2020-10-05-T-006-S-00084,2020-10-05-T-006,84,Speaker,Mr Melvin Yong.
2020-10-05-T-006-S-00085,2020-10-05-T-006,85,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Senior Minister of State for his reply and his assurance that the Government takes a serious view on abuse cases against our public transport workers while on duty."
2020-10-05-T-006-S-00086,2020-10-05-T-006,86,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,I declare myself as the Executive Secretary of the National Transport Workers' Union. The Union is currently working with the respective public transport operators to resume trials on installing a protective shield on our public buses.
2020-10-05-T-006-S-00087,2020-10-05-T-006,87,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Since the Senior Minister of State asked what other suggestions we may have, we aim to address the feedback and shortcoming surfaced in a previous trial in 2018, which the LTA was involved. I would like to ask if the LTA will support scaling the installation of such protective shields across all our public buses should the current trial find a suitable model to do so?"
2020-10-05-T-006-S-00088,2020-10-05-T-006,88,Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr Melvin Yong. This suggestion from the unions is currently being discussed with the operators. We would also take feedback from our bus captains because they are the ones who will be using this. When this safeguard is in place, they will be the ones who are going to use it daily. I think an important consideration when we ask the bus captains for their feedback, will be to ensure that the installation of these protective shields will not interfere with the safety when they are driving the buses. I think that is a very key consideration. We will also get their feedback, because I think previously the trials showed that when you put some of these protective shields in place, there was a bit of glare that affected the drivers, the bus captains. So, we will also have to look at that because, ultimately, this is for both the protection and safety of the bus captains and also for the safety of commuters."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00089,2020-10-05-T-007,89,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the next-generation ERP system allows for developers to create third-party applications; (b) whether the design of the on-board unit (OBU) be further streamlined for motorcyclists; and (c) whether the majority of the OBU's functions can be replaced by a smartphone in the future.
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00090,2020-10-05-T-007,90,Saktiandi Supaat,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the next-generation electronic road pricing (ERP) system is an open-source app-based device; (b) how will LTA allocate slots for installation of on-board units (OBU) to minimise queueing; (c) whether there is any replacement cost should the OBU get faulty after usage; and (d) in light of safety concerns about how the OBU's screen may be distracting to drivers, whether there can be an option to dim or turn off the display."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00091,2020-10-05-T-007,91,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether LTA will reduce the size and improve the design of the on-board units (OBUs) for all classes of vehicles for the next-generation ERP system to ensure safe use, avoid distraction to motorists and better interfacing with the vehicular dashboards and systems; and (b) whether LTA will assure Singaporeans that the price of the OBUs will be kept low and affordable."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00092,2020-10-05-T-007,92,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Mr Speaker, Sir, may I take Question Nos 19 to 21 together?"
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00093,2020-10-05-T-007,93,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00094,2020-10-05-T-007,94,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Thank you, Sir. Sir, Members have raised a few questions commonly asked by the public on the next-generation Electronic Road Pricing, or nexgen ERP system. Let me assure Members that in designing the system, LTA has carefully thought through these issues."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00095,2020-10-05-T-007,95,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The first question is why not process ERP payments using our smartphones? After all, we use it to pay all kinds of transactions, including charges at HDB and URA carparks."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00096,2020-10-05-T-007,96,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Technically, while this can be done, there will be many security and operational issues."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00097,2020-10-05-T-007,97,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"LTA consulted an inter-agency committee including the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, who advised that the core charging transactions and ERP data must be safely and securely processed with high assurance. The on-board units or OBUs, which is an integral part of the ERP system, have been designed to uphold the necessary protection for such purpose, and the security features are superior to that of a mobile phone. Hence, to better protect the system which contains the data of all motorists, we adopted the OBUs."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00098,2020-10-05-T-007,98,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"There are also operational issues. Motorists need to remember to bring their smartphones, ensure it is sufficiently charged, is connected to the cellular network and the ERP payment app is launched throughout the journey. There will bound to be numerous unintended failed transactions and inconveniences caused. Hence, LTA concluded that it is better to process payments through a dedicated and integrated OBU, similar to today’s in-vehicle unit or IU."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00099,2020-10-05-T-007,99,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The second question is about the design of the OBU. Sir, at this juncture, may I have your permission to show the OBU and IU units."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00100,2020-10-05-T-007,100,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00101,2020-10-05-T-007,101,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Thank you, Sir. So, if you compare, the OBU for motorcycles is only slightly larger than the current IU. The dimensions  for the current OBU is 14 cm x 8 cm x 5 cm versus the current IU which is 13 cm x 8 cm x 4 cm; so 1 cm difference. But I concede it may look a little bulky because of the larger screen – but it is actually good for people like me."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00102,2020-10-05-T-007,102,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"As for the OBUs for other vehicles, unlike for motorcycles, the processing unit will be installed below the dashboard and separated from the display unit on the screen. So, this is the processing unit but it is not going to be on your windscreen. It is actually going to be below the dashboard and it depends on the vehicle model where it will be put, but it will be out of sight. This is the processing unit and you can see that it has got ventilation, because it is actually a little CPU."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00103,2020-10-05-T-007,103,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The processing unit is separated from the display screen and the antenna – this is necessary because the OBU uses Global Navigation Satellite Technology and is, like I said, really a little computer. There will be safety and reliability issues to leave the processing unit on the dashboard when vehicles with enclosed spaces are parked under the hot sun, similar to how we will not expose our smartphones that same way."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00104,2020-10-05-T-007,104,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The OBU display unit will be mounted on the windscreen, and, actually, it is only slightly larger than the current IU. So, if Members look at this, it is about 3 cm longer but thinner. The current IU is 12 cm x 8 cm x 3 cm versus the OBU's display screen which is 15 cm x 8 cm x 2 cm."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00105,2020-10-05-T-007,105,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We are currently consulting the workshops and authorised motor vehicle agents on how best to install this display unit. The antenna is actually very small, so it will be on the windscreen, where your current IU is. But we are looking at how to best install the OBU so that the display unit can be installed in cars such that the blockage of the windscreen is minimal. Actually, this thing can be folded in, so that you will not see it if you do not want to see it. They are looking at how to do this better."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00106,2020-10-05-T-007,106,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"As to what information to show on the display unit, indeed, we will look at how to make sure that whatever information is shown and the way it is shown, it will not be distracting and it will not affect safety."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00107,2020-10-05-T-007,107,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"LTA intends to present a few options to gather public feedback. For example, the display can be kept black most of the time, and only display ERP charges paid when a transaction is effected. As a possible future upgrade, LTA is also studying whether information from the OBU can be pushed to our smartphones, then the smartphones can be used as the display screen instead."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00108,2020-10-05-T-007,108,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Ms He Ting Ru has asked a question for the next sitting on whether public consultation was done on the design – and we thought it is better we answer the question today. [Please refer to Note(s) for the text of the questions by Ms He Ting Ru1.] Where possible, our practice is to consult the public, but in this case, LTA faces some practical constraints."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00109,2020-10-05-T-007,109,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"This is a first-of-a-kind project – there is no similar system anywhere else in the world. LTA sought proposals through an international tender. Several designs were submitted, and LTA has to select the best from the point of view of performance, design and value-for-money. But after awarding the tender, LTA is contractually bound."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00110,2020-10-05-T-007,110,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"It could have specified that the winning tenderer has to conduct a major public consultation exercise and make significant changes to the design to take in public feedback, but that will add significant uncertainty which will delay the project and push up the tender prices."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00111,2020-10-05-T-007,111,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The first OBU will be free of charge for existing Singapore-registered vehicles. For new vehicles, the OBU would already be installed in the vehicle and form part of the overall cost of purchasing a new vehicle, as is the case with the IUs today."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00112,2020-10-05-T-007,112,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The pricing of OBU is still under consideration and LTA will release more details later including the warranty period of OBUs and information of the installation exercise. In allocating the slots for installation, we will ensure that there are sufficient installation points and give motorists ample notice to make their booking."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00113,2020-10-05-T-007,113,Speaker,Miss Cheryl Chan.
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00114,2020-10-05-T-007,114,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have two supplementary questions for Senior Minister of State Khor. The first one is, if the concern is around the data protection, because today, under the OneMotoring.sg, all the details about every driver's particulars as well as the vehicle particulars are already available. Can we consider using the legal framework or data protection framework so that there is no concern in terms of information leakage."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00115,2020-10-05-T-007,115,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"The second supplementary question that I have is, because eventually there is a consideration, as Senior Minister of State had pointed out, to push this into the smartphone app, can we bring forward this implementation to make sure that we do not have to put on an additional gadgets on the dashboard or any part of the car frames."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00116,2020-10-05-T-007,116,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"I want to thank the Member for the two supplementary questions. Firstly, with regards to data integrity, data security and protection, indeed, she is right to say that, for the ERP backend system, we will have data to more than some one million or so motorists – specific data. What we are doing is that the core charging function can only be done through the OBU, no third-party apps, not done through the mobile phone, simply because of security reasons and data security as well as reliability."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00117,2020-10-05-T-007,117,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The OBU interfaces, or speaks directly, to the backend ERP system and is able to access this."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00118,2020-10-05-T-007,118,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We do not allow third-party apps or mobile phones to do the core charging function because there may be a compromise on the data – leakage, as well as the fact that there could be hacking, spoofing of the location and you can have fraudulent charging. For a system like that, you would want to maintain confidence in the system for our motorists as well as the fact that motorists must be confident that the vehicles' specific data will not be leaked. That is the reason why this is done."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00119,2020-10-05-T-007,119,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"With regards to the second question about whether we can actually bring forward the timeline to look into whether we can allow data to be pushed one way, from the OBU to mobile phone and therefore, allow the mobile phone to replace the OBU display screen. What we want to do is to ensure a smooth implementation of the next-generation ERP system. The current ERP system is already more than 20 years old, it is reaching its end of its operational life and, in fact, is increasingly difficult and actually very expensive to maintain. Some of the parts are not going to be manufactured anymore. So, there is an urgency, a need to implement the nexgen ERP."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00120,2020-10-05-T-007,120,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We have already announced the timeline, starting from next year, for 18 months to do the installation. So, what we want, is to ensure a smooth installation of the nexgen ERP. To do this, the display unit will be a standard issue. We also need time to work with the contractors and the consultants to come up with the programme to be able to push OBU's specific data to the mobile app. And we will do it to the mobile phone third-party apps via bluetooth. What it means is that, motorists also have to give specific permissions for this to be done, they can then opt to use this mobile phone as the display screen."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00121,2020-10-05-T-007,121,Speaker,Mr Melvin Yong.
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00122,2020-10-05-T-007,122,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Senior Minister of State for her reply or rather her show and tell. I have two supplementary questions. My first question is about the upcoming industry consultations that the LTA has planned, I would like to ask, what is the scope of this consultation and if the LTA is still open to doing a public consultation on the design of the onboard unit – perhaps for future considerations. Like my fellow colleague, Miss Cheryl Chan have said, a lot of vehicles today already have display panels in the vehicle, can we then find a way to connect the OBU with the display that is already in existence in the vehicle."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00123,2020-10-05-T-007,123,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"The second question I have pertains to the costs of embarking on a re-design of the OBU. In June 2019, when there was an online incident of a supposed design leak, LTA then had responded to state that the pictures were just illustrations used for an earlier study back in 2016. On 17 June last year, LTA stated through a Facebook post that the agency was still testing the equipment for the new ERP system, which has not been finalised. However, we also understand from Senior Minister of State's reply today that the LTA is contractually bound to the current OBU design after the tender award and any design changes would have cost implication."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00124,2020-10-05-T-007,124,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"Therefore, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State, what is the cost of re-designing the OBU at this current stage of the ERP contract and whether it would be more cost-effective to streamline the design now rather than embark on a redesign in the future."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00125,2020-10-05-T-007,125,Amy Khor Lean Suan,I want to thank the Member for his questions. I think it is useful to clarify these.
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00126,2020-10-05-T-007,126,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Firstly, is with regard to what stage we are at, in terms of public consultation, which we said we will be doing for the installation of the display unit. Let me share that we have started consulting the workshops as well as the authorised motor vehicle agents to look at the installation, how best to do it, to take into account public feedback we have received, with regard for instance, the screen, you know, blocking the road view of the motorists; with regard to it being, you know, quite bulky and so on."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00127,2020-10-05-T-007,127,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"So, this is what we are doing, we need time to work this out with the workshops, as well as the authorised motor vehicle agent, simply because there are so many different designs, make or models of motor vehicles. So, once we have done this, we will share more details on our public consultation with respect to the installation of the display unit."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00128,2020-10-05-T-007,128,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"With regards to changing the OBU design at this stage, well, the fact is as the Member had said, we are contractually bound, so, any significant changes to the design of the OBU, will of course incur cost. Cost is actually subjected to negotiation."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00129,2020-10-05-T-007,129,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"But having said that, we are open to taking feedback from the public, which we have done and we are going to do. One of the things we will do, is with regards to the Graphical User Interface or GUI, what to put on the display screen. LTA, taking into account public feedback, will come up with a few options. Then, we will go out to do a public consultation again, to determine, you know, what are the important information to display with regards to driver safety, distractions and so on and so forth. So, that will be done."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00130,2020-10-05-T-007,130,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"In addition, we will see, as much feedback as possible, we will take into account within the bounds of our contractual obligations as well as the fact that you have to consider for instance, impact on the project timeline, technical viability is another other one, and of course safety requirements. So, the other one which we are doing and which we have taken feedback on, is of course with regard to the use of the mobile phone as a display screen. So, this is something that we are studying and we are looking to push this out. The Member Miss Cheryl Chan had asked if we do it as early as possible. As I have said, we want a smooth implementation of the nexgen ERP, let the system stabilise, we will look at this and then when it is possible, we will be able to offer it to the motorists and they can replace their display units. For new car owners, they can actually opt for that, in future."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00131,2020-10-05-T-007,131,Speaker,Ms He Ting Ru.
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00132,2020-10-05-T-007,132,He Ting Ru,"I thank the Minister of State for her answers to the questions. One supplementary question I would like to ask is basically, the tender was awarded in 2016 as we understand. That was four years ago, technology moves very quickly these days. So, I am just wondering what were the tender specifications that basically resulted in us being bound by the design that we committed to four years ago, rather than allowing for flexibility to update that as and when we went along? And whether we will consider this in future tenders and future calls for tender to allow us to have greater flexibility given that technology moves really quickly? And that, we do not inadvertently as in this case, end up incurring costs if we need to change the design as and when with public consultation and when technology moves along."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00133,2020-10-05-T-007,133,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Let me thank the Member for her additional supplementary question on this issue again. I do not have the details of the contract, obviously, but I would think that, as with all contracts, there will always be certain specifications that have to be put out. Otherwise, people cannot tender and you need to give contractors or tenderers some amount of certainty."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00134,2020-10-05-T-007,134,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"But within those limits, I am pretty sure and I understand that there is room for some consultation. And in fact, they have done this. As the Member said it was in 2016 that the contract was awarded, it was early 2016. The tender was called in 2014. As I have said it is a first-of-its-kind project, it is an international tender and there is no reference point so we did take a bit of time to look through the various tenders and proposals before we awarded it."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00135,2020-10-05-T-007,135,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Within that time frame, we had consulted and the contractors themselves have also done some internal consultations as well as even engage, for instance, NTU, to do a study, a human factor study on the GUI features – what to display and so on. I understand that they even had a driver trial experiments to look at the safety of the GUI features. We have also got an inter-Ministry committee that we consulted as I have shared earlier. And in fact, we also did two independent reviews on the features, the security features of the OBU. That is the reason why we have adopted what we have recently shared – that the OBU integrated with the ERP backend system and no third-party apps or use of mobile phone for the core charging functions."
2020-10-05-T-007-S-00136,2020-10-05-T-007,136,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"So, indeed, we are mindful that we have to take into account technology improvements and advancements which the contractors would have to do it. But understanding that this is a very, very significant and large project, I think Members will also appreciate why the timeline is actually stretched."
2020-10-05-T-008-S-00137,2020-10-05-T-008,137,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry with regard to the Report of the Auditor-General, wherein it stated that test checks found that JTC premises may have been sublet to about 26,000 business entities without JTC's approval (a) whether JTC has completed investigations into all identified business entities and confirmed cases; and (b) what are the penalties imposed on affected tenants, lessees and sub-lessees."
2020-10-05-T-008-S-00138,2020-10-05-T-008,138,Tan See Leng,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the hon Member of Parliament Mr Louis Chua for his question. The Auditor-General’s Office (AGO) had, in its 2020 Report, identified 26,000 instances of potential unauthorised subletting because 26,000 business entities had indicated JTC premises as their registered addresses even though they were not JTC’s lessees, tenants or authorised sublessees."
2020-10-05-T-008-S-00139,2020-10-05-T-008,139,Tan See Leng,"JTC is investigating the entities highlighted by AGO. So far, JTC has found that 1,900 of them are deregistered entities and 700 of them are on divested properties where JTC’s subletting policies do not apply. There are another 12,400 related entities of JTC lessees and tenants. For these 12,400 related entities, even if there was subletting of space, there would not have been any potential loss of revenue as the subletting fees would not have applied. Together, if we add them all up, these 15,000 entities account for around 60% of all the entities that AGO has highlighted."
2020-10-05-T-008-S-00140,2020-10-05-T-008,140,Tan See Leng,"For the remaining 40% of the entities – there are about 11,000 of them – JTC has now prioritised investigations for them. Based on preliminary investigations, JTC has found that a significant number of them are using JTC premises as their registered address even though they are not physically operating out of the premises. Again, since they are not operating out of these premises, these cases do not involve any unauthorised subletting of space."
2020-10-05-T-008-S-00141,2020-10-05-T-008,141,Tan See Leng,"To date, JTC has confirmed around 400 cases of unauthorised subletting. JTC will continue and will complete its investigations by the first half of 2021."
2020-10-05-T-008-S-00142,2020-10-05-T-008,142,Tan See Leng,"JTC is strengthening its processes as well as its inspection regime and it will make use of data analytics to better detect and reduce future incidences of unauthorised subletting. It will take enforcement action against lessees or tenants for confirmed cases of unauthorised subletting. Depending on the severity and circumstances of the breach, enforcement actions will range from financial measures to recover the sublet fees owing to JTC, to legal action to repossess the site from recalcitrant occupants."
2020-10-05-T-008-S-00143,2020-10-05-T-008,143,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"I thank the Second Minister for his response. I have two follow-up questions, the first of which is in relation to  the 400 cases thus far identified. In terms of these cases, what would the penalties be and what would have been the loss in the sublet fees that JTC would have collected. The second supplementary question is in terms of the sharpening of the analysis to improve the inspection regime, specifically with the use of data analytics which the Second Minister has affirmed. What has really changed between now and then? Since the implementation of this change, has there been more cases of unauthorised subletting that have been discovered and how would the Ministry assure the efficacy and efficiency of such a new regime?"
2020-10-05-T-008-S-00144,2020-10-05-T-008,144,Tan See Leng,"Mr Speaker, Sir, a s I have alluded to earlier, the 400 cases were detected as a result of fairly stringent actions undertaken by JTC. As to the extent of the sublet fees and the unauthorised part, it is still a subject of further investigations. We will take all active steps and measures to recover these fees that are owing and, in cases where clear-cut illicit subletting has been proven, we will not hesitate to take legal action to enforce it."
2020-10-05-T-008-S-00145,2020-10-05-T-008,145,Tan See Leng,"On the part about using data analytics, indeed, in terms of the understanding of the ability to register a business address using a premise, this is one of the policies which we need to tighten and realign. Having said that, in terms of the 11,000 that we are now actively looking into, many of the measures that we are taking actually draw a fine balance between taking a proactive step towards encouraging new businesses to start up and to set up and, of course, we need to draw a fine balance between enforcing to make sure that these businesses do not think that every single one that is setting up we treat them as if they are out to game the system itself."
2020-10-05-T-008-S-00146,2020-10-05-T-008,146,Tan See Leng,"So, to that end, the measures that we have taken are in terms of looking through the register of addresses, going into frequent and more intense inspection; in 2019, we had conducted about 1,900 inspections. But, of course, these are on a regular time basis to inspect the premises whether there is illegal subletting. Now, over and above what we had done in 2019, on top of the regular inspections, we are also going into random spot checks as well. So, the intensity of the checks, audits and inspections has also increased significantly."
2020-10-05-T-008-S-00147,2020-10-05-T-008,147,Tan See Leng,"At this particular point in time, I am not at liberty to share what is the frequency of these checks and inspections. But suffice to say that this is at a much more focused pace and, obviously, we are going to put a lot more effort and work into tightening it."
2020-10-05-T-009-S-00148,2020-10-05-T-009,148,Pritam Singh,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in view of the Auditor-General's Report for FY 2019/2020 (a) how many companies have received the Enterprise Development Grant (EDG) so far; (b) what action will Enterprise Singapore (ESG) undertake to ensure strict compliance to the minimum 30% local shareholding criterion for all future cases; and (c) whether ESG claws back grant monies from recipient companies as a matter of practice when there a substantial change in local shareholding before an EDG-funded project is completed.
2020-10-05-T-009-S-00149,2020-10-05-T-009,149,Low Yen Ling,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the Enterprise Development Grant (EDG) is part of Enterprise Singapore’s (ESG) toolkit to help businesses grow their core capabilities, innovate and internationalise. As of September 2020, ESG has supported almost 5,000 EDG projects. In administering the grants, ESG strives to strike a balance between ensuring the robustness of the governance process and the ease with which local enterprises can apply for support."
2020-10-05-T-009-S-00150,2020-10-05-T-009,150,Low Yen Ling,"Checks are performed during the grant approval process to ensure the EDG applicants meet the minimum 30% local shareholding criterion. Thereafter, the grant conditions require all EDG recipients to inform ESG of any changes in the application information during the course of the project. If recipients are found to be in breach of the grant conditions, including the 30% local shareholding criterion, ESG will withhold or, if disbursement had been made, ESG will claw back the grant. ESG will also subject these companies to enhanced scrutiny for future applications."
2020-10-05-T-009-S-00151,2020-10-05-T-009,151,Low Yen Ling,"For the case raised in the AGO Report, no disbursement had been made to the company. The company has also been placed on ESG’s watchlist for stricter scrutiny for future grant applications."
2020-10-05-T-009-S-00152,2020-10-05-T-009,152,Low Yen Ling,"ESG agrees with AGO’s recommendation and has commenced a second round of checks on shareholding eligibility before grant disbursement. ESG is also studying the feasibility of improving such checks using tools, such as data analytics."
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00153,2020-10-05-T-010,153,Pritam Singh,"asked the Minister for Manpower in light of the Auditor-General's Report for FY 2019/2020, (a) whether the Ministry will be undertaking a more wide-scale review of the number of successful career conversions and Professional Conversion Programme outcomes thus far; and (b) what will be the extent of sample checks to be conducted on grant Programme Partners by Workforce Singapore or the Ministry in future."
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00154,2020-10-05-T-010,154,Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) provide training and salary support to employers who hire and reskill mid-career jobseekers for new PMET jobs with good prospects. WSG currently works with 30 programme partners, including Trade Associations and Chambers and Institutes of Higher Learning, to run close to 100 PCPs in about 30 sectors."
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00155,2020-10-05-T-010,155,Josephine Teo,"A significant majority of our PCP participants have enjoyed good employment outcomes. About nine in 10 participants remained in employment 24 months after being placed and about seven in 10 earned higher wages after starting their new jobs. The Auditor-General's Office (AGO)’s audit findings do not call into question the impact of these programmes on the participants, but have highlighted issues with the practices of WSG’s programme partners and its supervision of them."
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00156,2020-10-05-T-010,156,Josephine Teo,"In the AGO's Report for the Financial Year 2019/2020, it was highlighted that three of WSG’s programme partners did not carry out adequate verification of career conversion for 11 disbursement cases involving 15 PCP participants. There was no doubt that the training had been properly carried out but AGO noted that programme partners had not documented how the participants’ previous and current job scopes were different, which is the requirement for the training to be supported under the PCP. WSG has reviewed each of these cases and verified that all 15 participants changed their job scopes and successfully converted into new job roles through their respective PCPs. In addition, to address the AGO's concern about the adequacy of its guidelines, WSG will be developing a new PCP guide for all its programme partners by the end of the year. The document will include guidelines on how career conversion should be consistently assessed, as well as the critical information that programme partners should report to ensure better and consistent monitoring of PCP outcomes."
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00157,2020-10-05-T-010,157,Josephine Teo,"AGO also checked 16 PCPs managed by eight programme partners and found inadequate monitoring of programme outcomes for 10 PCPs. The programme partners did not collect the complete set of performance indicators required by WSG and also had varying practices in collecting the information. WSG has since reviewed and streamlined its approach. Henceforth, programme partners will focus on the most important outcome indicators, namely, the number of placements and number of participants who completed training, both of which are straightforward to monitor and report."
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00158,2020-10-05-T-010,158,Josephine Teo,"Beyond the cases studied by AGO, WSG, on its own, initiated a comprehensive check of over 15,000 placements for similar lapses. This is the entire universe of PCP placements since 2016. Although the review will only be fully completed this year, WSG has not uncovered further lapses or systemic anomalies thus far."
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00159,2020-10-05-T-010,159,Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, ensuring good governance and outcomes for our programmes is a key priority for MOM and WSG. WSG has reiterated to all programme partners the need to adhere to the PCP administration process, including assessment of career conversion for participants, as well as the importance of close tracking and timely reporting of key programme outcome indicators. To ensure compliance with these requirements, WSG will conduct sampling checks of up to 20% of PCP placements by its programme partners on a regular basis."
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00160,2020-10-05-T-010,160,Josephine Teo,WSG remains committed to working closely with its programme partners to ensure sound governance and effectiveness of PCPs. It will also continue to strengthen its supervision over them.
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00161,2020-10-05-T-010,161,Speaker,Mr Pritam Singh.
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00162,2020-10-05-T-010,162,Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister for the reply to my Parliamentary Question. The PCP programme, as carried out under WSG, is a critical one to ensure that Singaporeans, especially PMETs, get into good jobs, and to that end, I think all of us have a deep interest in the programmes' success."
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00163,2020-10-05-T-010,163,Pritam Singh,"I would like to focus on one of the observations of the AGO which is at page 63 of the Report. I believe Minister covered it in her reply, where a test check – and AGO cannot check every case; they do test checks – and the test check revealed that 11 out of 56 cases found that there was inadequate verification of career conversion for trainees. The AGO also noted cases ""where the trainees' previous and current job scope appeared to be similar"". Those are the exact words."
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00164,2020-10-05-T-010,164,Pritam Singh,"My specific questions are which were the three programme partners identified in the AGO Report? Minister, I believe, in her reply mentioned that there is an on-going review of all PCP matters. I think this number is 15,000 placements. How prevalent is the problem of a similar job scope, after a PMET worker has undertaken a PCP programme?"
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00165,2020-10-05-T-010,165,Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member Mr Pritam Singh for his questions and also for acknowledging the critical importance of the Professional Conversion Programmes in helping our PMETs move on to new job roles, most of the time outside of their existing companies and industries, but sometimes within the same company or within the same industry."
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00166,2020-10-05-T-010,166,Josephine Teo,He acknowledged their importance and raised the question of the findings by the AGO on the career conversion.
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00167,2020-10-05-T-010,167,Josephine Teo,"I should emphasise this – the AGO noted that the career conversion was not well documented but it did not say that there was no career conversion. And, on subsequent checks, WSG established the clear fact that there was career conversion and it was a question of the programme partner not having properly documented this."
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00168,2020-10-05-T-010,168,Josephine Teo,"So, it was not that the job scopes did not change substantially. It was simply the fact that the programme partners did not document them properly and they did not have a very consistent way of assessing the degree of career conversion and the degree of change of the job scopes across different programme partners."
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00169,2020-10-05-T-010,169,Josephine Teo,"I would just want to emphasise this that there was, in fact, the change in job scope. WSG's verification confirmed this and it was a question of documentation. That being the case, we focus on fixing the problem of documentation. And I think I have explained earlier on in my reply how we go about doing so."
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00170,2020-10-05-T-010,170,Speaker,Mr Pritam Singh.
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00171,2020-10-05-T-010,171,Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Speaker. I thank the Minister for that reply. I would assume, having read the AGO Report that there would have been some time for WSG to respond, as the Minister has in Parliament, in the AGO Report as to that particular matter of documentation – that, really, it is not that the outcome was not achieved but the documentation was not done properly."
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00172,2020-10-05-T-010,172,Pritam Singh,"I understand that. My query is, was there enough time for WSG to inform the AGO that it is looking into these findings of the AGO and, thereafter, the reply could have been in the AGO Report? Or whether there was not enough time? So, that is the first question. The second question was, as part of my original Supplementary Question, was about the identities of the three programme partners."
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00173,2020-10-05-T-010,173,Josephine Teo,"In the AGO Report, if we look at its reporting of findings in other Ministries, it is quite consistent. Even if the agencies have addressed the issue, it does not prevent the AGO from making the Report. That is the merit of the system – that regardless of the actions that have been taken up to follow up on the findings, the AGO's responsibility is to report them so that the public is aware that there were these lapses. We acknowledged the lapse and we fixed it."
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00174,2020-10-05-T-010,174,Josephine Teo,"As to the names of the three programme partners, certainly, if Mr Singh is very interested, we can provide it to him. But I think the question really is, ""Did the programme partners make a mistake in good faith or did they deliberately try to defraud the Government in some way?"" And if our assessment is that they deliberately attempted to try and defraud the Government in some way, then the appropriate action is to report them to the Police so that a complete investigation can be conducted. At the appropriate juncture, their identities will be made public."
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00175,2020-10-05-T-010,175,Josephine Teo,"But, in this case, it was an incident of the programme partners not having done a thorough job of documenting what, in fact, did happen. So, we do not as a matter of practice regularly name programme partners for sometimes administrative errors that they have committed."
2020-10-05-T-010-S-00176,2020-10-05-T-010,176,Speaker,Mr Alex Yam.
2020-10-05-T-011-S-00177,2020-10-05-T-011,177,Alex Yam,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance in view of the weak links highlighted annually in the Auditor-General's Reports (a) how does the Civil Service ensure that officers are adequately trained and supervised to meet the Government's procurement processes; and (b) whether officers handling tenders have to attend regular refresher courses to stay abreast with new regulations and processes.
2020-10-05-T-011-S-00178,2020-10-05-T-011,178,Alex Yam,
2020-10-05-T-011-S-00179,2020-10-05-T-011,179,Liang Eng Hwa,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance in view of the recurring lapses in IT controls highlighted in the latest Auditor-General's Report, whether there are inherent systemic issues within the public service and what effective measures will be taken to address the weaknesses."
2020-10-05-T-011-S-00180,2020-10-05-T-011,180,Indranee Rajah,"Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to answer Question Nos 25 and 26 together, in my response?"
2020-10-05-T-011-S-00181,2020-10-05-T-011,181,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2020-10-05-T-011-S-00182,2020-10-05-T-011,182,Indranee Rajah,"Let me first assure Members that, as mentioned in the Auditor-General’s reports, all the agencies take the audit observations seriously and are committed to making improvements. Actions have been taken at the whole-of-Government level to address the gaps identified."
2020-10-05-T-011-S-00183,2020-10-05-T-011,183,Indranee Rajah,"Mr Speaker, the Auditor-General’s Report for FY 2019/2020 highlighted weaknesses in IT controls, specifically in the areas of  first, review of privileged users’ activities; and second, management of account and user access rights. These observations were raised in previous Reports."
2020-10-05-T-011-S-00184,2020-10-05-T-011,184,Indranee Rajah,"To provide some context, I should first explain that the Government IT systems were built over time, beginning from when we first built IT systems in Ministries back in 1980s and eventually extending to all Ministries and also new Ministries and programme offices."
2020-10-05-T-011-S-00185,2020-10-05-T-011,185,Indranee Rajah,"Since then, the IT systems have been upgraded, refreshed or replaced to be more effective and efficient to cater to the requirements over the years. Consequently, we now have more than 2,000 Government IT systems built over the years, by different vendors and using different technologies. Each system has its way of logging user activities and of managing who can access the system. As the access controls are not linked across systems, when an officer moves to another portfolio, it requires a chain of manual adjustments to different systems, to remove obsolete access rights and create new access rights for the officer. The reliance on manual adjustments is prone to human errors."
2020-10-05-T-011-S-00186,2020-10-05-T-011,186,Indranee Rajah,"The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group or SNDGG is developing systems that will automate the processes involved and minimise errors. It will take some time to fully implement the solutions across the whole-of-Government because we need to implement the automated process in more than 2,000 IT systems."
2020-10-05-T-011-S-00187,2020-10-05-T-011,187,Indranee Rajah,"First, we are automating the review of privileged users’ activities. SNDGG has started a pilot with some agencies and the tool will be progressively deployed from January 2021. This will be fully implemented for high-priority systems by December 2022 and all remaining systems by December 2023."
2020-10-05-T-011-S-00188,2020-10-05-T-011,188,Indranee Rajah,"Second, we are automating the management of account and user access rights. SNDGG has made available a solution which can alert agencies to staff movements and role changes so that they can manually remove the user accounts that are no longer required. Five of the 38 agencies that have onboarded this system were audited by AGO and no lapses pertaining to account and user access rights management were found."
2020-10-05-T-011-S-00189,2020-10-05-T-011,189,Indranee Rajah,"SNDGG is in the midst of enhancing this solution, so that it can trigger automatic removal of unneeded user accounts and review of user access rights, once the staff movement or role change is updated in the HR records. This system will be implemented for 800 high-priority systems by December 2023 and all remaining systems by December 2024."
2020-10-05-T-011-S-00190,2020-10-05-T-011,190,Indranee Rajah,"When officers are freed up from manual tasks, they are better able to focus on aspects of cyber-security and data protection that cannot be replicated by a machine. SNDGG has stepped up efforts to educate public officers on the importance of strong ICT governance and security controls, and to have the right habits and instincts. All public officers are required to undergo annual cyber and data security awareness training."
2020-10-05-T-011-S-00191,2020-10-05-T-011,191,Indranee Rajah,"Next, on procurement and contract management, the recurrent lapses tend to be for more complex types of procurement – such as IT and construction, and in less straightforward cases, such as assessing price reasonableness for single bids and managing urgent contract variations. Navigating these complexities require not only technical skills but experience and judgment which require long-term efforts to build up."
2020-10-05-T-011-S-00192,2020-10-05-T-011,192,Indranee Rajah,"To address this, we have been stepping up efforts in recent years to strengthen the competencies and capabilities of Public Officers in managing the procurement process. First, we are stepping up training of officers in key areas such as evaluation and approval of tenders. The training covers learning points from audit observations and good practices. Second, we will be providing additional guidance to approving authorities, which will be available from early next year. Third, since 2018, we have required all officers who are involved in procurement processes to complete a compulsory e-learning module. These are supplemented with regular refreshers and updates on new policies and practices."
2020-10-05-T-011-S-00193,2020-10-05-T-011,193,Indranee Rajah,"In addition, we are also stepping up efforts to strengthen construction and IT procurement and contract management capabilities, which are more specialised areas requiring deeper technical know-how. The Building and Construction Authority or BCA is developing a competency framework to train public officers in managing construction contracts. MOF and BCA issued a good practice guide last year, containing practical advice on the management of variation orders and how to spot fraudulent quotes. To enhance governance, we will track agencies’ performance in contract management, based on a set of governance indicators. Similarly, GovTech is working on a competency framework for IT procurement and developing an e-learning module that will be ready next year."
2020-10-05-T-011-S-00194,2020-10-05-T-011,194,Indranee Rajah,"To take these efforts forward further, MOF and the Civil Service College jointly established the Finance and Procurement Academy this year to better equip Public Officers with finance, procurement and contract management skills. The academy will work with technical agencies such as BCA and GovTech to not only conduct formal training, but also promote informal learning such as through practitioner sharing and mentorships. It will also support officers in continual learning to keep abreast of developments in finance, procurement and contract management policies and practices."
2020-10-05-T-011-S-00195,2020-10-05-T-011,195,Indranee Rajah,"In the area of developing finance capabilities, finance officers today are required to attend induction courses that cover the fundamentals of Government financial procedures, including on governance and internal controls. These are reinforced and refreshed at milestone programmes, forums and sharing sessions throughout the officers’ career. Similar efforts are also undertaken to raise awareness of these concepts more widely across the Public Service. For example, they are incorporated into finance courses targeted at non-finance officers. MOF also conducts regular briefings to agencies’ senior management to emphasise the importance of public accountability."
2020-10-05-T-011-S-00196,2020-10-05-T-011,196,Indranee Rajah,"In conclusion, let me say public officers are expected to be accountable for their actions and decisions, and this includes maintaining high standards of compliance with guidelines and procedures as they perform their duties. We place high expectations on the senior leadership of the Public Service, who are entrusted to be stewards of public resources. They must uphold strong governance and accountability in their organisations. These expectations are spelt out in the form of leadership competencies and responsibilities, which are conveyed to all senior Public Service leaders in Ministries and Statutory Boards. We evaluate our leaders against these expectations as part of their performance reviews and those who fall short will be rated less favourably. Depending on the nature and cause of the incident, appropriate disciplinary action may be taken as well."
2020-10-05-T-011-S-00197,2020-10-05-T-011,197,Indranee Rajah,"So, finally, let me assure Members that public accountability remains a top priority for the Government. Where warranted, agencies mentioned in the Auditor-General’s report are conducting further investigation into the lapses. The senior leadership of the Public Service is accountable and committed to addressing the lapses identified, resolving the problem at the root and preventing future recurrence."
2020-10-05-T-011-S-00198,2020-10-05-T-011,198,Speaker,Order. End of Question Time. Clarification by Minister Josephine Teo.
2020-10-05-T-012-S-00199,2020-10-05-T-012,199,Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, with your leave, may I correct a factual error in my speech at the 1 September Sitting during the debate on the Motion of Thanks for the President's Address."
2020-10-05-T-012-S-00200,2020-10-05-T-012,200,Speaker,Please proceed.
2020-10-05-T-012-S-00201,2020-10-05-T-012,201,Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, I had said that in the last five years, about 40,000 employers have applied for Employment Passes at least once. ["
2020-10-05-T-012-S-00202,2020-10-05-T-012,202,Josephine Teo,"That is an error. In the last five years, 75,000 employers have applied for Employment Passes at least once. Thank you."
2020-10-05-T-012-S-00203,2020-10-05-T-012,203,Speaker,Ministerial Statement. Deputy Prime Minister.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00204,2020-10-05-T-013,204,Heng Swee Keat,"Mr Speaker, Sir, after a most difficult past several months, the COVID-19 situation in Singapore has stabilised and large parts of the economy have resumed operations. It has been a test of a generation, which we have tackled as one nation."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00205,2020-10-05-T-013,205,Heng Swee Keat,"The Government has rolled out a decisive set of crisis management measures to minimise and cushion economic impact, preserve jobs and capabilities, and support households. This includes the support measures which I announced in August, before the Opening of Parliament. [Please refer to Annex 1.]"
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00206,2020-10-05-T-013,206,Heng Swee Keat,"I made the announcement then, as some of the support schemes were ending in August and we needed to give our firms and workers certainty during this difficult period. We are now tabling a Supplementary Supply Bill, which provides for the resources to implement the measures announced in August, for debate in Parliament. My Ministerial Statement today will provide context for the Supplementary Supply Bill."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00207,2020-10-05-T-013,207,Heng Swee Keat,"Mr Speaker, Sir, our four earlier Budgets committed close to $100 billion of support measures to deal with COVID-19. This is on top of other measures such as special relief measures for debtors and tenants. These measures have substantially cushioned the economic impact. MAS estimates that the combined Budgets will prevent the economy from contracting by a further 5.6% of GDP in 2020 and 4.8% in 2021."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00208,2020-10-05-T-013,208,Heng Swee Keat,"Our economic support measures will also offset some of the rise in resident unemployment rate by about 1.7 percentage points this year. This could mean about 155,000 jobs saved over these two years, although we will still see job losses overall. More than half of the jobs saved are due to the Jobs Support Scheme or JSS alone."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00209,2020-10-05-T-013,209,Heng Swee Keat,"This outcome has only been possible with the collective determination, adaptability and sacrifice of our people and businesses."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00210,2020-10-05-T-013,210,Heng Swee Keat,"Today, I want to look forward, and share how we will approach the next six months as our economy reopens, as well as our plans for our longer term economic recovery to emerge stronger."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00211,2020-10-05-T-013,211,Heng Swee Keat,"The trajectory of our economic recovery depends critically on how well the world deals with this still dangerous virus. Every passing day brings new surprises and new hope. Even as we learn more about it, there are profound uncertainties ahead."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00212,2020-10-05-T-013,212,Heng Swee Keat,One major uncertainty is how effective other countries are in containing the pandemic and the success of policies they adopt in opening their economies.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00213,2020-10-05-T-013,213,Heng Swee Keat,"Another key uncertainty is whether, and when, an effective and safe vaccine can be developed. Even if such a vaccine becomes available, the pandemic may not end quickly. Supply of the vaccine will be limited initially, and global rollout is likely to be uneven. We do not know how long the protective effect may last, or if mutation of the virus may render it ineffective."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00214,2020-10-05-T-013,214,Heng Swee Keat,"But there is also hope that we can overcome this crisis. In our fight against COVID-19, we are currently in a stable position, but we must remain vigilant. Amid the uncertainties, we are adapting to living with the virus. We have worked out the steps to further re-open safely in the months ahead. We are putting ourselves in the best position to fight COVID-19 by focusing on four key prongs."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00215,2020-10-05-T-013,215,Heng Swee Keat,"First, vaccination. We are working very actively to secure early access to safe and effective vaccines, if and when they become available."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00216,2020-10-05-T-013,216,Heng Swee Keat,"Singapore is an early supporter of the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access or COVAX Facility, which accelerates the development and production of, and equitable access to potential COVID-19 vaccines. Together with Switzerland, Singapore co-chairs the Friends of the COVAX Facility to promote vaccine multi-lateralisation."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00217,2020-10-05-T-013,217,Heng Swee Keat,"Singapore is also pursuing the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines with a number of pharmaceutical companies. At the same time, we are supporting local efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine as well as building up vaccine manufacturing capacity."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00218,2020-10-05-T-013,218,Heng Swee Keat,"Second, testing. In the meantime, we have increased our Polymerase Chain Reaction or PCR testing capacity manifold, and are close to our target of being able to conduct 40,000 laboratory tests a day. We are also evaluating new testing technologies that are less invasive and can produce test results more quickly. This enhanced testing capability will help us safely resume more activities sooner."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00219,2020-10-05-T-013,219,Heng Swee Keat,"Third, tracing. Swift contact tracing and isolation of infected individuals are key to limiting the spread of the virus. Our contact tracing teams are doing a sterling job and using digital tools well. The TraceTogether app, together with tokens that are being distributed nationwide, and the SafeEntry programme, enable contact tracing to reach the speed and coverage needed to rapidly contain viral transmission."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00220,2020-10-05-T-013,220,Heng Swee Keat,"Fourth, safe management. We must continue to adhere to safe management measures and do our part to facilitate contact tracing. Keeping community infections low is the key to re-opening our economy safely."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00221,2020-10-05-T-013,221,Heng Swee Keat,"The Multi-Ministry Task force co-chaired by Ministers Gan Kim Yong and Lawrence Wong will be releasing more details on the roadmap to Phase Three in the coming weeks. This will include the expected timeline for moving to Phase Three, changes to current regulations on the size of group gatherings, and participation at mass events."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00222,2020-10-05-T-013,222,Heng Swee Keat,"While managing the healthcare front of the COVID-19 battle, we must also deal with economic and social fronts. Many of our businesses, workers, and households have been hit hard by the disruptions and uncertainties due to COVID-19. Our path to recovery will not be easy."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00223,2020-10-05-T-013,223,Heng Swee Keat,"Our support over the four Budgets has been to provide immediate relief and also to minimise the scarring effects of COVID-19 on our economy, by preparing our businesses and workers to emerge stronger. In short, we are working together to alleviate near-term pains to build for a better tomorrow. We will remain focused on these over the next six months and beyond."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00224,2020-10-05-T-013,224,Heng Swee Keat,"With the situation stabilising in Singapore and some parts of the world, we will progressively open up more activities, at a pace that enables new practices to be internalised, to keep everyone safe."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00225,2020-10-05-T-013,225,Heng Swee Keat,"The performance and outlook for different economic sectors is highly uneven. Some sectors are doing better than before COVID-19. Firms in the IT, biomedical, e-commerce and finance sectors have benefited from the rise in demand for these services during this period. Some restaurants and hawkers are on their way to recovery. Construction activities will gradually resume as we complete the testing of workers and as they adjust to new safe management measures."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00226,2020-10-05-T-013,226,Heng Swee Keat,"But sectors that involve the movement of people across borders, such as aviation and tourism, will recover only when people around the world feel safe enough to resume travel and this will take some time. And businesses that involve large gatherings, such as in MICE, sports and concerts, will recover slowly, unless rapid test kits are effective in screening participants for safe entry."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00227,2020-10-05-T-013,227,Heng Swee Keat,"Not only are the outlooks different for different sectors, but within sectors, firms that have been nimble are doing better. For instance, some wet market stalls started online selling, and are enjoying robust business. Given these differences in outlook between and within sectors, we have adjusted broad-based wage support under JSS."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00228,2020-10-05-T-013,228,Heng Swee Keat,"For the hardest-hit sectors such as aviation and tourism, which face an uncertain road to recovery, our aim is to help companies preserve core capabilities and enable workers to retain specialised skills."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00229,2020-10-05-T-013,229,Heng Swee Keat,"As earlier announced in August, this will be through the Enhanced Aviation Support Package, a temporary redeployment programme, and the SingapoRediscovers Vouchers."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00230,2020-10-05-T-013,230,Heng Swee Keat,"In addition, we will extend the Enhanced Training Support Package, or ETSP, which I enhanced in the Resilience Budget. I will extend the ETSP for another six months, until 30 June 2021, to provide enhanced course fee subsidies for firms in our hardest-hit sectors. I will extend the ETSP to the Marine and Offshore sector from today, on top of the existing sectors, such as Air Transport, Retail, and Tourism. In recognition of the gradually recovering economic situation, we will also be lowering the absentee payroll rates to 80% from January 2021, capped at $7.50 per hour."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00231,2020-10-05-T-013,231,Heng Swee Keat,"In tandem, we will continue to provide strong support to firms that are growing. In this way, our workers can move into growth areas, stay employed, and build new skills."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00232,2020-10-05-T-013,232,Heng Swee Keat,"We have enhanced support for start-ups, via the Startup SG Founder programme. Since I announced the enhancements in August, more than 500 aspiring entrepreneurs have signed up for the three-month Venture Building programmes."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00233,2020-10-05-T-013,233,Heng Swee Keat,"We will provide wage support of between 25% and 50% for each new local hire in firms which increase their total local headcount, through the Jobs Growth Incentive, or JGI. The support will be for the first $5,000 of gross monthly wages for up to 12 months."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00234,2020-10-05-T-013,234,Heng Swee Keat,"As persons with disabilities may face greater challenges in finding jobs, I will provide the higher tier of wage support of 50% under the JGI to all Persons with Disabilities. This will apply to new hires of Persons with Disabilities from September 2020 to February 2021."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00235,2020-10-05-T-013,235,Heng Swee Keat,"To give a boost to businesses seeking to internationalise, transform and digitalise, I will extend or enhance our capability-building grants, namely the Market Readiness Assistance Grant, the Productivity Solutions Grant, the Enterprise Development Grant, and the PACT programme. These will enable firms to tap on new sources of growth. MTI will announce details in the coming weeks."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00236,2020-10-05-T-013,236,Heng Swee Keat,"Even as we shift our approach in supporting businesses and workers as the economy recovers, we will make sure that the support does not taper off too sharply."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00237,2020-10-05-T-013,237,Heng Swee Keat,"We had earlier enhanced support through loan schemes to provide working capital support for viable businesses. We will extend the Temporary Bridging Loan Programme for six months, until September 2021, at reduced levels. MAS will also extend the MAS Singapore Dollar Facility for Enterprise Singapore Loans, until September 2021."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00238,2020-10-05-T-013,238,Heng Swee Keat,We will adjust the support available under the Enterprise Financing Scheme to help Singapore enterprises access financing in areas such as trade and project needs. MTI and MAS will announce more details later.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00239,2020-10-05-T-013,239,Heng Swee Keat,"Later today, MAS will be announcing details on the extension of payment moratoriums, at a tapered level of support. Taken together, the staging of these measures avoids sharp drops in support, while facilitating restructuring where needed."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00240,2020-10-05-T-013,240,Heng Swee Keat,"All this support for our firms will ultimately benefit our workers. The best way to protect the welfare of our workers is a good job. By helping viable firms stay afloat during this difficult period, they can retain their workers. By helping firms to restructure and retrain their workers, they can emerge stronger."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00241,2020-10-05-T-013,241,Heng Swee Keat,More competitive and productive firms can provide better jobs and better prospects for workers. And more skilled and committed workers make firms more competitive. This synergy between competitive firms and capable workers is critical for both to do well.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00242,2020-10-05-T-013,242,Heng Swee Keat,"As part of our long-standing practice of tripartism, we must not fear, but instead ride on change together to achieve synergies and to emerge stronger."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00243,2020-10-05-T-013,243,Heng Swee Keat,"But even with the best efforts, some firms, especially in hardest hit sectors, may not survive, or may have to release some of their workers. So, other than supporting workers through our firms, we will continue to provide our fullest support to workers who have lost their jobs, to help them reskill and move into firms that are hiring."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00244,2020-10-05-T-013,244,Heng Swee Keat,The National Jobs Council is implementing the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package that I announced at the Fortitude Budget in May.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00245,2020-10-05-T-013,245,Heng Swee Keat,"The Council has curated 117,500 opportunities under the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package as of end-August. This is good progress, but we must press on."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00246,2020-10-05-T-013,246,Heng Swee Keat,"The Council is working closely with companies to hire mid-career jobseekers looking to make a switch in their careers and to redeploy workers in affected sectors where activities are low, such as aviation and tourism, to areas of need and where their skills are valued, such as healthcare and childcare."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00247,2020-10-05-T-013,247,Heng Swee Keat,"It is also engaging companies to offer traineeships, company attachments and training opportunities, which can later lead to good jobs."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00248,2020-10-05-T-013,248,Heng Swee Keat,The key task is now to make sure that workers know of and are successfully matched to these opportunities. We are doing this across multiple channels.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00249,2020-10-05-T-013,249,Heng Swee Keat,We have set up SGUnited Jobs and Skills Centres in every HDB town and have Career Ambassadors to reach out to residents.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00250,2020-10-05-T-013,250,Heng Swee Keat,"The Singapore Business Federation, or SBF, is working closely with other TACs and NTUC’s e2i to do business-to-business job matching across sectors, through the SBF SGUnited Jobs Initiative."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00251,2020-10-05-T-013,251,Heng Swee Keat,"MOM and WSG will also be appointing employment agencies as Placement Partners, to assist in placements."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00252,2020-10-05-T-013,252,Heng Swee Keat,"I encourage everyone to step out of your comfort zones and keep an open mind to learn new skills and take on new jobs. One good example is Ms Tan Bee Lian, who is preparing to be a Healthcare Assistant after being in the oil and gas industry for over 30 years. This is very commendable."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00253,2020-10-05-T-013,253,Heng Swee Keat,"To help those who have lost their jobs, MSF has recently extended the COVID-19 Support Grant, and applications are open until the end of the year. Beyond this year, we are studying the support for self-employed persons and workers who are most vulnerable. The continuation and form of support will depend on the labour market situation and economic outlook. One key consideration is to make a stronger link to helping individuals find a new job or to acquire new skills. In this way, we can better prepare our displaced workers for new opportunities as firms restructure. We will provide an update before the end of the year."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00254,2020-10-05-T-013,254,Heng Swee Keat,"Other than supporting our businesses and workers, we will also continue to support our households."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00255,2020-10-05-T-013,255,Heng Swee Keat,"The household support announced earlier continues to flow in the coming months. Please refer to this slide on schedule of support measures, which will also be digitally distributed to Members after the session. In it, you will notice that in October alone, eligible households will receive the GST Voucher – U-Save, the first tranche of Grocery Vouchers, and Service and Conservancy Charges, or S&CC, rebates. Eligible lower income workers will also receive the October tranche of Workfare Special Payment."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00256,2020-10-05-T-013,256,Heng Swee Keat,"We have received feedback that COVID-19 has caused some aspiring parents to postpone their parenthood plans. This is fully understandable, especially when they face uncertainty with their income. Hence, to help with expenses during this period, we will introduce a one-off additional support for newborns. This will be on top of the Baby Bonus Cash Gift, which provides eligible parents up to $10,000 in benefits. Minister Indranee will share more details on the additional support soon."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00257,2020-10-05-T-013,257,Heng Swee Keat,"I have laid out our approach to support our firms, workers and households in dealing with COVID-19 in the next six months and to have more babies. We will adjust our support if necessary, in response to changes on the medical front and global economic developments."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00258,2020-10-05-T-013,258,Heng Swee Keat,"I hope that businesses, workers and households will make good use of these resources in the months ahead."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00259,2020-10-05-T-013,259,Heng Swee Keat,"Beyond the immediate crisis, we want to emerge from COVID-19 stronger as a society and more united as a people. We are determined to have better jobs for our workers and stronger support to enable them to bounce back if they fall. We want to build an endearing home for future generations, and a fair and caring society based on what we stand for as a people."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00260,2020-10-05-T-013,260,Heng Swee Keat,"To deliver on these priorities, we need a dynamic and growing economy, with good jobs for all Singaporeans. Economic growth is an enabler for individuals and families to realise their aspirations and ensures that the public sector is adequately resourced to invest in our national priorities. Given the importance of economic growth as an enabler, I will now spend some time to sketch out the broad strokes of our strategy."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00261,2020-10-05-T-013,261,Heng Swee Keat,"The post-COVID-19 global economy will be different. Our future economy must be responsive to structural shifts, many of which have been accelerated by COVID-19."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00262,2020-10-05-T-013,262,Heng Swee Keat,"Support for globalisation is weakening and some countries are turning inwards. The adoption of digital technology has been given renewed impetus, unlocking new sources of return. Digital technology and its many applications are the new capital of the innovation-driven future economy. Asia continues to rise in global economic weight, as its recovery accelerates. Ensuring sustainability and care for the environment are gaining momentum."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00263,2020-10-05-T-013,263,Heng Swee Keat,"At home, we face slowing resident labour force growth. Future economic growth will come from raising productivity across the economy. So, we must make the best use of the skills and talents of our people and use new technology as a key complement."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00264,2020-10-05-T-013,264,Heng Swee Keat,"We are at a critical juncture in our economic development and the stakes are high. In the next few years, economies will undergo rapid transitions. Depending on their response, COVID-19 will benefit some and disadvantage others, whether at the firm-level, sector-level, or across the entire economy. We must take the actions now that will allow us to not just get through COVID-19, but more crucially, gain ground that will pave the way for our next lap of economic growth in the next five to 10 years."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00265,2020-10-05-T-013,265,Heng Swee Keat,"I will speak on what we are preparing for in this next lap of growth. Before I get into the details, I wish to stress that everything this Government does to protect, re-open, and grow our economy – we do, not for the economy’s sake, but for our people. We strive to secure a way for Singapore to continue to make a good living, so that Singaporeans can have a good life. This is our guiding principle."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00266,2020-10-05-T-013,266,Heng Swee Keat,"Thankfully, we are in a good position."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00267,2020-10-05-T-013,267,Heng Swee Keat,"Since 2017, the Future Economy Council has been driving the implementation of our Industry Transformation Maps, or ITMs, to restructure our economy sector by sector, firm by firm. We have made good progress."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00268,2020-10-05-T-013,268,Heng Swee Keat,"Before COVID-19, our resident unemployment rate was low at 3.2% as at end-2019."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00269,2020-10-05-T-013,269,Heng Swee Keat,"Between 2016 and 2019, overall productivity, measured by real value added per actual hour worked, rose by a creditable 2.4% per year. This is also an improvement over the 2.2% per year growth in the preceding three-year period."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00270,2020-10-05-T-013,270,Heng Swee Keat,"Overall, real median income for Singaporeans grew by 3.7% per year in the last three years, up from 3.2% in the preceding three years. Incomes at the 20th percentile grew by 4.4% per year in the past three years, up from 4% in the preceding three years."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00271,2020-10-05-T-013,271,Heng Swee Keat,"In 2015, we launched the SkillsFuture movement as well as our Research, Innovation and Enterprise, or RIE 2020 plan. These support our ITM work by strengthening our foundations of skills and innovation."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00272,2020-10-05-T-013,272,Heng Swee Keat,We are building on our good position and keeping up the pace.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00273,2020-10-05-T-013,273,Heng Swee Keat,"In the midst of this pandemic, we set up the Emerging Stronger Taskforce in May to update our economic roadmap to respond to the new realities and to emerge with a new competitive edge. There are many new business and growth opportunities for Singapore to seize, and the Taskforce has already made significant progress in this through the Alliances for Action."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00274,2020-10-05-T-013,274,Heng Swee Keat,"As rapid-action taskforces, the seven Alliances have rallied key players around common challenges faced by industry. They are developing prototypes to validate new business ideas, new business models, and new business solutions, in areas such as sustainability, robotics, and safe visitor experiences. Government agencies are partnering businesses to review regulations and promote innovation."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00275,2020-10-05-T-013,275,Heng Swee Keat,"Beyond the first wave of Alliances, the Taskforce is looking to launch new Alliances to build momentum for change and explore opportunities in new areas of growth, such as MedTech. The Taskforce will share more details."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00276,2020-10-05-T-013,276,Heng Swee Keat,"All these moves build on our ITM framework to deliver a refreshed economic strategy for a post-COVID-19 world, with emphasis on three priority areas."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00277,2020-10-05-T-013,277,Heng Swee Keat,"First, remaking Singapore as a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation, and enterprise. We will secure our external economic linkages as a vital global node in Asia and transform ourselves into a vibrant centre of technology and innovation."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00278,2020-10-05-T-013,278,Heng Swee Keat,"Second, redoubling our efforts to foster inclusive growth. With COVID-19 revealing vulnerabilities in our labour market, we need to better understand its structure, and upgrade jobs and skills across all segments of society."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00279,2020-10-05-T-013,279,Heng Swee Keat,"Third, investing in economic resilience and sustainability as a source of competitive advantage. Our resilience can be a source of growth, at many levels – for our individuals, industries, nation, and the world."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00280,2020-10-05-T-013,280,Heng Swee Keat,"Let me start with the first key move, which is to remake ourselves as a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00281,2020-10-05-T-013,281,Heng Swee Keat,"COVID-19 has changed travel patterns, sharpened the fragmentation of supply chains and accelerated digitalisation in different markets. It has heightened emphasis on resilience as companies and countries review their operations."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00282,2020-10-05-T-013,282,Heng Swee Keat,"Asia, in particular Southeast Asia, will continue to grow as one of the key global engines. We must deepen and broaden links to build up Singapore’s role at the heart of Asia’s growth, while forging connectivity with other key markets. A role that we have played in our long history as a trading port and which we will renew in two ways  one, rebuild and grow our physical connectivity – in travel and trade; and, two, enhance and expand our digital connectivity."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00283,2020-10-05-T-013,283,Heng Swee Keat,Our air hub has been badly affected by COVID-19 and we are sparing no effort to rebuild it.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00284,2020-10-05-T-013,284,Heng Swee Keat,"Compared with last year, passenger traffic has fallen by more than 98% in August, with daily passenger volume of about 3,000, down sharply from 190,000 previously."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00285,2020-10-05-T-013,285,Heng Swee Keat,"When global passenger traffic resumes, as it surely will, the Changi Air Hub will resume its role at the Global-Asia node, together with all the related sectors such as tourism, manufacturing and logistics."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00286,2020-10-05-T-013,286,Heng Swee Keat,"Accordingly, we must re-establish our position by reopening our borders gradually, positioning Singapore as a safe destination, levelling up capabilities and refreshing our infrastructure."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00287,2020-10-05-T-013,287,Heng Swee Keat,We are committed to revive our air hub and restore our air connectivity. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce is studying this carefully as part of our broader re-opening plans and the Minister for Transport will share more in his Ministerial Statement tomorrow.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00288,2020-10-05-T-013,288,Heng Swee Keat,"Our maritime trade has to date remained resilient to COVID-19, and we will accelerate moves to strengthen our position."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00289,2020-10-05-T-013,289,Heng Swee Keat,"Notwithstanding the 13.5% drop in global trade on a year-on-year basis in the first half of 2020, container throughput at Singapore's ports fell by a milder 1.1% over the same period. At the same time, firms are more prepared to diversify their operating bases to increase resilience."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00290,2020-10-05-T-013,290,Heng Swee Keat,"So, we must press on with improving transhipment capabilities, inking trade facilitation agreements and anchoring key shipping routes through Singapore."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00291,2020-10-05-T-013,291,Heng Swee Keat,The first few berths of Tuas Port are on track to be operational by 2021.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00292,2020-10-05-T-013,292,Heng Swee Keat,"The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership is slated to be signed this year, connecting a trade region of 15 countries accounting for about 30% of the global population and GDP."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00293,2020-10-05-T-013,293,Heng Swee Keat,"Moving ahead, we will further strengthen our value proposition through greater regional cooperation, and by building up a leading trade and logistics eco-system."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00294,2020-10-05-T-013,294,Heng Swee Keat,"Southeast Asia can benefit from the greater premium on supply chain resilience through regional cooperation. For example, the Iskandar Malaysia and Batam, Bintan, Karimun region presents good opportunities for companies to cluster the full value chain of complementary activities from research and development, to regional headquarters and manufacturing."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00295,2020-10-05-T-013,295,Heng Swee Keat,"To support our ambitions, we will significantly strengthen our entire trade and logistics ecosystem, deepening capabilities in our port, airport and beyond. We will enhance our infrastructure for Singapore to handle larger flows of food, pharmaceuticals, electronics and e-commerce."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00296,2020-10-05-T-013,296,Heng Swee Keat,"We will accelerate the build-up of digital capabilities, which will be a game-changer for Singapore’s connectivity with Asia and the world. Digital payments and data facilitate physical trade. It makes the exchange of varied goods and services more efficient, opens up new possibilities, and strengthens our value proposition as a trading node."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00297,2020-10-05-T-013,297,Heng Swee Keat,"Within Singapore, the Alliance on Supply Chain Digitalisation is exploring options and bringing together key players across the supply chain in this venture."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00298,2020-10-05-T-013,298,Heng Swee Keat,"We have also concluded Digital Economy Agreements with Australia, Chile and New Zealand, and have ongoing talks with South Korea. These agreements establish common frameworks and rules for digital trade, enabling our businesses, especially SMEs, to access international markets more easily."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00299,2020-10-05-T-013,299,Heng Swee Keat,These moves to enhance Singapore’s digital connectivity will open up new markets and opportunities for our businesses.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00300,2020-10-05-T-013,300,Heng Swee Keat,"As part of our ITM work, we are helping firms to make full use of digital technology. COVID-19 has accelerated the digitalisation and transformation of many businesses, big and small."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00301,2020-10-05-T-013,301,Heng Swee Keat,"Since January this year, enterprises have embarked on over 27,000 projects to improve their productivity and build new capabilities through the Productivity Solutions Grant and the Enterprise Development Grant schemes."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00302,2020-10-05-T-013,302,Heng Swee Keat,"During my dialogue with businesses on Friday, I met the founder of Seonggong, a restaurant group with brands such as Seorae Korean BBQ. Seonggong used digital technology to revamp its operations, from accounting to ordering to procurement. So much so that increased sales from online deliveries have more than offset losses from their dine-in business, by 10%."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00303,2020-10-05-T-013,303,Heng Swee Keat,"The experience of businesses shows that digitalisation is a strategic capability to unlock growth, evolve their models to harness digital possibilities and to integrate processes such as logistics, payment and marketing."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00304,2020-10-05-T-013,304,Heng Swee Keat,"We will press on with our ITM work, which helps businesses big and small, to transform holistically, bringing together the different aspects needed to upgrade."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00305,2020-10-05-T-013,305,Heng Swee Keat,A key priority for us now is to build on this momentum and bring digitalisation to our heartlands. Senior Minister of State Sim Ann and Minister of State Low Yen Ling will be announcing further plans for heartland enterprises in the coming days.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00306,2020-10-05-T-013,306,Heng Swee Keat,"I have spoken on seizing new opportunities through physical and digital connectivity. Beyond being an effective and trusted broker for trade and digital flows, we must be a key node where new ideas are born and nurtured into globally-competitive enterprises."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00307,2020-10-05-T-013,307,Heng Swee Keat,"Today, we have a business-friendly environment, strong rule of law, a skilled and diverse workforce, advanced infrastructure and a globally-competitive eco-system of financial and professional services. We must continue to build on these complementary strengths built up over the years."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00308,2020-10-05-T-013,308,Heng Swee Keat,"We will be unveiling a new five-year Research, Innovation and Enterprise, or RIE plan in December. The plan will build on earlier investments and enhance research to support areas of national priority, such as early childhood development, lifelong learning and keeping our seniors healthy. We will expand our transformation of the manufacturing, aviation and maritime industries, and deepen our capabilities as a Smart Nation and sustainable society."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00309,2020-10-05-T-013,309,Heng Swee Keat,"We will also position Singapore as a global intellectual property, or IP, centre in Asia. Ministers Indranee Rajah and Edwin Tong are leading our efforts on our Singapore IP Strategy 2030, and will share details at World IP Day."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00310,2020-10-05-T-013,310,Heng Swee Keat,"A major effort will be to integrate the work of the Future Economy Council and our RIE plan, so as to accelerate our transformation into an innovation-led economy, powered by technology. In this way, our businesses can be more competitive and our workers can have better job prospects."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00311,2020-10-05-T-013,311,Heng Swee Keat,An example of how we will scale up the translation of ideas and technology into business improvements is through the use of innovation platforms that bring industry and researchers to work together on specific challenges.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00312,2020-10-05-T-013,312,Heng Swee Keat,"We are also promoting the Open Innovation Network, an online platform which brings problem owners and problem solvers together to create industry-led solutions."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00313,2020-10-05-T-013,313,Heng Swee Keat,"Since 2017, a total of close to $13 million in grant and prize monies has been awarded to firms with viable solutions to deploy and scale their ideas under Enterprise Singapore’s Gov-PACT and IMDA’s Open Innovation Platform."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00314,2020-10-05-T-013,314,Heng Swee Keat,"This year, we have taken this further, with two rounds of National Innovation Challenges. We hope to see the outcome of these in the coming months."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00315,2020-10-05-T-013,315,Heng Swee Keat,"To summarise, we are making good progress in our move to position Singapore as a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise. By enhancing our connectivity and making innovation pervasive, we can better meet the challenges of a post-COVID world, and create good jobs and a brighter future for all Singaporeans."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00316,2020-10-05-T-013,316,Heng Swee Keat,"Our aim is not just to grow a vibrant, innovative economy, but an inclusive economy, where growth uplifts all Singaporeans. To achieve inclusive growth, our workers need to have the skills to stay relevant and we need to provide holistic support to uplift our vulnerable workers."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00317,2020-10-05-T-013,317,Heng Swee Keat,"First, skills. To take on good jobs and enjoy the fruits of growth, our workers need the right skills for the job. We have a strong base of human capital developed through our education system. But there are big changes upon us. There is stiffer global competition. With deep technological changes, skills are going obsolete faster."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00318,2020-10-05-T-013,318,Heng Swee Keat,"We will therefore need extensive upskilling and continual reskilling of our workforce, to equip our workers to continue to get good jobs. We want to do so for every worker at every age. We are investing significantly."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00319,2020-10-05-T-013,319,Heng Swee Keat,"This year, we have set aside about $3 billion for the SGUnited Jobs and Skills package to provide immediate employment and training support for our workers."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00320,2020-10-05-T-013,320,Heng Swee Keat,"This is on top of the close to $5 billion set aside over three years for our longer term structural measures, to support workers of all ages to upskill and access new job opportunities."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00321,2020-10-05-T-013,321,Heng Swee Keat,Firms and training providers have a major part to play. I urge all firms to make full use of the schemes for developing our people.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00322,2020-10-05-T-013,322,Heng Swee Keat,"We have a suite of leadership development programmes for Singaporeans at various stages of their careers, such as the Global Ready Talent Programme and the SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00323,2020-10-05-T-013,323,Heng Swee Keat,"Companies on the Human Capital Partnership, or HCP Programme, which recognises fair and progressive employers, have also benefited, as the HCP mark endorses them as employers of choice."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00324,2020-10-05-T-013,324,Heng Swee Keat,"We will work closely with industry and training providers, to make sure that the skills workers learn are useful."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00325,2020-10-05-T-013,325,Heng Swee Keat,"Skills upgrading is most effective when the training is relevant to the company’s needs and jobseekers have certainty in the value of the training. For example, through NTUC’s Company Training Committees, our Professional Conversion Programmes, or PCPs, and TechSkills Accelerator Company-Led Training programme for ICT jobs. These have had good outcomes. For example, about nine in 10 of PCP employees remained in employment 24 months after being placed, and about seven in 10 saw a wage increase after starting their new jobs."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00326,2020-10-05-T-013,326,Heng Swee Keat,"As part of this whole-of-society movement to build skills, companies too, need better skills! Skills to develop their workers, and redesign skills-based jobs to move beyond paper-based qualifications. We will continue our work through our ITMs, together with our unions, to drive these changes in each firm and in each sector."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00327,2020-10-05-T-013,327,Heng Swee Keat,"And finally, individuals have a key part to play in taking charge of their own learning. Our schools provide a good foundation. We are increasing the digital skills content in our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to prepare our young for a digital future. But learning does not stop after leaving school. We spend more years outside of school than in school. We all need to learn through life. In the process, we can enrich our lives, and our society at large."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00328,2020-10-05-T-013,328,Heng Swee Keat,"Even as we level up the skills of every worker at every age, we still need to bring in global talent to complement our Singapore talent. By building on complementary strengths, we can build cutting-edge capabilities in our workforce and our firms and plug into global networks. This will ultimately benefit all Singaporean workers."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00329,2020-10-05-T-013,329,Heng Swee Keat,"We will continue to update our foreign workforce policies carefully, such as our Employment Pass and S Pass rules, to achieve this synergy."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00330,2020-10-05-T-013,330,Heng Swee Keat,"Let us all play our part in building a strong, skilled workforce together. Singaporeans, growing up in a multi-cultural society, have an edge in building relationships with people around the world, especially in a more fragmented post-COVID landscape. Let us build on this."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00331,2020-10-05-T-013,331,Heng Swee Keat,I have covered how we will grow skills across the workforce to keep our workers competitive. The second way to ensure inclusive growth is to help vulnerable and lower wage workers raise their skills and secure good jobs.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00332,2020-10-05-T-013,332,Heng Swee Keat,"I had a good discussion recently with career coaches and union leaders, to better understand the challenges experienced by different groups of jobseekers."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00333,2020-10-05-T-013,333,Heng Swee Keat,"Each worker also faced different challenges. For some, it was a skills gap issue. For others, it was an issue of expectations – trying to find a job which matched their earlier salary. For yet others, especially mid-career and mature executives, employers were concerned about whether they could adapt."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00334,2020-10-05-T-013,334,Heng Swee Keat,"These are all important issues that we need to tackle together, urgently."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00335,2020-10-05-T-013,335,Heng Swee Keat,"For example, our lower income workers have been particularly hard hit by COVID-19. Many of these workers face a twin challenge, as they are also in sectors that will be affected by longer-term structural changes in the economy, such as retail or F&B. Some are also in the gig economy."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00336,2020-10-05-T-013,336,Heng Swee Keat,"Our middle income and middle-aged workers also have heavy family responsibilities and commitments, but face the challenges of a rapidly evolving labour market."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00337,2020-10-05-T-013,337,Heng Swee Keat,"For all these workers, there is even more urgency to upskill and transition into jobs with good long-term prospects."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00338,2020-10-05-T-013,338,Heng Swee Keat,"In the design of our support schemes, we have been deliberate in channelling additional support to vulnerable groups, to help them access opportunities and stay in good jobs."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00339,2020-10-05-T-013,339,Heng Swee Keat,"For example, mature and older workers are eligible for higher wage support in our career conversion programmes, as well as higher course fee subsidies. I announced some of these earlier this year as part of our SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00340,2020-10-05-T-013,340,Heng Swee Keat,Our lower income workers also get additional support for skills upgrading via the Workfare Skills Support scheme. This has been implemented in July 2020 to better support acquisition of skills and qualifications that are more likely to lead to higher wages.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00341,2020-10-05-T-013,341,Heng Swee Keat,"The Progressive Wage Model, or PWM, is an important labour policy innovation. PWM is more than a sector-based minimum wage."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00342,2020-10-05-T-013,342,Heng Swee Keat,"It is a four-in-one framework comprising a Job Ladder, Skills Ladder, Productivity Ladder and Wage Ladder. These four upgrading ladders are mutually reinforcing."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00343,2020-10-05-T-013,343,Heng Swee Keat,"By offering a proper career ladder, skills upgrading ladder, productivity improvement ladder and wage enhancement ladder, our four-in-one PWM transforms jobs that are traditionally less attractive to our locals."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00344,2020-10-05-T-013,344,Heng Swee Keat,"We will expand PWM to more sectors over time, while making sure that businesses in those sectors can absorb this change. Companies that voluntarily pay progressive wages and provide advancement pathways for lower income workers will also be recognised with a PWM Mark. In doing so, we will raise skill levels and create more and better jobs. And in time, we will slow down the future growth of the foreign workforce in these sectors."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00345,2020-10-05-T-013,345,Heng Swee Keat,"We may still be battling the downturn, but will be actively looking to identify the next few sectors where we can use the four-in-one PWM framework to redesign jobs and raise skills levels, and expand PWM to benefit more groups of lower wage workers as soon as conditions allow."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00346,2020-10-05-T-013,346,Heng Swee Keat,"This will also mean that business costs will go up, which will add to the difficulty of businesses during this time. But COVID-19 has highlighted why it is critical, for long-term survival, for firms to be more manpower-lean, productive and have jobs that are attractive to our locals."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00347,2020-10-05-T-013,347,Heng Swee Keat,We will have to explore solutions and the Government will provide support for the transition.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00348,2020-10-05-T-013,348,Heng Swee Keat,"It is a continuing journey to improve the job market for our more vulnerable workers. Beyond incentives, we need to shift culture and employer mindsets. But if we focus on the strengths of our workers and adopt flexibility in job design and redesign, we can customise creative solutions for different groups of workers."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00349,2020-10-05-T-013,349,Heng Swee Keat,"For example, we know that some workers find it hard to travel far for work. At the same time, some of the shops in our heartlands may find it difficult to find workers. By putting these job openings together, and placing them at potential touchpoints like Social Services Offices, Community Centres, MyCareersFuture portal, and SGUnited Jobs and Skills Centres, we can facilitate job matches for these workers."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00350,2020-10-05-T-013,350,Heng Swee Keat,"I have asked Minister of State Low Yen Ling, who is also Chairperson of the Mayors' Committee, to look into how we can better help our displaced mature professionals, and how we can make better use of micro-jobs to bring job opportunities closer to the heartlands. More details will be announced later."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00351,2020-10-05-T-013,351,Heng Swee Keat,"Given the scale of structural changes in the global economy, we need to redesign jobs and reskill workers, across all our ITMs, in significant ways. We need to be innovative in pursuing this and work in close partnerships between employers, workers and our unions. It will take time and effort, but if done well, will usher in a more dynamic and inclusive economy."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00352,2020-10-05-T-013,352,Heng Swee Keat,I have covered the first and second moves in this next phase of our industry transformation journey. Our third move is to invest in our economic resilience and sustainability as a source of growth and competitive advantage.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00353,2020-10-05-T-013,353,Heng Swee Keat,"Economic resilience is not a new idea for Singapore. We have achieved resilience through a diversified economic structure, with multiple engines of growth. No one industry accounts for much more than 20% of our GDP, so we do not put all our eggs in one basket."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00354,2020-10-05-T-013,354,Heng Swee Keat,We thus entered the COVID-19 pandemic on a relatively strong footing.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00355,2020-10-05-T-013,355,Heng Swee Keat,"We were able to ensure sufficient medical supplies and essential goods for our public and healthcare workers because we had a strategic national stockpile in place, supported by a combination of local production of essential supplies, and a diverse network of trading partners."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00356,2020-10-05-T-013,356,Heng Swee Keat,"Nonetheless, COVID-19 exposed vulnerabilities around the world. Beyond essential goods, critical inputs for industrial production and access to workers were cut off due to global work stoppages and travel bans. Demand also ground to a halt in many industries."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00357,2020-10-05-T-013,357,Heng Swee Keat,"We must therefore act now to improve our economic resilience. In doing this, we may have to creatively combine the efficiency of having things ready ""just in time"" with the resilience of building buffers ""just in case""."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00358,2020-10-05-T-013,358,Heng Swee Keat,"Will this drive for resilience come at the expense of growth and efficiency? Not necessarily so. For example, firms that embrace technology raise not only productivity, but also resilience."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00359,2020-10-05-T-013,359,Heng Swee Keat,"Lingjack, a manufacturer of fire extinguishers, automated its labour-intensive production lines in 2017. With over 90% of its production lines automated, Lingjack achieved efficiency gains of up to 40%. At the same time, this also made the company less vulnerable to worker shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00360,2020-10-05-T-013,360,Heng Swee Keat,"One key way to enhance our resilience and to grow is to produce essential supplies locally, which can be used both for local consumption and export. One example is medical supplies, such as masks and test kits."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00361,2020-10-05-T-013,361,Heng Swee Keat,"Another example is food. We set ourselves the ambitious ""30 by 30"" goal of producing 30% of our nutritional needs locally by 2030, up from less than 10% today. Our agri-food sector will enhance our resilience to food supply disruptions."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00362,2020-10-05-T-013,362,Heng Swee Keat,"The technology developed in support of this strategy, such as in seeds and alternative proteins, can be exported. We can grow these capabilities, building on our strengths in R&D and our standing as a trusted hub."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00363,2020-10-05-T-013,363,Heng Swee Keat,"Singapore is already the global R&D centre for AgriProtein, one of the world's leading insect protein companies. The R&D team develops technologies to upcycle food waste into sustainable animal feed solutions."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00364,2020-10-05-T-013,364,Heng Swee Keat,"As we grapple with climate change, environmental sustainability is an important aspect of our economic resilience for a low-carbon and resource-constrained future. Here again is an opportunity for the green sector to be a growth industry in its own right and to power our economy."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00365,2020-10-05-T-013,365,Heng Swee Keat,"First, we are transforming our industries to build a sustainable economy."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00366,2020-10-05-T-013,366,Heng Swee Keat,"We will continue to invest in research into energy and resource efficiency technologies and encourage adoption of these technologies through various incentives under EDB, EMA, BCA and NEA."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00367,2020-10-05-T-013,367,Heng Swee Keat,"Going forward, we will further promote the decarbonisation of the economy and pursue initiatives for a more sustainable economy."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00368,2020-10-05-T-013,368,Heng Swee Keat,"Under our Zero Waste Masterplan, we will promote the circular economy and support businesses to turn ""trash to treasure"", namely, to recycle or transform waste into useful inputs for production. Harnessing the circular economy model, JTC is working with companies on Jurong Island to build a more sustainable Jurong Island."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00369,2020-10-05-T-013,369,Heng Swee Keat,"We are increasing our deployment of renewable energy sources, such as solar energy, at both the national and industry level."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00370,2020-10-05-T-013,370,Heng Swee Keat,"And we will invest in new capabilities and solutions, such as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage to complement our existing R&D efforts. In time, we hope that these promising technologies can become commercially viable decarbonisation pathways in future."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00371,2020-10-05-T-013,371,Heng Swee Keat,"Even as we transform our existing industries, we are seeking new business opportunities in the green economy, given our region's growing needs for sustainable development."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00372,2020-10-05-T-013,372,Heng Swee Keat,We will establish ourselves as a carbon services hub in Asia.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00373,2020-10-05-T-013,373,Heng Swee Keat,"Efforts to limit the growth of carbon emissions will increase the demand for engineering, legal and consultancy services related to carbon."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00374,2020-10-05-T-013,374,Heng Swee Keat,The Alliance for Action for Sustainability is market-testing some concepts and business opportunities.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00375,2020-10-05-T-013,375,Heng Swee Keat,Finance is also an important enabler of green growth. We are developing financing solutions and markets in Singapore to help firms finance their adoption of more sustainable practices under MAS' Green Finance Action Plan.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00376,2020-10-05-T-013,376,Heng Swee Keat,"Taken together, our moves to strengthen our economic resilience and sustainability serve a dual purpose. They strengthen our economy so that we can bounce back quickly and better from shocks, while adding to our value proposition as a vital global node in Asia. In turn, all these initiatives will create many new opportunities and valuable jobs for our people."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00377,2020-10-05-T-013,377,Heng Swee Keat,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I have set out a set of interlocking strategies that will enable us to build back better and emerge stronger from this crisis. These strategies strengthen both our economy and our social compact."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00378,2020-10-05-T-013,378,Heng Swee Keat,"The key to achieving our objectives is working together. In our system, tripartism – between the Government, businesses and the Labour Movement – has been a tremendous source of strength."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00379,2020-10-05-T-013,379,Heng Swee Keat,"Our Emerging Stronger Taskforce's Alliances for Action are a new form of collaborative partnership – nimble, action-focused partnerships that involve people from a wide spectrum of society, while putting ideas into action quickly. This will further strengthen our capacity for economic transformation and change."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00380,2020-10-05-T-013,380,Heng Swee Keat,"By working together, our businesses will be better positioned to capture new opportunities in Asia, digitalisation, innovation and to build a more resilient and sustainable economy. Our people will be better placed to take on these new opportunities and bounce back from setbacks. We can then emerge from this pandemic stronger as an economy, as a society and as one people."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00381,2020-10-05-T-013,381,Heng Swee Keat,"As I announced in my August's Ministerial Statement, the continued support for our fight against COVID-19 will cost a further $8 billion this financial year. The additional measures I have spoken on today remain within this and earlier voted sums."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00382,2020-10-05-T-013,382,Heng Swee Keat,"I will fund the additional expenditure by reallocating monies from other areas with reduced spending, such as development projects that have been delayed due to COVID-19. The proposed reallocations are indicated in the Supplementary Estimates presented to Parliament today."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00383,2020-10-05-T-013,383,Heng Swee Keat,"When I announced the Fortitude Budget just after the start of the financial year, the economic situation and overall revenue picture were highly uncertain. We are now in the middle of the financial year and are in a better position to revise the overall revenue estimates."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00384,2020-10-05-T-013,384,Heng Swee Keat,"Hence, I am presenting the revised revenue estimates to Parliament, which will also take into account the revenue forgone arising from measures in the Fortitude Budget. The revised estimates will reflect a $1.5 billion draw on Past Reserves resulting from these measures, such as the Foreign Worker Levy waiver, for which the President had given in-principle approval. There is no additional draw for this latest support package itself."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00385,2020-10-05-T-013,385,Heng Swee Keat,"When I briefed the President and the Council of Presidential Advisers in August, I thanked them for their earlier support and approval for the use of Past Reserves to fund our response to COVID-19. In total, we are dedicating close to $100 billion to support our people and businesses."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00386,2020-10-05-T-013,386,Heng Swee Keat,"We are starting this new term of Government from a most challenging fiscal position. For this financial year, we already expect operating revenues to be 16% lower than initial estimates presented at the Unity Budget in February 2020."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00387,2020-10-05-T-013,387,Heng Swee Keat,"Revenue collections are expected to fall across all categories of revenue. For example, compared to the estimates at the start of the year, we expect GST collections to be down by 14%."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00388,2020-10-05-T-013,388,Heng Swee Keat,"We expect our revenue position to be weak for a number of years, as the effects of COVID-19 on the global economy linger and our economy slows. At the same time, our expenditure will rise as we continue to provide support for our people and businesses."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00389,2020-10-05-T-013,389,Heng Swee Keat,"In short, the Government is bearing a substantial part of the economy-wide adjustment during this crisis, through reduced revenues and substantial transfers to households and businesses."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00390,2020-10-05-T-013,390,Heng Swee Keat,This challenging fiscal position is a result of a global pandemic that no one could have predicted. What is within our control is how we use our fiscal resources well to respond to this crisis and to prepare for the future.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00391,2020-10-05-T-013,391,Heng Swee Keat,"We have dedicated close to $100 billion to support our people and businesses through this difficult period. As we do so, we must be careful not to spend in a way that squanders what generations before us have painstakingly built up."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00392,2020-10-05-T-013,392,Heng Swee Keat,"Our guiding principle is prudence, not austerity. We will continue to invest decisively in our national priorities, with a deep commitment to leave behind a better future for our children."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00393,2020-10-05-T-013,393,Heng Swee Keat,"There is much work to be done to transform our economy, and to build a fair and inclusive society, a sustainable and liveable city, and a safe and secure Singapore. We will have to find ways to fund these sustainably – higher taxes, and more effective spending. These are difficult choices, but we must meet them head-on."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00394,2020-10-05-T-013,394,Heng Swee Keat,"We will pay for our recurrent needs, like healthcare spending, with recurrent revenues, such as taxes. We will also maintain a disciplined and judicious use of borrowing, reserving its use for long-term infrastructure whose benefits are spread across many generations."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00395,2020-10-05-T-013,395,Heng Swee Keat,"Our Past Reserves have been critical in our fight against COVID-19. Governments around the world have committed trillions of dollars in response to COVID-19, and their debt levels have risen to record highs. Such debt will take generations to pay off. We have avoided this outcome because successive generations have built up strong reserves ahead of this crisis. We must have the discipline to start earning, saving, and investing for the future again."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00396,2020-10-05-T-013,396,Heng Swee Keat,COVID-19 is not our first crisis and certainly will not be the last.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00397,2020-10-05-T-013,397,Heng Swee Keat,"Mr Speaker, Sir, before I conclude, allow me to say a few words in Mandarin."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00398,2020-10-05-T-013,398,Heng Swee Keat,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] The COVID-19 situation in Singapore has stabilised. The key to controlling the pandemic is Singaporeans working together. We must remain vigilant and continue to cooperate in disease prevention and comply with the safe distancing measures. Testing, tracing, development and production of vaccines as well as the progress of controlling the pandemic in other countries will determine when we can safely reopen all our economic activities."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00399,2020-10-05-T-013,399,Heng Swee Keat,"At present, the pace of recovery varies across sectors. Hence, we will continue to provide assistance to Singaporeans and businesses from now till the next financial year or beyond."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00400,2020-10-05-T-013,400,Heng Swee Keat,"I understand that many businesses are still facing liquidity problems. I will extend the Temporary Bridging Loan Programme until September 2021, at reduced levels. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will also extend the MAS Singapore Dollar Facility for Enterprise Singapore Loans to help businesses continue to access credit."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00401,2020-10-05-T-013,401,Heng Swee Keat,"In addition, we will extend the Enhanced Training Support Package to June 2021 to provide course fee subsidies to hardest-hit sectors such as aviation and tourism."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00402,2020-10-05-T-013,402,Heng Swee Keat,"We understand that the uncertainty brought about by the pandemic has caused many young families to postpone their parenthood plans. Hence, we will provide eligible couples with a one-off additional support to help them reduce their child-rearing burden."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00403,2020-10-05-T-013,403,Heng Swee Keat,"The Government has started to draw up the Budget for 2021. We will continue to work closely with businesses, workers and community organisations to chart the way forward for Singapore."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00404,2020-10-05-T-013,404,Heng Swee Keat,"In order to create more quality jobs for our people, we need a flourishing economy. Fortunately, the Government has already started on industry transformation with the setting up of the Future Economy Council and introduced the Industry Transformation Maps for the various sectors. We have also established the Emerging Stronger Taskforce to refresh our economic strategy to prepare for the post-COVID era. We have also established the Alliances for Action to try out new ideas."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00405,2020-10-05-T-013,405,Heng Swee Keat,"We also need to further consolidate Singapore's position as a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation, and enterprise . We must invest in economic resilience and sustainability as a source of competitive advantage to prepare for a sustainable low-carbon future."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00406,2020-10-05-T-013,406,Heng Swee Keat,"Singapore must also foster inclusive growth. Our workers need to have skills to stay relevant. We will expand the Progressive Wage Model to more sectors over time, introduce job redesign and raise the skills of our workers to benefit more groups of lower-wage workers. And in time, we will slow down the growth of foreign workers in these sectors."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00407,2020-10-05-T-013,407,Heng Swee Keat,"In the Ministerial Statement I made in August, I have provided an additional $8 billion to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Together with the four Budgets announced earlier, we have promised as much as $100 billion to help our people and businesses to tide over this difficult time. Besides having to meet huge expenditures, our tax revenue is also facing substantial pressure due to economic slowdown globally."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00408,2020-10-05-T-013,408,Heng Swee Keat,"Despite this, our guiding principle is prudence, not austerity, when planning our finances. We will continue to invest resources in families, healthcare and infrastructure to enhance the quality of life of our people."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00409,2020-10-05-T-013,409,Heng Swee Keat,A thriving economy not only enables Singaporeans to realise their aspirations but also ensures that the Government has sufficient resources to meet their needs.
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00410,2020-10-05-T-013,410,Heng Swee Keat,"The post-COVID era will be a very different world. We will constantly refine our economic strategies to keep up with the times, innovate and maintain our competitive advantage. No matter how challenging the situations will be, we will put the interests and welfare of Singaporeans first. I believe that as long as we stay united, we will be able to overcome our immediate difficulties and usher in a better future."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00411,2020-10-05-T-013,411,Heng Swee Keat,"(In English)  Mr Speaker, our people and businesses are in the thick of battling COVID-19. We have adapted together, and I am glad that many continue to give their utmost in this difficult situation, and do their best for their families and communities."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00412,2020-10-05-T-013,412,Heng Swee Keat,"I have shared with this House and our people a stocktake of where we are, and where we are headed. I give you our commitment that we will continue to support our workers and businesses in this difficult time. We have worked out the steps to further re-open safely in the coming months. We have refreshed our economic strategy for a post-COVID-19 world, to remake Singapore as a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation, and enterprise, achieve inclusive growth and build resilience and sustainability, so as to achieve better lives and opportunities for our people."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00413,2020-10-05-T-013,413,Heng Swee Keat,"Given the great uncertainty ahead, we have to remain vigilant, work in close partnership, and continue to adapt as we plan and move ahead."
2020-10-05-T-013-S-00414,2020-10-05-T-013,414,Heng Swee Keat,"Work on Budget 2021 is underway. I encourage each of you to share with us your perspectives and ideas, and to do your part to build our future as part of our Singapore Together movement."

2020-10-05-T-018-S-00432,2020-10-05-T-018,432,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Speaker, I beg to move, ""That the Bill be now read a Second time""."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00433,2020-10-05-T-018,433,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, over the years, the Government has made significant efforts to strengthen Singapore's position as a premier international legal services and dispute resolution hub. We have capitalised on our geographical position and our strong adherence to the rule of law, to grow these services."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00434,2020-10-05-T-018,434,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In international arbitration, we have a comprehensive legal infrastructure that supports and at the same time intensively promotes arbitration alongside a robust and effective legal system. We have enhanced our laws, to constantly improve our system and to best meet the needs of the end user. We have a first class judiciary that is supportive of arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism and these are amongst the main reasons why Singapore is the most preferred seat of arbitration in the world today."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00435,2020-10-05-T-018,435,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We have come far, in the last 25 years, since the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, the SIAC, was set up. Today, Singapore is a popular seat for arbitration and also recognised as the third most preferred in international arbitration in the world. It is also the third most preferred arbitral institution, the SIAC, globally. In 2019, the SIAC saw a new high of 479 case filings. This is the third consecutive year that the SIAC's caseload has exceeded 400 and we will aim to do even better in the coming years."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00436,2020-10-05-T-018,436,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"This growth has only been possible with the close partnership between the Government and the legal fraternity. We share a common understanding about the value of alternative dispute resolution to Singapore's position as a legal services hub. At the same time, the arbitration landscape is constantly evolvingand we must be ever alert to changing needs and continue to improve Singapore's value propositions as a hub for international commercial arbitration."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00437,2020-10-05-T-018,437,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"With the uncertainties facing the global economy, it is now even more important that we regularly review and enhance our legislation, so as to continue to build on our reputation for being a trusted and neutral jurisdiction, under-girded by a strong rule of law and a legal framework that is responsive and remains relevant to the users' evolving needs."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00438,2020-10-05-T-018,438,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"This Bill, Mr Speaker, is moved in that spirit."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00439,2020-10-05-T-018,439,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In 2019, MinLaw conducted a broad public consultation on a number of proposals to improve and enhance and to consider for amendment of the International Arbitration Act or IAA. These proposals were aimed at enhancing our offerings, in the international arbitration arena and they included  the introduction of a default mode of appointment of arbitrators in multi-party situations; recognising that an arbitral tribunal and the High Court ought to have powers to enforce obligations of confidentiality; allowing a party to the arbitral proceedings to appeal to the High Court on a question of law arising out of an award, provided that parties have agreed to opt into this mechanism; and allowing parties to waive or limit the annulment grounds under the Model Law or the IAA. These are amongst the several proposals that were considered in the consultation in 2019."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00440,2020-10-05-T-018,440,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We consulted widely. And received feedback from arbitral institutions, from professional bodies, from practitioners, from academics, from multi-national companies who are themselves users of the arbitration in the international arena, key industry experts, both local and foreign. We have studied the feedback and the views very carefully. We received a broad range of views, because this really represents the end-users and the market. We received views on whether to implement them and if so, how then these changes ought to be implemented."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00441,2020-10-05-T-018,441,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"After extensive consultation with stakeholders, we have decided to proceed with the first of the two of the proposals first. This Bill therefore introduces two amendments."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00442,2020-10-05-T-018,442,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"First, it sets out a default mechanism for the appointment of arbitrators in multiparty situations."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00443,2020-10-05-T-018,443,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Second, it recognises that the tribunal and the High Court have the power to enforce confidentiality obligations in an arbitration."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00444,2020-10-05-T-018,444,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The rest of the proposals which were considered in the public consultation are still being studied and evaluated by my Ministry. I wish to thank and place on record our gratitide to all those who have contributed their views, their time and suggestions. They have been very welcomed and most helpful in shaping our views. I would like to emphasise that the Government remains committed to working with our stakeholders to strengthen the international arbitration regime so as to ensure that this regime remains attractive and continues to serve the needs of international businesses."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00445,2020-10-05-T-018,445,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, let me now take Members briefly through each of the amendments."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00446,2020-10-05-T-018,446,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"At present, the IAA provides a procedure for default appointment of arbitrators only where there are only two parties to a dispute; and where these parties have adopted an ad hoc arbitration instead of institutional arbitration or have chosen not to apply institutional arbitration rules. There is currently no similar procedure in the IAA or the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, for arbitrations where the dispute involves more than two parties."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00447,2020-10-05-T-018,447,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As Members know, today as transactions become more complex, disputes become more complex, multi-party arbitrations have been a growing trend. It is no longer often that we see a case where there is a single claimant with a single respondent. The increasingly complex and diverse nature of contracts means that more often than not, these disputes will be multi-party in nature."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00448,2020-10-05-T-018,448,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Where there are multiple parties, they may not be able to collectively agree on an arbitrator. Indeed, it is sometimes not in their interest to do so. A group of claimants will probably find it easier to be aligned, but in some multi-party cases, the interests of the disputing parties are not necessarily aligned neatly into two opposing sides and very often, they are not. As a result, it is not easy for these two groups of parties to agree on who they wish to nominate as their respective arbitrator. Such situations could also occur in disputes arising from multi-shareholder or multi-joint venture party disputes."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00449,2020-10-05-T-018,449,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In one example that was cited to us, the dispute comprised a state, a ministry and joint venture vehicle as the respondent. On the side of the claimants was a consortium of oil companies. The claimants were more easily able to co-ordinate and appoint an arbitrator, but when it came to the respondents, it was a lot more difficult as the different parties comprising the respondent group, comprised different entities with divergent interests. This would result in one side not having the benefit of a party appointed member on the tribunal, through no fault of his except that its interests were not coincident with the rest of the respondent group."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00450,2020-10-05-T-018,450,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Other examples include claims by a developer against two contractors, in a situation where each of the contractors might have had a distinct role and each of the contractors might well have a reason for suggesting that the other contractor is at fault. In those situations, you would not expect the respondent parties to be coincident or aligned in terms of their choice of arbitrators."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00451,2020-10-05-T-018,451,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,It is also not uncommon for respondents to try to delay or frustrate an arbitration by either failing to appoint an arbitrator or dragging their feet or just not taking part in the proceedings for nomination at all.
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00452,2020-10-05-T-018,452,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"These examples are just some, but they demonstrate the importance of having clear rules or procedures, upfront, to help parties to quickly resolve their differences, at the procedural stage. This is not a problem where parties have decided on a set of institutional rules, but it does become critical in the context of multi-party ad hoc arbitration situations where there is no agreed mechanism for the constitution of the arbitral tribunal, and where the parties' inability to agree on the appointment of their arbitrators would invariably lead to disagreement and delays in commencing the proceedings. This invariably adds to costs and unnecessary time spent on process and procedure, when the parties really ought to get into the heart of the substance of the dispute and resolve those disputes. We also want to ensure that, as far as possible, all parties receive equal treatment in the formation of the tribunal."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00453,2020-10-05-T-018,453,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, to address these concerns, clause 3 of the Bill introduces a new section 9B to the Act, to provide for the default procedure for the appointment of arbitrators in multi-party arbitrations. It will apply where there are three or more parties and three arbitrators. The default procedure will only apply where parties have not agreed on a procedure for the appointment of the arbitrators."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00454,2020-10-05-T-018,454,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Let me now take Members briefly through the steps involved in this procedure. The claimant must first appoint an arbitrator on or before the date of its request for arbitration. If there is more than one claimant, then all the claimants should make the appointment by agreement. The claimant or claimants must then inform the respondents of the appointment and state the appointed arbitrator together with the notice of arbitration."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00455,2020-10-05-T-018,455,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The respondent must then appoint an arbitrator after the receipt of the request for arbitration. Again, if there is more than one respondent, all the respondents need to make or agree to the appointment. The respondent must inform the claimant or claimants of the appointment. And finally, the two appointed arbitrators on both sides, will then get together and appoint the third arbitrator, who will be the presiding arbitrator."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00456,2020-10-05-T-018,456,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"However, where parties are unable to come to an agreement on their choice of arbitrator, then the new section 9B(2) provides that the appointing authority must then, in that situation and upon the request of any party, appoint all three arbitrators. In doing so, the appointing authority is required to have regard to and I quote, ""all relevant circumstances"". So, a broad discretion, to consider all the facts, all the matters which arise in the context of that appointment exercise is to be considered. 9B(2) also allows for the appointing authority to consider the choices already made by the parties at that stage, if any, and at what stage the proceedings might be at."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00457,2020-10-05-T-018,457,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Let me elaborate a little on this. Under the IAA, where the parties have not agreed on who should be the appointing authority, then the default appointing authority will be the President of the Court of Arbitration of the SIAC and any other person nominated by the Chief Justice to exercise the powers of that appointing authority."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00458,2020-10-05-T-018,458,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In doing so, the appointing authority may have regard to all relevant circumstances as I have mentioned and that authority may reappoint or may revoke any appointment that has already been made. The appointing authority may also designate any one of the three arbitrators as the presiding arbitrator. This process seeks to strike a balance between party autonomy and equality in the arbitration process. And this process is itself aligned with the rules of leading arbitral institutions on the multi-party appointment of arbitrators. So, the process that we have designed in this, is in terms of philosophy, aligned with that of leading institutions around the world."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00459,2020-10-05-T-018,459,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In similar fashion, the appointing authority will appoint the third arbitrator upon the request of any party, and if the two arbitrators appointed by the parties fail to agree on the appointment of the third arbitrator within the timeframe specified. Again, the appointing authority is granted discretion to consider all relevant circumstances, in coming to its decision. And these may also include the reasons why the two appointed arbitrators are not able to agree on the third arbitrator or their reasons for failing to come to an agreement within a specified time."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00460,2020-10-05-T-018,460,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Introducing this default mode of appointment in multi-party arbitrations will reduce potential delay in the conduct of arbitration proceedings. And this might arise where parties are unable to agree or refuse to agree as I mentioned earlier. Or, if the party-appointed arbitrators are themselves, unable to agree on a third appointment."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00461,2020-10-05-T-018,461,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"With the amendment, the parties' failure to agree on joint nominations, or indeed, a refusal to agree, will not prevent the arbitral tribunal from being constituted expeditiously. As any party in this default mode of appointment would have the right to make a request to the appointing authority, to cite reasons and to request the authority to make the appointment. This would also, as I mentioned, avoid the problem of parties seeking to delay or frustrate the arbitration by not taking part in the process at all."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00462,2020-10-05-T-018,462,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"And we believe that ultimately, this default mechanism, that is set up upfront, will save time for parties, will increase the overall efficiency of the process and will be a further step in continuing to make Singapore an attractive seat for complex international arbitration disputes including those with include multi-parties."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00463,2020-10-05-T-018,463,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, I now move on to broadly outline the second amendment."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00464,2020-10-05-T-018,464,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Currently, unless parties otherwise agree, the parties and the arbitral tribunal have a duty of confidentiality. This can arise in a number of ways. First, as a result of an agreement between the parties. Second, under any written law or rule of law and this includes the common law. Third, under the rules of arbitration including the rules of arbitration of an institution or organisation, which the parties have agreed to, or have been adopted by the parties."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00465,2020-10-05-T-018,465,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Confidential information obtained in anarbitration proceeding is protected from disclosure or use for any other collateral purpose, not the purposes for which the information was obtained, which is the arbitration."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00466,2020-10-05-T-018,466,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The scope and content of such a duty might differ. In other words, what does this duty cover, what kind of information, what type of documents? They might differ from case to case."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00467,2020-10-05-T-018,467,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"And depending on the circumstances of each case, this duty could cover documents used or disclosed in the proceedings."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00468,2020-10-05-T-018,468,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Our Courts over several decided cases have recognised that, in the absence of an express agreement between the parties regarding the existence and the scope of a duty of confidentiality, even in that parties to the arbitration have an implied duty of confidentiality."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00469,2020-10-05-T-018,469,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"At the same time, our courts have also commented that there ought not be any generalisations as to what the duty of confidentiality would encompass. In other words, do not set out upfront for every case and in each and every case for each type of categories of documents, what that scope of confidentiality covers because each case ought to be evaluated and contextualised in its own circumstances and the implied duty reflects the needs and expectations of the parties as well."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00470,2020-10-05-T-018,470,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"A distinction has to be drawn between different types of confidentiality attaching to different types of documents or evidence that has been obtained in these proceedings. So, for example, arbitration awards may be treated differently from the underlying materials used or disclosed in the course of arbitration proceedings."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00471,2020-10-05-T-018,471,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,This duty is also not absolute and the extent to which the duty is preserved will depend on the individual circumstances.
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00472,2020-10-05-T-018,472,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Given the centrality of confidentiality in arbitration, parties expect that their various obligations of confidentiality can be protected. However, the International Arbitration Act, as it currently stands, does not expressly recognise that. The arbitral tribunal does not recognise that the arbitral tribunal or the Courts have the power to enforce existing confidentiality obligations in the event of any such breach."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00473,2020-10-05-T-018,473,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Bill, therefore, seeks to insert a new section 12(1)(j) in the IAA to expressly recognise the powers of the arbitral tribunal and the High Court in terms of enforcing such a duty and to give effect to such obligations by making orders or giving directions as may be appropriate. These powers will apply, regardless of whether the obligations arise under any of the limbs which I mentioned earlier, whether the obligation arises by written law, by rule of law, under common law, rules of arbitration or by agreement between parties."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00474,2020-10-05-T-018,474,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The amendment recognises that confidentiality is an important attribute of arbitration and that the common law is still developing as to the precise extent of the obligation, in other words, whom it should bind and the exceptions, if any, to the rules. The Bill, therefore, does not codify obligations of confidentiality but seeks to strengthen parties’ ability to enforce existing obligations. It does not impose any new or additional obligations of parties beyond what has been set out in those three broad categories that I have mentioned."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00475,2020-10-05-T-018,475,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"For instance, the new provision will not require a plaintiff in arbitration-related court proceedings, to have to apply for the sealing of the court file and redaction of the papers, when commencing such proceedings and that is the position currently."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00476,2020-10-05-T-018,476,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, in summary, this Bill will strengthen our international arbitration framework. It keeps us up to date and will ensure that Singapore remains an attractive venue for international arbitrations. It will also show the international arbitration community that we have a continued commitment to providing strong legislative support for international arbitration. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00477,2020-10-05-T-018,477,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00478,2020-10-05-T-018,478,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I declare my interest as a Fellow of the Singapore Institute of Arbitrators."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00479,2020-10-05-T-018,479,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"I rise in support of this Bill, which amends the International Arbitration Act or IAA and seeks to enhance Singapore’s status as an international commercial arbitration hub."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00480,2020-10-05-T-018,480,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Over the years, Singapore’s position as an international dispute resolution hub in the globe has been cemented, largely due to its strong recognition of the rule of law. Alternative dispute resolution mechanisms – in particular, mediation and arbitration, are increasingly popular in recent times, with the privacy afforded to parties at such forums. Additionally, the Singapore Courts have also recognised arbitration agreements and stayed Court proceedings commenced in breach of such agreements. This lends weight and legitimacy to the arbitration landscape in Singapore and parties can be confident that their earlier agreements to arbitrate their disputes will be upheld in Singapore."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00481,2020-10-05-T-018,481,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,I understand that the Bill makes the following two key amendments
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00482,2020-10-05-T-018,482,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"First, the introduction of a default mode of appointment of arbitrators in multi-party arbitrations where parties’ agreement does not specify the procedure for such appointments; and"
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00483,2020-10-05-T-018,483,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Second, the Bill will explicitly provide for the arbitral tribunal and the High Court to enforce obligations of confidentiality, by making the relevant and/or necessary orders and directions, where such obligations exist."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00484,2020-10-05-T-018,484,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"I welcome the amendments, for the following reasons."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00485,2020-10-05-T-018,485,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"In an era where contractual obligations are being restructured, varied, suspended and/or terminated, as a result of the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on global economies, the potential for disputes over substantive matters is rife. The complexity of such matters may be exacerbated where there are more than two parties involved in the dispute. The amendments plug the lacuna in the law. With the stipulated procedure on appointment of arbitrators in multi-party arbitrations, this should minimise procedural disputes on the same time, resulting in saved time and costs for parties. We note that there is a growing trend in arbitrations from joint ventures, oil and gas matters, and merger and acquisition disputes – these disputes often involve substantial sums of monies, and there is all the more reason why we want these matters to be arbitrated in Singapore."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00486,2020-10-05-T-018,486,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Additionally, privacy and confidentiality remain the cornerstone of arbitration. The enactment of statutory powers of the arbitral tribunal and High Court to enforce existing confidentiality obligations, whether under agreements or at law, gives bite and effect to such obligations, which will certainly bring Singapore’s arbitration landscape to greater heights."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00487,2020-10-05-T-018,487,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"While the amendments do not seek to impose fresh and/or new confidentiality obligations in arbitration proceedings, my query relates to the scope of such existing obligations. The authorities suggest that the general principle in Singapore’s arbitration law is that arbitrations are not only private but also confidential."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00488,2020-10-05-T-018,488,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,The High Court in Myanma Yaung Chi Oo Co Ltd v Win Win Nu and another in 2003 held that “there was an implied obligation on the parties obtaining documents not to disclose them or use them for any purpose other than the dispute in which they were obtained.”
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00489,2020-10-05-T-018,489,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Disclosure, however, may be permissible in certain circumstances, such as the consent of the other party; by order or leave of Court; where it is reasonably necessary; and/or where it was in the interests of justice or where legally required."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00490,2020-10-05-T-018,490,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Would the Minister be able to provide certain specific instances in which confidentiality obligations are waived? For instance, where documents and/or evidence are raised in arbitration proceedings for which a finding has been made, are subsequently raised in court proceedings for a separate matter between the same parties who wish to deviate from their original position?"
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00491,2020-10-05-T-018,491,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"Sir, clarifications notwithstanding, I stand in support of this Bill."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00492,2020-10-05-T-018,492,Vikram Nair,"M r Speaker, I support this Motion. I declare my interest as a dispute resolution lawyer who practises international arbitration."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00493,2020-10-05-T-018,493,Vikram Nair,"Between June and August last year, MinLaw proposed several amendments to the International Arbitration Act for public consultations. Six areas were put out for public consultation and this Bill implements two of them."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00494,2020-10-05-T-018,494,Vikram Nair,The first amendment is to provide for a default mode of appointment for arbitrators in multi-party arbitrations.
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00495,2020-10-05-T-018,495,Vikram Nair,"Generally, when an agreement is entered into parties would usually include standard arbitration clauses in those agreements. These clauses would typically provide for tribunals consisting of a sole arbitrator, or sometimes three arbitrators. Where there are three arbitrators to be appointed, the usual method is for the Claimant to appoint one, the Respondent to appoint one and for the two appointed arbitrators to agree on a third. These are general practices, of course, specific clauses may vary. There is typically also a deadlock mechanism. If the two party appointed arbitrators cannot agree on the third, namely that it will be appointed by some third party, usually institution appointed under the arbitration agreement. This could be ICC, for example."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00496,2020-10-05-T-018,496,Vikram Nair,"Where problems arise is if there are more than two adverse parties in an arbitration and all are separately represented. I think the Minister highlighted several examples in his speech. And this is increasingly common in the context of multi-party agreements or in a situation where different agreements are consolidated because we now have rules permitting consolidation of arbitrations. So, in this scenario where you have three parties or more, there is a greater likelihood that parties will not be able to agree upon ""party appointed"" arbitrators. For example, if there are multiple Respondents, each separately represented and with different views on the same issue, there may be deadlock."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00497,2020-10-05-T-018,497,Vikram Nair,"What these rules provide for is the default appointment of arbitrators in such situations, which is eminently sensible. It requires parties to name arbitrators at specific points in the process as well. So, this also reduces the chance that the appointment of arbitrators will be used as a way to delay proceedings."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00498,2020-10-05-T-018,498,Vikram Nair,"Now, the core of arbitration is always party autonomy and party autonomy is still protected here because if parties have agreed on their own default mechanism where agreement cannot be reached, that should still prevail. What this amendment deals with such a situation where parties did not really provide the mechanism but would not have wanted deadlock either. So, what this provides is really a process by which this deadlock can be broken and the arbitration process can be moved smoothly along, even where parties or whether there are three or more parties who cannot agree on the arbitrator."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00499,2020-10-05-T-018,499,Vikram Nair,The second amendment also deals with another vexed issue and this is confidentiality
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00500,2020-10-05-T-018,500,Vikram Nair,"Confidentiality obligations are common in arbitration proceedings. This is also one of the main attractions of arbitration for many parties as they would prefer to settle disputes out of the public eye. However, the protection of confidentiality is sometimes more difficult because the most common remedy for breach of confidentiality is to get an injunction to prevent dissemination of the information. This would only be available if the information is not already in the public domain. Thus, speed is of the essence if one wishes to get injunctive relief to protect confidentiality of matters subject to arbitration."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00501,2020-10-05-T-018,501,Vikram Nair,"For most practitioners, we would agree that the Tribunal always have powers to make such orders but this was never expressly set out in the legislation. There was some debate on whether tribunals may have the power and to what extent that powers would extend to making confidentiality a part of the arbitration. So, by making this amendment to section 12 of the International Arbitration Act – which is really a section that spells out the Tribunal's powers – what it now provides specifically is that the Tribunal has such powers to make orders to protect confidentiality in an arbitration. Of course, the scope of this obligation is not defined precisely but this is necessary because exactly what documents are covered by it, which are already out in the public domain, which are not – these are all matters for that Tribunal to decide. But at least the one debate that will be off the table is whether or not the Tribunal has these powers."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00502,2020-10-05-T-018,502,Vikram Nair,"The other benefit of putting it in this section of the International Arbitration Act is that the Court will also now have the power to make an order where a Tribunal is not able to so this is also, I think, necessary as a catch all provision because given the speed with which one has to move if you want to protect confidentiality. If the Tribunal is not in place, for example, it may be necessary to go to the Courts to get such an order."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00503,2020-10-05-T-018,503,Vikram Nair,
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00504,2020-10-05-T-018,504,Vikram Nair,"I support and welcome both of these amendments. I think they both solve practical problems that practitioners encounter and it is a tidy solution. I would also add, in my concluding remarks, that I also agree with the other four proposals the Ministry had put forward in the consultation and hope that these too can be implemented in due course. Each of these are good solutions to practical problems."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00505,2020-10-05-T-018,505,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of this amendment Bill. I thank the Second Minister for Law for the explanations to the amendment Bill. I declare my interest as a legal practitioner in international arbitration disputes."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00506,2020-10-05-T-018,506,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,The two broad areas of amendments that the Bill proposes in relation to multi-party arbitration and powers of arbitral tribunals and the High Court are important are important and very much welcome.
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00507,2020-10-05-T-018,507,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"These amendments are also timely since the last amendments came in 2012. I have no doubt that with these amendments, more parties will benefit by bringing their disputes seated in Singapore or before the Singapore International Arbitration Centre or SIAC. I thank MinLaw which had proactively consulted various stakeholders in the international arbitration eco-system in Singapore. There were various proposals stated in the public consultation paper."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00508,2020-10-05-T-018,508,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"It has to be noted, though, that since the conclusion of the public consultation in 2019, admittedly we are now facing a much-changed global legal landscape ravaged by the current COVID-19 pandemic."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00509,2020-10-05-T-018,509,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Since the pandemic, there has been an uptick in terms of brewing cross-border disputes arising out of force majeure, impossibility of performance and other contractual breaches. However, even with our Singapore law firms’ increasing global presence, connections and international expertise, we continually face stiff competition to attract these disputes to our shores."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00510,2020-10-05-T-018,510,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"This is because clients and litigants are not only more sophisticated, but they are more sensitive to disputes, especially during this time. They are craving for certainty both in terms of costs and outcome of arbitration proceedings especially in the midst of this economic outlook. They require more flexibility; some may prefer greater court supervision on matters of law in arbitral proceedings. Others, as so, and prefer to waive appeals to the High Court on arbitral awards in the interests of having finality in the arbitral process. Corporations are also rethinking their agreements to prepare for a post-COVID world and considering the best dispute resolution mechanism that would offer them the best flexibility or option."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00511,2020-10-05-T-018,511,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Hence, while I applaud the efforts made to further ensure that Singapore’s arbitration regime remains responsive and relevant to evolving needs, I would urge MinLaw to consider expediting the tabling of the other proposals in the consultation paper as this will be key to cementing Singapore’s status as the preferred seat for arbitration disputes and leapfrog us over other competitive jurisdictions."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00512,2020-10-05-T-018,512,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,My focus is on two separate proposals raised in the consultation paper which are not tabled here in this Bill.
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00513,2020-10-05-T-018,513,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"The first of which would allow parties which seek greater curial intervention, to appeal to the High Court on a question of law in an award based on an opt-in mechanism. The second would allow parties who on the other hand prefer minimal curial intervention, to agree to waive or limit the annulment grounds under the relevant sections of the IAA and the Model Law."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00514,2020-10-05-T-018,514,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,I believe that these proposals would be beneficial to Singapore.
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00515,2020-10-05-T-018,515,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Firstly, they would sharpen our edge as a preferred seat of arbitration as they would cement parties’ autonomy, front and centre, in our arbitration legislative framework. Parties would have more options and flexibility to tailor an international agreement to suit their unique purposes, especially in preparation for a post-COVID world. This would hopefully then attract more cross-border transactions and international disputes to be heard before the Singapore Courts and SIAC."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00516,2020-10-05-T-018,516,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Consequently, it would only mean more exposure and training for our local lawyers from a professional development standpoint. As an international disputes lawyer, I have handled disputes in various jurisdictions and arbitration centres, SIAC here, London Court of International Arbitration and International Court of Arbitration in London and Paris. However, looking at the current climate, local younger lawyers, may not get much exposure and opportunity to experience handling international arbitration disputes. As such, we need to consider tabling these other proposals soon for the benefit of our future generations of talent."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00517,2020-10-05-T-018,517,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not a glass-half-empty kind of guy – looking at what is not there instead of what is. But I fear that if we do not fill the glass up now, we may be too late to do so in the future."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00518,2020-10-05-T-018,518,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Necessity is the mother of all inventions. There is an opportunity for us to reinvent and leapfrog the competition now.
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00519,2020-10-05-T-018,519,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"I therefore seek an indication from the Minister on whether the other proposals in the consultation paper, particularly the two I mentioned, are being tabled and if so, when. Clarifications notwithstanding, Mr Speaker, I support the amendments to the Bill."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00520,2020-10-05-T-018,520,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, Singapore has emerged as one of the leading hubs for international arbitration in recent years. In 2019, the Singapore International Arbitration Centre or SIAC set a new record with 479 new case filings and parties from over 59 jurisdictions chose Singapore as their destination for arbitration."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00521,2020-10-05-T-018,521,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,The amendments in this Bill will further strengthen our international arbitration regime and raise Singapore’s profile as a global centre for international arbitration. Parties who require arbitration services will also have access to a wider range of options best tailored to their needs.
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00522,2020-10-05-T-018,522,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"That said, I have a few clarifications on the Bill, many of which, Minister Edwin has already clarified on."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00523,2020-10-05-T-018,523,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"My first clarification is on the default mode of appointment of arbitrators in multi-party arbitration. It is good that we recognise that we need to provide for the appointment of arbitrators in multi-party disputes which are on the rise. They occur, for instance, in disputes involving joint ventures, mergers and oil and gas acquisition."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00524,2020-10-05-T-018,524,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"The new section 9B details the default mode of appointment for multi-party situations. There is some concern about point 4 of this section, which states  if either the claimants or the respondents fail to appoint an arbitrator, the appointing authority must appoint all three arbitrators. The authority can also reappoint or revoke any appointments made."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00525,2020-10-05-T-018,525,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,It is unclear why the failure of just one side to appoint an arbitrator means that the appointing authority must now step in to appoint all three arbitrators even if the other side managed to agree on their arbitrator.
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00526,2020-10-05-T-018,526,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Essentially, this means that failure to agree by one side, makes the agreement reached by the other side ineffective."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00527,2020-10-05-T-018,527,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,I do understand that it is common for arbitration institutions to require the appointing authority to appoint all three arbitrators if either the claimants or the respondents are unable to come to an agreement on an arbitrator.
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00528,2020-10-05-T-018,528,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"However, there is a permutation on this model under article 8(1) of the 2020 London Court of International Arbitration Rules. It says  where all parties have agreed in writing for each side to nominate a single arbitrator, but one side is not able to come to an agreement on a nomination, the other side is free to make its nomination."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00529,2020-10-05-T-018,529,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Party autonomy is a significant feature of arbitration.
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00530,2020-10-05-T-018,530,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"To ensure that parties’ agreements are given consideration, can the Minister confirm that the appointing authority should take into account the agreement reached by parties on one side on their arbitrator when appointing the three arbitrators?"
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00531,2020-10-05-T-018,531,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,My second clarification is on the amendment to expressly recognise the powers of the arbitral tribunal and the High Court to enforce obligations of confidentiality.
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00532,2020-10-05-T-018,532,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,This amendment is welcome and will assist in tightening the process and preserving confidentiality of the proceedings.
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00533,2020-10-05-T-018,533,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"That said, despite the express recognition, the Bill does not codify confidentiality obligations that the Minister mentioned."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00534,2020-10-05-T-018,534,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Given that one of the main draws of arbitration is the confidentiality of proceedings, and codifying confidentiality obligations will assist in reducing uncertainty and potential disputes over these obligations, can the Minister clarify the reasoning behind deciding against codifying confidentiality obligations?"
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00535,2020-10-05-T-018,535,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"For a good example, we can take a look at the arbitration scene in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Arbitration Ordinance expressly provides for a statutory duty of confidentiality in arbitration."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00536,2020-10-05-T-018,536,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Under section 18(1) of the Arbitration Ordinance, unless agreed by the parties, no party may publish, disclose or communicate information relating to the arbitral proceedings and awards."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00537,2020-10-05-T-018,537,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Notably, this confidentiality extends to the existence of arbitration proceedings. This position is also mirrored in article 45.1 of the 2018 Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre Rules."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00538,2020-10-05-T-018,538,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Hong Kong was ranked among the top five seats of arbitration worldwide in 2018 and still continues to have a lead over our own SIAC in 2019.
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00539,2020-10-05-T-018,539,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"We note that codifying confidentiality obligations may lead to some challenges. For instance, there may be difficulties in defining the scope of the duty of confidentiality and its exceptions."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00540,2020-10-05-T-018,540,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"However, such difficulties are already present in our current approach of implying the duty of confidentiality in arbitration."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00541,2020-10-05-T-018,541,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"In fact, it is not uncommon for arbitration proceedings to be delayed because of parties disputing over their scope of implied duty of confidentiality. The delay reduces one of the main draws of arbitration – its efficiency."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00542,2020-10-05-T-018,542,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"I hope the Minister will consider codifying confidentiality obligations, whether in the Act itself or in subsidiary legislation, as this would encourage parties to arbitrate in Singapore."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00543,2020-10-05-T-018,543,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"My final clarification is on the exclusion of the proposed opt-in mechanism for parties to incorporate a right to appeal to the High Court, on a question of law arising out of an arbitral award."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00544,2020-10-05-T-018,544,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Can the Minister clarify the reasoning behind deciding against including this right to appeal on a question of law?
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00545,2020-10-05-T-018,545,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"As things stand, parties may only apply to the High Court to set aside an arbitral award on relatively limited grounds. These grounds include fraud, corruption, breach of the rules of natural justice or contravention of Singapore’s public policy."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00546,2020-10-05-T-018,546,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"One of the key components of arbitration proceedings is finality. However, this should not be at the expense of leaving questions of law unresolved. This may potentially have significant impact on the substantive rights of parties."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00547,2020-10-05-T-018,547,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Furthermore, the opt-in mechanism allows parties to choose to exercise this right or to rely on the default position. This adds to Singapore’s commitment in giving parties the flexibility to determine certain issues and procedures in their arbitral proceedings, as compared to court proceedings."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00548,2020-10-05-T-018,548,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"In fact, the right to appeal on a question of law has already been expressly recognised in our domestic arbitration. Section 49 of our Arbitration Act provides that a party to arbitral proceedings may, with the agreement of all parties and with the leave of the Court, appeal to the Court on a question of law arising out of an arbitral award."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00549,2020-10-05-T-018,549,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Giving parties this option to have a right to appeal on a question of law may not only encourage more parties to arbitrate in Singapore, but also assist in determining case law in Singapore."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00550,2020-10-05-T-018,550,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, in conclusion, I look forward to Singapore increasing its global standing as a centre for international arbitration."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00551,2020-10-05-T-018,551,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Notwithstanding my clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill. If I may add, Sir, I slowed down my speech and spaced it out significantly so that I did not deliver my speech in a quick-fire fashion as Minister Edwin mentioned at the last Sitting about my speeches. I took into account the Minister’s previous feedback and I hope that he will now agree to all my proposals in this speech."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00552,2020-10-05-T-018,552,Speaker,Minister Edwin Tong.
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00553,2020-10-05-T-018,553,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank all the Members, particularly Mr Ng for slowing his speech, but I will have a response for him, perhaps in a less quick-fire fashion."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00554,2020-10-05-T-018,554,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, I am very grateful that the Members have highlighted that the principle of party autonomy, which really has been one of the key considerations in the way in which we have organised arbitration rules or laws. And obviously, our whole eco-system in encouraging parties to come into Singapore and choose Singapore as a neutral, trusted venue."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00555,2020-10-05-T-018,555,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,We understand and agree with this principle which really undergirds the amendments that we have proposed in this Bill.
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00556,2020-10-05-T-018,556,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Members have sought various clarifications and I will address these in turn.
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00557,2020-10-05-T-018,557,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Ng’s first question relates to the question of whether the appointing authority should also take into account the agreement that had already been reached by the parties at the stage where the appointing party’s role is triggered, and whether it should take that into account when deciding on the appointment all three arbitrators."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00558,2020-10-05-T-018,558,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, that was a very good question and let me just give a little bit of background before I answer Mr Ng’s question. In the feedback we that we received from the various consultations, the principle of equal treatment of the parties in the context especially of the appointment of the tribunal was something which was emphasised to us. It is part of the adjudicative system."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00559,2020-10-05-T-018,559,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Arbitral institutional rules and also the national laws unanimously impose a requirement, whether express or implied, that the parties be treated equally throughout the process."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00560,2020-10-05-T-018,560,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Although the solutions adopted differ in some particulars, most major institutional rules, including the LCIA Arbitration Rules that Mr Louis Ng referred to, now either permit or, in fact, require the institutions to designate the entire tribunal in multi-party proceedings. In other words, the moment there is a disagreement on one party's nomination, then the rules either permit or, in fact, they require the appointing authority to designate the entire tribunal. That is the position in LCIA and also some other major institutions. The reason behind this is to preclude imbalance or, at least, the perception of imbalance in the way in which the tribunal is subsequently appointed and avoid a situation where just one party has a say on his or her nominee for the arbitration."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00561,2020-10-05-T-018,561,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In scoping section 9B, we can see that there are many reasons why a party may not be able to agree or has chosen not to agree to the arbitrator. It could be because parties do not identify with the same “side” as the party nominating it even though we may be co-respondents to the arbitration, or it may be because one party is intentionally delaying the proceedings, not nominating, or dragging its feet, as I have mentioned earlier, so as to trigger the default mechanism to appoint all three and, in that process, hope to sideline the choice put up by the other party. And we are very much alive to that possibility."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00562,2020-10-05-T-018,562,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, to allow the appointing authority some flexibility and the discretion to take into account what I have just articulated and, indeed, what Mr Louis Ng had put forward in his speech, the appointing authority is now clothed with the ability to look at all relevant circumstances and we do not define upfront what that might be precisely because it may differ from case to case and the antecedent conduct of the parties in terms of the choice of the arbitrator would be something that the appointing authority would look at."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00563,2020-10-05-T-018,563,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, to that extent, the authority can look at factors, such as whether the parties on one side may have reached an agreement or not in the way that Mr Louis Ng has put it, or the reasons why one side was not able to come to an agreement. That is also relevant. It may not be because of trying to frustrate the process or trying to delay the proceedings. That is also relevant. And the appointing authority will have the ability to look at and study all these factors."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00564,2020-10-05-T-018,564,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In the context of appointing the three arbitrators, we have given broad remit to the authority to do so. So, it may reappoint. We have expressly said it may reappoint, meaning if one party has already chosen, it may reappoint, or it may decide to revoke the appointment altogether and decide afresh."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00565,2020-10-05-T-018,565,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We believe that this strikes the right balance between the principles of equality and also party autonomy, something that Mr Louis Ng and Mr Vikram Nair also spoke about."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00566,2020-10-05-T-018,566,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On the question of confidentiality, the amendment is to recognise that the tribunal and the High Court will have power to enforce these obligations. The amendments do not seek to change the law or add new obligations, but seeks to ensure that it is clear beyond the pale that the tribunal and the High Court will have the power to enforce these obligations."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00567,2020-10-05-T-018,567,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Patrick Tay asked for clarifications on instances where the obligations might be waived. Sir, the duty has its roots in common law. As Mr Patrick Tay mentioned, Justice Kan mentioned this in a 2003 decision that it is implied that parties who choose arbitration are more likely to take into account the fact that these are private hearings and have the cloak of confidentiality."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00568,2020-10-05-T-018,568,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Courts, however, have also noted – and I think Mr Patrick Tay also briefly alluded to that – that we should take care not to generalise what that duty would encompass upfront, that is, not to spell it out upfront. Mr Vikram Nair also noted that this gives a degree of flexibility because, as a case proceeds, the quality and nature of confidentiality over a specific piece of information or document might change. Likewise, whether or when a confidentiality obligation is to be waived must also be assessed in the context of the facts in which the issue arises."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00569,2020-10-05-T-018,569,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I would add that, in any given case, regard must also be given to the chosen institutional rules that the parties have agreed will apply to their own arbitration and whether or not there are any specific rules in that setting relevant to the way in which they look at confidentiality."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00570,2020-10-05-T-018,570,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"To a reference that Mr Louis Ng brought up about institutional rules, I should add that the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) Rules do stipulate the scope of confidentiality and that it is stated to cover the existence of the proceedings itself, like the Hong Kong position that Mr Louis Ng mentioned – the pleadings, evidence and what other materials might arise in the context of the proceedings and, of course, all documents produced in discovery in those proceedings, and, finally, the award that was issued at the culmination of the proceedings."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00571,2020-10-05-T-018,571,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,I will come back to this point in a moment as I address Mr Louis Ng's other point in a less quick-fire way.
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00572,2020-10-05-T-018,572,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Some examples of situations where the Courts have found that confidentiality obligations have been waived or where disclosure of confidential information is accepted include the following
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00573,2020-10-05-T-018,573,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"(a) where the award is registered as a Singapore judgment and, obviously, it then enters into the realm of the public domain and privacy can no longer be attached to those proceedings and, therefore, the award itself;"
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00574,2020-10-05-T-018,574,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"(b) alternatively, where parties have, by their own conduct, indicated for an agreement for the confidentiality to be waived, for example, by not requesting that an open Court proceeding in which confidential information is to be discussed or would be brought up in those proceedings, not requesting that those proceedings be heard in-camera; and"
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00575,2020-10-05-T-018,575,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,(c) where there is reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct and there is a “public interest” behind why that information ought to be disclosed and an exception made for the confidential information arising out of the arbitration proceedings to be disclosed.
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00576,2020-10-05-T-018,576,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Moving to Mr Louis Ng's question as to why the obligation of confidentiality is not codified and whether we would consider doing so, let me again give a bit of background."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00577,2020-10-05-T-018,577,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As I have mentioned earlier, it has its roots in common law, so it is implied in the proceedings. Mr Louis Ng mentioned that, in Hong Kong, it has been codified and it might then improve or, at least, enhance the proceedings. Let me just clarify that the fact that there is a duty of confidentiality is really quite unarguable. So, what Hong Kong has done is to say that there is a duty of confidentiality. But in our proceedings here in Singapore, especially in the context of what I have mentioned in the SIAC Rules, it is really quite unarguable. What the real issue is, when it comes to confidentiality, is often what are the quality and nature of that confidentiality. What does it do to the information and documents that are exchanged in those proceedings? That, as I have mentioned earlier, might take a different shape or be differently contoured, depending on the context."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00578,2020-10-05-T-018,578,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, what exactly is that scope? To whom does it apply? Does it apply only to the parties or the witnesses? You may have to look at what are the facts of that case, bring them up and the context, before you assess that question. When does it apply? Does it apply at the start? But it may not have the same quality as the start if, subsequently, information is disclosed or allowed to be disclosed or divulged by one party. So, the further context as to when you are looking at the issue will also be relevant."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00579,2020-10-05-T-018,579,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Of course, finally, how is it best enforced? Is it by way of an injunction of some sort, a mandatory injunction, or would the parties be allowed to disclose it in a measured way under a ringfence or redacted."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00580,2020-10-05-T-018,580,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, these are all questions that I hope Mr Louis Ng will appreciate, but which arise maybe as a consequence of there being a confidentiality obligation in the first place which, as far as we are concerned, there is no argument over. Which is why we are proposing these amendments to allow the tribunal and the High Court to enforce these obligations."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00581,2020-10-05-T-018,581,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"But the question as to what you do with the confidential obligations, how you enforce, is something that ought to be looked at case to case and context to context. That is something that the High Court here in Singapore and also internationally have espoused. So, for that reason, we have decided against codifying and setting out the exact scope to what it applies and when it applies and let the Courts and the tribunal assess that question on a case-by-case basis."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00582,2020-10-05-T-018,582,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In addition, we have also taken this view because it is also a recognition that this area of law is still evolving. There have been cases, both locally as well as internationally. Some, Mr Patrick Tay has cited earlier, and also International case law on this and it is a question that is best left to the common law at this stage to develop more fully."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00583,2020-10-05-T-018,583,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I would add to Mr Louis Ng's point also that where parties to an agreement – if you come to an agreement and you have a specific concern, you have a specific confidentiality attached to, say, an IP patent or to a piece of information that is very sensitive – it is open to the parties to expressly incorporate provisions specific to their own needs in their arbitration agreement and that will be enforced. Members will remember that, at the outset, I mentioned that the confidentiality arises in a number of ways, one of which is through the parties' express agreement in the arbitration agreement itself."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00584,2020-10-05-T-018,584,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Louis Ng will know that the Courts have consistently looked at the scope of the arbitration agreement and to study that to assess the extent of the confidentiality obligations.
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00585,2020-10-05-T-018,585,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Next, let me move on to the amendments which have considered in the consultation but not brought in this Bill. Both Mr Louis Ng and Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim have enquired about these amendments and the proposals that were considered. I have briefly outlined these other considerations earlier and they broadly relate to the opt-in right of appeal and the proposal for the waiver or limitation of the annulment grounds."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00586,2020-10-05-T-018,586,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"These are still being studied and are not part of today's Bill, but I welcome Mr Vikram Nair's as well as Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim's views on them. I think Mr Louis Ng also said that these would add value to our landscape. We agree with the views that are set out. We will add them on to the very many REACH views that we have received so far on this and study them together with the various stakeholders that I have mentioned at the outset. When we are ready with that, we will come back and I am sure we will also consult with Mr Louis Ng and the others who have raised the points here."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00587,2020-10-05-T-018,587,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In the final analysis, on these points, I want to assure Members and the arbitration community that my Ministry recognises the range of options and the diversity of views on these proposals. As I have said, some go towards whether or not they should be implemented; others have given us suggestions as to how they can be implemented. The operationalisation of these mechanisms also needs some study to ensure that they are consistent and that they lend themselves to fairness."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00588,2020-10-05-T-018,588,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, in conclusion, we believe that this Bill introduces amendments that best serve the needs of the arbitral community. As I have flagged, this is a process that is on-going and we are always taking into account what users want to see – developments in the law and, of course, international conventions and practices as well. We will continue to make Singapore an attractive seat for arbitration disputes."
2020-10-05-T-018-S-00589,2020-10-05-T-018,589,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"With that, Sir, I beg to move."

2020-10-05-T-019-S-00595,2020-10-05-T-019,595,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Speaker, I beg to move, ""That the Bill be now read a Second time""."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00596,2020-10-05-T-019,596,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Singapore’s reputation as a clean city is a source of national pride. High standards of public hygiene have been a cornerstone of our good public health.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00597,2020-10-05-T-019,597,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Over the years, we have introduced policies and programmes to shape social norms and keep Singapore clean and liveable. These include anti-littering campaigns, mobilising the community and uplifting the environmental services industry."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00598,2020-10-05-T-019,598,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Internationally, Singapore is known as a clean and green city. Nine in 10 Singaporeans expressed satisfaction with the cleanliness of our public spaces and take pride in keeping Singapore clean, according to a survey by the Singapore Management University or SMU. But there is room for improvement."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00599,2020-10-05-T-019,599,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We are overly reliant on efficient cleaning services. Public toilets in coffee shops and hawker centres are an area of concern and the cleanliness of bin centres and waste disposal areas need to be improved. One in five respondents to the SMU survey thought it acceptable to leave rubbish around if there was already litter in the area. One in three respondents believed that it is the cleaners' responsibility to return trays. Clearly, we still have some way to go to inculcate a strong sense of social responsibility in Singaporeans to do their part to keep public spaces clean."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00600,2020-10-05-T-019,600,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"At the same time, we remain vulnerable to public health threats. In 2003, SARS came to Singapore and claimed 33 lives. We have also had to tackle local public health incidents such as the gastroenteritis outbreaks that occurred over 2018 and 2019. Linked to contaminated environments, these outbreaks affected more than 1,200 people."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00601,2020-10-05-T-019,601,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"There are also waterborne health risks from pathogens that lurk in water, such as the Legionella bacteria, which can be transmitted through the inhalation of contaminated airborne water droplets. Aquatic facilities, such as swimming pools, spa pools and water playgrounds, and aerosol-generating systems, such as cooling towers, can harbour such bacteria."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00602,2020-10-05-T-019,602,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Between 2000 and 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported around 57 Legionellosis outbreaks associated with aquatic facilities in the US. More than 600 fell ill and six people lost their lives. Similar Legionellosis outbreaks have occurred in Australia, France and the United Kingdom. While such outbreaks have not occurred here, we must not be complacent."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00603,2020-10-05-T-019,603,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"For the past eight months, we have been battling the COVID-19 pandemic, a public health crisis unprecedented in scale and impact. Among the many lessons learnt, an important one is the need for high standards of sanitation and hygiene. COVID-19 will not be the last global pandemic that we have to face. We must shore up our public health defences and be ready to contain emerging outbreaks, when they come."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00604,2020-10-05-T-019,604,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We can learn from some best practices internationally on managing public health risks more effectively. Take Japan. At the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, the Japanese football team and fans earned worldwide praise for practising social responsibility and cleaning up after themselves."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00605,2020-10-05-T-019,605,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Other than public education, we learnt that a pillar of the national habit of cleanliness in Japan was its Building Sanitation Law. Large premises, such as schools and shopping centres, are required to conduct thorough cleaning periodically and undertake checks on pest control, indoor air quality and cooling towers."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00606,2020-10-05-T-019,606,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Japan's legislation also places the responsibility for a building's sanitary conditions on its owners and formalises the role of environmental health personnel to oversee all environmental matters in the premises, including oft-neglected back-of-house areas, such as bin centres. This has fostered a strong sense of ownership on cleanliness."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00607,2020-10-05-T-019,607,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"South Korea is another example. It transformed its cleaning industry and processes following the deadly outbreak of MERS in 2015. Through courses by the International Sanitary Supply Association, cleaners are better-trained and certified on the correct cleaning procedures and disinfection methods."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00608,2020-10-05-T-019,608,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In New York City, regulations were passed for cooling towers to be registered, tested and regularly maintained after a Legionellosis outbreak in 2015. This has enhanced New York's capability to manage waterborne public health risks."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00609,2020-10-05-T-019,609,Grace Fu Hai Yien,These are useful lessons as we seek to strengthen our framework to keep Singapore clean.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00610,2020-10-05-T-019,610,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We have adopted a multi-pronged approach to keep Singapore clean under the national SG Clean movement launched earlier this year. The SG Clean movement builds on existing hygiene measures and goes further to raise our standards in public hygiene and inculcate a culture of cleanliness, so that we can emerge stronger from COVID-19."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00611,2020-10-05-T-019,611,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"SG Clean has three key thrusts. First, raising cleanliness standards of premises by working with premises owners; second, transforming the cleaning industry to meet greater demands; and third, inculcating shared responsibility for cleanliness among individuals, as end-users and patrons of premises. Let me elaborate on these thrusts and explain how the initiatives under the proposed Bill fit in."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00612,2020-10-05-T-019,612,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"First, to raise cleanliness standards of premises, we must ""Build Right"", ""Clean Right"" and ""Audit the Results"". To ""Build Right"", we have incorporated in the building plan process, requirements on premises owners, such as the provision of sensor-operated toilet flushing systems and proper layout of bin centres. Well-designed and well-maintained infrastructure is an enabler of good public health."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00613,2020-10-05-T-019,613,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"To support premises owners in rejuvenating infrastructure, the National Environment Agency or NEA recently announced the Toilet Improvement Programme for hawker centres and coffee shops, to incentivise premises to renovate ageing toilet infrastructure."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00614,2020-10-05-T-019,614,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"""Clean Right"" and ""Audit the Results"" are important steps where premises owners adopt proper cleaning regime as guided by NEA's advisories on cleaning and disinfection. And NEA's SG Clean Quality Mark certifies premises that adopt good cleaning practices."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00615,2020-10-05-T-019,615,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"A key part of the Bill is to support this thrust under SG Clean, by clarifying lines of accountability for maintaining clean premises and setting clear standards expected of premises owners. I will speak more on this later."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00616,2020-10-05-T-019,616,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Second, we will continue to transform the cleaning industry to meet increased and more sophisticated demand for cleaning services. In doing so, we also hope to create more good jobs. The Environmental Services Industry Transformation Map or ESITM launched in 2017 has laid the foundation for this. For example, by driving technology adoption, upskilling the workforce and enhancing productivity through job redesign and outcome-based contracting."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00617,2020-10-05-T-019,617,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Our cleaners are the unsung frontline heroes of the COVID-19 outbreak, working tirelessly to keep Singapore clean and safe. We will continue to support cleaners as part of the industry transformation journey. For example, we had introduced the Progressive Wage Model or PWM and PWM Bonus to raise employment standards, facilitate career progression and promote better wages for skilled cleaners."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00618,2020-10-05-T-019,618,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Since we went into the COVID-19 period, NEA has also collaborated with training institutions to launch new Continuing Education and Training courses on environmental infection control to ensure that cleaners are trained to protect themselves against public health threats at work. Through this structured training framework, cleaners can become multi-skilled and expect to earn higher wages."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00619,2020-10-05-T-019,619,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Third, we will promote good personal hygiene and social norms among end-users and patrons at premises. We launched a campaign under SG Clean earlier this year to promote positive behaviour in our shared spaces and stepped up recently with initiatives on returning trays and using public toilets responsibly in hawker centres and coffee shops. More than 5,000 SG Clean Ambassadors have stepped forward to spread SG Clean messages across the country."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00620,2020-10-05-T-019,620,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"All in, we have a sound framework that has enabled us to maintain good public health."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00621,2020-10-05-T-019,621,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Speaker, Sir, it is in this context that I am introducing the Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill. It will introduce three broad shifts in our approach to environmental sanitation and hygiene."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00622,2020-10-05-T-019,622,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"First, we will adopt a more proactive approach in guarding against public health threats and institute baseline environmental sanitation standards for routine and periodic cleaning across high-risk premises. For example, the standards will cover daily cleaning frequencies for high-touch surfaces, such as toilets and lift buttons and oft-neglected areas, such as bin centres; periodic thorough cleaning, say every six months, covering areas that are not easily accessible and not covered by routine cleaning; a pest management plan; and a cleaning and disinfection protocol. The standards will also specify desired outcome-based cleanliness indicators to be achieved and the tools and training requirements for workers to carry out cleaning effectively."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00623,2020-10-05-T-019,623,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Second, we will work with industry partners to co-develop environmental sanitation standards applicable to their respective sectors and tailored to their needs. We will progressively implement these from mid-2021, starting with higher risk premises with immuno-vulnerable occupants, high footfall or a history of outbreaks, such as our pre-schools, schools, youth and eldercare facilities, hawker centres and coffee shops."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00624,2020-10-05-T-019,624,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Third, we will place greater responsibility on the Managers of high-risk premises to ensure that the environmental sanitation standards are met. With the support of trained environmental control coordinators and environmental control officers, or ECCs and ECOs in short, the Managers will be required to implement environmental sanitation programmes developed for the premises by the ECCs and ECOs that meet the environmental sanitation standards."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00625,2020-10-05-T-019,625,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"To provide a pipeline of competent ECCs and ECOs, we will introduce a two-tiered competency-based framework. In general, premises, such as a pre-school or coffee shop, will require an ECC while more complex or multi-tenanted premises will require an ECO, with a higher level of competency to coordinate efforts amongst different tenants within the premises. This will provide a career progression pathway for ECCs to become ECOs, as they gain experience and upgrade their skills to take on more responsibilities. We expect to train 3,800 ECCs from the first quarter of 2021."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00626,2020-10-05-T-019,626,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Similarly, we will proactively regulate higher risk aquatic facilities and aerosol-generating systems, to manage risks from potential waterborne disease outbreaks."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00627,2020-10-05-T-019,627,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now highlight the main elements of the Bill."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00628,2020-10-05-T-019,628,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill establishes an environmental sanitation regime for specified premises, and regulatory regimes for aquatic facilities and aerosol-generating systems."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00629,2020-10-05-T-019,629,Grace Fu Hai Yien,I will speak first on the environmental sanitation regime.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00630,2020-10-05-T-019,630,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The new section 62A empowers NEA to designate, with Minister's approval, specified premises for which an environmental sanitation programme is required. The new section 99A gives powers to the Director-General to issue, approve, amend or revoke codes of practice and standards of performance with respect to the provisions of the EPHA, including programmes and measures relating to environmental sanitation."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00631,2020-10-05-T-019,631,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"A key feature of this Bill is to clarify the responsibilities for keeping specified premises clean. The new section 62B prescribes the duties of the ECC or ECO, which include developing an environmental sanitation programme for the specified premises, monitoring its implementation and recommending remedial measures to address any default in implementation."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00632,2020-10-05-T-019,632,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The Manager of the specified premises must endorse and submit to the Director-General the environmental sanitation programme, implement the programme and any remedial measures recommended by the ECC or ECO. In accordance with the lines of accountability, the Manager will be responsible for any failure to implement the programme."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00633,2020-10-05-T-019,633,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"To ensure that ECCs and ECOs have the technical competence required to perform their roles, the new section 61A empowers the Director-General to register or refuse to register an individual as an ECC or ECO, and stipulates the circumstances under which the Director-General may suspend or cancel such registration. The new section 61B provides for appeals to the Minister against the Director-General's decisions made under section 61A."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00634,2020-10-05-T-019,634,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Notwithstanding upstream preventive efforts under the environmental sanitation regime, we must be prepared to intervene at the first warning signs of a potential health risk. The new section 62C empowers the Director-General to issue directives to close any premises, clean or disinfect the premises or any public service vehicle, or take other necessary measures in respect of the premises or public service vehicle, to prevent or manage health risks or disease outbreaks."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00635,2020-10-05-T-019,635,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Finally, we must ensure that the environmental sanitation regime is properly implemented and the directives are complied with. The new section 62D empowers the Director-General and authorised officers to conduct compliance checks and obtain documents and information for the purposes of the new sections 62A, 62B and 62C."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00636,2020-10-05-T-019,636,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I will next talk about how the Bill strengthens environmental hygiene in higher-risk aquatic facilities and aerosol-generating systems under the new Parts VII and VIIA in the Bill."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00637,2020-10-05-T-019,637,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Presently, swimming pools are the only type of aquatic facilities licensable under the EPHA. We will extend our licensing regime to more categories of aquatic facilities, such as multi-use spa pools and water playgrounds, which have become commonplace in Singapore. To effect this, the new section 63 requires the owner or occupier of any premises with a licensable aquatic facility to obtain a licence from the Director-General, prior to its use or operation."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00638,2020-10-05-T-019,638,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"While we currently have regulations for aerosol-generating systems, such as cooling towers, we do not have a registry of these systems and their locations. To strengthen our ability to respond to potential health risks, such as in the event of an outbreak, the new section 66A requires the owner or occupier of any premises with a registrable aerosol-generating system to register it with the Director-General prior to its use or operation."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00639,2020-10-05-T-019,639,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"To prevent or manage potential health risks or disease outbreaks, the new section 64 empowers the Director-General to require the cessation of the use or operation of any aquatic facility, or class of aquatic facilities. This section also empowers the Director-General to require the cessation of the use or operation of a licensable aquatic facility if there has been a contravention of any applicable requirement. Similar powers are provided under the new section 66B for aerosol-generating systems."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00640,2020-10-05-T-019,640,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We will introduce monitoring powers under the new sections 65 and 66C for the Director-General and authorised officers to conduct compliance checks on any aquatic facility or aerosol-generating system and to obtain documents and information to administer, enforce or ascertain compliance with the requirements in Parts VII and VIIA."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00641,2020-10-05-T-019,641,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill marks another milestone in our efforts to keep Singapore clean and safe. The state of public cleanliness reflects the character of our citizens. Through collective action and co-ownership, we will forge a cleaner, stronger and kinder Singapore for generations to come. Mr Speaker, I beg to move."

2020-10-05-T-019-S-00643,2020-10-05-T-019,643,Speaker,Order. I propose to take a break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 4.25 pm.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00644,2020-10-05-T-019,644,Speaker,Sitting accordingly suspended
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00645,2020-10-05-T-019,645,Speaker,at 4.05 pm until 4.25 pm.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00646,2020-10-05-T-019,646,Speaker,Sitting resumed at 4.25 pm.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00647,2020-10-05-T-019,647,Speaker,[(proc text) Debate resumed. (proc text)]
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00648,2020-10-05-T-019,648,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, I love it when I bring my three daughters out by myself and have some Daddy-Daughters time while Mummy takes a break. It is precious quality time, which I wish I have more of."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00649,2020-10-05-T-019,649,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,I am glad to share that I no longer need to change nappies. They are big girls now and use the toilet. That is of course absolutely good news but also absolutely bad news at times.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00650,2020-10-05-T-019,650,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Every time they say the words, “Daddy, I need to wee wee”, it sparks a mad crazy frantic race to find a toilet. Not just any toilet but a male toilet, which has clean seats, which my daughters can sit on."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00651,2020-10-05-T-019,651,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"That, unfortunately, is a hard thing to find, especially in coffee shops and hawker centres. The reality is that many of our public toilets stink. And I am not just talking about the smell. Often, seats are covered in urine and the entire facility is unhygienic."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00652,2020-10-05-T-019,652,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, my daughters and I are extremely supportive of this Bill."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00653,2020-10-05-T-019,653,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,This is a public health issue that we all need to tackle. It is also not just about toilets but about maintaining cleanliness in premises with high footfall and immuno-vulnerable occupants.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00654,2020-10-05-T-019,654,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, the Government Parliamentary Committee or GPC for Sustainability and the Environment strongly supports this Bill as well."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00655,2020-10-05-T-019,655,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"The GPC Members will share different perspectives on how we can raise our public hygiene standards. Together, our speeches will articulate four key proposals."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00656,2020-10-05-T-019,656,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"First, the GPC proposes that we implement a grading system to measure the cleanliness of public toilets and incentivise operators by linking these grades to licence renewal or tax rebates."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00657,2020-10-05-T-019,657,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Second, the GPC proposes that the Ministry reviews and considers expanding the scope of premises covered by the Bill."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00658,2020-10-05-T-019,658,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Third, the GPC proposes that cleaners be trained in suitable languages and formats, and be treated with fair labour practices."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00659,2020-10-05-T-019,659,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Fourth, The GPC hopes that the proposed amendments will not result in an increase in the cost of living."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00660,2020-10-05-T-019,660,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, we all have a stake in public hygiene and the GPC has reached out to the public through social media for their feedback on this Bill. We will be raising some of the public’s concerns in our speeches."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00661,2020-10-05-T-019,661,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,I personally have four points to make.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00662,2020-10-05-T-019,662,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"First, I propose we introduce a grading system for cleanliness at specified premises, starting with public toilets at coffee shops and hawker centres. A grading system will help increase hygiene standards in public toilet. These standards have fallen in recent years, according to an SMU survey aptly named ""Waterloo"". Over 25% of the 6,000 respondents said they would not use the toilets in coffee shops and hawker centres."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00663,2020-10-05-T-019,663,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Our GPC's own public consultation received many comments about bad experiences at such toilets. One commenter, Mr Tan, said, ""Many of our friends have said they rather hold their tummies than to let it out at the kopitiam toilet."""
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00664,2020-10-05-T-019,664,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"But the problem affects us even if we avoid using the toilets. As Mr Jack Sim, Founder and CEO of the World Toilet Organisation said, ""Remember that even if you do not use these dirty toilets, the cooks who prepare your food are using them. If there is no soap to wash their hands, you may be eating their dirt."""
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00665,2020-10-05-T-019,665,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,This is a very unpleasant thought but a very real possibility that we need to remember.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00666,2020-10-05-T-019,666,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, I believe a grading system for cleanliness will help. It can be similar to the Singapore Food Agency's Food Hygiene Recognition Scheme. Under that scheme, food establishments are rated for their hygiene and must prominently display the grade they receive – A, B, C, or under the new system, Gold, Silver or Bronze."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00667,2020-10-05-T-019,667,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,This provides an objective measure for the general public to determine the level of cleanliness of a food establishment. They can use this information to decide whether to purchase from a food establishment.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00668,2020-10-05-T-019,668,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"For a start, will the Ministry consider implementing a similar grading system for public toilets at coffee shops and hawker centres? A visible, objective benchmark gives operators something to strive towards and could help promote higher standards."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00669,2020-10-05-T-019,669,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,My second proposal builds on our idea of a grading system. Will the Minister consider linking the grading system to the licensing duration and licensing fees of coffee shops and hawker centres?
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00670,2020-10-05-T-019,670,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"For instance, we could offer a slightly longer licence term or lower licensing fees for coffee shops and hawker centres that attain and maintain a certain minimum cleanliness grade. This provides incentives for premises that have done well, to keep up the good work, and for premises that have not done so well, to raise their standards."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00671,2020-10-05-T-019,671,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"In their speeches, other Members of the GPC – Ms Poh Li San, Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Miss Cheryl Chan – will also be sharing their views on a grading system and other incentives for maintaining public toilet cleanliness."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00672,2020-10-05-T-019,672,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"My third proposal is about training. I understand that the Environmental Control Coordinators or ECCs and Environmental Control Officers or ECOs, of specified premises will have to undergo training to be registered with NEA. But I am concerned that their training will not be conducted in suitable languages or formats."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00673,2020-10-05-T-019,673,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Take, for example, an existing course offered by the Singapore Polytechnic for ECOs in the construction sector. It is conducted entirely in English and requires participants to answer 100 questions in a two-hour electronic examination. Many ECCs and ECOs in the cleaning industry are seniors and would likely struggle with the language requirement and the electronic test-taking component."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00674,2020-10-05-T-019,674,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Can Minister share if such courses for ECCs and ECOs in the cleaning industry will be conducted in more languages and more accessible formats? It will help operators meet these new requirements without having to replace their existing staff. Let us not allow language barriers and teaching formats to get in the way of cleanliness and safety.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00675,2020-10-05-T-019,675,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"In their speeches, Mr Don Wee and Ms Nadia Samdin will also be speaking on grants to support cleaners in undergoing training courses and career development for our cleaners."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00676,2020-10-05-T-019,676,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,My last point is about labour conditions. Let us remember that higher hygiene standards also means more work for our cleaners.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00677,2020-10-05-T-019,677,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Many are already struggling. Mdm Low, a 67-year-old cleaner, told the media that she cleans the toilets four to five times during each of her 12-hour shift. She said, ""Just an hour after I finished cleaning, I come back to find unflushed toilets, water pooling around the basins, and sometimes puddles of urine on the floor."""
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00678,2020-10-05-T-019,678,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"One respondent to our public consultation also raised these fair questions. He asked, ""Would not improving cleanliness at these places require more labour? How do we know that this would not add to the gruelling work that cleaners already have to do? How is the Government going to ensure safe and sustainable labour standards with added labour?"""
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00679,2020-10-05-T-019,679,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Can Minister share how we intend to ensure that cleaners are treated with fair labour practices? I propose we start by raising the employment standards required of cleaning companies under the Enhanced Clean Mark Accreditation scheme.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00680,2020-10-05-T-019,680,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Specifically, let us require that companies provide cleaners, whether foreign or local, with sufficient breaks and rest days without reducing their take-home salary. Our increased hygiene standards can only be sustainable if cleaners are well rested and adequately paid. Let us ensure they are."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00681,2020-10-05-T-019,681,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, I hope Minister can consider the proposals raised by the GPC. Ultimately, the GPC believes that public hygiene is everyone's personal responsibility and we need to go upstream to solve this problem."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00682,2020-10-05-T-019,682,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"While this Bill will help, we urge all Singaporeans to move away from the mindset that cleaners will be there to clean up after us. We should be a ""Clean Singapore"", not a ""Cleaned Singapore"". Notwithstanding our clarifications, the GPC for Sustainability and the Environment stands in strong support of the Bill."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00683,2020-10-05-T-019,683,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Mr Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill. While COVID-19 has caused widespread economic hardships and taken a toll on many individuals, there are silver linings to this pandemic. Some silver linings include the rapid digitalisation of the economy and heightened awareness of public and personal hygiene. If Singaporeans, as a society are able to capitalise on these silver linings, we will be in a good or perhaps even better position after we ride out this pandemic."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00684,2020-10-05-T-019,684,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"During the early stages of COVID-19, there were campaigns encouraging the adoption of the 10 Steps Hand Wash, greater conversation on office culture where employees should not fear taking medical leave and not be in the office when unwell. These desirable social behaviours and conversations should be encouraged and continued even post-COVID. As COVID-19 is unlikely to be the last pandemic that the world will see and when the next Disease X may appear, it is a constant worry in the minds of healthcare professionals."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00685,2020-10-05-T-019,685,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"In view of this, it is of paramount importance and perhaps timely to take a more proactive and preventive approach in improving public health and hygiene. Afterall, these two areas are deemed as the first line of defence against any disease that we may have."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00686,2020-10-05-T-019,686,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"We, as a society should have higher expectations of what being clean and hygienic means. The achievement of this state should also be a collaboration between public users and the care-takers, instead of having the sole responsibility borne by the latter. Amendment to this Act is timely as it introduces the environmental sanitation programmes for premises designated by NEA, regulate aquatic facilities and aerosol-generating systems and mandates the need for registered Environmental Control Coordinators or ECCs and Environmental Control Officers or ECOs to have better oversight at the specified premises."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00687,2020-10-05-T-019,687,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"In view of this, I would like to focus on three areas and highlight how we can achieve the aims that are set out."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00688,2020-10-05-T-019,688,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"First, a greater emphasis on cleanliness in the public domain with the grading system for toilets. Dirty public toilets are a ubiquitous sight in Singapore and I am sure many of us have experienced this from time to time. As my colleague, Mr Louis Ng has just pointed out, from the recent study by SMU, it has revealed that there has been a dip in public hygiene standards in toilets at coffee shops and hawker centres since 2016. To address this issue, enforcement of environmental sanitation programmes and having standardised cleanliness metrics are necessary. The Happy Toilet Programme, which was introduced or started in 2003, is one of such programmes. However, it does not seem to have a meaningful impact to-date."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00689,2020-10-05-T-019,689,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"To reduce the viral gastroenteritis diseases and the related transmission in public spaces, there is a pressing need to markedly improve the conditions of public toilets across Singapore, whether it is from the coffee shops to those in the MRTs, schools, childcare and the eldercare facilities."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00690,2020-10-05-T-019,690,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"While public toilets are already required to be cleaned at regular intervals, having an industry standard metric of assessment on the desired level of cleanliness could better align everyone and better achieve the aim of improving public health and hygiene."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00691,2020-10-05-T-019,691,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"In the establishment of this industry standard metric of assessment, reference can be derived from the grading of hawker stalls based on the sanitation levels and conditions of management. Similarly, the grading of public toilets can be used as an objective assessment. By pegging the grading of public toilets to the Premise Manager's ability in running the entire premise would put some responsibility on these operators in upkeeping the high standards of sanitation in public toilets."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00692,2020-10-05-T-019,692,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"And second, to elevate importance of social responsibility and communal attitude. By placing the entire responsibility on cleaning contractors or Premise Managers to raise the overall standards of public hygiene cannot be the only path forward for us. It is not only onerous on them but also not fair as the users play a big part of this eco-system. Thus, a collaborative ownership between the users and caretakers of these public facilities are required."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00693,2020-10-05-T-019,693,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Let us just look 5,000 km beyond our shores. We see the shining example of Japan, a place that many would pride them for cleanliness, precision and advanced technology. When social responsibility is synonymous to a culture, even smart technologies can be incorporated at public facilities without fear of being damaged. Think of automatic flushes, bidet gadgets and recently ""see-through"" public toilets for people to inspect their cleanliness before using them. This indicates an upkeep of these clean public toilets is not just reliant on technologies alone."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00694,2020-10-05-T-019,694,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,The communal mentality is intrinsic and the Japanese way of life appears both in their personal as well as public spaces. Public spaces are used and treated with respect as the Japanese continually places the interests of the larger good before themselves.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00695,2020-10-05-T-019,695,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Sometimes I wonder, why are the toilets, such as those in Changi Airport able to keep the high level of sparkling clean conditions whereas toilets in hawker centres and coffee shops leave much to be desired. How are we able to maintain our home toilets clean, yet unable to do so in the public? If I may posit, it boils down to context and our perception when using these public facilities."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00696,2020-10-05-T-019,696,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"The mentality that this is not my toilet and thus I am not bothered about ensuring the cleanliness and the state I leave it, as there is someone else who cleans after me. This deplorable mindset must change and has to change now. We are all users of the public good and only through exercising greater social responsibility can all these public facilities become more desirable. Perhaps, it is time we take a leaf from Japan, to adopt more communal attitude and let us be proud users of public facilities."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00697,2020-10-05-T-019,697,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Little actions, such as ensuring that we do not squat on toilet bowls, do not sprinkle water on the floors after washing our hands, proper disposal of papers in the bins go a long way in ensuring the cleanliness of public toilets. If we are constantly mindful of what we are doing and treat this the same as our own home toilets, we should be able to do that in the public areas without any fear and without any issue."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00698,2020-10-05-T-019,698,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"For those caring for young children and seniors, we understand these groups are very vulnerable. We show our love and our care for them, and always want to ensure they receive the very best. It is not uncommon to hear of parents lamenting the unsanitary conditions they find in toilets or nursing rooms. And I think my colleague, Mr Louis Ng has expressed this quite well."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00699,2020-10-05-T-019,699,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,The impetus to change and care for the public toilets go beyond ourselves. It is also the message that we wish for our next generation to take away – that we care for our younger ones and our seniors and want to do right for them. Let us not falter and begin today by changing our habits in the use of public resources and treat it like it is our own home.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00700,2020-10-05-T-019,700,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"And lastly, to rethink the effectiveness of the carrot and stick approach and explore the public health behavioural science to shape societal behaviours and policies. As we emphasise the need for social responsibility, the question then arises on how do we create this sense of social responsibility to encourage users of public facilities to treat all these facilities with care and sanitation?"
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00701,2020-10-05-T-019,701,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"A direct approach would be the traditional use of fines. Fines has often been used to act as a deterrent for individuals to prevent undesirable societal behaviours, such as littering. Fines have been used so often that it has been a common joke that Singapore is nothing but a ""Fine"" city. While fines can be a quick means to temporary deter an issue, it may not necessarily nip the issue in the bud."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00702,2020-10-05-T-019,702,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"As society evolves, there is stronger call for Singapore to be a gracious and more caring society. Perhaps alternate and gentler ways could be explored in shaping positive societal behaviours."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00703,2020-10-05-T-019,703,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"UK's Behavioural Insights Team, also known as the Nudge Unit started in 2010 to apply behavioural science to public policy of which one approach would be the nudge which aims to ""do more with less"", making simple and small changes in the design of the environment to bring about greater change in societal behaviours."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00704,2020-10-05-T-019,704,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,The concept of incorporating behavioural sciences into policy-making is not a new one in Singapore. Several national initiatives had shown evidences of such deep thinking and the fusion of exploring behavioural concepts to enhance the effectiveness of these initiatives. This paradigm shift in the way of thinking should be lauded.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00705,2020-10-05-T-019,705,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,One such national initiative I would like to highlight is the Health Promotion Board or HPB's National Steps Challenge.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00706,2020-10-05-T-019,706,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Under this challenge, the use of incentives was adopted to encourage development of good habits like exercising. While incentives can be considered as a ""carrot"" approach, how the challenge was executed revealed signs that it was carefully thought out to ensure that interest in the challenge is sustained and ultimately achieves the objective of encouraging a more active lifestyle. This challenge had a few waves to reignite and sustain interest after the initial novelty wears off. And most recently, HPB will also be partnering Apple to leverage on gamification to continue the excitement in this challenge and achieve its social objective."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00707,2020-10-05-T-019,707,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"In line with exploring the use of alternatives and behavioural science to shape societal behaviour, I would like to ask the Minister"
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00708,2020-10-05-T-019,708,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"(a) Notably, a lot of extrinsic rewards have been used to spur a change in societal behaviour. Have we identified the sweet spot in the use of incentives. For example, the amount of incentives and the length of incentives given in the development of these good habits?"
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00709,2020-10-05-T-019,709,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,(b) Could we explore similar initiatives such as Nudges to encourage the behavioural change of users in public toilets? A well-known example to encourage people to take the stairs instead of the escalators would be the Piano stairs in Stockholm metro where melodious music is played when climbing or going down the stairs.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00710,2020-10-05-T-019,710,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"(c) Besides HPB, the Singapore Police Force has been exploring and getting ideas from the public and the Institutes of Higher Learning on the use of nudges to prevent the public from falling prey on scams. Could we better understand how effective behavioural sciences have been in policy making?"
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00711,2020-10-05-T-019,711,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Mr Speaker, Sir, against the backdrop of COVID-19, the seasonal flu, the distant looming threat of Disease X, it is thus of paramount importance and interest that we now start working on preventive instead of reactive measures. COVID-19 is a clear reason why there is no better time than to begin these changes today."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00712,2020-10-05-T-019,712,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"As with all societal changes and benefits, it takes collective effort and thoughtfulness of every individual to effect the change over time. In the same vein, ensuring the high standards of sanitation requires joint efforts – from the users to the caretakers of the public facilities. Without which, the actions of a few could thwart the efforts of the broader good. I am positive that we as a nation would be able to come together and unite in working towards this aspiration of social good."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00713,2020-10-05-T-019,713,He Ting Ru,"Mr Speaker, the COVID pandemic that is still affecting our lives has brought home the importance of keeping to high hygiene and cleanliness standards and ensuring that these standards are upheld at the risk of becoming threats to public health and safety."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00714,2020-10-05-T-019,714,He Ting Ru,"The Bill before us implements mandatory cleaning standards for specified premises and will, indeed, go towards ensuring that premises which have poor hygiene standards may result in operators being held accountable. The aim is to provide enough of a stake that we would see improvements to our living spaces when they fall below acceptable levels."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00715,2020-10-05-T-019,715,He Ting Ru,"Yet while Singapore has an international reputation as a clean city and despite years of Clean and Green campaigns, I believe it is still important to ask ourselves if we are a clean city or a ""cleaned"" city, as a few of my colleagues have pointed out earlier. Are we truly a nation where individuals take responsibility to ensure that our environment is clean and hygienic or do we instead see it as someone else's problem? Do we make messes in our living environments and expect cleaners to do their jobs and clean up after us?"
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00716,2020-10-05-T-019,716,He Ting Ru,"We all agree there is a big distinction in the society which is able to maintain high hygiene standards because people do their parts to keep clean compared with one where low-wage, low-status workers are employed to do their jobs to clean up messes that others have left behind without a second thought. What does it say about us as a people when we leave our food dishes and rubbish strewn all over the table after a meal and justify it by not wanting the poor cleaners to lose their jobs?"
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00717,2020-10-05-T-019,717,He Ting Ru,"Like many point out, we also have much to learn from the experiences of societies such as Switzerland, Japan and Taiwan which maintain high levels of cleanliness with hardly any litter bins and street sweepers in sight. Such societies have evolved and have high levels of social consciousness where residents take pride in their surroundings. This extends to having a culture where people who are sick automatically wear surgical masks to avoid infecting other people without being mandated to do so by law. Residents also automatically sort their rubbish into different categories to facilitate recycling rather than rely on workers in waste processing centres to do it for them."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00718,2020-10-05-T-019,718,He Ting Ru,"While living in Germany, I also remember being extremely conscious about how I would sort out my rubbish for fear of accidentally placing the recyclable materials in the wrong bin and possibly contaminating the material in the entire bin."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00719,2020-10-05-T-019,719,He Ting Ru,"On a weekend trip to Switzerland, stopping for breakfast at a cafe, we witnessed a man at an adjacent table carefully sweeping up the crumbs of the croissant that he just ate before meticulously dusting them onto his plate and returning it to the waiter behind the counter."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00720,2020-10-05-T-019,720,He Ting Ru,"Back in Singapore, our environmental services industry is estimated to employ approximately 78,000 workers with almost two-thirds of employed residents in the sector aged 55 and above. It is one of the industries targeted by our much-vaunted Progressive Wage Model which tells us that these are possibly low-pay, low-status jobs, a future which parents threaten their kids with if they do not study hard enough"
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00721,2020-10-05-T-019,721,He Ting Ru,"The reality though, is that the pandemic and associated lockdowns around the world have shown that cleaners are key frontline workers keeping economies and societies running while running risks to their own and their families' health. The stigma associated with what is traditionally seen as an unskilled, unimportant job can undermine how we view public health and hygiene and lead to under-investment in the industry. This prevents the implementation of new technologies and digitalisation initiatives that would otherwise raise productivity and make such jobs less physically demanding on our older workers, but also removing some of the stigma associated with being a cleaner."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00722,2020-10-05-T-019,722,He Ting Ru,"The wider point here is also one of sustainability, environmental, economic and societal. We are now facing an uncertain future where the planet is fast running out of time to deal with limited resources and effects of climate change are becoming more real. We can ill afford to use and consume as if our resources were unlimited. Likewise, our ageing demographics also tell us that there will come a point where it will become unrealistic to keep relying on low-wage, low-status workers, often either foreign or elderly, to maintain cleanliness standards while we continue to treat them as being unimportant and invisible."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00723,2020-10-05-T-019,723,He Ting Ru,"Even if the cleaning industry looks to more long-term sustainable solutions to provide the services expected of them, we, as in society, must start developing the type of social consciousness required for each one of us to adopt a clean lifestyle. We could do so by having another look at our Clean and Green campaigns over the years to figure out what has been effective in the past. Have these campaigns overly emphasised fines, penalties and shaming for specific behaviours with less regard to the reasons behind our actions rather than address wider issues relating to shift in awareness that everyone has a role to play in keeping our shared spaces clean."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00724,2020-10-05-T-019,724,He Ting Ru,"A coherent multi-faceted approach that starts from a young age and is tailored to fit our changing society needs to be taken – from punitive measures for those who litter and dirty the environment to public education campaigns at all levels about environmental protection, driving the need to reduce and better manage waste and to foster a pride in our shared spaces. Youth voices would be extremely important in this and we should fully involve the young from the start in our efforts to effect such changes and driving home the message that our reliance on cheap and elderly labour to clean up after us has to go."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00725,2020-10-05-T-019,725,He Ting Ru,"Perhaps, it is also time that we look to wisdom espoused by Goethe who wrote  ""Let everyone sweep in front of his own door, and the whole world will be clean."" This is a shared philosophy that I hope will be one of the legacies that we leave behind for future generations of Singaporeans to come."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00726,2020-10-05-T-019,726,Joan Pereira,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the introduction of the Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill comes during a critical time. We are in the midst of a global crisis, unprecedented in its scale and impact. The pandemic is also a wake-up call, highlighting the importance of things that we have all taken for granted, such as environmental hygiene and public health."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00727,2020-10-05-T-019,727,Joan Pereira,This Bill mandates environmental sanitation (ES) standards for the cleaning and disinfection of high-risk premises.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00728,2020-10-05-T-019,728,Joan Pereira,"This means that cleaning costs will go up. Most of us are aware that Singapore is clean because of the hard work of our many cleaners. However, if we all do our part and play a more active role to keep our public environment clean, our collective efforts can help keep costs down."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00729,2020-10-05-T-019,729,Joan Pereira,The high-risk areas listed in the Bill include toilets and other high-touch areas.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00730,2020-10-05-T-019,730,Joan Pereira,"Many of our public toilets in coffee shops and hawker centres are often very wet. Sometimes, the wet floors and sink counters are due to leaky taps, shallow sinks and high water pressure or poor user habits. Wet toilets are both a physical hazard and environmental public health hazard."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00731,2020-10-05-T-019,731,Joan Pereira,"I would like to suggest that the Ministry specify toilet design requirements to ensure that toilets are easier to maintain and kept dry. This set of specifications will also ensure that toilets that are being upgraded or built will be up to the ES standards. Useful features include better drainage, better ventilation to minimise foul odours and to speed up evaporation, hand-dryers that are right next to the sinks, and hands-free sensor taps and toilet flushes. With an ageing population, fall prevention should be a priority. Therefore, the floors of all public toilets should use non-slip materials or coatings. All toilets should be upgraded progressively, starting with the older and more poorly designed toilets. Sir, in Mandarin."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00732,2020-10-05-T-019,732,Joan Pereira,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Many of our public toilets in coffee shops and hawker centres are often wet. Sometimes, the wet floors and sink counters are due to leaky taps, shallow sinks and high water pressure. More often than not, the slippery floors are so because of poor user habits. Wet toilets are both a physical hazard and environmental public health hazard."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00733,2020-10-05-T-019,733,Joan Pereira,"I would like to suggest that the Ministry specify toilet design requirements to ensure that toilets are easier to maintain and kept dry. This set of specifications will also ensure that toilets that are being upgraded or built will be up to the ES standards. Examples of useful features include better drainage, better ventilation to minimise foul odours and speed up evaporation, hand-dryers that are right next to the sinks, and hands-free sensor taps and toilet flushes. With an ageing population, fall prevention should be a priority. Therefore, the floors of all public toilets should use non-slip materials or coatings.

2020-10-05-T-019-S-00734,2020-10-05-T-019,734,Joan Pereira,"(In English)  Coffee shop and hawker centre operators should tap on the recently launched Toilet Improvement Programme to make the necessary upgrades to their toilets and for proper maintenance. For individuals, public education on the correct toilet etiquette would be useful to keep our toilets clean and dry."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00735,2020-10-05-T-019,735,Joan Pereira,"On the subject of sustainability, I am worried about the impact of higher cleaning standards on our environment. For example, more gloves and chemicals would be used. Is there a more sustainable way to clean and sanitise which can minimise the discharge of chemicals into our environment?"
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00736,2020-10-05-T-019,736,Joan Pereira,"Sir, I look forward to the Minister’s response and would like to conclude with my support for the Bill."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00737,2020-10-05-T-019,737,Gan Thiam Poh,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the introduction of mandatory environmental sanitation (ES) standards will certainly receive overwhelming support if we consider the results of the Public Cleanliness Satisfaction Survey undertaken by SMU. According to the survey, around 97% of Singapore’s residents would like legislation to ensure higher hygiene standards for public spaces, including care centres for the young and elderly, and food establishments. Sir, in Mandarin."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00738,2020-10-05-T-019,738,Gan Thiam Poh,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] There is room for improvement in the public hygiene standards of our hawkers centres and coffee shops. Given the large number of customers and thus, the heavy usage of the facilities, such as the tables and toilets, we need a lot more joint effort from all stakeholders to keep these places clean."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00739,2020-10-05-T-019,739,Gan Thiam Poh,"These food establishments offer a variety of delicious food at affordable prices for all. Based on this price level, the operators have budget constraints for the number of cleaners they can employ to keep the food establishments clean. If everyone makes a conscientious effort to pick up after themselves, return their trays, clean up their tables, refrain from littering, and so on, we will be able to enjoy a clean environment without paying unnecessary additional costs."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00740,2020-10-05-T-019,740,Gan Thiam Poh,"Another problem eateries have is the presence of pests. Food remnants attract scavengers such as cockroaches, rats and birds, amongst others."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00741,2020-10-05-T-019,741,Gan Thiam Poh,"Sometimes when I eat at these places, I see many of these ‘uninvited guests’ flying around and having a ‘party’. If you are not careful, you could be ‘bombarded’ and may get droppings on you. Sometimes I can see that the food on the tables nearby gets contaminated by these birds."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00742,2020-10-05-T-019,742,Gan Thiam Poh,"In recent years, many of these hawker centres and food establishments are forced to install nets to prevent birds from flying in. I would like to ask the Minister how effective these nets have been in reducing the incidents of birds flying in to look for food. Under what circumstances do we need to put in the nets and do the authorities have more plans to extend the installation of nets to more food centres and coffee shops?"
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00743,2020-10-05-T-019,743,Gan Thiam Poh,"(In English)  Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should also review our pest control regime as pests are vectors for diseases. As the weather gets warmer, pest populations can expand quickly. We have to ensure proper management of food storage and food waste in our food centres."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00744,2020-10-05-T-019,744,Gan Thiam Poh,"Would the Minister also share the progress of the Tray Return Programme, the learning experience so far and what improvement measures may be introduced to boost public participation in this initiative? Would there be more incentives, more “carrots” to encourage more people to cooperate?"
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00745,2020-10-05-T-019,745,Gan Thiam Poh,"We may also consider more incentives for owners, stallholders or operators to improve their cleanliness scorecard. Hopefully, this would be a means to an end. Ideally, hygiene and clean habits should become part of our culture, something we all do instinctively, whether or not we would be rewarded for it."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00746,2020-10-05-T-019,746,Gan Thiam Poh,"The NEA launched the Toilet Improvement Programme which allows hawker centres and coffee-shops to apply for up to 90% funding to improve their toilets and level of cleanliness. This programme is up to the operators to decide if they want to take it up. However, I think the NEA may consider sending strong advisories to obviously poorly designed and maintained toilets to take up this offer and urgently overhaul their toilets in the interest of public health."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00747,2020-10-05-T-019,747,Gan Thiam Poh,"Last but not least, may I suggest that we provide incentives for the provision of enclosed areas in our food establishments for smokers. Setting up an enclosed area for them will help to ensure that other customers are protected from second-hand smoke. Would the NEA consider providing funding support under the same Toilet Improvement Programme for coffee-shops which do not wish to remove their smoking corners to build an enclosed area for smokers?"
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00748,2020-10-05-T-019,748,Gan Thiam Poh,"With that, I would like to conclude with my support for the Bill."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00749,2020-10-05-T-019,749,Raeesah Khan,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Singaporeans see the importance of personal hygiene now more than ever. We see our fellow citizens taking ownership of the health of themselves and their families."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00750,2020-10-05-T-019,750,Raeesah Khan,"It was inspiring to see how quickly people reacted to the pandemic, abiding by regulations to wear masks, putting sanitisers in lifts and donating masks to those in need."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00751,2020-10-05-T-019,751,Raeesah Khan,This Bill to amend the Environmental Public Health Act arises from the necessity of expanding this to our public spaces.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00752,2020-10-05-T-019,752,Raeesah Khan,"Singapore has run campaigns to encourage citizens to create a clean and green Singapore. From 1961 to 1989, the number of cleaners working in Singapore had declined from more than 7,000 to 2,100. However, this changed as our country got wealthier and had access to cheap labour."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00753,2020-10-05-T-019,753,Raeesah Khan,"Today, Singapore currently has an army of 58,000 workers in the cleaning industry."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00754,2020-10-05-T-019,754,Raeesah Khan,"Mr Liak Teng Lit, former Chairman of the NEA, reportedly once expressed that Singapore is not a clean City. It is a cleaned City. Mr Edward de Silva Chairman of the Public Hygiene Council in an article published by today noted that the reliance on cleaners is now entrenched in Singapore's mentality, and thus, it is worthwhile to consider that the overall cleanliness we have in Singapore may not be truly reflective of a collective civic-mindedness on the part of individuals to keep Singapore clean."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00755,2020-10-05-T-019,755,Raeesah Khan,"Where businesses and the state are concerned, the Bill goes some way to keep these stakeholders accountable for their role in maintaining public health."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00756,2020-10-05-T-019,756,Raeesah Khan,"At this juncture, I wish to raise a clarification about the specifics of the Bill."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00757,2020-10-05-T-019,757,Raeesah Khan,"Firstly, sub-section 2(b) in the new section 62A empowers NEA to designate certain non-publicly-accessible premises as specified premises under the Act, in particular clause B5 implies that NEA may do so for any premises or class of premises for which an environmental sanitation programme is assessed to be necessary to minimise, or alleviate the risk of, or to prevent or manage, an outbreak or spread of any infectious disease."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00758,2020-10-05-T-019,758,Raeesah Khan,"To this end, I would like to seek a clarification on how these assessments will be carried out. What are the parameters and principles underlying such assessments?"
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00759,2020-10-05-T-019,759,Raeesah Khan,"Mr Deputy Speaker, while we seek to improve public health standards via this Bill, I wish to stress the need to consider the broader landscape in which our system of public hygiene and sanitation operates."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00760,2020-10-05-T-019,760,Raeesah Khan,"The question of who will take ownership for a good quality of public health comes to mind. During the pandemic, we saw how dependent we are on foreign labour as a country to keep Singapore clean. Is this model sustainable? What happens if there is another situation that arises, or we do not have access to them."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00761,2020-10-05-T-019,761,Raeesah Khan,"We need to ensure that Singaporeans are empowered with a sense of ownership and civic-mindedness towards our country. I worry that with more guidelines, and thus potentially, the hiring of more cleaners, we start relinquishing our responsibility in caring for the environment and the people we share our surroundings with."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00762,2020-10-05-T-019,762,Raeesah Khan,"We can make comparisons with countries such as Japan and Korea – countries that are known to have a strong sense of civic-mindedness and for being clean, but I think we can draw inspiration from fellow citizens too. A resident by the name of Mr Tan, a senior citizen who I met recently on a house visit in Compassvale, shared that he and his neighbours take turns to clean their common corridor on a weekly basis."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00763,2020-10-05-T-019,763,Raeesah Khan,"We can also look at people who organise beach clean-ups at places like East Coast Park and Changi Beach, or those who organise ground-up initiatives to help those who are unable to spring-clean their homes."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00764,2020-10-05-T-019,764,Raeesah Khan,"We even count the World Toilet Man himself, Jack Sim, as a fellow citizen who has been a crusader of upholding good personal hygiene."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00765,2020-10-05-T-019,765,Raeesah Khan,"To encourage citizens to take ownership of their surrounds, we need to encourage civic-mindedness in youths by exposing them to more community-based programmes and weaving the themes of community building into our schools. We need to make students responsible for the cleanliness of their schools and we need to encourage people to recycle. The state should seek to improve recycling facilities in residential areas."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00766,2020-10-05-T-019,766,Raeesah Khan,"We can build on the reputation of a clean and green city. As we aim to improve sanitation standards in Singapore by way of legislation, let us bring cleanliness and civic-mindedness back as our common values, and move from being a being merely a cleaned city to a clean city."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00767,2020-10-05-T-019,767,Don Wee,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will deliver the first part of my speech in Mandarin."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00768,2020-10-05-T-019,768,Don Wee,(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] I support the Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill introduced by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00769,2020-10-05-T-019,769,Don Wee,"The ongoing global pandemic has given us a strong impetus to review our public hygiene regulation and enforcement framework. We should not miss this opportunity to raise the public hygiene standard. We should learn the lessons and the health reform opportunities presented by the pandemic. If we do not gain the experience nor reflect upon ourselves, we would waste this learning opportunity to enhance our ability to resist future health crises."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00770,2020-10-05-T-019,770,Don Wee,"Introducing mandatory environmental sanitation standards for the cleaning and disinfection of high-risk premises is necessary and timely. Such premises include nursing homes, kindergartens, public toilets and rubbish collection centres. The new requirements will help our fight against COVID-19 and mitigate future public health risks."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00771,2020-10-05-T-019,771,Don Wee,One of the most common complaints about public hygiene is about the toilets in our hawker centres and coffee shops.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00772,2020-10-05-T-019,772,Don Wee,"I would like to urge stall operators, coffee shops and eatery shops owners to leverage on higher standards of cleanliness to attract more customers and increase revenues."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00773,2020-10-05-T-019,773,Don Wee,"However, owners and operators have often told me that they are worried about the higher costs of cleaning. They may not be able to absorb the higher cost and may need to pass part of it to their customers. They are concerned that they may lose some business as a result."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00774,2020-10-05-T-019,774,Don Wee,"I also have some concerns with the requirement for premises managers to be identified and held accountable for adhering to the ES standards. I hope that for the implementation of this new measure, building and premises owners will be required to provide proof that they give premises managers the authority and requisite resources to carry out their duties. I seek the assurance of the Ministry that designated employees will not be held responsible in the event that environmental sanitation standards are not met due to insufficient resources. Take the two coffee shops at Brickland’s blocks 803 and 810 for example. The coffee shop aunties and assistants are my residents. They are managing 2 roles at the same time, making coffee, serving tea and cleaning as well. They are the frontline workers providing essential services, but their salaries are not very high. I am very concerned about their working conditions after the new regulations come into force."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00775,2020-10-05-T-019,775,Don Wee,I will continue my speech in English.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00776,2020-10-05-T-019,776,Don Wee,"(In English) 	Customers, who desire cleaner toilets, also worry about the prices of their favourite hawker meals going up. We would also want to ensure that hawker and coffee shop meals remain accessible and affordable for the less privileged Singaporeans."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00777,2020-10-05-T-019,777,Don Wee,"Another concern is the availability of manpower. The higher demand for cleaning due to the pandemic has already led to a labour shortage. This is a sector which attract fewer Singaporeans and on top of this difficulty, there is a limit on the number of foreign workers we can hire. Can we turn to technology for help? Perhaps, for some premises, it may be viable to deploy robot cleaners, for example. However, it would be challenging to use robot cleaners in the toilets of our hawker centres and coffee shops, due to the terrain and space constraints. Robots are also costly."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00778,2020-10-05-T-019,778,Don Wee,"In the face of this manpower crunch, how are we going to meet the new environmental sanitation (ES) standards? Do we have plans to draw more Singaporeans or PRs into this sector or will we need to re-adjust manpower policies? Will higher wages alone be sufficient to attract and retain local workers? How will the Ministry persuade the Singapore public to pay more for local workers, while at the same time, ensure that the less privileged ones amongst us do not have to bear the burden of the higher cleaning costs?"
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00779,2020-10-05-T-019,779,Don Wee,"In the face of limited manpower, we must help our cleaners to become more efficient and productive. The half-day cleaners' training programme launched by NEA and the Restroom Association last month is very useful. I seek the Ministry's assurance that it will become a permanent training programme, with refresher and upgrading courses in the future. This will ensure that our cleaners will meet ES standards and be equipped to deal with potential new health hazards."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00780,2020-10-05-T-019,780,Don Wee,I am also very glad to note the new Toilet Improvement Programme launched by NEA last Friday. Interested coffee shops and hawker centre operators may apply for up to 90% funding to improve the design and cleanliness of their toilets and adopt more effective cleaning measures. I strongly urge them to tap on this programme to fund the necessary renovations and measures.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00781,2020-10-05-T-019,781,Don Wee,"New toilets can be redesigned to make it easier to be kept clean. For example, round sloped sinks are better than flattish square or rectangular sinks which tend to accumulate debris in corners. Taps, soap dispensers, toilet flushes and doors can be operable through sensors or with foot pedals."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00782,2020-10-05-T-019,782,Don Wee,"In order for us to benefit from a higher sanitation standard, we must all take joint responsibility for our environment and do our part to keep our surroundings clean. There is thus an important role for public education. I am interested to hear more about the Ministry's efforts in this area."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00783,2020-10-05-T-019,783,Don Wee,"Most of us recognise that we can do more to help at the individual level, as highlighted in the Public Cleanliness Satisfaction Survey, we found that 87% of the respondents think that Singapore is clean due to the efficiency of the cleaners. Therefore, Singaporeans' civil-mindedness has a lot of room for improvement. If each of us do our part and encourage those around us to do their parts, our collective effort will go a long way to keep Singapore cleaner, reduce the need for cleaning and minimise the cleaning costs. I would like to conclude with my support for the Bill."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00784,2020-10-05-T-019,784,Desmond Choo,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I stand in support of the amendments. The introduction of the amendments is timely considering that the COVID-19 pandemic has magnified the importance of individual and public hygiene. It is an excellent opportunity to improve the nation's public health infrastructure beyond COVID-19. A strong healthcare system needs an equally robust hygiene framework to keep up the fight against the current pandemics and future ones."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00785,2020-10-05-T-019,785,Desmond Choo,"The amendments, which include the implementation of mandatory standards and greater accountability on stakeholders, complement the SG Clean Movement. The new rules will also play an integral role in increasing the effectiveness of safe management measures as we work towards a gradual and safe reopening of our economy. I will now detail two points for the consideration of the Minister and one query to allow for the better integration of the amendments for relevant stakeholders."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00786,2020-10-05-T-019,786,Desmond Choo,"First, the benefits arising from the mandatory appointment of ECCs and ECOs in premises are two-fold  not only will it complement our efforts to improve public hygiene infrastructure, but it also fits well within our national push to expand upskilling and employment opportunities. In supporting these enhanced rules, I recognise that the Labour Movement has a pivotal role to play in ensuring that companies have sufficient trained workers to comply with the rules with greater ease."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00787,2020-10-05-T-019,787,Desmond Choo,"Currently, institutions such as NEA and Singapore Polytechnic offer ECO training courses, but these might be tailored to old requirements for maintaining good environmental practices within construction sites. Our NTUC social enterprises can increase training capacity for ECCs and ECOs in line with the amended Section 62B. Additionally, we could potentially look into dove-tailing of ECC and ECO work with Safe Management Officer responsibilities to better coordinate businesses' efforts for safe re-opening."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00788,2020-10-05-T-019,788,Desmond Choo,"Second, as we work towards baseline cleaning standards and increased public hygiene responsibilities, we must remember to keep broader goals in mind. We must progressively aim to shift from Government-led initiatives towards a structure where all stakeholders take ownership. To this end, I put forth two recommendations."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00789,2020-10-05-T-019,789,Desmond Choo,"First, the new environmental sanitation programmes cannot work without well-trained workers. They must also be paid fairly so that we can attract more workers to join the industry.  Businesses must adopt outcome-based procurement practices and Government give recognition to companies that work towards increased productivity with the adoption of technology. Businesses and Government agencies should award cleaning contracts to progressive employers who upskill and reward their workers. We should also be bold and look at ECO and ECC jobs as the pinnacle of the Progressive Wage Model or PWM for cleaners."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00790,2020-10-05-T-019,790,Desmond Choo,"Second, we must recognise that Singapore relies heavily on cleaning services to ensure the cleanliness of public areas. Despite Governmental and businesses' efforts in working towards a cleaner Singapore, we must remember that this responsibility lies in the individual too. Take the example of returning of trays in Food & Beverage establishments. In the third Public Cleanliness Satisfaction Survey undertaken by SMU, 36% of respondents said they were unsure whether trays should be returned. Public education is thus, vital, in working towards a cleaner Singapore and this initiative will instil greater individual responsibility to keep Singapore clean."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00791,2020-10-05-T-019,791,Desmond Choo,"Lastly, I have one query relating to the fines imposed in contravention of the amended sections. The contravention of the relevant sections in the amendments in section 62A(5), 62B(3), 62C(6), 63(2), 66A(7) by the Manager of any specific premises/owner/occupier would constitute an offence. Upon conviction, the offence attracts a fine not exceeding $5,000 on the first offence and a fine not exceeding $10,000 for the second or subsequent offences. This serves as an effective deterrent to the management of smaller premises, all those without as much resources. However, I am concerned that the deterrent effect of the fine may not be as effective for well-resourced entities. In the event of persistent contravention of the Act, will the Minister look into imposing non-monetary sanctions, including suspensions of operations to supplement the existing fine structure to send a stronger deterrent signal against non-compliance?"
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00792,2020-10-05-T-019,792,Desmond Choo,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, despite the nation being labelled as one of the world's cleanest cities, we must continue to build on the efforts we have achieved thus far. Notwithstanding the suggestion, I stand in support with the amendments which will play an important role in chartering the nation's journey to successfully sail through the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00793,2020-10-05-T-019,793,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, over the last year, we have seen our lives reshaped and reorganised by COVID-19. We have had to build up our resilience as a society, while we stay home to flatten the curve."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00794,2020-10-05-T-019,794,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"But not everyone could do this. ""Stay home because we can't"" – this was one of the viral phrases first expressed by essential workers. COVID-19 can be acquired through contact with surfaces contaminated with the virus and laboratory tests have demonstrated that the virus can survive on surfaces for two to three days. As such, ensuring environmental hygiene through regular cleaning and disinfection of places with high volume of people minimises the risk of transmission. During this time, many essential workers were required to step-up the cleaning regimes, their efforts on this front kept us safe."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00795,2020-10-05-T-019,795,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"As Singapore plans for Phase Three, gradually reopens and allows for more public movement, we must as a society remain vigilant. The events of the past few months have made a few things clear. Government and pandemic response teams need to be constantly receptive to new information and err on the side of caution and we must all play our part. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of civic mindedness and the responsibility shared between Government, businesses and the public to keep each other safe."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00796,2020-10-05-T-019,796,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,I am supportive of this Bill and have four points to make on the amendments.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00797,2020-10-05-T-019,797,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"First, the pandemic has highlighted the important role essential workers play in keeping Singapore safe. The establishment of the environmental control coordinator and environmental control officer roles can be a step towards elevating the essential worker and creating pathways for career development in environmental health as individuals become experts in the subject matter. They offer an opportunity for training, skill acquisition and capability development."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00798,2020-10-05-T-019,798,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"I sincerely hope that businesses will look inwards for talent that can be nurtured when thinking about these appointments, so as to enable our cleaners to develop new skills and earn more."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00799,2020-10-05-T-019,799,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"I also hope that the Ministry can provide employers with support on the above and discourage organisations from simply outsourcing these functions. I am unsure whether these roles, if fulfilled by part-time external workers, will have an actual effect on improving cleanliness standards. One suggestion would be for the Ministry to consider a reduction in training fees for businesses that send existing Singaporean employees to be upgraded and certified."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00800,2020-10-05-T-019,800,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Second, one of the biggest lessons we have learned from COVID-19 is the importance of prompt and timely action in our response to pandemics. While I also support the move to expand the powers of the Director-General to issue directives to any entity or persons to clean and/or disinfect the premises from the first warning signs of a potential health risk or disease outbreak, we are also aware that viruses do not only have an impact on health, but also on the economy. These expanded powers include the possibility of the Director-General giving a directive to close the relevant premises, or any part of the relevant premises, for a period not exceeding 14 days for the purpose of cleaning and disinfecting – such cleaning and disinfecting to take place in a manner and within the time specified in such directive. The discretion to make these directives will need to be weighed carefully and I know that premise managers will be wondering what sort of manner and time period is likely to be specified, as businesses need to plan for these possibilities and this will incur cost."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00801,2020-10-05-T-019,801,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"I am also heartened that individuals who are required to carry out the disinfecting of the relevant premises will need to be provided with appropriate personal protective equipment. Sir, as highlighted in the earlier part of my speech, our cleaners are essential workers who play a valuable role in keeping society safe. We have seen instances in the early days of COVID-19, where conservancy workers and cleaners were merely equipped by their employers with masks, disinfectants and simple cloths."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00802,2020-10-05-T-019,802,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"In short, I would like to suggest the Ministry to take collaborative approach when working with premise managers and workers to meet the new standards set out in this Bill, especially in the early days of transition and to prioritise safety of our essential workers."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00803,2020-10-05-T-019,803,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Third, I understand that the amendments also envision Codes of Practices which will set out sector-specific standards required as part of the ES regime. I would like to ask the Ministry when these Codes of Practices will be introduced and how much time the different industries will have to respond to these Codes. It would be helpful if the Ministry can explain why there are different sector-specific standards and whether ECC and ECO skills and training will be transferable across the industries."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00804,2020-10-05-T-019,804,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Like we did with SARS in 2003, we have and we are still learning from COVID-19. While reactive learning is, unfortunately, going to be necessary when dealing with a pandemic, we can take a proactive approach by working with the public to transform Singapore from a cleaned city, to a clean city. We must find more effective ways of working with the public to imbue a culture of personal responsibility in the cleanliness of the facilities that we share, as they do in countries, such as Japan, which has a national habit of Marie Kondo-ing and keeping things clean and tidy. I believe that we must double down our efforts in building a responsible culture to keep our public toilets clean, return our trays and utensils so that food scraps do not attract unwanted pests which carry diseases, and picking up after ourselves in shared spaces."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00805,2020-10-05-T-019,805,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Deputy Speaker, Sir, a few words in Malay."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00806,2020-10-05-T-019,806,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Frontline workers especially cleaners play a very important role in keeping the environment clean. With the establishment of new jobs such as the environmental manager, the environmental control coordinator and the environmental control officer, I hope that this will create new career development pathways for our frontline officers so that they can upskill and obtain better salaries. I hope that businesses will give priority to local workers to take on these new jobs."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00807,2020-10-05-T-019,807,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"However, these policies will not be enough in our efforts to combat the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak if Singaporeans do not play their part to maintain our environmental hygiene. Cleanliness is our shared social responsibility. We must cultivate good habits and promote a culture where cleanliness is prioritised no matter where we are, whether inside or outside our homes."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00808,2020-10-05-T-019,808,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"(In English)  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, ultimately, our laws reflect social norms and will only be effective when implemented well. Keeping Singapore clean is a shared responsibility, and even as the Ministry introduces heightened standards for the protection of our people, I urge the Ministry to work with industry and give sufficient time for industry and our workforce to respond."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00809,2020-10-05-T-019,809,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Notwithstanding my suggestions expressed in this speech, I support the Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00810,2020-10-05-T-019,810,Deputy Speaker,Mr Derrick Goh.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00811,2020-10-05-T-019,811,Derrick Goh,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, a clean environment with good sanitation is something we cannot take for granted. For locations visited by COVID-19 patients, we follow the practice of disinfecting and deep cleaning residential, work or public places."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00812,2020-10-05-T-019,812,Derrick Goh,"However, in situations related to cleaning of high-risk premises, such as pre-schools and eldercare facilities, and locations where many people share the same body of water or recirculated air, namely, (a) swimming pools, spas and water playgrounds and (b) central air-conditioning systems, there should be maintenance standards and practices set for these areas."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00813,2020-10-05-T-019,813,Derrick Goh,"So, it is timely that the Government strengthens and mandates maintenance standards as well as placing accountability on premises managers that have aquatic facilities or licensable aerosol-generating systems. This will help reduce the risks posed by diseases and create a safer environment for all to live, work and play."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00814,2020-10-05-T-019,814,Derrick Goh,"In support of this Bill, I would like to also highlight that more of us are working from home as a result of this pandemic, which have implications on the current way we regulate environmental public health. Given this recent trend, there are now more smokers as well as non-smokers who are working from home."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00815,2020-10-05-T-019,815,Derrick Goh,Many industry experts expect this new norm of working from home to continue well after this pandemic ends. This is due to the benefits of remote working for individuals as well as for corporates.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00816,2020-10-05-T-019,816,Derrick Goh,"Over the last few months, I had received many feedback from residents about exposure to cigarette smoke floating into their flats from neighbours who smoke. This trend coincides with The Straits Times report that NEA received 11,400 cases of feedback for the period January to April this year. This represents a 21% increase in cases related to smoking in residential homes and corridors. As circuit breaker measures kicked in on 7 April, it is likely that the number of complaints to NEA could have been higher since the last report."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00817,2020-10-05-T-019,817,Derrick Goh,"The dangers of second-hand smoke as a silent killer, the smell and residue from nicotine and the irritation to the nose and throat are well documented and have been discussed previously in this House, so I will not belabour this point."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00818,2020-10-05-T-019,818,Derrick Goh,"Of the resident feedback that I have received about neighbours smoking, at least half of those were smoking near open windows or doors. Today, the solution to limit the effects of second-hand smoke floating from a neighbour is for the non-smokers to shut their windows or doors. This cannot be a fair outcome. A practical way is to perhaps require resident smokers to close their windows and doors when they smoke and, of course, to go down to the open spaces at the ground floor if they have kids around. This solution aligns to existing NEA regulations which require windows of private vehicles to be fully wound up so that the second-hand tobacco smoke is expelled when the driver smokes in certain areas."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00819,2020-10-05-T-019,819,Derrick Goh,"A similar parallel could be drawn to the smoking rooms at hotels where doors and windows are closed so that the impact to other hotel occupants are minimised. In this way, a requirement like this will protect the rights of all parties concerned – for residents to smoke at home as well as non-smokers and neighbours to protect their health. In fact, this proposal provides the non-smoker the added option of closing their windows or doors."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00820,2020-10-05-T-019,820,Derrick Goh,"I understand that while such a policy does not completely eliminate the impact of second-hand smoke, it can however significantly reduce the impact of smoke experienced by residents living next to a smoker neighbour. Importantly, this proposal is a balanced approach that draws a line and recognises the need for both sides and not just the party whose health is being endangered to play their part. It will also go a long way towards reducing the tension between neighbours as our living spaces become more compact. This will be yet another step taken in the right direction that does not add to the complexity of existing enforcement measures. I hope Minister Grace Fu will study this and consider amending the regulations in future to address this environmental health issue that is at the heart of many HDB and condominium residents. In Mandarin, please."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00821,2020-10-05-T-019,821,Derrick Goh,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] The COVID-19 pandemic has made us to be more concerned about our health. I support the timely amendment to the Bill to raise the hygiene standards of pre-schools, eldercare centres as well as swimming pools, water playground and the central air-conditioning systems, as well as to state clearly the responsibilities of premises managers. This is to better protect the health of our people and giving them peace of mind. I fully support this amendment."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00822,2020-10-05-T-019,822,Derrick Goh,"At the same time, as a result of the pandemic, more people are working from home, including many smokers. Recently, many residents complained that second-hand smoke from their neighbours have forced them to close their doors and windows, which they felt was unfair."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00823,2020-10-05-T-019,823,Derrick Goh,"I hope the Government will pay more attention to the health hazards of passive smoking. I think a feasible way is to require smokers to close their doors and windows when they smoke at home, so that their right to smoke will not be affected, and the health of their neighbours will be protected."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00824,2020-10-05-T-019,824,Derrick Goh,"At the same time, this recommendation is in line with the NEA requirement for in-car smoking. Hotels have a similar practice for in-room smoking. Simple window closures will protect your health. I hope that NEA will study the feasibility on the suggestion in depth."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00825,2020-10-05-T-019,825,Derrick Goh,"(In English)  In conclusion, the new policies in this amendment will give residents greater peace of mind. In the longer term, this will be a significant boost to the environmental public health of all in Singapore. Sir, I support the Bill."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00826,2020-10-05-T-019,826,Deputy Speaker,Mr Shawn Huang.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00827,2020-10-05-T-019,827,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I stand in support of this amendment. Singapore must quickly fulfil the critical requirements to enable us to safely reopen our hub to the region and the world. It requires proper planning and implementation regimes to safeguard us from the spread of COVID and future pandemics."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00828,2020-10-05-T-019,828,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,We must also inculcate basic public health sanitation habits as part of our culture and DNA. It has to become our way of life. It is not solely the responsibility of the business owner or the manager of the premises. This is our shared responsibility to safeguard one another.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00829,2020-10-05-T-019,829,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,"For this amendment, I would like to highlight that we will should also consider the impact and opportunities for SMEs and the environmental sanitation industry."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00830,2020-10-05-T-019,830,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,"SMEs of specific premises will need to incorporate these new ECC/ECO requirements as additional compliance costs. SMEs may find it challenging due to their limited resources and limited manpower. Many are already managing different roles. In this climate, SMEs are doing their best to sustain their core businesses and protect the livelihood of workers. However, SMEs also understand the importance of these measures. A phased approach is needed to help SMEs implement these regulatory requirements to gradually achieve the required standards."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00831,2020-10-05-T-019,831,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,"In the near term, we must ensure that there are sufficient resources for ECCs and ECOs to get trained, certified and avoid down time. There must also be sufficient sanitation service providers to ensure that it is priced competitively to help manage the operating cost of SMEs."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00832,2020-10-05-T-019,832,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in Mandarin, please."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00833,2020-10-05-T-019,833,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] SMEs have limited financial and human resources, which is a challenge for them. Many companies are already managing multiple roles. In this difficult economic environment, SMEs are doing their best to sustain their businesses and protect workers' livelihoods."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00834,2020-10-05-T-019,834,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,"However, SMEs also recognise the importance of these measures. We should help our SMEs meet this new requirement. A phased approach is needed to help SMEs implement these regulatory requirements to meet the required standards."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00835,2020-10-05-T-019,835,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,"In the near term, we must ensure that there are sufficient resources to train and certify ECO and ECCs to avoid work stoppage. There must also be sufficient sanitation service providers to ensure that prices are reasonable and help SMEs manage costs."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00836,2020-10-05-T-019,836,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,"(In English)  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in English, please."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00837,2020-10-05-T-019,837,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,"Can I ask the Minister what measures will be taken to reduce bottlenecks during implementation and avoid unnecessary downtime for businesses? And what are the estimated annual costs and expected downtime for hawker centres, kopitiams, neighbourhood markets and small neighbourhood merchants?"
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00838,2020-10-05-T-019,838,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,"With the limited manpower in Singapore, we must also be cognisant of how we help Singaporeans develop their full potential as they take on new roles. These skills must be multi-disciplinary, transferrable and relevant to a broad set of job opportunities. This is opportune to the industry to chart expertise development, career progression roadmaps and transferrable skills laterally and vertically within the sanitation and public health eco-system."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00839,2020-10-05-T-019,839,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,"The training and upskilling of new coordinators and officers should be steeped in the understanding of business, law, science and technology. It should be a journey of building expertise and in the spirit of strengthening Singapore's resilience and relevance."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00840,2020-10-05-T-019,840,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,We need to make sure that no one gets left behind. We must design progressive steps for everyone to feel confident to have the capacity to build expertise and skills as a way of life.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00841,2020-10-05-T-019,841,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,"We must remember that though it is important to safeguard and enforce higher standards of public health and sanitation, we must not forget that every step must be to build a stronger, more confident and competitive Singaporean workforce that is agile and competent. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00842,2020-10-05-T-019,842,Deputy Speaker,Ms Poh Li San.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00843,2020-10-05-T-019,843,Poh Li San,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00844,2020-10-05-T-019,844,Poh Li San,"I am in agreement with Minister for Sustainability and Environment, Ms Grace Fu, that ""we need to strengthen Singapore's environmental public health resilience, to safeguard Singaporeans against the current pandemic and dengue outbreak, as well as future public health threats""."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00845,2020-10-05-T-019,845,Poh Li San,"We must not further delay the important step in raising cleaning standards. According to a recent study by SMU, the cleanliness of our toilets has regressed compared to 2016. These invisible bacteria and viruses in the toilets are quite hardy unless they are being neutralised by disinfectants regularly. Frequent habits, such as using mobile phones while in the toilets, further exacerbate the transmission of diseases beyond the washroom. Hence, if the dirtiest places can be kept clean and generally germ-free, infectious disease transmission can be well-controlled at source."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00846,2020-10-05-T-019,846,Poh Li San,"I would like to touch on the importance of public education. It is common knowledge that when it is everybody's problem, then fewer people will act on it. Many public washrooms, especially in hawker centres and coffee shops, are not well kept. Unfortunately, there are many irresponsible culprits who reflect poor civic responsibility and leave the responsibility of cleaning up to the many senior uncles and aunties who have to clean for a living. It is only common sense that, even with the EPHA, it would be an uphill battle if users are irresponsible."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00847,2020-10-05-T-019,847,Poh Li San,"Another case of irresponsible people. Two weeks ago, during my house visit, I spoke with a resident who has worked for many years as a cleaner for Sembawang Town Council. This resident shared with me that it is very frustrating for him to keep cleaning the mess left all over the place. Items, such as empty beer cans and cigarette boxes, are often thrown on the basketball courts."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00848,2020-10-05-T-019,848,Poh Li San,"Good practices start at home and in schools. I recall when I was in Primary school, my school mates and I have toilet cleaning duties during our school camps. It was a little humbling at first but, after a while, we learnt to master the techniques of using different brushes and detergents for different locations. Till now, I continue using these skills I learnt in school and I will always keep my toilets at home sparkling clean. It may be a good idea to start training our younger ones from a tender age, so that they maintain these good habits into adulthood."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00849,2020-10-05-T-019,849,Poh Li San,"Let us all do our part and be more civic-minded when using the public toilets and consider the 59,000 cleaners who are already past 60 years old. Let us also consider who will be replacing these uncles and aunties once they stop working."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00850,2020-10-05-T-019,850,Poh Li San,"Next, I would like to touch on the amendments to strengthen environmental sanitation controls in premises. These premises apply to five categories with high footfall and immune-vulnerable occupants. They are childcare facilities, schools and youth facilities, eldercare facilities, hawker centres and coffee shops."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00851,2020-10-05-T-019,851,Poh Li San,"I would like to propose that we include sports facilities as a sixth category. Gyms, studios, sports halls and so on of all sizes and for various sports, during pre-COVID days, are often densely packed during the peak hours, with energetic sports enthusiasts who are frequently soaked in profuse perspiration after a good workout."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00852,2020-10-05-T-019,852,Poh Li San,"According to a 2014 study by the School of Public Health at University of Memphis, gym equipment can be dirtier than a toilet seat. For instance, free weights were found to contain 362 times more germs than toilet seats. Many of these sports venues, especially the gyms and studios, are enclosed within an air-conditioned environment, with no natural ventilation. The washrooms and shower facilities are also often packed, especially during the morning and evening peak periods. There are inconsistencies in the housekeeping hygiene standards as some gyms and studios ensure thorough cleaning and some do not. Young and old alike, everyone goes to the gym to keep fit and not to fall ill from a bacteria or viral infection. Hence, I urge MSE to consider the inclusion of sporting facilities under the scope of the EPHA."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00853,2020-10-05-T-019,853,Poh Li San,"On this note, would it be effective or fair to foist the responsibility and accountability solely on premises managers?"
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00854,2020-10-05-T-019,854,Poh Li San,"Under the environmental sanitation regime, the Bill will require premises managers to assume the responsibility to meet the mandatory environmental sanitation standards and take greater ownership to proactively clean their premises through the implementation of a systematic and preventative cleaning routine."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00855,2020-10-05-T-019,855,Poh Li San,"In childcare, schools, nursing homes and even sports venues, the users do pay sufficient regular fees and these fees will allow the business owners to provide a reasonable standard of hygiene and cleanliness."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00856,2020-10-05-T-019,856,Poh Li San,"However, we need to look into the hawker centres and coffee shops. We need to ensure that these premises meet the environmental sanitation standards. Most public toilets no longer collect a fee to use the toilets and the amendments to EPHA must not result in a regressive step where patrons are then required to pay a fee for the use of the washrooms. So, we need to look into the inevitable additional manpower and higher costs. These cost increases may be passed on to the tenants and, in turn, to the patrons in the form of higher food prices."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00857,2020-10-05-T-019,857,Poh Li San,"To nurture a proactive ""keep-clean culture"", I would also suggest MSE consider a carrot-and-stick approach rather than just a stick approach. We could incentivise premises owners to consistently maintain a high standard of cleanliness and hygiene, by providing a clean property tax rebate. Dedicated efforts and focus must be taken to consistently score well on every inspection. I think incentives will go a long way to motivate both the premises owners and the cleaning crew to do more than just the bare minimum."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00858,2020-10-05-T-019,858,Poh Li San,"Another suggestion is to promote active citizenry in reporting venues with poor sanitation standards directly via an app to NEA. The public can be the eyes and ears on the ground to help NEA inspectors focus on premises that require their attention. The premises owners must be taken to task. In addition, perhaps NEA could consider an annual contest for the public to vote in the top three venues with the cleanest toilets into the Hall of Fame, as well as the worst three venues with the dirtiest toilets into the Hall of Shame. No one wants to belong to the latter, so such a contest may put some social pressure to keep premises owners motivated and this could possibly be more effective than summons and fines by NEA."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00859,2020-10-05-T-019,859,Poh Li San,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding the above-mentioned suggestions, I support the Bill."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00860,2020-10-05-T-019,860,Poh Li San,"Now, I would like to conclude the key points raised by the Government Parliamentary Committee in Mandarin."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00861,2020-10-05-T-019,861,Poh Li San,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Deputy Speaker, I shall now conclude the key points and suggestions raised by the MCE GPC in Mandarin."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00862,2020-10-05-T-019,862,Poh Li San,"First, we suggest the implementation of a cleanliness grading system and also an incentive system which will link to the premises licence renewal or property tax rebate, so as to encourage proactive control of hygiene standards. Premise owners can also consider implementing operation processes or additional equipment that will raise efficiency of cleaning. For example, coffee shop owners can consider implementing a more effective pest control solution or automated vacuum and washing equipment. In addition, F&B owners can also attract more patrons by maintaining a higher hygiene standard."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00863,2020-10-05-T-019,863,Poh Li San,"Secondly, our country must raise the social consciousness where ""it is everyone's responsibility to maintain public hygiene"". In schools, teachers should teach the students the good habits of maintaining hygiene and cleanliness. At home, parents should also encourage their children to partake in the household chores. In public, citizens should also maintain the cleanliness of surroundings, to reduce the reliance on our cleaners."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00864,2020-10-05-T-019,864,Poh Li San,"Third, we suggest that MSE to deeply consider if the Bill should also include other premises that may pose threats to public health, such as sports facilities and religious worship venues. The reason is that other than COVID-19, there could be other more deadly transmission diseases in future. Therefore, we should start now and prepare ourselves well, to prevent such horrible viruses from endangering precious lives."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00865,2020-10-05-T-019,865,Poh Li San,"Our country currently has approximately 59,000 cleaners. Amongst them, about 40,000 are locals and most of them are above 60 years old. Therefore, the courses for Environment Control Coordinator designated by Amendments to the Environmental Public Health Act Bill, should be conducted in languages understood by the senior cleaners. Otherwise, the cleaners may not understand the course contents and find themselves failing the course and in turn losing their jobs. In addition, we also encourage Singaporeans from all walks of life, to express their gratitude towards the cleaners for many years of hard work and their contribution in keeping Singapore clean."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00866,2020-10-05-T-019,866,Poh Li San,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the GPC for Sustainability and Environment, we support this Bill."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00867,2020-10-05-T-019,867,Deputy Speaker,Minister Grace Fu.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00868,2020-10-05-T-019,868,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank Members for their broad support of the Bill. Their thoughtful comments and suggestions reflect the importance that we collectively place on preserving a clean and healthy environment for Singaporeans."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00869,2020-10-05-T-019,869,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Members have raised pertinent points which can be broadly summarised as follows.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00870,2020-10-05-T-019,870,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"First, while the environmental sanitation regime focuses on Premises Managers taking responsibility for the cleanliness of their premises, we must also instill greater social responsibility for public hygiene, especially on the part of end-users."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00871,2020-10-05-T-019,871,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Second, even as we lean on Premises Managers to take concrete steps to improve cleanliness, we must help them manage compliance costs."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00872,2020-10-05-T-019,872,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Third, we must build on the capabilities of all key partners within the cleaning eco-system, including the cleaning industry, cleaners, Environmental Control Coordinators (ECCs) and Environmental Control Officers (ECOs)."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00873,2020-10-05-T-019,873,Grace Fu Hai Yien,I fully agree. Let me address the issues.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00874,2020-10-05-T-019,874,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Miss Cheryl Chan, Mr Don Wee, Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Ms Nadia Samdin, Ms Poh Li San, Mr Desmond Choo, Mr Derrick Goh, Ms Joan Pereira, Ms He Ting Ru and Ms Raeesah Khan have spoken passionately about the need for shared responsibility for public cleanliness, especially on the part of consumers and end-users. Members called for a shift away from the mindset of not caring about public spaces or amenities, simply because it is not our own."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00875,2020-10-05-T-019,875,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Building shared responsibility is a key thrust of our SG Clean movement. We are working with partner organisations and SG Clean Ambassadors to communicate simple yet important social norms on cleanliness, such as binning used tissues and litter, and returning one’s tray at hawker centres."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00876,2020-10-05-T-019,876,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We have also been exploring the use of behavioural science approaches to shape habits, as suggested by Miss Cheryl Chan and Ms Poh Li San. NEA has piloted the use of visual and audio cues to nudge users to return their trays at hawker centres. Mr Gan Thiam Poh would be happy to know that this helped to increase tray return rates at Zion Riverside Food Centre and Adam Road Food Centre by 19 percentage points and 42 percentage points respectively."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00877,2020-10-05-T-019,877,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"NEA has also piloted behavioural nudges such as placing posters with normative and emotive messages, in strategic locations, to encourage users to keep public toilets clean and dry. We will continue to push on this front."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00878,2020-10-05-T-019,878,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Let me now touch on how we will manage the regulatory impact on Premises Managers which several Members, including Ms Poh Li San and Mr Don Wee, have raised. We fully appreciate the concerns of businesses, especially in this difficult economic climate that we are in right now."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00879,2020-10-05-T-019,879,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Premises Managers should view the enhanced measures as the best insurance against potentially much larger costs should an outbreak happen due to unsanitary conditions. Businesses benefit from having good environmental sanitation that protects the health of their customers, employees and, as one Member has mentioned, the chefs that are working at the premises. Conversely, lapses in public health can cost them dearly. The F&B outlets and childcare centres involved in the gastroenteritis outbreaks in 2018 and 2019 know this from first-hand experience."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00880,2020-10-05-T-019,880,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Against the backdrop of COVID-19, businesses are prioritising cleanliness and hygiene as assurance to customers and to woo them back. Over 24,000 premises have acquired the SG Clean Quality Mark which provides a stamp of assurance to occupants that the premises are clean. So, cleanliness at this time fully reflects the importance of environmental sanitation and public hygiene."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00881,2020-10-05-T-019,881,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"From the outset, we have adopted a pragmatic approach to ensure adequate standards, while managing the impact on businesses. We have been working closely with sectoral leads, such as MOE, MSF, Early Childhood Development Agency and Singapore Food Agency or SFA to develop environmental sanitation standards that take into account the needs and constraints of each sector."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00882,2020-10-05-T-019,882,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"As an illustration, let me share how we are working with SFA and coffee shop owners to implement an environmental sanitation regime, while managing business costs for coffee shop owners."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00883,2020-10-05-T-019,883,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"NEA is working closely with coffee shop owners to put in place a regime that is practical and effective. The coffee shop owner who is the Premises Manager may appoint his outlet supervisor as the ECC. Some Members have voiced concerns about many of our elderly cleaners not being able to meet the needs or the standards required of an ECC. Let me assure Members that we are not expecting all cleaners to be trained in an ECC function. Every coffee shop needs only one person to be appointed as an ECC and that person can be an outlet supervisor, doing it as part of his or her function."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00884,2020-10-05-T-019,884,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The outlet supervisor, after the requisite training, will have the competencies to tailor an appropriate environmental sanitation programme and I would say here it is tailoring because we will come up with a standard template that the different sectors can tailor to their own circumstances."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00885,2020-10-05-T-019,885,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Smaller coffee shops may face more manpower constraints. We understand that. So, taking in their feedback, NEA will allow a few small coffee shop owners to collectively appoint one ECC for their premises, for economies of scale if they should require so or should they prefer to do so. Alternatively, the owner may double-up as the ECC."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00886,2020-10-05-T-019,886,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The environmental sanitation programme will focus on key areas that impact public health. For example, it will lay out daily cleaning frequencies for high-touch surfaces, such as seats and table-tops, as well as public amenities such as toilets. There must also be thorough periodic cleaning of hard-to-reach areas such as ceiling beams and overhead fixtures which can harbour rats and birds."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00887,2020-10-05-T-019,887,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The coffee shop owner will be required to conduct a comprehensive pest management survey periodically, say once every six months. Such inspections can surface defects for rectification, such as crevices to be sealed. The ECC will be trained in the basics of pest management so he can monitor pest management works. These preventive measures, coupled with good housekeeping, go a long way in tackling the root causes of the pest issues highlighted by Mr Gan Thiam Poh."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00888,2020-10-05-T-019,888,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Let me assure Ms Nadia Samdin that we will provide sufficient lead time for stakeholders to adjust to the new regulations. In the first half of next year, NEA will refine the environmental sanitation standards in consultation with industry stakeholders, issue the Code of Practice, and train the ECCs. The training syllabus, which focuses on the basics of hygiene, is applicable to all sectors."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00889,2020-10-05-T-019,889,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Implementation of the environmental sanitation regime will commence from mid-2021. We will start with a six-month advisory period for sectors to gradually adapt to the regulatory requirements, before enforcement begins. So, that would take us to the end of the year and we will start enforcing in 2022."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00890,2020-10-05-T-019,890,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Ms Poh Li San and Ms Nadia Samdin have asked to roll out the environmental sanitation regime to other premises and Ms Raeesah Khan has also asked about the framework in deciding which sectors to go first. So, we will start with implementation at higher risk premises with immuno-vulnerable occupants such as eldercare and childcare facilities; premises with high footfall such as coffee shops and hawker centres; or premises with a history of outbreaks. We will consider their suggestions when extending the regime to other premises in subsequent phases. This is also in response to Mr Shawn Huang's suggestion that we should phase out the implementation so that there is time for capacity to be built into the industry."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00891,2020-10-05-T-019,891,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Don Wee, Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Ms Poh Li San, Ms Joan Pereira and Mr Shawn Huang raised concerns about the cost impact of enhanced cleaning requirements. We will help businesses, especially the small players, manage costs."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00892,2020-10-05-T-019,892,Grace Fu Hai Yien,One area is manpower cost. We will allow flexibility for Premises Managers of small businesses to double up as ECCs. An ECC will be allowed to supervise cleaning works at a few branches or outlets as long as he is able to handle the workload.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00893,2020-10-05-T-019,893,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We will also help Premises Managers improve infrastructure and capabilities to enhance cleanliness, such as through NEA’s Toilet Improvement Programme for coffee shops and hawker centres which Ms Joan Pereira might be interested in. We are also exploring with SkillsFuture Singapore or SSG on the possibility of subsidising training costs for ECCs and ECOs, a suggestion raised by Ms Nadia Samdin."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00894,2020-10-05-T-019,894,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The third cluster of issues, which was raised by Mr Don Wee, Ms Nadia Samdin, Mr Louis Ng and Mr Desmond Choo, is about future-proofing the cleaning industry by raising capabilities and supporting the workers."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00895,2020-10-05-T-019,895,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"As Mr Don Wee pointed out, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated manpower shortages in the cleaning industry. Indeed, the industry is a growth area in jobs. And we want existing jobs to expand in skills and productivity so that more Singaporeans can get better paying jobs in the cleaning industry. This gives a strong impetus to accelerate the pace of digitalisation and automation in the cleaning industry to enhance productivity. This is a key thrust under the Environmental Services Industry Transformation Map."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00896,2020-10-05-T-019,896,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Cleaning companies have tapped on the enhanced Productivity Solutions Grant to adopt technology to overcome manpower constraints. As of 30 September 2020, NEA has approved 791 applications, with a total grant amount of $15.3 million."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00897,2020-10-05-T-019,897,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We are seeing some results. Lionsbot, a local start-up which sells and rents out cleaning robots, has seen an increase in demand for their robots, with 80% more inquiries since the pandemic started. LionsBot will be building 300 autonomous cleaning robots and progessively deploying them across Singapore to scrub, mop, vacuum, sweep, shine and even transport cleaning equipment. The cleaning robots can be rented by cleaning companies on a subscription basis so they do not need to invest in ownership and maintenance."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00898,2020-10-05-T-019,898,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We are also upskilling workers in the cleaning industry. Workforce Singapore, in partnership with NEA and the Environmental Management Association of Singapore, has rolled out a new Place-and-Train Programme for Cleaning Specialists for Disinfection Services in August 2020. This programme enables cleaners and jobseekers to reskill to take on the role of a cleaning specialist."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00899,2020-10-05-T-019,899,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Local cleaners performing general cleaning duties can also upgrade themselves by enrolling into the Continuing Education and Training courses on environmental infection control, with up to 90% training subsidy from SSG. With enhanced skillsets, these individuals can take on more specialised and skilled job roles that offer better salaries and career prospects."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00900,2020-10-05-T-019,900,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"As Members rightly pointed out, we must ensure that workers are fairly rewarded and can make a decent living. All cleaning businesses are required to provide wages stipulated under the Progressive Wage Model or PWM. With enhancements to the PWM, real median monthly gross wages of full-time resident cleaners have increased by 26% from 2014 to 2019, higher than the workforce’s median of 21%."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00901,2020-10-05-T-019,901,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Other measures are in place to ensure fair labour practices in the cleaning sector. MOM worked with tripartite partners to encourage premises to provide rest areas for outsourced workers like cleaners. In view of the COVID-19 situation, NEA and MOM worked with tripartite partners to advise service buyers and providers to ensure the safety and health of cleaners, manage their workload, and remunerate them appropriately for additional responsibilities."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00902,2020-10-05-T-019,902,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The effectiveness of the environmental sanitation regime does not just depend on the cleaning industry; it also requires that ECCs and ECOs have the knowhow to assist the Premises Manager. Mr Louis Ng and Mr Desmond Choo have spoken on this.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00903,2020-10-05-T-019,903,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Training for ECCs and ECOs will be customised to their needs and literacy levels as far as possible. For example, to cater for adult learners, the course does not stipulate educational qualifications and can accept trainees so long as ECCs can attain Workplace Literacy and Numeracy or WPLN Level 5 for reading, listening, speaking and writing. ECOs will require WPLN Level 7, or Level 6 with two years of relevant working experience. This basic proficiency is necessary, as the ECCs and ECOs need to learn how to develop an environmental sanitation programme and convey clear instructions to cleaners."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00904,2020-10-05-T-019,904,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Louis Ng asked if the training course for ECCs and ECOs can be conducted in more languages and are suitable for seniors. Initially, training will be conducted in English but NEA will review the need to offer the course in more languages, depending on the trainees’ needs."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00905,2020-10-05-T-019,905,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Taking into account employers’ needs, NEA will work with training providers to make the training course as concise as possible without compromising quality, and will provide bite-sized information or pictorial guides where possible."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00906,2020-10-05-T-019,906,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"As we gradually extend the environmental sanitation regime to more premises, there will be greater demand for competent ECCs and ECOs. In the next few years, we expect to enhance up to 15,700 ECC and ECO jobs under the environmental sanitation regime."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00907,2020-10-05-T-019,907,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Several Members, including Ms Poh Li San and Miss Cheryl Chan spoke about public toilets, and the importance of practising social responsibility in keeping them clean. Mr Louis Ng and Miss Cheryl Chan suggested introducing a cleanliness grading system for public toilets and tying it to licensing duration or fees for hawker centres and coffee shops."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00908,2020-10-05-T-019,908,Grace Fu Hai Yien,This overall approach of education and enforcement is broadly in line with our multi-pronged strategy to improve public toilet cleanliness.
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00909,2020-10-05-T-019,909,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Our first strategy is to improve design and infrastructure. As part of this, NEA is reviewing requirements for proper toilet design in the Code of Practice on Environmental Health, setting up model toilets in hawker centres and supporting infrastructure upgrade under the Toilet Improvement Programme."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00910,2020-10-05-T-019,910,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Second, NEA will step up surveillance and enforcement. Through the environmental sanitation regime, we will foster effective cleaning of toilets by mandating baseline standards. This is complemented by training programmes for toilet cleaners. We have also tightened penalties against toilet lapses since 1 April 2020 and NEA will continue with surveillance efforts through regular inspections."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00911,2020-10-05-T-019,911,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Third, NEA will ramp up public education and promote good toilet etiquette. You may have heard of our recent Public Toilet Cleanliness Initiative, where NEA partnered the Restroom Association of Singapore to promote good toilet habits."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00912,2020-10-05-T-019,912,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In line with Ms Poh Li San’s suggestion on involving citizens’ contribution, and Miss Cheryl Chan made a smiliar suggestion, we have installed feedback panels in some hawker centre toilets, to gain insights on users’ perceptions and make more targeted infrastructural improvements and cleaning efforts. We are rolling out more initiatives. So, do look out for the “Loo of the Future” Challenge to crowdsource for innovative toilet design ideas in the coming months."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00913,2020-10-05-T-019,913,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"On Mr Louis Ng and Miss Cheryl Chan’s suggestion of a cleanliness grading system, our primary focus for now is to support the premises in achieving a set of baseline environmental sanitation standards."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00914,2020-10-05-T-019,914,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Nonetheless, SFA will be introducing a new licensing and recognition framework for food establishments which will require them to have good track records on food safety and cleanliness. Major lapses in toilet cleanliness could conceivably affect their licence duration, which means they will have to go through audits more frequently, if they have a shorter licence duration. This will motivate coffee shops to maintain good track records and uphold cleanliness in their premises."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00915,2020-10-05-T-019,915,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Deputy Speaker, let me conclude. Public hygiene has always been a priority for the Government, but we must do more following COVID-19. This Bill marks a new milestone to keep Singapore clean by placing greater accountability on Premises Managers to strengthen public hygiene in their premises."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00916,2020-10-05-T-019,916,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Notwithstanding the focus of the Bill, Members have also spoken passionately and more broadly on a host of other environmental public health related matters, such as pest control, bird nuisance, tray return, smoking and littering. For better focus on the Bill, I will not address them one by one, specifically. These interrelated issues show that public health is multi-faceted and the solutions must also be multi-factorial."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00917,2020-10-05-T-019,917,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"This is why all users must play their part if we are to truly move the needle on public hygiene. While the Manager can keep his place clean and safe, individuals must take responsibility to maintain good personal hygiene. This is not just about safeguarding public health, but also building a more gracious society. In properly disposing of our used tissues for example, we help protect our cleaners, many of whom are elderly, from biohazards in their work environment so that they can work safely."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00918,2020-10-05-T-019,918,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Ultimately, public hygiene is a collective responsibility. I ask everyone to work with us to make Singapore a truly clean and liveable home, and instil a national culture of cleanliness. Good public hygiene will help us get over the current pandemic and be better prepared for the next outbreak. We must do our utmost to keep Singapore safer and stronger. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to speak in Chinese."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00919,2020-10-05-T-019,919,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Public hygiene must remain our first line of defence against disease outbreaks. The SARS outbreak in 2003 claimed 33 lives. The gastroenteritis incidents between 2018 to 2019, which were linked to contaminated environments, affected more than 1,200 people. The COVID-19 pandemic we are facing will not be the last global pandemic that we have to face. Hence, we must sustain our efforts in ensuring a clean environment and maintaining good personal hygiene. This will safeguard public health, and protect lives."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00920,2020-10-05-T-019,920,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment has introduced the Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill, as part of our SG Clean movement."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00921,2020-10-05-T-019,921,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Through these legislative changes, we will set minimum environmental sanitation standards for specific premises and make Premises Managers responsible for ensuring that these standards are met. We will progressively implement these standards from mid-2021, starting with higher-risk premises with immuno-vulnerable occupants, high footfall or a history of outbreaks, such as our preschools, schools, youth and eldercare facilities, hawker centres and coffee shops."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00922,2020-10-05-T-019,922,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"NEA will work with sector leads and industry partners in the coming months to co-develop these environmental sanitation standards applicable to their respective sectors and ensure that the standards are customised and fit for purpose. We are mindful of the operating and compliance costs to premises managers amidst the current global economic downturn and will adopt a pragmatic approach to ensure that the requirements are robust and effective against disease transmission, while managing the impact on businesses."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00923,2020-10-05-T-019,923,Deputy Speaker,"If we could have a moment of your time. You are about to exceed 40 minutes. Therefore, I would invite Leader to come forward to request an extension of the Standing Orders."
2020-10-05-T-019-S-00924,2020-10-05-T-019,924,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker."
2020-10-05-T-020-S-00925,2020-10-05-T-020,925,Indranee Rajah,"Mr Deputy Speaker, may I seek your consent and the general assent of Members present to move that the proceedings on the item under discussion be exempted from the provisions of Standing Order No 48(8) to remove the time limit in respect of Minister Grace Fu's speech."
2020-10-05-T-020-S-00926,2020-10-05-T-020,926,Deputy Speaker,I give my consent. Does the Leader of the House have the general assent of the hon Members present to so move?

2020-10-05-T-021-S-00932,2020-10-05-T-021,932,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] By raising overall standards for public hygiene, we also hope to create new jobs and upgrade existing ones. For example, with the introduction of the environmental sanitation regime, we will require premises managers to upskill existing workers and some larger enterprises may employ new workers. These workers will undergo technical training to develop, implement and monitor plans to raise cleanliness in line with the environmental sanitation standards."
2020-10-05-T-021-S-00933,2020-10-05-T-021,933,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"While the Government puts in place these measures to improve public hygiene in Singapore, it is also important that all of us, as end-users, customers or patrons, also play our part. This means taking a little more effort to do some simple things, such as binning our litter, returning trays after dining, and practising good toilet etiquette. It also means having a mindset of consideration for cleaners, and the next person who uses the same public facilities. Let us build a gracious society, and make Singapore a truly clean and liveable home."
2020-10-05-T-021-S-00934,2020-10-05-T-021,934,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]"

2020-10-05-T-023-S-00939,2020-10-05-T-023,939,Indranee Rajah,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, ""That Parliament do now adjourn."""
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00940,2020-10-05-T-023,940,Indranee Rajah,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00941,2020-10-05-T-023,941,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, I was a smoker for 17 years. I quit because of what I am going to talk about today – second-hand smoke. To be very honest, I did not quit for myself. I quit because I knew that second-hand smoke will severely affect the health of my daughter. I did not want her to suffer because of my choice to smoke."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00942,2020-10-05-T-023,942,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"The rights of smokers have to be protected. They are adults, old enough to decide whether they want to smoke or not. But we need to make sure that others are not affected by their decision to smoke. Affected here is not just about not liking the smell of smoke or the discomfort of seeing the smoke. When I say affected, I mean you could die because of second-hand smoke."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00943,2020-10-05-T-023,943,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"The World Health Organization has said that there is no safe level of exposure to second-hand smoke, which can cause coronary heart disease, stroke and lung cancer."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00944,2020-10-05-T-023,944,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Those inhaling second-hand smoke are actually exposed to more chemicals than the smokers themselves. Sidestream smoke, the main component in second-hand smoke, is four times more toxic than the smoke that a smoker inhales from the cigarette."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00945,2020-10-05-T-023,945,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"I am especially concerned about how second-hand smoke especially affects the vulnerable amongst us. According to MOH, even the slightest exposure to second-hand smoke can harm babies and young children. For them, even a little is already too much."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00946,2020-10-05-T-023,946,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, for me the most alarming thing is this. In 2016 alone, 383 people in Singapore died due to second-hand smoke. That is about one person dying every single day. We must do something."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00947,2020-10-05-T-023,947,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"For years, many residents have reached out to me about their neighbours smoking at balconies and at windows. Second-hand smoke enters their homes, and they feel helpless about the health risks facing their families."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00948,2020-10-05-T-023,948,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Mr Chia shared how his baby cries whenever he inhales his neighbour's second-hand smoke. Mr Chia feels that he has tried everything. He shut his window panels for most of the day and even installed a fan to blow the smoke away. Yet, toxic fumes continue to enter into his home."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00949,2020-10-05-T-023,949,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Zyen is another helpless resident. Her baby suffers from a lung infection and her neighbour smokes. She says, ""He smokes at midnight and the second-hand smoke drifts into our room when we are sleeping soundly."" How much more long-term damage will her baby suffer, she wonders."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00950,2020-10-05-T-023,950,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Another resident, Ms Lam, lives with her elderly parents. She often wakes up in the middle of the night to close the window so that her parents are not affected by her neighbours' second-hand smoke. But this also means there is no ventilation in the home for fresh air. They do not sleep properly and they are stressed out."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00951,2020-10-05-T-023,951,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,These are just some of the many concerns that residents have shared with me just over the past few weeks. Statistics shows that they are not alone.
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00952,2020-10-05-T-023,952,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"In the first four months of this year, NEA received 11,400 complaints related to smoking, a 20% increase from last year. This increase was largely due to people smoking in or near homes."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00953,2020-10-05-T-023,953,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"With more people working from home because of COVID-19, the number of cigarette-smoke disputes escalated to the Community Mediation Centre or CMC has quadrupled from two cases a month to now eight cases a month."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00954,2020-10-05-T-023,954,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Ms Lim is yet another example. She said that her family started having eye and throat irritation, headaches and nausea during the circuit breaker period due to the prolonged exposure to second-hand smoke. Her neighbour smokes seven to eight times a day, causing her to be ""literally basked in a cloud of smoke"" every day."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00955,2020-10-05-T-023,955,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"For Ms Lim and other Singaporeans, second-hand smoke is a silent assassin that poisons them in their own homes and they have no way to run."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00956,2020-10-05-T-023,956,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, NEA has previously said that second-hand smoke is a ""neighbourly"" issue. It is true. Neighbours should try to solve problems by talking to each other – and they do try. When it does not work, they seek mediation and support from HDB, NEA, TC, RC, CMC, CDRT and Members of Parliament, a whole alphabet soup of authorities. Yet, many residents have found these channels ineffective."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00957,2020-10-05-T-023,957,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"One such grievance was shared with me by Ms Ana. She has suffered a second-hand smoke of a couple living below her unit for at least 10 years. The couple smokes throughout the day. She has applied for CMC mediation, but her neighbours refused to attend the mediation, citing their right to smoke within their own home. Similarly, her Members of Parliament have told her that they are ""powerless"" and ""their hands are tied""."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00958,2020-10-05-T-023,958,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"These stories highlight why talk is not enough. CMC mediation is voluntary and does not work when neighbours refuse to participate. Even when Members of Parliament want to help, they cannot seek help from law enforcement because there is no relevant law or regulation to enforce."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00959,2020-10-05-T-023,959,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"A different solution is needed. The ""neighbourly"" issue of second-hand smoke is not the same as loud karaoke coming from next door or wet laundry dripping from upstairs. It causes long-term health damage and death. It cannot be solved the same way we solve all these other neighbourly disputes."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00960,2020-10-05-T-023,960,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, the GPC for Sustainability and the Environment proposes that the Ministry bans residents from smoking near the windows or at the balconies of their HDB flats and private apartments. This would minimise the effect that second-hand smoke has on their neighbours."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00961,2020-10-05-T-023,961,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Our proposal is not new. The US, as well as several provinces of Canada, does not allow smoking in public housing."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00962,2020-10-05-T-023,962,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"What is more, our proposal is very similar to what our NEA officers already do. They issue advisories to residents, telling them, ""not to smoke near the windows or at the balconies, as a way to minimise the amount of cigarette smoke emitted from their premises""."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00963,2020-10-05-T-023,963,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,All our proposal does is empower our officers to enforce their current advisory.
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00964,2020-10-05-T-023,964,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"In the past, NEA has also said that restricting people's actions in HDB flats would be an ""intrusive regulatory approach""."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00965,2020-10-05-T-023,965,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"However, our law already intrudes on people's behaviour within their homes. We ban residents from being nude in their own homes if other people can see it. We ban residents from keeping cats in their own homes because we feel it might affect their neighbours. Just this March, this House passed my Private Member's Bill, which bans the feeding of wildlife in any place, including private residences."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00966,2020-10-05-T-023,966,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"So, we do draw the line somewhere. Why do we draw the line at nudity, pets and feeding wildlife, but not at second-hand smoke, something that kills hundreds of people in Singapore a year?"
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00967,2020-10-05-T-023,967,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, I am sure NEA is not unaware of the impact of second-hand smoke. After all, we do have existing laws that restrict someone from smoking in their car in the no smoking zone along Orchard Road if their windows are down."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00968,2020-10-05-T-023,968,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"So, all our Government Parliamentary Committee or GPC asks for is to mirror these restrictions when it comes to our homes. Ultimately, our proposal seeks to balance the interests of both groups. We allow smokers to smoke within their homes as long as they stay away from windows and balconies. We allow non-smokers to avoid the perils of second-hand smoke. It is a win-win situation."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00969,2020-10-05-T-023,969,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"One condominium in Singapore, Foresque Residences, has already implemented this restriction on their own. Last year, an overwhelming 84.4% of residents voted in favour of it. We believe many other residents in HDB flats and private apartments would welcome such a restriction in their estates."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00970,2020-10-05-T-023,970,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Last but not least, our proposal is enforceable using existing technology already used on the ground. NEA has been using cameras to catch high-rise litterbugs. These surveillance cameras are focused only on the external facade of the housing units being investigated to capture the act of littering. It can even capture someone throwing cigarette butts out of their window. These cameras have contributed to hugely increasing a number of successful enforcement actions from 10 in 2011 to over 1,200 in 2018. They are effective."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00971,2020-10-05-T-023,971,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Separately, NEA has also been using thermal surveillance cameras to catch residents smoking at prohibited areas, such as common corridors, lift lobbies and staircase landings. These cameras can ""detect objects in meeting high heat and capture images of the smoking offence"". NEA can use all these existing technologies to catch those who smoke near windows and at balconies. We have years of experience fine-tuning their use and to minimise privacy intrusion and to maximise successful enforcement. What is missing now is just the legislation."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00972,2020-10-05-T-023,972,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"If Minister's reply is that these technologies are not viable, then NEA should implement alternative solutions to facilitate enforcement. After all, when high-rise littering started killing people, we acted urgently to deploy solutions on the ground. Second-hand smoke near windows and balconies also kills people and we should act on it with the same urgency. We must not let ""hard to enforce"" be an obstacle to saving lives"
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00973,2020-10-05-T-023,973,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Finally, I would like to share the experience of Mr Su, like me, a former smoker. He shared with me that he used to enjoy sitting at his balcony with a coffee and cigarette, and his neighbours would respond by slamming their balcony doors and windows."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00974,2020-10-05-T-023,974,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Mr Su quit smoking after becoming a father. But he now finds the tables have turned. He is the one slamming the window now because he has neighbours who are now smokers. Belatedly, he realises the impact he has had on his neighbours."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00975,2020-10-05-T-023,975,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,We cannot afford to wait for smokers in Singapore to reach this same realisation.
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00976,2020-10-05-T-023,976,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, in conclusion, for the sake of the health and lives of our children, our elderly parents and other non-smokers, the GPC proposes that this Government introduces a ban on smoking near windows and at the balconies of HDB flats and private apartments. This is a public health concern we cannot continue to deny and leave unresolved."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00977,2020-10-05-T-023,977,Deputy Speaker,Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment.
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00978,2020-10-05-T-023,978,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Mr Deputy Speaker, protecting Singaporeans against second-hand tobacco smoke has always been our priority. I thank Mr Louis Ng for his proposal to curb second-hand smoke. Many Members, including myself, have received similar suggestions."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00979,2020-10-05-T-023,979,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Let me assure everyone that my Ministry is equally concerned about second-hand smoke. Indeed, I empathise with all who have suffered from this."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00980,2020-10-05-T-023,980,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We have always recognised the serious health risk from second-hand smoke. We first introduced smoking prohibition in omnibuses, cinemas and theatres in 1970 and have progressively expanded this to more public places. We were among the first globally to impose a nation-wide smoking ban in the covered common areas of residential estates."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00981,2020-10-05-T-023,981,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Currently, smoking is prohibited in more than 32,000 places and we will do more."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00982,2020-10-05-T-023,982,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Singapore has introduced robust policies to discourage smoking, such as raising the minimum legal age of smoking and introducing standardised packaging for tobacco products. Through public education and nudges, we urge smokers to quit their habit."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00983,2020-10-05-T-023,983,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Consequently, the daily smoking prevalence has decreased from 18.3% in 1992 to 13.9% in 2010 and 10.6% in 2019. We continue to work on driving down smoking prevalence, which will also reduce the incidence of second-hand smoke."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00984,2020-10-05-T-023,984,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Let me turn to the issue of second-hand smoke experienced in homes.
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00985,2020-10-05-T-023,985,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Of the 11,400 smoking complaints received in the first four months of 2020, 58% or 6,630 complaints were in residential estates. As more residents work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an uptick in smoking complaints in residential estates. Ninety-five percent or 6,310 of these complaints were related to smoking in common corridors, staircases and void decks. The remaining 5% or 320 cases involved smoking in homes."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00986,2020-10-05-T-023,986,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"NEA has prioritised surveillance at common areas, in particular, common corridors, staircases and void decks at residential estates. Thermal cameras are also deployed at smoking hotspots. In the first half of 2020, NEA took 2,400 enforcement actions at these areas, a 37% increase from the same time period last year."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00987,2020-10-05-T-023,987,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"For complaints of smoking in homes, NEA, Town Councils and grassroots leaders take an educational approach and advise smokers to be considerate and not smoke near windows and balconies. Most smokers take heed, except for a small group of recalcitrant smokers. For such cases, grassroots leaders, NEA and relevant agencies help to mediate between neighbours and discuss adjustments to be made. Affected residents can turn to the Community Mediation Centre. They can also raise the matter to the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal or CDRT as a last resort."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00988,2020-10-05-T-023,988,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Between January 2019 and July 2020, 25 claims relating to excessive smoke, caused by cigarettes or incense, were filed with the CDRT. Quite a number of claimants were able to resolve issues amicably without proceeding to the Tribunal."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00989,2020-10-05-T-023,989,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Mr Louis Ng and GPC Members have proposed that we ban smoking at balconies and windows of homes. We are just as keen to resolve this issue and have carefully studied these suggestions. Unfortunately, besides the fact that such legislation could be highly intrusive, there are significant practical challenges in enforcement that limit effectiveness."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00990,2020-10-05-T-023,990,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"First, enforcement will be challenging as capturing evidence of the smoking offence is not straightforward. Smelling the tobacco smoke is not sufficient as cameras must capture the smoker smoking or holding a lighted cigarette, as evidence for enforcement. However, a smoker can easily hide behind a pillar, frosted glass windows, or curtains to avoid detection by the camera. Overall, this may entail deployment of significant resources without achieving effective outcomes."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00991,2020-10-05-T-023,991,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Second, to capture the smoking act, the camera must be placed at suitable vantage points to probe into the window or balcony. For towering flats, finding the right vantage point in common areas to deploy the camera is not always possible. Directly aiming cameras into homes is highly intrusive, unlike surveillance for high rise littering where the camera is trained at the building facade and can be placed at ground level some distance away."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00992,2020-10-05-T-023,992,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Finally, this will exacerbate existing concerns about privacy and infringing the owner's rights to his or her private space. Meadows@Peirce is a case in point. A dispute had ensued in 2017 between the condominium management committee and its residents when a circular directed residents to refrain from smoking at balconies and windows. Some residents argued that the management committee should not dictate actions in private spaces."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00993,2020-10-05-T-023,993,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We have studied overseas practices too, some of which were cited by the Member. Globally, there are few instances of bans on smoking in homes. In the US, the smoking ban in homes is limited to public rental housing which accounts for a tiny fraction, in fact, 1% of the total housing stock. In Australia, some states ban smoking in common areas of multi-unit housing and exempt private spaces, although owner corporations can adopt their own by-laws to cover the private living areas. Indeed, this is similar to what we have in Singapore. Smoking is already banned in many common areas of residential estates. MCSTs can opt to adopt by-laws to expand the ban in their estates, with support from residents."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00994,2020-10-05-T-023,994,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"In US, the ban is enforced by Public Housing Authorities, whilst in Australia, the owner-corporations have to enforce the ban. Even in countries where there are bans, effectiveness has been mixed and uncertain at best. In US public housing, there was difficulty in securing evidence for enforcement and smokers also saw this as a violation of privacy."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00995,2020-10-05-T-023,995,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The difficulties in enforcing against smoking in homes and privacy concerns can lead to greater frustration, exacerbate disputes and increase social tensions. This was the case at Meadows@Peirce. The overseas examples show that enforcement is challenging."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00996,2020-10-05-T-023,996,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We must work hard to address the difficult issue of second-hand smoke from homes but legislation against smoking at windows or balconies may not be that silver bullet. Instead, we will pursue a three-pronged approach."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00997,2020-10-05-T-023,997,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"First, we will work harder to engender greater social responsibility. This means instilling consideration for the health and well-being of those around us, not just family members but also our neighbours. We must entrench new social norms of what constitutes acceptable behaviour. For example, stop smoking in homes, including at windows and balconies, and do so only in non-prohibited areas away from others."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00998,2020-10-05-T-023,998,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"NEA will work with other agencies such as MOH, HPB and MND and MSO to explore effective ways of doing this. For example, by developing targeted messages on exercising social responsibility, as well as acceptable social norms. These can then be communicated pervasively across key platforms, including social media channels. Changing norms will take time but we must work doubly hard as it gets to the very heart of the problem that legislation and enforcement, at least with today's level of technology, cannot fix."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-00999,2020-10-05-T-023,999,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Second, we will examine more ways to facilitate productive conversations between neighbours to deal with difficult situations, before they escalate into intractable disputes. For example, we could develop simple messages for neighbours to communicate concerns with one another or share best practices from successful efforts to resolve neighbourly disputes. We will also look at how to leverage community networks and links, including grassroots, to bring neighbours together in conversations."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-01000,2020-10-05-T-023,1000,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Third, we will work with agencies to study how these disputes can be better addressed by the inter-agency Community Dispute Management Framework. We will work with agencies to review the Community Mediation Process and the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal or CDRT to enhance their effectiveness when residents have to resort to these channels. Nonetheless, we hope that most cases will not have to end up in community mediation or with the Tribunal."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-01001,2020-10-05-T-023,1001,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The best way to protect against second-hand smoke is for family members and neighbours to help smokers cut down and quit smoking. And if they have to smoke, not to light up at home and instead smoke at non-prohibited areas."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-01002,2020-10-05-T-023,1002,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Sir, I fully appreciate the frustration and distress of those who suffer from second-hand smoke at home. We are determined to address this and will work hard with Government agencies and the community on the strategies that I laid out. At the same time, we will continue to monitor best practices globally and improvements in technology. We will stay open to innovative and practicable solutions as they emerge."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-01003,2020-10-05-T-023,1003,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Ultimately, mitigating the impact of second-hand smoke requires everyone to play their part. Smokers must exercise consideration for the health of their family and neighbours. As a community, we must help one another build the right social norms for a healthy and gracious society."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-01004,2020-10-05-T-023,1004,Deputy Speaker,"Yes, I see two raised hands. The Adjournment does have 30 minutes, we have used 22 minutes of the 30 minutes. So, I will invite Members to ask clarifications and then the response has to be limited only to eight minutes up to 7.00 pm, which is the moment of interruption. Mr Louis Ng."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-01005,2020-10-05-T-023,1005,Deputy Speaker,"Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang  Thank you, Sir. I was really hoping she would just said yes, but just two clarifications."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-01006,2020-10-05-T-023,1006,Deputy Speaker,"One, I think the problem is that we are viewing this as a neighbourly dispute issue. If we view this as a public health crisis then the policy direction and the policy outcome might be completely different."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-01007,2020-10-05-T-023,1007,Deputy Speaker,"Two, I expected that we would raise the issue of whether it is enforceable and I addressed that in the speech that it can be. Why can we not just use the cameras that we use for high-rise littering there is pointing at the facade of the building that can capture someone who is throwing a cigarette butt out of their window. Why can we not use the same camera to capture someone smoking at their windows or the balconies and not point it inside to the house. So, if they are lying down on their bed and smoking, that is okay. I am just saying move them away from the windows and balconies so that it minimises, not completely eradicate, but minimises the effects of second-hand smoke on the neighbours."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-01008,2020-10-05-T-023,1008,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"To the Member's first question, we are dealing with this issue of second-hand smoke not just as a neighbourly dispute. The fact that we started legislation to ban smoking in common areas, really, one of the priority is because we want to protect the public from second-hand smoke. That is why there are 32,000 places now that are smoking prohibited areas. So, in fact, the smokers have very little areas, very little space for them to smoke. They cannot smoke in playgrounds, common corridors, staircases and so on."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-01009,2020-10-05-T-023,1009,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The reason really is protecting public from second-hand smoke as well as of course making it very difficult for smokers to smoke because we hope that that will help to reduce their smoking prevalence rate. And indeed, we have been successful in doing this because I have actually given statistics to show that smoking prevalence rates have fallen to 10.6% in 2019, and we are doing more. We are going to expand the smoking prohibited areas to even more places."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-01010,2020-10-05-T-023,1010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"In fact, somebody said, ""Actually, our smoking prohibition in common areas in residential estate is really right up to the doorstep of your homes already."" So, it is not really just about neighbourly disputes. But, as I have said to ban smoking in homes, there are couple of issues, not just about enforcement but also about privacy concerns. So, that leads to my answer to the second question. Why can we not just use the cameras we are using? Indeed, in my response, I have elaborated on why it is difficult to enforce using the cameras we have – both optical cameras as well as thermal cameras."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-01011,2020-10-05-T-023,1011,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"So, just give Members an illustration. In fact, as the Member said, we have had years of experience using optical cameras for high-rise littering enforcement and then recently thermal cameras for enforcement against smoking in prohibited areas. So, because we have years of experience, my NEA colleagues fully understand the intractable difficulties in enforcing against smoking at balconies and windows."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-01012,2020-10-05-T-023,1012,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Allow me to just elaborate a little, Deputy Speaker. First of all, thermal cameras are of shorter range than the optical cameras for high-rise littering. And as I have said, for high-rise littering, we can have the optical cameras at ground level point as Member said, at the facade, as long as you can see somebody throwing the cigarette – the act of throwing – we will then investigate from which floor, we know which unit, we can investigate and then get the person to admit to the littering offence."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-01013,2020-10-05-T-023,1013,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"For smoking at balconies and windows, as I have explained, it is not so easy because you need to see the smoker in the act of taking the lighted cigarette or holding the cigarette and to do that you have to train the camera at level with as well as directly at the windows or balconies. First, because of the design of flats and increasingly so, it is very difficult to find common areas where you can put cameras and be able to aim directly at that flat. Flats, for instance, with recess windows and balconies, you cannot do it. Most of the private condominium designs are very difficult, you cannot do it. Even for high-rise littering, it is already difficult and that is just the facade. For smoking, you actually have to look in. And the problem is, if you just step back behind, like I say, curtains, walls and so on, the person is actually still near the windows and balconies, but you cannot catch. So, that is optical camera."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-01014,2020-10-05-T-023,1014,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We have even thought about how do you do it if you cannot mount at the ground floor. You have to mount at a certain height and distance, but will you be able to find common staircases that there has a good vantage point? If you cannot, can you mount it in the homes of residents? Unlikely."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-01015,2020-10-05-T-023,1015,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The other thing is, even for high-rise littering camera when you mount and aim, the camera will be looking at a few units, so there are actually privacy concerns. But for high-rise littering, because we are aiming at the facade, I think it is less of an issue. But, for smoking, it will be really an intrusion into privacy. Because even the innocent resident may also be in the line of sight."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-01016,2020-10-05-T-023,1016,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"For thermal cameras, the distance is only 40 metres so you can well imagine if you are separated or blocked by trees, so on and so forth, you will not be able to get the heat signature. I hope that explains."
2020-10-05-T-023-S-01017,2020-10-05-T-023,1017,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]"
2020-10-05-T-023-S-01018,2020-10-05-T-023,1018,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"[(proc text) Resolved, ""That Parliament do now adjourn."" (proc text)]"
2020-10-05-T-023-S-01019,2020-10-05-T-023,1019,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Adjourned accordingly at 6.59 pm.
2020-10-05-T-024-S-01020,2020-10-05-T-024,1020,He Ting Ru,"asked the Minister for Manpower of the number of retrenchments in 2020, how many were women."
2020-10-05-T-024-S-01021,2020-10-05-T-024,1021,Josephine Teo,"Based on our latest available survey data, in the first half of 2020, 6,460 residents were retrenched, of which about half were women."
2020-10-05-T-024-S-01022,2020-10-05-T-024,1022,Josephine Teo,
2020-10-05-T-025-S-01023,2020-10-05-T-025,1023,Sharael Taha,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Ministry is reviewing its eligibility criteria for distributing support grants especially on the use of per capita income of occupants living in a particular address.
2020-10-05-T-025-S-01024,2020-10-05-T-025,1024,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The fundamental objective of various financial support grants is to provide support to Singapore residents who require either temporary assistance due to loss of income or longer-term assistance as they are unable to seek employment due to reasons such as medical illness or family circumstances. These grants are therefore intended for applicants who do not have sufficient savings, assets or income to meet their basic needs."
2020-10-05-T-025-S-01025,2020-10-05-T-025,1025,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In general, measures such as household per capita income (PCI), gross household income and annual value of property are useful proxies of a household’s financial circumstances, and ability to tide through challenging periods. For large households with higher expenses, PCI is often more meaningful. Applicants with higher PCI are typically more resilient financially and better able to weather financial or employment shocks."
2020-10-05-T-025-S-01026,2020-10-05-T-025,1026,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Thus, household income or PCI are often used as eligibility criteria for assistance schemes such as ComCare and the COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG), which is intended to help employees in lower- to middle-income households who suffered job loss or salary loss."
2020-10-05-T-025-S-01027,2020-10-05-T-025,1027,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MSF regularly reviews the eligibility criteria of our assistance schemes to ensure that their objectives are being met, and that they meet the needs of target groups. Flexibility is also exercised on a case by case basis when applying the eligibility criteria."
2020-10-05-T-025-S-01028,2020-10-05-T-025,1028,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Recognising the unprecedented and unexpected nature of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government has also implemented other schemes that are not subjected to means testing such as cash payouts and Passion Card top-ups for all Singaporeans, and the Jobs Support Scheme."
2020-10-05-T-026-S-01029,2020-10-05-T-026,1029,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs what are the plans of MUIS to regulate or educate food and beverage (F&B) operators on the use of labels depicting Islamic phrases or Muslim-owned businesses status in order to avoid confusion amongst the public of the halal status of F&B establishments and potential dilution of the MUIS halal certification mark.
2020-10-05-T-026-S-01030,2020-10-05-T-026,1030,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Halal certification is voluntary in Singapore. Those who apply and are awarded halal certificates are closely regulated by MUIS to ensure that they meet the requisite halal standards.
2020-10-05-T-026-S-01031,2020-10-05-T-026,1031,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Muslim owners and operators of food and beverage (F&B) businesses may choose not to apply for halal certification on the basis that it is already clear that it is a religious obligation and responsibility for Muslims to serve halal food to other Muslims. Instead, they prefer to highlight their faith, either through labels that indicate that the establishment is Muslim-owned or through the display of Islamic paraphernalia."
2020-10-05-T-026-S-01032,2020-10-05-T-026,1032,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MUIS will continue to emphasise to F&B businesses the importance of not naming or promoting their establishments in a manner that could mislead consumers. For example, Muslim F&B businesses which opt to only use Islamic paraphernalia or Muslim-ownership labels to indicate they are a halal-food establishment should take care to ensure that their food is halal. The MUIS halal logo also must not be used or modified by businesses that have not attained official certification, so that it does not lead to a dilution of the mark. Action will be taken against businesses that make wilful misrepresentations."
2020-10-05-T-026-S-01033,2020-10-05-T-026,1033,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"It is also important for customers of F&B halal establishments to be alert to establishments that may display misleading information. Halal food consumers should familiarise themselves with the halal certification mark or ask F&B owners for clarification if they are unsure whether the establishment serves halal food if other labels are displayed. For Muslim consumers, dining decisions are a personal choice. MUIS will continue to provide guidance, so they can be more aware of the considerations and implications when making food choices. MUIS has conducted several public education efforts on this matter through mainstream media and various social media platforms, such as the HalalSG Twitter, MUIS' Facebook page, MuslimSG app and various podcast shows."
2020-10-05-T-027-S-01034,2020-10-05-T-027,1034,Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how is STB supporting travel agencies to expand their local tour offerings; (b) whether hostels that are licensed under the Hotel Licensing Board qualify as partners for use of the SingapoRediscovers vouchers; and (c) whether STB will extend the period beyond 31 December 2020 for the 90% reduction of the minimum financial requirement for travel agents to keep their licences.
2020-10-05-T-027-S-01035,2020-10-05-T-027,1035,Chan Chun Sing,"I will first answer the first and third question. Since global travel restrictions were in place in the first quarter of 2020, STB has been working closely with the National Association of Travel Agents, also known as NATAS, as well as the travel agent community, to help companies tide over the lull by tapping on domestic demand and using this time to upskill their staff to prepare for recovery when international travel returns."
2020-10-05-T-027-S-01036,2020-10-05-T-027,1036,Chan Chun Sing,"When Phase Two reopening began in July, travel agents and tourist guides were permitted to resume tour operations gradually, with appropriate safe management measures in place. Since then, over 200 applications with close to 500 tour itineraries have been approved."
2020-10-05-T-027-S-01037,2020-10-05-T-027,1037,Chan Chun Sing,"To promote these tour offerings, we have featured innovative tour packages and experiences on STB’s SingapoRediscovers campaign site. We have also provided various forms of marketing support, for instance, through STB's Marketing Partnership Programme, where travel agents can apply for a grant to offset their marketing costs. Furthermore, STB has facilitated discussions between travel agents, attractions and hotels to offer combined packages for Singaporeans to enjoy."
2020-10-05-T-027-S-01038,2020-10-05-T-027,1038,Chan Chun Sing,"The minimum financial requirement is imposed to ensure that travel agents have the financial means to fulfil their commitments to customers. In view of the sharp drop in customer business and financial stress on our travel agents, we decided to reduce the minimum financial requirement for travel agents holding a general or niche licence by 90% until the end of this year. We are closely monitoring the situation and are prepared to extend this if needed."
2020-10-05-T-027-S-01039,2020-10-05-T-027,1039,Chan Chun Sing,"On the second question regarding hostels' qualification as partners for the use of the SingapoRediscovers vouchers, our primary focus is safeguarding the health and safety of Singaporeans. As backpacker hostels are largely made up of close-living quarters with communal facilities like bathrooms, there is a higher risk of virus transmission associated with the physical setting. We are reviewing if hostels with non-communal facilities can be made safe for staycations, and if so, we will look to include them in the SingapoRediscovers vouchers programme."
2020-10-05-T-028-S-01040,2020-10-05-T-028,1040,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry can increase university enrolments for the coming few years so that all Singaporeans with grades that qualify for entry into Government-funded universities can do so amidst COVID-19.
2020-10-05-T-028-S-01041,2020-10-05-T-028,1041,Lawrence Wong,"This year, MOE and the Autonomous Universities (AUs) have already provided more degree places, in anticipation of higher demand from students whose overseas study plans were disrupted by COVID-19. The AUs extended their application windows by two months, and made around 2,000 more offers to local applicants across a range of courses."
2020-10-05-T-028-S-01042,2020-10-05-T-028,1042,Lawrence Wong,"MOE will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely, including the situation overseas and the impact on travel restrictions. If necessary, we are prepared to continue to adjust the number of degree places in the AUs, taking into account the number of Singaporeans who meet admissions standards, as well as the medium to long-term national manpower demand for graduates across the different sectors of the economy."
2020-10-05-T-029-S-01043,2020-10-05-T-029,1043,Yeo Wan Ling,asked the Minister for Defence what is the status and updated timeline for the move of the RSAF operations from Paya Lebar Air Base to Tengah Air Base.
2020-10-05-T-029-S-01044,2020-10-05-T-029,1044,Ng Eng Hen,"Mindef had previously announced that the relocation of Paya Lebar Air Base (PLAB) would likely occur about 2030 or beyond and only after the Changi Air Base East and Tengah Air Base have been expanded to house the existing assets at PLAB. Specifically for CAB East, the works there would also need to align with other development works including the building of additional runways for Singapore Changi Airport."
2020-10-05-T-029-S-01045,2020-10-05-T-029,1045,Ng Eng Hen,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the construction sector severely and caused some project delays with regard to the works at both Changi and Tengah Air Bases. Despite these disruptions, the current assessment is that barring further disruptions, the relocation of PLAB can still occur within previously projected timelines."
2020-10-05-T-029-S-01046,2020-10-05-T-029,1046,Ng Eng Hen,Site surveys and preliminary designs of the expanded air bases have been completed. The current focus is on the land preparation works that include the realignment of roads and the construction of facilities at Tengah Air Base and Changi Air Base will commence thereafter.
2020-10-05-T-030-S-01047,2020-10-05-T-030,1047,Jamus Jerome Lim,"asked the Minister for Defence whether the operational readiness of the RSAF will be significantly compromised if sorties taking off from Paya Lebar Airbase are clustered into a small number of windows within the day, even if the duration of each window will be relatively longer."
2020-10-05-T-030-S-01048,2020-10-05-T-030,1048,Ng Eng Hen,"As a small country with no strategic depth, it is critical for Singapore’s survival to maintain a capable and operationally-ready RSAF. Without this crucial deterrence, Singapore's national defences can easily be compromised and with potentially catastrophic consequences. Our own history demonstrates and reminds us of this existential vulnerability. Within hours after Japanese forces invaded Peninsula Malaysia in 1941, General Yamashita sent an air raid over Singapore – 17 planes were involved. With air superiority established, Japanese forces advanced swiftly down and reached Singapore within days. The British forces had to retreat into Singapore and blew up the causeway to slow down the Japanese assault. But without an airforce then to protect our skies, residents on our island were still at the mercy of bombs that fell from Japanese fighter planes. The death and destruction that ensued was horrendous. As one survivor, Mr Conceicao, who was 17 years old at that time, vividly recalled ""we saw hands, heads maybe, legs and parts of the human body lying about…this affected us throughout the course of the war and our life""."
2020-10-05-T-030-S-01049,2020-10-05-T-030,1049,Ng Eng Hen,"That we have a capable RSAF today able to defend our skies is taken for granted. It’s a virtuous state of affairs, but one that can slip if ever the capabilities of our pilots and planes degrade. And to keep up their skills, RSAF pilots need to train adequately. We recognize the inconvenience and disruption to residents here. MINDEF/SAF has done as much as we can to keep the RSAF training tempo locally to essential levels and activity. Let me elaborate."
2020-10-05-T-030-S-01050,2020-10-05-T-030,1050,Ng Eng Hen,"The RSAF has reduced its local training as far as possible. About half of actual flying training occurs overseas in countries that are willing to provide us those opportunities. On one of my visits to Luke Air base, where our F16s pilots train, I hosted the mayor and residents of the surrounding town to an appreciation lunch. I thanked the mayor for their support and understanding for our fighter detachment’s training there, especially to tolerate the noise, just as our resident here do. He smiled, and replied, ""it’s the sound of freedom."" Singapore is thankful that we have our good friends and partners in many countries who support our defence efforts."
2020-10-05-T-030-S-01051,2020-10-05-T-030,1051,Ng Eng Hen,"Even for local training, a significant proportion is done through simulators. During actual flying, the RSAF has introduced measures to reduce the noise. First, most of the local flying is conducted over waters rather than land, and avoiding residential areas except during take off, landing and transit to and from training areas. To illustrate, the northern end of the runway at Paya Lebar Air Base is approximately six kilometres from our territorial boundary. The fighter pilots have mere seconds after take-off to bank a sharp left in order to keep within our territorial airspace."
2020-10-05-T-030-S-01052,2020-10-05-T-030,1052,Ng Eng Hen,"Sorties taking off from Paya Lebar Air Base and Tengah Air Base are already clustered where possible, in multiple groups, even when smaller number of aircraft are involved."
2020-10-05-T-030-S-01053,2020-10-05-T-030,1053,Ng Eng Hen,"In addition to these routine measures, the RSAF does adjust its training tempo to accommodate sensitive periods. When national school examinations are held, the frequency of flights are reduced and night flying activities end earlier. During this COVID-19 pandemic where more residents are working and studying from home, the RSAF has kept the level of local flying activities to the minimum needed to maintain operational readiness. Flying is also spread across the week and on selected weekends."
2020-10-05-T-030-S-01054,2020-10-05-T-030,1054,Ng Eng Hen,"This regular training both locally and overseas keep the RSAF sharp and able to protect us well. It’s not against theoretical or imagined threats. Since the 9/11 twin tower attacks in Manhattan, the RSAF has put its pilots and Ground Based Air Defence systems on alert. On any given year, the RSAF responds to more than 350 suspicious air threats. In June last year for instance, there was a bomb threat on an inbound Scoot flight. Our fighters were scrambled and took to the skies within minutes to intercept the aircraft and escorted it back to Changi Airport. That case was reported in the news; many more go unreported for a variety of reasons."
2020-10-05-T-030-S-01055,2020-10-05-T-030,1055,Ng Eng Hen,This state of high operational readiness of the RSAF is only possible with regular and realistic training. I thank Singaporeans for their continued support to maintain an operationally ready and capable RSAF.
2020-10-05-T-031-S-01056,2020-10-05-T-031,1056,Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether Wireless@SG hotspots can be rolled out for HDB rental blocks to ensure a minimum level of Internet connectivity for residents who may not be able to afford the subsidised plans with Home Access 3.0 programmes.
2020-10-05-T-031-S-01057,2020-10-05-T-031,1057,S Iswaran,"The Government is committed to equipping all Singaporeans with a baseline of affordable digital access. Compared to deploying Wireless@SG at HDB rental blocks, the Home Access scheme is a more targeted and practical solution that provides internet connectivity to lower-income households in their homes. Wireless@SG supplements this with free out-of-home connectivity at public sites with high human traffic, such as transport nodes and community facilities such as community centres, libraries, and hawker centres."
2020-10-05-T-031-S-01058,2020-10-05-T-031,1058,S Iswaran,"Under the Home Access scheme, all households residing in HDB rental units are eligible for a heavily subsidised broadband subscription at $9/month, which is about 70% less than comparable commercial plans. For households with ComCare recipients, the out-of-pocket expense could be even lower, at $6/month. Broadband is also provided for free to households with school-going children or persons with disabilities who are beneficiaries of the NEU PC Plus programme. Low-income households can apply to IMDA for these schemes."
2020-10-05-T-031-S-01059,2020-10-05-T-031,1059,S Iswaran,"Low-income households may approach MSF's Social Service Offices (SSOs) to apply for ComCare. If they require home broadband, the SSOs can help with their application for the Home Access scheme and, if needed, provide additional financial assistance for a basic broadband plan."
2020-10-05-T-032-S-01060,2020-10-05-T-032,1060,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) to date, how many low-income households have benefited from the Home Access 3.0 programme for minimum broadband speeds; and (b) whether higher minimum broadband speeds can be considered for the Home Access programme to cater for the growing need for online access."
2020-10-05-T-032-S-01061,2020-10-05-T-032,1061,S Iswaran,"The Home Access 3.0 programme was launched in April 2020 and has supported close to 1,500 beneficiaries to date."
2020-10-05-T-032-S-01062,2020-10-05-T-032,1062,S Iswaran,"The speed of broadband provided under Home Access has improved over the years, in response to consumer needs. Earlier this year, the minimum broadband speed offered was raised from 300Mbps to 500Mbps, with no increase in the monthly co-payment for beneficiaries that opt for a broadband-only plan. This is higher than the minimum speed available on the market, and is sufficient to support common daily activities such as internet surfing, video calls, and video streaming. More than 80% of beneficiaries have opted for the minimum broadband speed of 500Mbbps. Home Access also offers a 1Gbps option for households that prefer higher speed broadband."
2020-10-05-T-032-S-01063,2020-10-05-T-032,1063,S Iswaran,"We will continue to review the Home Access scheme regularly, to ensure that its offerings keep pace with the needs of citizens."
2020-10-05-T-033-S-01064,2020-10-05-T-033,1064,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB can consider ramping up the number of flats constructed, especially in mature estates, and reduce the number of upcoming condo developments as families become more financially prudent during this COVID-19 period and beyond."
2020-10-05-T-033-S-01065,2020-10-05-T-033,1065,Desmond Lee,"The Government plans the supply of public and private housing units under the respective Build-To-Order (BTO) and Government Land Sales (GLS) Programmes carefully, taking into account factors such as prevailing economic and housing market conditions, as well as longer-term demographic and population trends. This is to ensure that the injection of housing units meets demand over the near to medium term, while being sustainable for the entire housing market."
2020-10-05-T-033-S-01066,2020-10-05-T-033,1066,Desmond Lee,"To meet demand for public housing, HDB has increased the BTO flat supply from 14,600 units in 2019 to about 16,700 units this year. The flat supply includes a good mix of units in the mature and non-mature estates, to provide a range of choices to home seekers with different budgets and needs."
2020-10-05-T-033-S-01067,2020-10-05-T-033,1067,Desmond Lee,"Given the limited supply and high demand for BTO flats in the mature estates, flat buyers who wish to buy flats in the mature estates can consider buying a resale flat in the open market, where first-timer buyers may receive up to $160,000 in housing grants."
2020-10-05-T-033-S-01068,2020-10-05-T-033,1068,Desmond Lee,"For private housing, URA has reduced the supply of private residential units on the Confirmed List for the 2H2020 GLS programme, after considering the COVID-19 situation, the economic slowdown and uncertain business outlook."
2020-10-05-T-033-S-01069,2020-10-05-T-033,1069,Desmond Lee,"The Government will continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 situation on the housing market closely, and calibrate the near and medium term supply of public and private housing units holistically to account for potential shifts in the housing demand and aspirations of the population."
2020-10-05-T-034-S-01070,2020-10-05-T-034,1070,Foo Mee Har,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Ministry is aware of the prevalence of ""zombie companies"" in Singapore and the risk that COVID-19 support schemes may be allocating precious resources to them, hindering the allocation of labour and skills to more productive parts of the economy."
2020-10-05-T-034-S-01071,2020-10-05-T-034,1071,Chan Chun Sing,"The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have devastated the global economy, and Singapore is no exception. MTI expects GDP growth this year to be between negative 7% and negative 5%. If this forecast is realised, the impact of COVID-19 will be worse than that of past crises, such as SARS and the Global Financial Crisis (or GFC). It will negate the gains that the Singapore economy had made in the last two to three years."
2020-10-05-T-034-S-01072,2020-10-05-T-034,1072,Chan Chun Sing,"This extent of impact required the Government to act swiftly and decisively to provide temporary relief to businesses. We have introduced a variety of support measures to help companies with cashflow, costs, and credit. We have also introduced measures that were designed to help companies retain capabilities or build new ones in the face of a changed environment, including the enhanced Enterprise Development Grant, and Productivity Solutions Grant."
2020-10-05-T-034-S-01073,2020-10-05-T-034,1073,Chan Chun Sing,"We recognise that some companies with unviable businesses might have been able to stay afloat in the near-term by benefiting from some of the support measures. However, the temporary nature of the broad-based support given means that any reprieve enjoyed by such companies would only have been for a short time. This is especially since we constantly review our measures to ensure that they are relevant for the situation."
2020-10-05-T-034-S-01074,2020-10-05-T-034,1074,Chan Chun Sing,"In particular, over the past few months, it has become clear that the economic downturn will be prolonged. The economy emerging from the crisis will also look very different. Rather than sustaining businesses, we need to help them adapt to the new environment. There are broadly three types of companies."
2020-10-05-T-034-S-01075,2020-10-05-T-034,1075,Chan Chun Sing,"The first type of companies still have the opportunity to grow. For these companies, we will look to spur them on to grow further, so that they will create more jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans as they flourish."
2020-10-05-T-034-S-01076,2020-10-05-T-034,1076,Chan Chun Sing,"The second type of companies comprise those that have suffered a drop in demand, but will eventually recover. We will help them preserve their core capabilities as they tide through this difficult period, so that they will be well-positioned to emerge stronger once the economy recovers."
2020-10-05-T-034-S-01077,2020-10-05-T-034,1077,Chan Chun Sing,"The third type of companies comprise those that have seen their business conditions changed permanently. We will provide support to them to pivot to new products and markets. At the same time, our SkillsFuture and Adapt and Grow initiatives will help the workers in such companies reskill and find jobs in new areas. Even with this support, some businesses will inevitably have to cease."
2020-10-05-T-034-S-01078,2020-10-05-T-034,1078,Chan Chun Sing,"By taking this approach, we will be able to reallocate resources, labour, and skills to support those parts of the economy that are still growing, while preserving the core capabilities of our companies that are going through difficult times. This will give us the best chance to create the largest number of jobs for Singaporeans in a fiscally sustainable and efficient manner."
2020-10-05-T-035-S-01079,2020-10-05-T-035,1079,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether receiving the COVID-19 Support Grant and grants under Self-Employed Income Relief Scheme will result in a reduction of ComCare assistance to be received; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider allowing ComCare clients to receive their existing ComCare assistance together with COVID-related financial assistance.
2020-10-05-T-035-S-01080,2020-10-05-T-035,1080,Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how can families facing prolonged periods of unemployment be supported beyond the current ComCare scheme for financial assistance; and (b) whether the COVID-19 Support Grant can evolve to some form of unemployment support.
2020-10-05-T-035-S-01081,2020-10-05-T-035,1081,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"ComCare beneficiaries receive a package of assistance which may include cash assistance for their daily living expenses and assistance with their household and medical bills. To provide existing Comcare beneficiaries with longer runway to regain stability during this economic downturn, MSF has automatically extended the duration of their ComCare assistance by six months. This applies to ComCare households whose assistance is due for review by October this year. New ComCare beneficiaries this period will also generally receive at least six months of assistance, to give them a longer runway to regain stability."
2020-10-05-T-035-S-01082,2020-10-05-T-035,1082,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Since they receive comprehensive support, ComCare clients are not eligible for the COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) to avoid duplicating support for the same purposes. For the same reason, ComCare beneficiaries who receive support under the Self-Employed Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) will have their ComCare assistance adjusted downwards to take into account SIRS support. This approach minimises overlap in government assistance and preserves resources to help those with greater needs. ComCare beneficiaries who have a change in financial circumstances, such as losing their jobs or income, can inform the Social Service Office (SSO) and request for a review of their ComCare assistance. The SSO will assess their new circumstances and adjust the ComCare support quantum as needed."
2020-10-05-T-035-S-01083,2020-10-05-T-035,1083,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"ComCare beneficiaries continue to benefit from other COVID-related government budget support schemes that are broad-based for all Singaporeans, such as the Care and Support Package and Solidarity Payment. These are on top of the ComCare assistance they currently receive."
2020-10-05-T-035-S-01084,2020-10-05-T-035,1084,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Government has introduced the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package which will support close to 100,000 jobseekers. The package aims to expand job, traineeship and skills training opportunities to support Singaporeans affected by the economic impact of COVID-19. Employees from lower- and middle-income families who involuntarily lose their jobs, are placed on No-Pay-Leave (NPL) or experience at least 30% loss of employment income may apply for CSG. The CSG application window has been extended to December 2020."
2020-10-05-T-035-S-01085,2020-10-05-T-035,1085,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Government will continue to monitor the labour market situation and study how to continue supporting vulnerable workers beyond 2020.
2020-10-05-T-036-S-01086,2020-10-05-T-036,1086,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Ministry will consider extending the Development Support and Learning Support Programme to children who are differently abled at the nursery levels.
2020-10-05-T-036-S-01087,2020-10-05-T-036,1087,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Development Support (DS) and Learning Support (LS) Programme is one of a suite of programmes which provides additional developmental support for preschool children. The DS-LS Progamme is currently designed to support preschool children aged 5 and 6 identified with mild developmental delays or learning needs. The DS-LS programme is currently offered at about 550 preschools. Children on the DS-LS programme are given the necessary support such as pull-out sessions with Learning Support Educators or therapists to address their developmental and learning needs.
2020-10-05-T-036-S-01088,2020-10-05-T-036,1088,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For the younger nursery children, there are issues of whether identifying children with mild developmental delays or learning needs at these earlier ages is appropriate and if intervention via the existing DS-LS programme is suitable. ECDA is studying these issues with agencies."
2020-10-05-T-036-S-01089,2020-10-05-T-036,1089,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For nursery children with clearer moderate to severe developmental delays, preschools can already identify and refer these children to KKH and National University Hospital as well as the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC) where more intensive support can be provided."
2020-10-05-T-036-S-01090,2020-10-05-T-036,1090,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"At the same time, ECDA is scaling up KidSTART to support more low-income families with the development of their children from birth. This will support the development of these children from these families, regardless of whether there are development delays."
2020-10-05-T-036-S-01091,2020-10-05-T-036,1091,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Taking ECDA's KidSTART programme, DS-LS programme and the EIPIC programme together, these form the range of assistance available to provide additional developmental support for preschool-age children and their families."
2020-10-05-T-037-S-01092,2020-10-05-T-037,1092,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) how does the new Grants Governance Framework and rules issued by the Ministry to all agencies differ from the existing framework currently adopted; and (b) how does the Ministry plan to ensure consistent implementation across agencies.
2020-10-05-T-037-S-01093,2020-10-05-T-037,1093,Heng Swee Keat,"The new Grants Governance Framework sets out clear rules and provides guidance on the entire grants management process. It systematically covers the different stages of the grant life-cycle – from grant design, approval and disbursement, to monitoring and anomaly detection. Emphasis is placed on the importance of proper planning and risk management, so as to ensure effective use of public funds and to safeguard against fraud and abuse."
2020-10-05-T-037-S-01094,2020-10-05-T-037,1094,Heng Swee Keat,The rules are supplemented by a good practice guide that provides helpful examples and practical advice. These measures aim to raise the standard of grants administration across all agencies.
2020-10-05-T-037-S-01095,2020-10-05-T-037,1095,Heng Swee Keat,"This new framework brings together in one document the guidelines on grants administration that were previously in different documents. The framework also addresses the gaps identified through a multi-agency review of grants management which was completed last year, as well as learning points from the thematic audits of our grant schemes undertaken by the Auditor-General's Office. For example, we have strengthened the supervisory measures for third-party grants administrators and the use of intermediaries."
2020-10-05-T-037-S-01096,2020-10-05-T-037,1096,Heng Swee Keat,"MOF has taken steps to ensure consistent implementation across agencies. We have communicated the new framework widely and at different levels. For instance, MOF consulted various stakeholders involved in operations, internal audit, and finance across many agencies in developing the framework. This ensures that the rules and guidelines are written in a way that the agencies understand easily, so that they are clear on how to implement them. Agencies also subject their grants to regular audits as part of overall governance to ensure compliance with the rules."
2020-10-05-T-037-S-01097,2020-10-05-T-037,1097,Heng Swee Keat,"In addition, as agencies' senior management play an important role in setting the right tone on grants governance and adherence to guidelines, MOF has briefed all Permanent Secretaries, Heads of Government Agencies, and Directors of Finance. We will continue our active engagements with grant practitioners and the internal audit community on the rules and good practices."
2020-10-05-T-037-S-01098,2020-10-05-T-037,1098,Heng Swee Keat,"Finally, the new framework also aims to promote simpler and consistent ways of administering grants, so that our citizens and businesses, especially the SMEs can benefit when they need to apply for different grants. MOF will continue to monitor the implementation of the grants governance framework, and look out for further practical ways to improve it."
2020-10-05-T-038-S-01099,2020-10-05-T-038,1099,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the number of COVID-19 cases from the crew of ships visiting Singapore port waters in the last six months; and (b) what are the COVID-19 safety measures required for all workmen, ship agents' or ship suppliers' personnel and other persons boarding commercial vessels visiting Singapore port waters."
2020-10-05-T-038-S-01100,2020-10-05-T-038,1100,Ong Ye Kung,"Let me first explain that it is essential for ships and their crew to call at Singapore’s port. We are a major international port, and thousands of ships call at the Port of Singapore every month to deliver goods into our country, bring out exported goods, and ensure that the global supply chain remains undisrupted. Inevitably, some crew members will be infected with COVID-19 and become imported cases in Singapore."
2020-10-05-T-038-S-01101,2020-10-05-T-038,1101,Ong Ye Kung,"Since March 2020, there were a total of 21 COVID-19 positive cases from the crew of three ships that visited Singapore’s port waters. Two COVID-19 positive cases were also detected amongst shore-based personnel. They boarded one of the three ships and got infected, unfortunately. Based on Maritime and Port Authority's (MPA) investigations, the two personnel had consumed meals that were prepared onboard the ship with the ship's crew, using shared utensils. Fortunately, they have since recovered."
2020-10-05-T-038-S-01102,2020-10-05-T-038,1102,Ong Ye Kung,"The precautionary measures for shore-based personnel boarding ships in Singapore’s port waters are stated in two MPA Port Marine Circulars. These measures go beyond the guidelines issued by the International Maritime Organization and the World Health Organization. They include wearing of masks at all times; donning of additional personal protective equipment such as gloves, goggles, and surgical gowns except in situations where doing so jeopardises operational and personal safety; minimising time spent on the ship to reduce the risk of infection; and maintaining a safe distance of at least two metres when on board. Crew on board the vessels must also observe similar precautionary measures, when shore-based personnel are on board."
2020-10-05-T-038-S-01103,2020-10-05-T-038,1103,Ong Ye Kung,"In addition, since September 2020, MPA has progressively rolled out Rostered Routine Testing for shore-based personnel who frequently board ships. Port workers, pilots, surveyors, cargo officers as well as launch and supply boat operators are tested once every 14 days for COVID-19. To date, around 1,200 have been tested and all have tested negative for COVID-19."
2020-10-05-T-038-S-01104,2020-10-05-T-038,1104,Ong Ye Kung,"MPA will continue to update its Port Marine Circulars when required, as the pandemic situation evolves."
2020-10-05-T-039-S-01105,2020-10-05-T-039,1105,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) in each of the last five years, how many tonnes and what percentage of Singapore's recyclable waste has been exported; and (b) how does the Ministry ensure that the exported recyclable waste ultimately gets recycled instead of being incinerated or deposited in landfills overseas."
2020-10-05-T-039-S-01106,2020-10-05-T-039,1106,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We exported about 1,889,000 tonnes of recyclable waste in 2015, 1,757,000 tonnes in 2016, 1,637,000 tonnes in 2017, 1,579,000 tonnes in 2018 and 1,439,000 tonnes in 2019. This corresponds to 41% of Singapore’s total waste recycled in 2015, 37% in 2016, 35% in 2017, 33% in 2018 and 34% in 2019."
2020-10-05-T-039-S-01107,2020-10-05-T-039,1107,Grace Fu Hai Yien,
2020-10-05-T-039-S-01108,2020-10-05-T-039,1108,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Ferrous and non-ferrous metals, paper and cardboard waste made up about 90% of the total amount of recyclables exported in 2019. These recyclables have commercial value and fetch competitive prices when exported."
2020-10-05-T-039-S-01109,2020-10-05-T-039,1109,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Recyclables that are contaminated with hazardous or other wastes, are governed by the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal (Basel Convention), which is a Multilateral Environmental Agreement that regulates the import, export and transit of hazardous wastes and other wastes."
2020-10-05-T-039-S-01110,2020-10-05-T-039,1110,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Our companies are regularly reminded about Singapore’s obligations under the Basel Convention, and NEA will investigate and enforce against any violations. While we are aware of the countries where our recyclables are exported to, we do not have information on how the recyclables are processed and treated in the countries of import, or if they are further exported. We are unable to gather data from companies that are outside our jurisdiction."
2020-10-05-T-039-S-01111,2020-10-05-T-039,1111,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Recyclables have an intrinsic value. The value is a function of the value of the recycled material, the market price of its substitute, and the cost of recycling, including transportation to an export destination. If there is no export market for it, or if the cost of recycling outweighs the value of the recycled product, the waste collector may choose not to collect the recyclables but to treat them as general waste and send them to the incineration plant. Therefore, my Ministry recognises the need to build up our local recycling capabilities. For example, we are working with the private sector to develop mechanical recycling solutions to turn waste plastics into plastic pellets for manufacturing new products. And chemical recycling to process contaminated plastics that cannot be mechanically recycled. For e-waste, we are developing capabilities to recycle Large Household Appliances, ICT products, batteries and lamps to support the upcoming e-waste Extended Producer Responsibility framework. This will allow us to better extract resources from waste and close our waste loops locally through a circular economy approach."
2020-10-05-T-040-S-01112,2020-10-05-T-040,1112,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether he can provide an update on (i) the expansion of our domestic waste recycling industry and (ii) NEA's study on e-waste and plastics recycling solutions and technologies and its assessment of their suitability for local adoption; and (b) whether there has been a cost-benefit analysis of exporting recyclables versus owning the capabilities to process them, considering the carbon footprint of transport and the environmental impact on developing countries that import recyclable waste."
2020-10-05-T-040-S-01113,2020-10-05-T-040,1113,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"My Ministry recognises the need for Singapore to build local recycling capabilities. The National Environment Agency (NEA) commissioned a recycling landscape study in 2018, which found that it was feasible to develop domestic recycling capabilities for both e-waste and plastic waste. These recommendations provided the inputs to our circular economy approach outlined in the Zero Waste Masterplan that we launched in 2019. The Masterplan will enable us to better extract resources from waste, and create economic opportunities and good jobs for Singaporeans."
2020-10-05-T-040-S-01114,2020-10-05-T-040,1114,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We are making good progress in developing local recycling capabilities, working with the private sector. Over the next three years, we expect three new e-waste recycling facilities to be set up that will allow us to recycle more than 64,000 tonnes of e-waste per year. At the same time, we are working with research institutes and companies to develop solutions in treating and recycling e-waste in a more energy-efficient and eco-friendly manner. For example, the NTU Singapore-CEA1 Alliance for Research in Circular Economy (SCARCE) is developing innovative solutions to treat and recover resources from e-waste like lithium ion batteries and silicon solar panels, and finding ways to detoxify and recycle plastic parts in e-waste."
2020-10-05-T-040-S-01115,2020-10-05-T-040,1115,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We are also exploring mechanical recycling and chemical recycling solutions for plastics with industry players. Chemical recycling is an added option to process contaminated plastics that cannot be mechanically recycled. More recycling capabilities are expected to evolve with our upcoming Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework for packaging waste, including plastics. To recover more plastics from our waste for recycling, NEA is also conducting a feasibility study for a pilot Plastic Recovery Facility (PRF). If feasible, the pilot PRF will be the first such facility built by the government."
2020-10-05-T-040-S-01116,2020-10-05-T-040,1116,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We have not done a cost-benefit analysis to compare exporting recyclables with processing them locally. While we are aware of the countries where our recyclables are exported to, we do not have information on how the recyclables are processed and treated in the countries of import, or if they are further exported. We are unable to gather data from companies that are outside our jurisdiction. Nevertheless, we are committed to building up our local capabilities to treat and close our waste loops locally, where feasible, both physically and economically, to enhance our resource resilience. As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, we are vulnerable to global supply chain disruption, including disruption to cross-border flow of our recyclables for recycling. As such, my Ministry and the NEA will continue to work closely with all stakeholders to strengthen our local recycling capabilities."
2020-10-05-T-041-S-01117,2020-10-05-T-041,1117,Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider subsidising dengue vaccines for persons who have had prior dengue infection as affordability is one of the reasons for people not vaccinating against re-infection.
2020-10-05-T-041-S-01118,2020-10-05-T-041,1118,Gan Kim Yong,"Dengvaxia, which is currently the only licensed dengue vaccine, has been approved by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) for the prevention of dengue in individuals age 12 to 45 years living in endemic areas. The vaccine is not suitable for those who have not been previously infected. The World Health Organization recommends that countries considering vaccination as part of a dengue control programme undertake pre-vaccination screening, to avoid vaccinating those who are unsuited. If screening is not feasible, vaccination can be considered in areas with a prevalence of at least 80% by nine years of age."
2020-10-05-T-041-S-01119,2020-10-05-T-041,1119,Gan Kim Yong,"Singapore has a low dengue prevalence at 7% for individuals below 18 years of age. Among adults age 18 to 74 years, the prevalence is 45%, still below the threshold for population vaccination without screening. In view of this, the Ministry of Health's Expert Committee on Immunisation (ECI) has advised that Dengvaxia is not an effective means to control dengue at the population level. Individuals who wish to be vaccinated should first consult their doctor on whether Dengvaxia is appropriate for them. As such, it has not been included in the national immunisation schedules and is not eligible for government subsidy."
2020-10-05-T-041-S-01120,2020-10-05-T-041,1120,Gan Kim Yong,MOH will continue to monitor the development of the dengue vaccines and review regularly whether they should be included in the schedules.
2020-10-05-T-041-S-01121,2020-10-05-T-041,1121,Gan Kim Yong,"Given the limitations of the available vaccine, vector control remains the most effective way to prevent the spread of dengue. We advise Singaporeans to continue with the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout to remove breeding sites at home and protect themselves from mosquito bites through the use of preventive measures such as the use of insect repellents and mosquito coils."
2020-10-05-T-042-S-01122,2020-10-05-T-042,1122,Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the average level of COVID-19 testing per day for the last month; (b) what is the expected timeline for reaching the target of 40,000 tests per day announced in May 2020; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider publishing the number of tests conducted per day."
2020-10-05-T-042-S-01123,2020-10-05-T-042,1123,Gan Kim Yong,"COVID-19 testing is a key enabler in the Government’s overall efforts to fight COVID-19. In September 2020, we tested an average of 27,200 individuals per day for COVID-19 using diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. This is approximately 4,700 individuals PCR tested per million total population each day. PCR testing is done using a combination of standard and pooled testing as the circumstances allow."
2020-10-05-T-042-S-01124,2020-10-05-T-042,1124,Gan Kim Yong,"We are on track to have a testing capacity of 40,000 tests a day by November 2020."
2020-10-05-T-042-S-01125,2020-10-05-T-042,1125,Gan Kim Yong,"To provide regular updates on the number of individuals tested, MOH already publishes information on the total number of swabs conducted and total number of unique persons swabbed on MOH's website every Tuesday."
2020-10-05-T-043-S-01126,2020-10-05-T-043,1126,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry and SkillsFuture Singapore will consider embarking on a detailed study together with tripartite partners and academia on (i) the efficacy of current Continuing Education and Training (CET) Schemes in supporting placement, progression and upward social mobility and (ii) the future skills and CET required in the next three to five years across the new and growth sectors/industries."
2020-10-05-T-043-S-01127,2020-10-05-T-043,1127,Lawrence Wong,MOE and Skills Future Singapore (SSG) collaborate with many stakeholders to study the impact of the SkillsFuture movement and initiatives.
2020-10-05-T-043-S-01128,2020-10-05-T-043,1128,Lawrence Wong,"For example, SSG has set up the Workforce Development Applied Research Fund (WDARF) to encourage inter-disciplinary research in the area of workforce development and lifelong learning, and to evaluate the impact of Continuing Education and Training (CET) and lifelong learning policies and programmes. For future skills, SSG has also been undertaking various studies to better understand the needs of new growth areas, so that we can design more effective CET programmes."
2020-10-05-T-043-S-01129,2020-10-05-T-043,1129,Lawrence Wong,SSG works closely with many partners in such research. We will be happy to commission more detailed studies together with unions and employers in the suggested areas.
2020-10-05-T-044-S-01130,2020-10-05-T-044,1130,Tin Pei Ling,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information what is the projected gap in digital talent supply and demand in Singapore over the next one year, three years and five years respectively."
2020-10-05-T-044-S-01131,2020-10-05-T-044,1131,S Iswaran,"Digital technology (tech) jobs are in high demand across all sectors of our economy. Over the last three years, tech talent in Singapore has grown by about 10,000 year-on-year. In light of COVID-19, the urgency for companies to digitalise and transform has only accelerated, which will intensify demand for people who can perform these jobs."
2020-10-05-T-044-S-01132,2020-10-05-T-044,1132,S Iswaran,"Notwithstanding the current global economic crisis, net job creation for tech roles remains positive in our economy. In mid-September 2020, there were nearly 10,000 tech-related job postings on WSG’s MyCareersFuture web portal alone. In addition, the Government is partnering industry to create another 6,800 jobs, traineeships and skills opportunities over the course of the year via IMDA’s TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) and WSG’s SGUnited Jobs and Skills initiatives. Fresh graduates from our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), and aspiring mid-career professionals keen to pursue a tech career, will benefit from these opportunities."
2020-10-05-T-044-S-01133,2020-10-05-T-044,1133,S Iswaran,"Over the longer term, we expect the demand for tech talent to continue outstripping supply. We have made deliberate efforts to widen our tech talent pipeline by expanding our Pre-Employment Training (PET) intake in IHLs and investing in Continuing Education and Training (CET) programmes led by IMDA and WSG. Over the next three years, our PET pipeline from IHLs will generate around 20,000 local tech talent supplemented by at least 6,250 from place-and-train CET programmes, to keep pace with growing demand, in functions such as Digital Marketing, Software Engineering, and Cybersecurity. Of these 6,250 opportunities, IMDA aims to place some 2,500 mid-career professionals aged 40 and above in good tech jobs."
2020-10-05-T-044-S-01134,2020-10-05-T-044,1134,S Iswaran,"The Government is committed to working with companies to create good career progression opportunities for Singaporeans. We urge Singaporeans to likewise invest in themselves and take advantage of these skills training opportunities, so that they can participate in the digital economy, and stay competitive in this dynamic landscape."
2020-10-05-T-045-S-01135,2020-10-05-T-045,1135,Sharael Taha,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether a study has been commissioned to understand the impact of a work-from-home norm on demand for commercial rental property; and (b) if so, whether there are any measures being explored to soften the impact on the market."
2020-10-05-T-045-S-01136,2020-10-05-T-045,1136,Chan Chun Sing,"Working from home has become more prevalent in recent years, due to technological advances and corporate policies. COVID-19 has accelerated this trend. The Government has not commissioned a study into the impact of working from home on commercial rental property. Nevertheless, we are monitoring vacancy rates and rentals carefully in order to calibrate the supply of commercial properties in line with changes in demand."
2020-10-05-T-046-S-01137,2020-10-05-T-046,1137,Lim Wee Kiak,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment how can Singapore leverage on the work-from-home trend to promote adoption of greater personal acceptance and responsibility for recycling and reducing waste.
2020-10-05-T-046-S-01138,2020-10-05-T-046,1138,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In view of the work-from-home trend, NEA has stepped up engagement to encourage the community to adopt good 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) habits. Additional emphasis has been placed on actions which can be taken by those working from home. These include bringing reusable food containers for takeaway; not opting for disposable cutlery; avoiding food waste by ordering and cooking the right amounts; storing any unfinished cooked food properly for safe consumption later; and emptying and cleaning recyclables before placing them in the blue recycling bins."
2020-10-05-T-046-S-01139,2020-10-05-T-046,1139,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Last month, NEA launched the second run of the ""Say YES to Waste Less"" campaign together with partners to encourage consumers to reduce food wastage and consumption of disposables. We are heartened that 95 partners have come on board, an increase from 59 partners last year. These include food delivery service platforms, which have seen increased demand in recent months as more people work from home, as well as operators of major food and beverage (F&B) outlets, malls and retail chains, hotels, schools, and non-government organisations. In all, they cover more than 2,100 premises, an increase from the 1,600 premises last year."
2020-10-05-T-046-S-01140,2020-10-05-T-046,1140,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Our partners have rolled out several initiatives. For example, by making opting out of receiving disposable cutlery the default option, prompting customers to ask for smaller food portions or consider if they need a bag, and offering incentives for customers who bring their own reusables."
2020-10-05-T-046-S-01141,2020-10-05-T-046,1141,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We also recently started a Citizens' Workgroup to co-create solutions with members of the public to reduce the excessive consumption of disposables. We look forward to hearing participants’ ideas on how we can reduce the use of disposables, whether working from home or at our workplaces."
2020-10-05-T-047-S-01142,2020-10-05-T-047,1142,Don Wee,asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry will consider removing the annotation symbol from the PSLE certificates of those candidates who have been granted access arrangements during the PSLE such as extra time allowance.
2020-10-05-T-047-S-01143,2020-10-05-T-047,1143,Lawrence Wong,Examinations are meant to certify the academic achievements of candidates and are administered under a set of standardised conditions. This is to ensure a fair examination and that examination results can be compared meaningfully across candidates.
2020-10-05-T-047-S-01144,2020-10-05-T-047,1144,Lawrence Wong,"For students with Special Educational Needs or medical conditions, standardised testing conditions may result in them being given an inadequate assessment of their abilities or being unable to take the examinations altogether. To cater to these candidates, the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) provides access arrangements, which may range from exemption from specific components of the examination and provision of extra time, to provision of a separate room or enlarged print."
2020-10-05-T-047-S-01145,2020-10-05-T-047,1145,Lawrence Wong,"When access arrangements have been granted, SEAB’s policy is to annotate on the examination certificate only when there are significant modifications of the examination. This is done to indicate factually that the candidate has taken the examination under conditions that are different from the standard prescribed conditions, and to uphold the integrity and fairness of the examination."
2020-10-05-T-047-S-01146,2020-10-05-T-047,1146,Lawrence Wong,"A student's progression to secondary education will not be affected by the annotation, as school postings do not take such annotations into account."
2020-10-05-T-048-S-01147,2020-10-05-T-048,1147,Cheng Li Hui,"asked the Minister for Health (a) in the past three years, how many babies have been born through the use of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF); (b) what is the success rate of IVF when using fresh, versus frozen, eggs; and (c) what are the current measures to help couples address infertility issues."
2020-10-05-T-048-S-01148,2020-10-05-T-048,1148,Gan Kim Yong,"From 2016 to 2018, 4,673 babies were born through the use of assisted reproduction technology (ART)."
2020-10-05-T-048-S-01149,2020-10-05-T-048,1149,Gan Kim Yong,International scientific literature shows that the success rates for fresh and frozen eggs are largely comparable.
2020-10-05-T-048-S-01150,2020-10-05-T-048,1150,Gan Kim Yong,"MOH has recently enhanced support for couples in meeting their parenthood aspirations. Earlier this year, we removed the age limit of 45 years old for women to undergo ART treatments, and removed the cap on the number of ART cycles for all women."
2020-10-05-T-048-S-01151,2020-10-05-T-048,1151,Gan Kim Yong,"Government co-funding for up to six ART cycles and three cycles of intrauterine insemination (IUI) procedure is also available to defray the out-of-pocket costs for eligible couples at public AR centres. In addition, couples can use MediSave to pay for assisted conception procedures, which include both ART and IUI, at all AR centres."
2020-10-05-T-049-S-01152,2020-10-05-T-049,1152,Cheng Li Hui,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether he can provide an update on the issue of social egg freezing; (b) whether the Ministry has reviewed its policy to extend this procedure to everyone, and not only to certain individuals based on medical grounds; and (c) whether the Ministry is aware that a growing number of Singaporeans are going overseas to have their eggs or sperm preserved."
2020-10-05-T-049-S-01153,2020-10-05-T-049,1153,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Government supports and encourages Singaporeans to fulfil their marriage and parenthood goals as early as possible, to increase the chances of conceiving naturally and reduce age-related problems. Currently, licensed assisted reproduction centres in Singapore are only allowed to freeze eggs when there are medical reasons. For instance, before a woman undergoes chemotherapy treatment that will adversely affect her ability to have a child."
2020-10-05-T-049-S-01154,2020-10-05-T-049,1154,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Some have asked that egg freezing procedures be extended beyond medical grounds. We are carefully reviewing this. Social egg freezing may benefit some women because of their personal circumstances, for example, they may not be able to find a partner when they are younger, but may want to preserve their chances of conceiving if they marry later."
2020-10-05-T-049-S-01155,2020-10-05-T-049,1155,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"However, we also have to take into account the ethical and social concerns over legalising social egg freezing, including inadvertently causing more to delay marriage or parenthood based on a misperception that they can have a child whenever they wish to. The risks of developing complications during pregnancy also increase with age, even if the child is conceived through a frozen egg."
2020-10-05-T-049-S-01156,2020-10-05-T-049,1156,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Ministry does not track or have information on the number of Singaporeans going overseas to have their eggs or sperm preserved.
2020-10-05-T-050-S-01157,2020-10-05-T-050,1157,Cheng Li Hui,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, whether there has been a significant increase in the adoption rate of Government-wide digitalisation initiatives; (b) how does the Government intend to capitalise on this opportune timing to push ahead with digitalisation and introduce new projects; and (c) whether there are plans to allocate additional funding to support and encourage Singaporeans to be more digital savvy."
2020-10-05-T-050-S-01158,2020-10-05-T-050,1158,S Iswaran,"COVID-19 has underscored the imperative for Singapore to digitalise. The Government is committed to support businesses and individuals on their digitalisation journey, no matter their starting point."
2020-10-05-T-050-S-01159,2020-10-05-T-050,1159,S Iswaran,"Since March, digital adoption rates have increased significantly. PayNow NRIC registrations have increased by 410,000, while PayNow mobile registrations have grown by 200,000. About 25,000 enterprises are now registered on the Nationwide E-invoicing Network, up from 1,000 in March 2020. With an enhanced Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG), more than 4,600 SMEs have adopted technologies to enforce public health safety requirements and adapt to remote work. Under the Grow Digital initiative, 1,400 enterprises are tapping into overseas markets through pre-approved e-commerce platforms."
2020-10-05-T-050-S-01160,2020-10-05-T-050,1160,S Iswaran,"Beyond accelerating economy-wide digital transformation in the immediate term, we will invest in innovation to catalyse new products, services and business models. This includes collaborating with academia and industry to strengthen research and development (R&D) outcomes. We will develop capabilities of local enterprises and workers, to be more competitive and create economic value for Singapore, in areas such as data, AI, cybersecurity, immersive media and 5G."
2020-10-05-T-050-S-01161,2020-10-05-T-050,1161,S Iswaran,"The Government will continue to digitise services for convenient citizen access to government services. For example, the recent Primary 1 registration exercise was done fully online."
2020-10-05-T-050-S-01162,2020-10-05-T-050,1162,S Iswaran,"As the Government positions our economy for the future, we are equally committed to ensuring that vulnerable segments, including low-income families, seniors and small businesses, are well supported."
2020-10-05-T-050-S-01163,2020-10-05-T-050,1163,S Iswaran,"To this end, we established the SG Digital Office (SDO) and mobilised 1,000 Digital Ambassadors to drive e-payment adoption under the Hawkers Go Digital programme and equip seniors with digital skills under the Seniors Go Digital programme. More than 7,600 stallholders now offer the SGQR Unified e-Payment solution, and over 28,000 seniors have been trained."
2020-10-05-T-050-S-01164,2020-10-05-T-050,1164,S Iswaran,"To support home-based learning needs, IMDA enhanced the NEU PC Plus programme, to subsidise a second computer for larger low-income families with school-going children. More than 10,000 households have benefitted in the past nine months; double the 2019 total. An additional 7,000 low-income households and seniors have further benefited from subsidised broadband, devices or mobile data through the Home Access and the Mobile Access for Seniors schemes."
2020-10-05-T-050-S-01165,2020-10-05-T-050,1165,S Iswaran,"These efforts reflect the Government’s strong commitment to support our businesses and Singaporeans to thrive in a digital environment. We will continue to review and refine our efforts, to ensure that all Singaporeans will benefit in our shared digital future."
2020-10-05-T-050-S-01166,2020-10-05-T-050,1166,S Iswaran,
2020-10-05-T-051-S-01167,2020-10-05-T-051,1167,Sylvia Lim,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether the Government, as a major investor in Government-linked companies, uses its shareholder influence to persuade investee companies to prioritise Singaporean jobs during any mass retrenchment exercise."
2020-10-05-T-051-S-01168,2020-10-05-T-051,1168,Heng Swee Keat,"As Members of the House are aware, GIC and Temasek operate independently from the Government. The Government maintains an arm’s-length relationship with these investment entities, and neither directs nor influences their commercial or operational decisions. The same applies for the portfolio companies they invest in, whether in Singapore or otherwise. This is an important governance principle that we have carefully safeguarded over the years, which has helped to instill strong commercial discipline in the way they manage their investments."
2020-10-05-T-051-S-01169,2020-10-05-T-051,1169,Heng Swee Keat,"Since the start of COVID-19, the Government has been doing all it can to support jobs for Singaporeans. Our measures apply to all jobs in Singapore, including those in the investee companies."
2020-10-05-T-051-S-01170,2020-10-05-T-051,1170,Heng Swee Keat,"Our efforts to support jobs does not only happen when retrenchment occurs. There are three key prongs to our approach. First, we work with our tripartite partners to stave off job losses. The Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment (Tripartite Advisory) emphasises retrenchment as a last resort, only after employers have exhausted other alternatives such as redeployment and flexible work arrangements. The Government also intervened aggressively upstream to protect jobs when COVID-19 happened, by introducing the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) to support companies in their wage costs. Since the launch of JSS, over $16 billion of payouts have been disbursed, benefitting over two million local workers."
2020-10-05-T-051-S-01171,2020-10-05-T-051,1171,Heng Swee Keat,"COVID-19 is an unprecedented crisis. Even with our best efforts, retrenchments may be inevitable in some companies. Hence, the second prong of our approach is to work closely with our tripartite partners to ensure that retrenchments are conducted responsibly. The Ministry of Manpower has advised employers to adhere to the Tripartite Advisory, and use clear and objective criteria in the selection of employees and conduct the retrenchment responsibly and sensitively."
2020-10-05-T-051-S-01172,2020-10-05-T-051,1172,Heng Swee Keat,"Third, we continue to support job creation and ensure that our workers are ready for these new opportunities. This is done through our Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) efforts and the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package which offers jobs, traineeships and training opportunities. The National Jobs Council, chaired by SM Tharman, is working hard through agencies to implement this package. The Jobs Growth Incentive also aims to encourage companies to frontload their hiring, while our SkillsFuture movement encourages and supports our workers in upskilling and transforming themselves for a post-COVID world."
2020-10-05-T-051-S-01173,2020-10-05-T-051,1173,Heng Swee Keat,"And this is our approach to supporting jobs for Singaporeans across the board, not just in Government-linked companies, and not just for the immediate term through this crisis but also for the longer term, to ensure that employment can be sustained beyond COVID-19."
2020-10-05-T-052-S-01174,2020-10-05-T-052,1174,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Prime Minister whether the Government intends to abolish the Civil Service performance management system of stack ranking.
2020-10-05-T-052-S-01175,2020-10-05-T-052,1175,Chan Chun Sing,The Civil Service seeks to operate a transparent and fair performance management system which rewards officers according to their work contributions.
2020-10-05-T-052-S-01176,2020-10-05-T-052,1176,Chan Chun Sing,"We adopt a system of relative ranking, where an officer's performance is not just assessed by his own supervisor, but also cross-ranked against his peers by a ranking panel comprising direct and indirect supervisors. The system allows us to moderate supervisor subjectivity and establish common and consistent standards of performance assessment, to identify and recognise stronger performing officers. It also correspondingly helps identify weaker performing officers to help them improve their performance."
2020-10-05-T-052-S-01177,2020-10-05-T-052,1177,Chan Chun Sing,"On balance, we find that a system of relative ranking of performance still serves its purpose. Nevertheless, we have also allowed flexibility for deviation where the case merits, depending on the performance of individual officers. We continue to study alternative systems of performance management so that we can ensure our system remains relevant and effective as our operating landscape changes."
2020-10-05-T-053-S-01178,2020-10-05-T-053,1178,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether the Ministry and the Multi-Ministry Task Force on COVID-19 can proactively work with the National Arts Council to come up with proper safe distancing guidelines on outdoor live performances instead of going with a blanket restriction, so that our artistes can make a living."
2020-10-05-T-053-S-01179,2020-10-05-T-053,1179,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The arts and culture community has been significantly affected by COVID-19. The resumption of live performances is important not only to restore a source of livelihood for our arts practitioners, professionals and organisations, but also a way in which the community can contribute to uplifting spirits of Singaporeans."
2020-10-05-T-053-S-01180,2020-10-05-T-053,1180,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Since 19 June 2020, all workplaces in the arts sector have safely resumed operations. Museums and galleries are now also open to visitors. We have taken a cautious approach towards the resumption of activities in the arts and culture sector, particularly on live performances which carry higher transmission risks. Around the world, we have observed COVID-19 clusters forming as a result of such performances. For example, a choir performance in Netherlands resulted in 102 members of the choir falling ill with COVID-19, while in Japan, at least six clusters of cases were linked to performances in music venues."
2020-10-05-T-053-S-01181,2020-10-05-T-053,1181,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"MCCY and National Arts Council (NAC) have been working closely with MOH and other agencies, such as A*STAR, to develop safe management measures and tools that will help ensure the safety of our performers, crews and audiences in the context of live performances. As announced on 21 August 2020, MCCY and NAC are currently conducting live performance pilots at selected indoor and outdoor spaces, to trial the safe management measures that we have developed. Several pilots, including a traditional music performance at the Esplanade Outdoor Theatre, have been completed successfully. The experience of these pilots will allow us to progressively scale-up live performances in both outdoor and indoor spaces. I would therefore like to assure you, Mr Speaker, that MCCY and NAC are working proactively with MOH, through the pilots, on safe management measures to allow outdoor – and indoor – live performances to resume as soon as feasible, even as we continue to prioritise the health and safety of our performers, crew, and audiences."
2020-10-05-T-053-S-01182,2020-10-05-T-053,1182,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I am confident that our arts groups and practitioners will rise to the challenge, and transform how they present and perform their craft as we transit to the new normal. I also seek the public's understanding that the experience of attending a pilot performance will be different from the past, and ask for everyone’s cooperation to abide by the safe management measures, so that we can better enable our arts community to resume their activities over time."
2020-10-05-T-053-S-01183,2020-10-05-T-053,1183,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"NAC and NHB will continue to support our arts and culture groups and practitioners to engage new audiences, and cultivate new ones, in new and innovative ways. We urge members of the public to also continue supporting Singapore's arts and culture – by attending online shows and donating to your favoured groups and artists, to sustain them and help them emerge stronger after COVID-19."
2020-10-05-T-054-S-01184,2020-10-05-T-054,1184,He Ting Ru,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in each of the last five years (a) how many Singaporean families have been eligible for the Kindergarten Fee Assistance Scheme (KiFAS); (b) how many Singaporean families have received assistance under KiFAS; and (c) whether the Government has plans to extend KiFAS to all eligible Singaporean families irrespective of chosen childcare provider, with the same subsidy to be provided to all eligible children."
2020-10-05-T-054-S-01185,2020-10-05-T-054,1185,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Kindergarten Fee Assistance Scheme (KiFAS) is a means-tested subsidy for families with (i) household incomes within the qualifying income ceiling, and (ii) children enrolled in half-day kindergartens run by Anchor Operators and the Ministry of Education (MOE). Families are prompted to apply for the subsidy during enrolment, and all families who meet the criteria for KiFAS will receive KiFAS support upon enrolment and subsidy application."
2020-10-05-T-054-S-01186,2020-10-05-T-054,1186,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"From January 2020, we had raised the qualifying monthly household income ceiling for KiFAS from $6,000 to $12,000 and increased the subsidy amounts, so that more families benefit from KiFAS. The number of children receiving KiFAS has thus increased by one-third, from an annual average of around 9,000 between 2016 and 20191, to 12,000 this year."
2020-10-05-T-054-S-01187,2020-10-05-T-054,1187,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Anchor Operators and MOE Kindergartens offer accessible, affordable and quality programmes, and are well-distributed across various locations in Singapore. Anchor Operator kindergartens are further required to charge no more than $160 per month for half-day kindergarten to ensure affordability, and must meet ECDA's quality requirements. MOE Kindergartens charge similar fees and operate under strict MOE oversight to ensure quality."
2020-10-05-T-054-S-01188,2020-10-05-T-054,1188,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"While we have made efforts to enhance affordability of kindergartens, the priority is to enhance affordability of childcare centres as the majority of children increasingly attend full-day childcare programmes, which better serve families' needs. Childcare subsidies are provided to children enrolled in all ECDA-licensed childcare centres. Children enrolled in childcare programmes receive a universal Basic Subsidy and, if eligible, a means-tested Additional Subsidy. For the Additional Subsidy, we had raised the qualifying household income ceiling to $12,000 from January 2020 to benefit more families. Over the medium term, we aim to further enhance affordability in childcare centres by lowering fee caps."
2020-10-05-T-054-S-01189,2020-10-05-T-054,1189,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Taken together, all childcare centres and Anchor Operator and MOE Kindergartens currently serve more than 85% of Singaporean children enrolled in preschool. The vast majority receive subsidy support."
2020-10-05-T-054-S-01190,2020-10-05-T-054,1190,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Beyond preschool subsidies, parents can tap on the Baby Bonus Cash Gift, as well as the Child Development Account (CDA) First Step grant of $3,000 and government matching contributions, to offset their children's preschool fees."
2020-10-05-T-054-S-01191,2020-10-05-T-054,1191,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Government is committed to investing in early childhood education. Within the next few years, we will double our spending on preschool to over $2 billion per year, up from about $1 billion in 2018. We will continue to improve preschool quality, affordability and accessibility, to ensure that every child has a good start in life."
2020-10-05-T-055-S-01192,2020-10-05-T-055,1192,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,asked the Minister for Transport why does the Government allow the private hire vehicle companies to impose a rule that their drivers take up to a maximum of three passengers only and must leave the front seat empty as it affects both drivers and passengers.
2020-10-05-T-055-S-01193,2020-10-05-T-055,1193,Ong Ye Kung,"While the government has issued advisories and measures to Point-to-Point (P2P) operators to help combat COVID-19, the P2P operators have also introduced additional measures, such as Grab's requirement for the front seat of vehicles be left empty to create a physical distance between drivers and their passengers."
2020-10-05-T-055-S-01194,2020-10-05-T-055,1194,Ong Ye Kung,"LTA respects the decision of the operators, which is to create a physical distance between drivers and their passengers. But they need to make this requirement known upfront to passengers when they are making their bookings. Grab has since lifted this restriction on 2 October 2020."
2020-10-05-T-056-S-01195,2020-10-05-T-056,1195,Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many private hire car operators have participated in the Point-to-Point Support Package (PPSP); (b) what are the amounts disbursed to each of these private hire car operators through the PPSP; and (c) whether any reasons are offered by private hire car operators who decide not to participate in the PPSP.
2020-10-05-T-056-S-01196,2020-10-05-T-056,1196,Ong Ye Kung,"The Point-to-Point Support Package was launched in February this year to help drivers tide over difficult times. In total, the three tranches of the package amounted to more than $300 million. Although it was designed as a Government assistance package for drivers, the taxi and Private Hire Car (PHC) operators have been working with the Government and contributed to the Support Package."
2020-10-05-T-056-S-01197,2020-10-05-T-056,1197,Ong Ye Kung,"For the first tranche of the Support Package between March and May 2020, three operators – Grab, Gojek and Ryde – contributed more than $20 million in total to match the Government's assistance for drivers through commission rebates. However, the PHC operators have stopped matching the Government’s assistance in subsequent tranches. The Ministry of Transport do not fault them, because the Support Package was designed as a Government assistance package to start with, and we appreciate their contribution. Instead, the operators have been helping the Government to disburse Special Relief Fund (SRF) payouts to their drivers. As of 30 September, the Government has disbursed about $45 million in SRF payouts to drivers through Grab, $8 million through Gojek and about $60,000 through Ryde."
2020-10-05-T-057-S-01198,2020-10-05-T-057,1198,Seah Kian Peng,"asked the Minister for National Development whether he can provide an update on the state of major infrastructure projects, specifically the ones that will be postponed or cancelled, if any, given the current economic restructuring that Singapore is going through."
2020-10-05-T-057-S-01199,2020-10-05-T-057,1199,Desmond Lee,"The current economic situation underscores the need to press on with our economic transformation efforts, so that our firms and workers can emerge stronger, and seize new opportunities following this challenging period.  Government agencies responsible for the various economic sector are working closely with their industry partners to review their plans, including for major infrastructure projects.  While some infrastructure projects such as the construction of Changi Airport Terminal 5 have been delayed as a result of COVID-19, the Government remains committed to infrastructure projects that are critical investments for future generations."
2020-10-05-T-058-S-01200,2020-10-05-T-058,1200,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"asked the Minister for National Development whether smart light sensors can be installed in all our common areas, parks and the environment to turn on lights automatically instead of having to manually adjust the timings during certain periods or months when the environment turns dark early."
2020-10-05-T-058-S-01201,2020-10-05-T-058,1201,Desmond Lee,"HDB has implemented the Smart Lighting System (SLS) in all public housing developments with tenders called since May 2018.  The SLS incorporates light sensors to sense ambient lighting levels and automatically turn the lights on when ambient lighting is low, for instance during rainy conditions.  The SLS covers both the indoor and outdoor common areas of the development, including void decks, corridors, and driveways."
2020-10-05-T-058-S-01202,2020-10-05-T-058,1202,Desmond Lee,"Prior to the implementation of the SLS, light sensors would be installed in specific areas that required additional lighting to supplement the lack of natural lighting during bad weather conditions.  However, the area of coverage could not be easily adjusted as this would require re-wiring and the installation of additional sensors.  In contrast, with the SLS, light sensors are integrated with the lighting network, offering the flexibility to easily adjust or even extend the area of coverage to the whole development should the need arise.  HDB is currently working with the Town Councils to extend the SLS to all existing estates under the HDB Green Towns Programme."
2020-10-05-T-058-S-01203,2020-10-05-T-058,1203,Desmond Lee,"For the parks under its management, NParks is currently piloting the use of ambient light sensors to automatically activate lighting at the Singapore Botanic Gardens.  NParks will evaluate the feasibility of a wider implementation of these sensors in parks, based on the outcomes of this trial."
2020-10-05-T-058-S-01204,2020-10-05-T-058,1204,Desmond Lee,Our agencies will continue to explore new technologies that can better meet the needs of our HDB residents and park users and improve sustainability.
2020-10-05-T-059-S-01205,2020-10-05-T-059,1205,Lim Wee Kiak,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether more flexibility can be exercised over MediSave claims for age-related medical treatment such as macular degeneration; and (b) whether the Ministry will review the MediSave limits for the elderly who have a substantial balance in their MediSave accounts so that they need not top up so much cash when paying their bills.
2020-10-05-T-059-S-01206,2020-10-05-T-059,1206,Gan Kim Yong,"Through Government subsidies, MediShield Life, MediSave and MediFund, we ensure that healthcare services remain affordable to Singaporeans. MediSave withdrawal limits are sized to adequately cover the co-payment for the majority of patients in subsidised settings."
2020-10-05-T-059-S-01207,2020-10-05-T-059,1207,Gan Kim Yong,"In recent years, we have enhanced the MediSave withdrawal limits to provide greater flexibility for our seniors in managing age-related medical treatment. We announced earlier this year that the annual limit for patients with complex chronic conditions in the outpatient setting will be raised from $500 to $700 from 1 January 2021. This will help them better meet their needs, as the prevalence and severity of chronic diseases typically increases with age. To better support seniors’ long-term care needs, we have just launched the MediSave Care scheme on 1 October 2020, which allows cash withdrawals of up to $200 per month for severely disabled patients aged 30 and above. We have lowered the age threshold for Flexi-MediSave from 65 to 60, allowing younger and more seniors to benefit from this scheme for their treatments and screenings at polyclinics, Specialist Outpatient Clinics, and GP clinics on the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS). We will continue to review the MediSave withdrawal limits regularly, to strike a balance between helping Singaporeans pay for their healthcare services and retaining sufficient savings for their longer-term needs."
2020-10-05-T-059-S-01208,2020-10-05-T-059,1208,Gan Kim Yong,"Elderly patients who still face difficulty in paying their healthcare bill after subsidies and MediShield Life can apply for further assistance from MediFund/MediFund Silver. For those who are unable to tap on these schemes, the Ministry of Health will consider appeals to use MediSave beyond the prevailing withdrawal limits on a case-by-case basis. No Singaporean will be denied necessary treatment due to an inability to pay."
2020-10-05-T-060-S-01209,2020-10-05-T-060,1209,Jamus Jerome Lim,"asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there has been any study of the differences, over time, between charges by private versus public healthcare providers; (b) whether this has been appreciably altered by the citizen/PR subsidy; and (c) whether the trend of rising costs has accelerated due to greater access to insurance products that reduce the individual cost-sharing burden."
2020-10-05-T-060-S-01210,2020-10-05-T-060,1210,Gan Kim Yong,"Between 2017 and 2019, average inpatient bill sizes in private healthcare settings grew by around 7% on a compounded annual growth rate basis. This was about twice the growth rate of 3.4% for average inpatient bills of unsubsidised patients in ""A"" wards in public healthcare institutions (PHI). Over the same period, average day surgery bills in the private setting grew by 4.3%, compared to 0.6% for unsubsidised PHI patients. As Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents can enjoy government subsidies of up to 80% by opting for affordable care in the PHI setting, it would not be meaningful to compare their charges with those in the private healthcare setting."
2020-10-05-T-060-S-01211,2020-10-05-T-060,1211,Gan Kim Yong,"Some insurance products, such as Integrated Plan (IP) riders with full coverage, which cover the entire co-payment under the IP plan, have contributed to the higher growth rate for private sector bills. While such products are popular because no co-payment is required, the absence of co-payment can inadvertently lead to over-utilisation and rising healthcare costs, and ultimately, higher insurance premiums for all. This is why the Ministry had worked with insurers to introduce a minimum level of co-payment for new IP riders in 2018. This was an important move to preserve the principle of co-payment in our healthcare financing system. This measure will take time to bear fruit. All stakeholders, including patients and medical practitioners, must continue to exercise responsibility when choosing and recommending appropriate and necessary care."
2020-10-05-T-061-S-01212,2020-10-05-T-061,1212,Saktiandi Supaat,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs in light of some children with special needs finding it stressful to abide by COVID-19 regulations, such as mandatory mask wearing (a) what kind of training do police officers receive to equip them to deal with such individuals if they fail to abide by the law; and (b) how can the Police exhibit more empathy towards these individuals, while ensuring that rules are complied with to everyone's interest."
2020-10-05-T-061-S-01213,2020-10-05-T-061,1213,K Shanmugam,"Mask wearing is enforced to protect public health. However, Police officers do exercise flexibility when dealing with vulnerable persons, such as children and persons with special needs."
2020-10-05-T-061-S-01214,2020-10-05-T-061,1214,K Shanmugam,"The officers adopt an advisory approach when engaging such persons and the caregivers, and advise the wearing of face shields if the person has difficulties wearing face masks. They use simple and clear language."
2020-10-05-T-061-S-01215,2020-10-05-T-061,1215,K Shanmugam,"Police officers are equipped with these skills to engage vulnerable persons, as part of their training on general policing."
2020-10-05-T-062-S-01216,2020-10-05-T-062,1216,Sharael Taha,"asked the Minister for Education whether there are any measures in place to (i) assess the quality of training from SkillsFuture training providers and (ii) measure the effectiveness of SkillsFuture courses, through competency or company-based outcome assessments rather than using course attendance and participation."
2020-10-05-T-062-S-01217,2020-10-05-T-062,1217,Lawrence Wong,"To assess the quality of training from funded training providers, SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) conducts surveys immediately after course completion, to gather trainee feedback on the training quality. Follow-up surveys are conducted with trainees six months after completion of the course to ascertain post-training outcomes, such as the ability to apply the skills learnt at work. 86% of the trainees surveyed in 2019 indicated that they were able to perform better at work after undergoing SSG-funded training. The survey results are taken into consideration by SSG during the funding renewal process. Additionally, SSG conducts regular checks and audits on course delivery by training providers."
2020-10-05-T-062-S-01218,2020-10-05-T-062,1218,Lawrence Wong,"We share the member's view that we should focus on the outcomes of training, and go beyond input measures like course attendance and participation. This is why SSG conducts regular surveys with employers to gauge the effectiveness of SkillsFuture training programmes. These include the Public Perception Survey on SkillsFuture, which surveys employers on the impact of SkillsFuture training on the work performance of their employees. Another example is the Work-Study Programme Outcomes Survey, a programme-specific survey which measures employers' satisfaction of the programme and effectiveness of the Work-Study approach in training potential or existing employees."
2020-10-05-T-062-S-01219,2020-10-05-T-062,1219,Lawrence Wong,Certifiable skills training courses that enjoy a higher tier of funding support are examinable and need to demonstrate clear learning outcomes. Trainees who go through courses accredited under the Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) system are required to take competency-based assessments as part of the course requirement.
2020-10-05-T-062-S-01220,2020-10-05-T-062,1220,Lawrence Wong,"We take the quality and outcomes of SkillsFuture training seriously, and will continue to ensure that Singaporeans are well-supported in their lifelong learning journey."
2020-10-05-T-063-S-01221,2020-10-05-T-063,1221,Darryl David,asked the Minister for Education (a) how many companies have participated in the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme (ELP) since it first started; (b) how many companies are currently on the ELP and what is the attrition rate of ELP companies; and (c) what is the percentage of graduates from the ELP who continue to be in full-time employment after the ELP companies have fulfilled their mandatory employment commitments to graduates.
2020-10-05-T-063-S-01222,2020-10-05-T-063,1222,Lawrence Wong,"To date, about 1,400 companies have participated in the SkillsFuture Work-Study Certificate, Work-Study Diploma and Work-Study Post Diploma Programmes, which were formerly known as the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme. This number has steadily increased from the 34 at launch in 2015."
2020-10-05-T-063-S-01223,2020-10-05-T-063,1223,Lawrence Wong,"Currently, 378 companies are on these Work-Study programmes. We do not track the attrition rate of companies, as their participation vary from intake to intake depending on their business outlook and hiring plans. An MOE survey conducted on these programmes that concluded between May 2018 and April 2019 found that 89% of the employers who participated reported that they would continue to participate in the programme. The same survey also found that 87% of the graduates were employed in a full-time permanent job six months after graduation. As of October 2019, 59% of the graduates remained with the company that trained them during the Work-Study Programme."
2020-10-05-T-064-S-01224,2020-10-05-T-064,1224,Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many applicants have been successful in getting their HDB flats under open booking since it was launched (b) how many have decided not to go for flat selection after they obtained their queue number; (c) whether there are flats that still remained unselected under open booking; and (d) whether HDB will be offering more of such open bookings to those who need to get the flat early.
2020-10-05-T-064-S-01225,2020-10-05-T-064,1225,Desmond Lee,"HDB launched the open booking of flats in June 2019. This allows home seekers to apply for a flat online, and get their flat selection appointment on a first-come-first-served basis, which can be as early as the next working day."
2020-10-05-T-064-S-01226,2020-10-05-T-064,1226,Desmond Lee,"HDB has received a total of about 10,500 flat applications through open booking since its launch. More than 1,000 applicants booked a flat, while the remaining 9,500 or so did not."
2020-10-05-T-064-S-01227,2020-10-05-T-064,1227,Desmond Lee,"HDB suspends open booking twice a year to inject a fresh supply of flats. At the most recent suspension on 3 August 2020, 36 units remained unselected, which is less than 5% of the 806 flats made available following the previous injection in March 2020. These unselected flats, together with the fresh flat supply, were made available for online viewing from 2 September 2020. In total, 492 flats were made available for open booking, and home seekers have been able to resume online applications from 9 September onwards."
2020-10-05-T-064-S-01228,2020-10-05-T-064,1228,Desmond Lee,"HDB has been exploring ways to offer more flats through open booking. For example, since February 2020, HDB has ceased the Re-Offer of Balance Flats exercises, so that more of the unselected flats from the Sale of Balance Flats exercises can be offered directly for open booking. HDB will continue to refine its sales processes to better meet the needs of home seekers."
2020-10-05-T-065-S-01229,2020-10-05-T-065,1229,Alex Yam,asked the Minister for National Development with working from home becoming a part of our lifestyle (a) how will this impact HDB's design for future homes to be built; and (b) whether there are plans to turn communal spaces in the neighbourhood into working spaces with Wi-Fi to help those who need a quiet space to work.
2020-10-05-T-065-S-01230,2020-10-05-T-065,1230,Desmond Lee,HDB
2020-10-05-T-065-S-01231,2020-10-05-T-065,1231,Desmond Lee,"HDB flats are also designed to provide flexibility for residents to reconfigure spaces in their homes to meet their needs. For example, columns in new flats are pushed to the edges wherever possible, so that home owners can have more flexibility in reconfiguring their home layout. Many homeowners have personalised their homes through renovation. There are also ways to create workspaces through use of creative furnishing."
2020-10-05-T-065-S-01232,2020-10-05-T-065,1232,Desmond Lee,"We are studying how HDB flats can further support telecommuting – a trend that has been accelerated by the current pandemic. Today, broadband for Wi-Fi ready connections is readily available in all public housing flats, facilitating working and studying from home. HDB is also trialing 'smart-enabled' homes in Punggol Northshore and Tengah so that residents can adopt more smart applications. If feasible, we will incorporate these features into future flats."
2020-10-05-T-065-S-01233,2020-10-05-T-065,1233,Desmond Lee,"We have also made available communal spaces within the neighbourhood which can be used for work. For example, HDB has introduced Community Living Rooms, which are located within the void decks, and some of our Community Clubs (CCs) have opened their spaces for work purposes in recent months. Most of these spaces are equipped with basic amenities such as charging points, and access to Wi-Fi networks."
2020-10-05-T-065-S-01234,2020-10-05-T-065,1234,Desmond Lee,"For residents who require additional amenities, such as meeting rooms with video conferencing facilities, they have the option of using commercially-run co-working spaces available at three public libraries  Jurong Regional Library, Toa Payoh Public Library and Geylang East Public Library."
2020-10-05-T-065-S-01235,2020-10-05-T-065,1235,Desmond Lee,"We will continue to monitor tele-commuting trends, and study ways to convert existing communal spaces into workspaces, as well as to plan and design workspaces upfront in future community facilities."
2020-10-05-T-066-S-01236,2020-10-05-T-066,1236,Seah Kian Peng,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development that given the increasing stresses on families and individuals due to the current COVID-19 and economic crisis, what are the measures adopted to keep families intact and maintain the mental well-being of individuals."
2020-10-05-T-066-S-01237,2020-10-05-T-066,1237,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant disruption to our lives. Many have experienced life stressors, at home and at work, including changes to care arrangements for their dependents, or suffered job or income loss. During this trying period, we are also paying particular attention to vulnerable individuals and families who face more acute challenges in their lives. This crisis has led to emotional, psychological and financial distress for many."
2020-10-05-T-066-S-01238,2020-10-05-T-066,1238,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,
2020-10-05-T-066-S-01239,2020-10-05-T-066,1239,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In the face of crises, we have rallied together stronger as a society. Many citizens have stepped forward as volunteers to proactively reach out to vulnerable persons – ranging from providing for the food and medical needs of isolated seniors, to checking in on the well-being of low-income and other vulnerable households. To offer emotional and mental health support to individuals and families, MSF and MOH jointly set up the National CARE Hotline (NCH) in April 2020, which is manned by trained personnel who provide support to callers impacted psychologically or emotionally by COVID-19. Close to 900 trained volunteers have managed over 27,900 calls to the NCH since its launch, offering callers advice, referrals for specific assistance or just a sympathetic listening ear. MSF also runs other Carelines for Persons Under Quarantine (PUQs) and under Stay-Home-Notice (PSHN), to provide them with emotional support. Aside from providing direct psychological support, callers also received information on and referrals to additional resources where needed."
2020-10-05-T-066-S-01240,2020-10-05-T-066,1240,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,
2020-10-05-T-066-S-01241,2020-10-05-T-066,1241,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Additional stressors during the COVID-19 period may cause domestic friction and potentially family violence. During the Circuit Breaker period, MSF’s Adult and Child Protective Services received about 10% more enquiries on average, compared to before the Circuit Breaker. Most of them were related to family tensions with no incidence of violence. We encourage families to seek and receive help early, so that they do not escalate to violence. Together with our community partners, MSF will continue to keep a close watch on family violence and provide counselling, intervention, and refuge to those in need of services."
2020-10-05-T-066-S-01242,2020-10-05-T-066,1242,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Families facing marital, divorce, and parenting stress can also approach any of our 48 Family Service Centres (FSCs) or an online counselling service set up in April 2020 by MSF with the Community Psychology Hub. In the past five months, this service has supported over 700 clients while the FSCs have seen a stable flow of about 1000 clients for parenting and marital issues during the same period."
2020-10-05-T-066-S-01243,2020-10-05-T-066,1243,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"To help families juggle working from home while caring for their loved ones, Families for Life (FFL) launched the #FFLShareTheCare online video series during Circuit Breaker. The series covers topics such as parenting, relationship and communications, and caring for newborns. These videos have been well received, with 2.4 million views so far. FFL is also offering Triple P online, an evidence-based parenting programme, free of charge. Triple P has been proven to be effective, with parents reporting sustained reduction of around 20% in both their children’s problematic behaviour scores and parenting stress scores three months after completing the programme. FFL will continue to promote family bonding and nurture resilient families through its annual family campaigns."
2020-10-05-T-066-S-01244,2020-10-05-T-066,1244,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"To provide financial support to middle- and lower-income individuals adversely affected by the economic impact of COVID-19, MSF rolled out the Temporary Relief Fund in April 2020 and the COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) in May 2020. We have also introduced greater flexibility for low-income households to qualify for ComCare financial assistance. Existing ComCare beneficiaries whose assistance ends between May and October this year would have their assistance extended by six months automatically. New Comcare recipients have also been provided a longer runway of six months’ assistance to regain stability. These measures have worked with other governmental financial assistance schemes to give much needed urgent support to those facing serious financial stress. Social Service Offices have also been facilitating affected individuals to gain access to broader employment and training opportunities by referring them to the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Programme, overseen by the National Jobs Council (NJC)."
2020-10-05-T-066-S-01245,2020-10-05-T-066,1245,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"With the impact being more acute for low-income families, MSF has accelerated our outreach to the low-income/vulnerable households since June 2020. Volunteers and community partners from our SG Cares Community Networks have been proactively reaching out to the residents, checking in on their well-being and offering additional support where required. In less than three months, close to 900 volunteers and community partners have reached out to about 13,000 households, successfully engaging over 6,300 households and referring about 2,300 households for further help."
2020-10-05-T-066-S-01246,2020-10-05-T-066,1246,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As we continue to fight against COVID-19, many Singaporeans have stepped up to show care and support for one another. We are grateful to many volunteers, community partners and everyday neighbours who have selflessly and tirelessly stepped forward to provide resources, care and support for other Singaporeans. We must continue to look out for one another. Let us continue to stand together, and emerge stronger as one people."
2020-10-05-T-067-S-01247,2020-10-05-T-067,1247,Hany Soh,asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will allow carpooling by taxi operators so as to maximise the usage capacity of each vehicle and also reduce the country's overall carbon footprint.
2020-10-05-T-067-S-01248,2020-10-05-T-067,1248,Ong Ye Kung,"There is no regulation prohibiting taxi operators, and other Point-to-Point (P2P) operators, from pooling passengers and creating a new service. In fact, GrabShare and RydePool are existing services that allow commuters to share a ride on a taxi or a private hire car (PHC) with other passengers heading in the same direction. However, in view of the COVID-19 situation, Grab and Ryde have decided to take precautions to suspend the GrabShare and RydePool services on their own accord."
2020-10-05-T-068-S-01249,2020-10-05-T-068,1249,Jamus Jerome Lim,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry has considered imposing a per-flight environmental tax with regard to SIA's proposed plan to operate ""flights to nowhere""; and (b) whether the Ministry has considered suggesting to SIA to have pilots retain skills via simulators and have flight crews' salaries be further supplemented by the estimated additional environmental costs via a Government subsidy, instead of operating such flights."
2020-10-05-T-068-S-01250,2020-10-05-T-068,1250,Ong Ye Kung,I thank the Member for his questions. I will address them in my reply at the 6 October 2020 Parliament sitting.
2020-10-05-T-069-S-01251,2020-10-05-T-069,1251,Darryl David,asked the Minister for Education what are the plans for National School Games (NSG) competitions and similar school sporting events that are scheduled to take place in the first quarter of 2021.
2020-10-05-T-069-S-01252,2020-10-05-T-069,1252,Lawrence Wong,"The National School Games (NSG) is an integral part of school life for our student athletes. Due to the COVID-19, we had to cancel NSG and other sporting events this year."
2020-10-05-T-069-S-01253,2020-10-05-T-069,1253,Lawrence Wong,MOE is monitoring the COVID-19 situation closely. We plan to resume NSG in 2021 under enhanced Safe Management Measures (SMMs) and are currently working with SportSG on the detailed parameters for the safe conduct of these Games. Key considerations would be to minimise intermingling and contact between student athletes from different schools; provide sufficient spacing at waiting areas; and to strictly adhere to personal hygiene and cleaning protocols. Modifications to some sports may also be required so that students can participate in them safely. We will announce details of the arrangements at a later date.
2020-10-05-T-069-S-01254,2020-10-05-T-069,1254,Lawrence Wong,"In the meantime, schools have resumed some sports co-curricular activities (CCAs) within the current national guidelines for sports. MOE is committed to providing a holistic education for our students while ensuring that our schools remain a safe environment for learning and growth."
2020-10-05-T-070-S-01255,2020-10-05-T-070,1255,Desmond Choo,asked the Prime Minister (a) what is the projected and actual utilisation rate so far for the TraceTogether token; and (b) how will the Ministry safeguard personal data collected from TraceTogether and SafeEntry in light of the users' privacy concerns stemming from the increased risk of cyber-attacks.
2020-10-05-T-070-S-01256,2020-10-05-T-070,1256,Teo Chee Hean,"As of 28 September, we have issued about 101,000 TraceTogether Tokens to members of the public. We will progressively expand the distribution across Singapore so that anyone who wants a TraceTogether Token can collect one from a Community Centre nearest their home."
2020-10-05-T-070-S-01257,2020-10-05-T-070,1257,Teo Chee Hean,"The purpose of the Token is to boost overall community participation in the TraceTogether Programme, particularly for those who are not able to download theTraceTogether App. Currently the overall participation (App and Token) rate of TraceTogether Programme is at around half our population, with TraceTogether Programme participants predominantly on the App as community-wide Token distribution had just commenced. The higher the participation rate, the more effective our digital contact tracing efforts, and the safer we can keep ourselves, our loved ones, and our colleagues."
2020-10-05-T-070-S-01258,2020-10-05-T-070,1258,Teo Chee Hean,"The data collected by the TraceTogether Programme is encrypted and stored only for 25 days on the user's App or Token, after which it is automatically deleted. The encrypted data (of up to 25 days) is kept on the device until the user shares it with MOH for contact tracing in the unfortunate (and hopefully unlikely) circumstance that the user tests positive for COVID-19. Because it is encrypted, even if someone unlawfully extracts the data from the App or the Token, they will not be able to make sense of the data."
2020-10-05-T-070-S-01259,2020-10-05-T-070,1259,Teo Chee Hean,"Personal data collected from the SafeEntry programme is also encrypted, and will only be accessed by the authorities when needed for the purpose of preventing or controlling the transmission of COVID-19."
2020-10-05-T-070-S-01260,2020-10-05-T-070,1260,Teo Chee Hean,"The Government is the custodian of the data submitted by individuals, including those from the TraceTogether and SafeEntry programmes, and stringent measures are in place to safeguard this personal data. Only authorised public officers will have access to the data. Under the Public Sector Governance Act, public officers who recklessly or intentionally disclose the data without authorisation, misuse the data for gain, or re-identify anonymised data without authorisation may be found guilty of an offence and may be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment of up to two years, or both."
2020-10-05-T-071-S-01261,2020-10-05-T-071,1261,Joan Pereira,"asked the Minister for Health for the mental and social well-being of our seniors in nursing homes, whether up to five designated visitors for each nursing home resident can be allowed, instead of two currently, though the current arrangement of only one visitor can visit each day can remain for the safety of our seniors."
2020-10-05-T-071-S-01262,2020-10-05-T-071,1262,Gan Kim Yong,"Seniors residing in nursing homes are typically frail and more vulnerable to complications of COVID-19 infection. To safeguard their health, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has implemented a suite of precautionary measures in nursing homes from the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, including the suspension of face-to-face visitations on 2 April 2020."
2020-10-05-T-071-S-01263,2020-10-05-T-071,1263,Gan Kim Yong,"The limitations on face-to-face visitations has been important in keeping the risk of infections in nursing homes low. However, recognizing that prolonged suspension of visitations will have an adverse impact on the well-being of seniors and their loved ones, MOH has allowed nursing homes to cautiously resume face-to-face visitations in Phase Two from 19 June 2020. Visits were subject to strict safe management measures, including capping the number of designated visitors at two, allowing only one designated visitor at any one time, as well as limiting the duration of the visit."
2020-10-05-T-071-S-01264,2020-10-05-T-071,1264,Gan Kim Yong,"From 31 July 2020, nursing homes were allowed to make further adjustments to the visitation guidelines, in view that community numbers were low and stable. One of the adjustments was to allow four designated visitors per resident, up from two previously, while maintaining the limit of one designated visitor at any one time. Nursing homes also have the discretion to allow a resident to have more than four designated visitors for exceptional circumstances, such as compassionate reasons, or to allow more members of large families the opportunity to spend time with a loved one."
2020-10-05-T-071-S-01265,2020-10-05-T-071,1265,Gan Kim Yong,We will continue to monitor the well-being of our seniors in nursing homes and review the restrictions on visitations as the COVID-19 situation evolves.
2020-10-05-T-072-S-01266,2020-10-05-T-072,1266,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the circumstances that led to the air-conditioning ventilation duct at NEX shopping mall being dislodged; (b) what are the liabilities of the building owner, management office, and tenant in such cases; and (c) what is being done to prevent such incidents from happening again."
2020-10-05-T-072-S-01267,2020-10-05-T-072,1267,Desmond Lee,"Following the incident where an Air-Conditioning & Mechanical Ventilation (ACMV) duct detached from the ceiling of a cinema hall in the NEX shopping mall, Building and Construction Authority (BCA) instructed the building owner to appoint a Professional Engineer to carry out a detailed investigation of the incident, and to recommend rectification measures to be taken."
2020-10-05-T-072-S-01268,2020-10-05-T-072,1268,Desmond Lee,"The investigation is ongoing and is expected to be completed by end October 2020. However, preliminary findings indicate that a significant amount of water had accumulated in the layer of acoustic material surrounding the ACMV duct. The weight of the accumulated water is likely to have overloaded the brackets that were supporting the ACMV duct, causing them to give way."
2020-10-05-T-072-S-01269,2020-10-05-T-072,1269,Desmond Lee,BCA has alerted other cinema operators to inspect their ACMV ducts and to carry out maintenance and repair works where necessary. BCA will assess what further measures need to be taken to prevent a recurrence of such incidents after the investigation has been completed.
2020-10-05-T-073-S-01270,2020-10-05-T-073,1270,Lim Biow Chuan,asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA can introduce regulations to ensure that cyclists riding on footpaths do not ride recklessly and endanger other users of the footpaths.
2020-10-05-T-073-S-01271,2020-10-05-T-073,1271,Ong Ye Kung,"There are already regulations in place for bicycles and cyclists. For example, bicycles must not exceed 20kg or be wider than 70cm, cyclists must adhere to the speed limit of 10km/h on footpaths and 25km/h on cycling paths, and the use of mobile communication devices while riding is disallowed on all public paths."
2020-10-05-T-073-S-01272,2020-10-05-T-073,1272,Ong Ye Kung,"Recently, we also raised the penalties for speeding and reckless riding offences. Those found guilty may be fined up to $10,000 and/or imprisoned for up to 12 months. They may also be charged under the Penal Code for causing hurt."
2020-10-05-T-073-S-01273,2020-10-05-T-073,1273,Ong Ye Kung,"Beyond regulations and harsher penalties, we need greater social consciousness. This is why we introduced a Code of Conduct in 2018, which encourages cyclists to give way to pedestrians on public paths, and slow down when approaching crowded areas, intersections, or crossings. It is important that all users play their part in contributing to a gracious active mobility culture, by being considerate and looking out for one another so as to make our community a safer and friendlier space to Walk, Cycle and Ride together."
2020-10-05-T-074-S-01274,2020-10-05-T-074,1274,Murali Pillai,asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry has plans to install acoustic cameras to identify noisy vehicles for enforcement action.
2020-10-05-T-074-S-01275,2020-10-05-T-074,1275,Ong Ye Kung,"Excessive vehicle noise is caused by a variety of factors, such as illegal modifications to vehicles, vehicle design, and irresponsible driver behaviour."
2020-10-05-T-074-S-01276,2020-10-05-T-074,1276,Ong Ye Kung,"The National Environment Agency (NEA) sets the noise emission standards for new and in-use vehicles. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) requires vehicles to undergo mandatory, periodic inspections to ensure they meet NEA’s noise emission standards for in-use vehicles and have not been illegally modified. In between inspections, LTA takes action against illegally modified vehicles, based on complaints and regular enforcement efforts with the Traffic Police."
2020-10-05-T-074-S-01277,2020-10-05-T-074,1277,Ong Ye Kung,"There are currently no plans to install acoustic cameras for enforcement action against noisy vehicles, as this is a novel technique that has yet to be rigorously tested. Government agencies will continue to monitor new technologies, including acoustic cameras, for better enforcement against noisy vehicles."
2020-10-05-T-074-S-01278,2020-10-05-T-074,1278,Ong Ye Kung,
2020-10-05-T-075-S-01279,2020-10-05-T-075,1279,Tin Pei Ling,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the rationale for restricting investable products under the CPF Investment Scheme; (b) how are the approved investment products determined; (c) how frequent is this list of approved products reviewed; and (d) whether Singaporeans can choose to invest in products not in the approved list on a conditional basis.
2020-10-05-T-075-S-01280,2020-10-05-T-075,1280,Josephine Teo,The primary purpose of CPF is to help members save for retirement. Members earn risk-free interest of up to 6% per annum on their CPF balances. Members who are prepared to take some risks may do so through the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS).
2020-10-05-T-075-S-01281,2020-10-05-T-075,1281,Josephine Teo,"There is a wide variety of investment products available in the market. Members also vary greatly in their knowledge and understanding of these products. To prevent excessive risk to retirement savings, CPF Board sets limits on the amounts that can be invested as well as the products available under CPFIS."
2020-10-05-T-075-S-01282,2020-10-05-T-075,1282,Josephine Teo,"Notwithstanding these limits, members have access to a range of investment products of varying risk profiles. These include bonds, fixed deposits, insurance policies, unit trusts, exchange-traded funds, shares and gold products."
2020-10-05-T-075-S-01283,2020-10-05-T-075,1283,Josephine Teo,"Managed investment products and providers are reviewed before they are available through CPFIS. For example, since 2006, all new CPFIS funds must be in the top 25th percentile of funds in their global peer group and have an expense ratio below the cap in their risk category."
2020-10-05-T-075-S-01284,2020-10-05-T-075,1284,Josephine Teo,"To ensure that the list of CPFIS products and providers remains relevant, the CPF Board will continue to review it on an ongoing basis. This strikes a balance between allowing CPFIS participants the flexibility to diversify their investment portfolios to enhance their retirement nest eggs, while safeguarding members' interest."
2020-10-05-T-076-S-01285,2020-10-05-T-076,1285,Joan Pereira,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in view of COVID-19, whether screw taps for wash basins and manual flushing systems in hawker centre toilets can be replaced with automatic ones."
2020-10-05-T-076-S-01286,2020-10-05-T-076,1286,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The Code of Practice on Environmental Health currently states that public toilets should install sensor-operated taps and flushing systems. All new building developments, including hawker centres, are required to comply with the Code."
2020-10-05-T-076-S-01287,2020-10-05-T-076,1287,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Of the 33 MSE-owned hawker centres, 25 already have sensor-operated taps and flushing systems installed. We will install these provisions in the remaining centres during upcoming periodic renovations. I encourage Town Councils to install sensor-operated taps and flushing systems in HDB-owned hawker centres. This is particularly important in view of public health concerns amidst the COVID-19 pandemic."
2020-10-05-T-076-S-01288,2020-10-05-T-076,1288,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"To support the Town Councils, NEA is providing co-funding under the Toilet Improvement Programme for improved toilet designs that facilitate cleaning and maintenance, including the installation of sensor-operated taps and flushing systems."
2020-10-05-T-077-S-01289,2020-10-05-T-077,1289,Lim Biow Chuan,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in the past three years, how many cat feeders have been summoned for littering."
2020-10-05-T-077-S-01290,2020-10-05-T-077,1290,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In the past three years, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has enforced against eight cat feeders for littering. Food left behind from the feeding of stray animals may attract pests such as cockroaches and rats, and endanger public health. Containers left behind can also collect stagnant water and lead to mosquito breeding. It is therefore important that cat feeders are considerate and clear leftover food and food containers after feeding."
2020-10-05-T-077-S-01291,2020-10-05-T-077,1291,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Many community cats are taken care of by regular, responsible feeders. NEA and the Animal and Veterinary Service work with the Cat Welfare Society to allow such feeding, while making sure that food remnants are not left behind."
2020-10-05-T-078-S-01292,2020-10-05-T-078,1292,Desmond Choo,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry amidst greater trade tensions and shortening of supply chains, what are the Ministry's plans to enhance Singapore's position as a regional trade hub."
2020-10-05-T-078-S-01293,2020-10-05-T-078,1293,Chan Chun Sing,"Singapore’s positioning to be a critical node in the global system has not changed, amidst trade tensions and reconfiguration of supply chains. To achieve this, we must continue to position Singapore as the preferred business hub by adding value to businesses that trade with Singapore, trade through Singapore, and trade from Singapore."
2020-10-05-T-078-S-01294,2020-10-05-T-078,1294,Chan Chun Sing,"First, Singapore must build on our reliability as a trusted node. We will continue to remain open for business to facilitate the flow of goods and essential business travel. Singapore's ports have stayed open throughout the COVID-19 crisis. We are working to establish travel arrangements with more countries to progressively enable greater air travel, while ensuring public health and safety are upheld. Singapore will continue working with our trading partners to foster greater global and regional integration, and reduce impediments to the flow of goods across borders. For example, Singapore is working with other ASEAN Member States to streamline non-tariff measures on essential goods such as food and medical supplies. Greater global emphasis on resilient supply chains brings opportunity too. Companies will want to diversify their sourcing and production. Some will look to South-East Asia, and this will benefit Singapore’s businesses and other trade-related services."
2020-10-05-T-078-S-01295,2020-10-05-T-078,1295,Chan Chun Sing,"Second, we will continue to strengthen Singapore’s physical and digital connectivity. Our efforts to enhance our air and sea ports’ connections are complemented by efforts on digital connectivity, such as the digitalPORT@SGTM initiative, which is a one-stop portal for maritime regulatory and port services transactions. We have also embarked on new generation Digital Economy Agreements with countries such as Australia, Chile and New Zealand that will help firms to interoperate more seamlessly and efficiently in the digital economy. Physical connectivity allows businesses to trade through Singapore, while digital connectivity will enable businesses to transcend geographical boundaries and trade from Singapore by capturing value from trade flows that do not physically pass through Singapore."
2020-10-05-T-078-S-01296,2020-10-05-T-078,1296,Chan Chun Sing,"Thirdly, we will continue to focus on innovation, digitalisation, improving productivity, upskilling our workers, and building core capabilities that are difficult to replace. These are fundamentals which underpin our competitiveness, and ensure that Singapore continues to be the preferred business hub of Asia by adding value to businesses that trade with Singapore, trade through Singapore, and trade from Singapore."
2020-10-05-T-079-S-01297,2020-10-05-T-079,1297,Hany Soh,asked the Minister for Education whether all Primary school students will receive a personal laptop or tablet with complimentary Wi-Fi access to further support home-based learning.
2020-10-05-T-079-S-01298,2020-10-05-T-079,1298,Lawrence Wong,"MOE announced in June this year that we will be equipping all secondary school students with a personal learning device by end-2021, seven years ahead of the original schedule."
2020-10-05-T-079-S-01299,2020-10-05-T-079,1299,Lawrence Wong,"We are currently studying whether to extend the programme to primary school students. As part of this study, we need to better understand how the daily use of such devices might impact younger students, and improve learning outcomes. We are also looking into the concerns raised by various stakeholders about excessive screen time and digital addiction at an early age."
2020-10-05-T-079-S-01300,2020-10-05-T-079,1300,Lawrence Wong,"While we study this issue, measures have been put in place to ensure that all primary school students will have access to devices for home-based learning. For example, our schools have sufficient devices that can be loaned to students who need them."
2020-10-05-T-080-S-01301,2020-10-05-T-080,1301,Darryl David,asked the Minister for Education how has COVID-19 affected the 2020 Direct School Admission (DSA) exercise for Secondary schools especially in the absence of school sports or other such events and activities that would have ordinarily facilitated DSA applicants to use objective and quantitative criteria in their DSA applications.
2020-10-05-T-080-S-01302,2020-10-05-T-080,1302,Lawrence Wong,"In spite of the COVID-19 situation, there continues to be healthy interest in the Direct School Admission for secondary schools (DSA-Sec) this year – with about 30,500 applications, an increase from the 29,000 received in 2019."
2020-10-05-T-080-S-01303,2020-10-05-T-080,1303,Lawrence Wong,Schools have recently concluded DSA selections which were conducted via electronic modes. This ensured the safety and well-being of students and school staff by preventing the intermingling of students across schools.
2020-10-05-T-080-S-01304,2020-10-05-T-080,1304,Lawrence Wong,"A common setting and standardised set of equipment at students’ own primary schools was used for the video-conferencing sessions. This was to ensure that all students would be given a fair assessment, regardless of their backgrounds."
2020-10-05-T-080-S-01305,2020-10-05-T-080,1305,Lawrence Wong,"With the cancellation of the National School Games and other events due to COVID-19, indicators such as recent race timings, standings and awards were not available. Nevertheless, schools were able to make use of other sources of information, including students’ school records, information provided in their online applications as well as from video-conferencing sessions with the students. These sessions included e-interviews or tasks that enabled students to demonstrate their attributes and potential in particular areas. For example, some students were asked to imitate melodies and rhythms of varying complexity, reproduce a dance sequence, perform ball-handling and different movement skills, or create pencil sketches."
2020-10-05-T-080-S-01306,2020-10-05-T-080,1306,Lawrence Wong,"With the above adjustments, schools were able to take a holistic approach to DSA selection, taking into account not only the student’s achievements and performance, but also their interest and passion for the talent area, their potential and personal qualities. As in previous years, schools formed selection panels to collectively evaluate each DSA applicant and to ensure objectivity and balance. The selection panels tapped on their experience in talent identification and exercised professional judgement to evaluate and select students who can most benefit from their development programmes. Through all of these measures, we were able to facilitate the smooth implementation of DSA this year, even amidst the COVID-19 situation."
2020-10-05-T-081-S-01307,2020-10-05-T-081,1307,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether telecommunication companies (telcos) have standardised clauses for the non-renewal of service contracts; (b) whether non-renewal clauses that place the obligation on customers to inform telcos exactly seven days in advance before the end of the service contract, or risk incurring a penalty, are in accordance with the principles of contract law; and (c) whether IMDA is aware as to whether consumers experience an increase in subscription fees after the automatic continuation of their service contacts upon its expiry."
2020-10-05-T-081-S-01308,2020-10-05-T-081,1308,S Iswaran,My Ministry and IMDA consider it important for telcos to offer consumers flexibility in service termination.
2020-10-05-T-081-S-01309,2020-10-05-T-081,1309,S Iswaran,"Current service contracts typically include a notice period for service termination, which may vary across telcos. Subscribers are generally not required to notify the telcos on a specific date in order to terminate their services. IMDA has asked the sole telco that used to have this requirement to exercise greater flexibility, and it has complied."
2020-10-05-T-081-S-01310,2020-10-05-T-081,1310,S Iswaran,"Service contracts usually span a minimum period, ranging from three months to two years, during which subscribers may enjoy discounted subscription rates. At the end of the minimum subscription period, telco services roll over automatically to ensure that there is no disruption to access. If the service contracts are not terminated or renewed, consumers may see an increase in subscription rates as they will have to pay the non-discounted rates. Consumers will have the flexibility to renew existing contracts or sign up for new contracts any time after the minimum subscription period ends. Some telcos also offer consumers this flexibility before the end of the minimum subscription period."
2020-10-05-T-081-S-01311,2020-10-05-T-081,1311,S Iswaran,"To safeguard the interest of consumers, IMDA requires telcos to inform subscribers of key contractual obligations upfront, when they sign up for or renew their service contracts. This includes changes to subscription rates after the minimum period."
2020-10-05-T-082-S-01312,2020-10-05-T-082,1312,Alex Yam,asked the Prime Minister with regard to the recent document leaks from the US Financial Crimes Network (a) whether any banks in Singapore are implicated in the money laundering activities; and (b) whether the Government is in touch with the banks named to verify any Singapore connection.
2020-10-05-T-082-S-01313,2020-10-05-T-082,1313,Desmond Choo,asked the Prime Minister in view of the recent assertions by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that a number of banks in Singapore had handled large sums of suspicious transactions (a) how will MAS address the assertions with the banks; and (b) what have been the efforts to enhance our work against suspicious transactions and money laundering.
2020-10-05-T-082-S-01314,2020-10-05-T-082,1314,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The Members' questions arose from the leaked reports of the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN."
2020-10-05-T-082-S-01315,2020-10-05-T-082,1315,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Let me explain what these leaked reports are about. Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) are filed by financial institutions if they have reason to suspect that a financial transaction could be related to a crime. The reasons for suspicion may be due to an adverse media story on the customer, or the customer not providing a good explanation for an unusually large transaction. FinCEN receives a large number of STRs on an ongoing basis – 2.75 million in 2019."
2020-10-05-T-082-S-01316,2020-10-05-T-082,1316,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The leaked reports mentioned in the media articles were filed with FinCEN by banks in the US, involving transactions with banks in almost every country in the world. To be clear, STRs are not in themselves evidence of money laundering. In fact, most STRs are eventually not found to be connected to criminal activities or money laundering."
2020-10-05-T-082-S-01317,2020-10-05-T-082,1317,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Notwithstanding, MAS is reviewing the information on the leaked STRs to determine if our banks had appropriately detected suspicious transactions, taken timely action to mitigate the risk, and made the necessary filings to the Commercial Affairs Department. If any bank is found to have weaknesses in anti-money laundering controls, MAS will direct it to rectify them promptly. If there has been a breach of Singapore’s anti-money laundering requirements, MAS will take enforcement action."
2020-10-05-T-082-S-01318,2020-10-05-T-082,1318,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Desmond Choo also asked a broader question on how Singapore is combating money laundering and other financial crimes. I note that Ms Foo Mee Har has also raised a similar question for a later Sitting.
2020-10-05-T-082-S-01319,2020-10-05-T-082,1319,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has assessed that Singapore’s regulatory framework for combating money laundering is fully aligned with international standards, and that MAS supervision of the financial sector is robust."
2020-10-05-T-082-S-01320,2020-10-05-T-082,1320,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"For financial institutions at higher risk of being exposed to money laundering, MAS takes a more intrusive approach. MAS directs the financial institutions to take remedial actions, and ensures they report on their implementation of the measures."
2020-10-05-T-082-S-01321,2020-10-05-T-082,1321,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"As I just mentioned, when financial institutions are in breach of our anti-money laundering requirements, MAS will take firm enforcement actions. These include financial penalties, prohibition orders, public reprimands, and revocation of licenses. MAS has published enforcement actions in connection with serious cases, to send a strong deterrent signal."
2020-10-05-T-082-S-01322,2020-10-05-T-082,1322,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,MAS and CAD are continually improving their methods of detection. This includes deploying technologies such as network analytics to uncover well-concealed criminal networks with complicated layers of entities and persons. They have also established partnerships with key financial institutions in Singapore to share information on common and emerging criminal typologies. Building trusted relationships with the private sector further enables case-specific intelligence to be shared among the relevant financial institutions.
2020-10-05-T-082-S-01323,2020-10-05-T-082,1323,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Further, we leverage international cooperation in combating such crime. Singapore has been playing an active role at the FATF to shape international anti-money laundering standards. We have built strong working relationships with all the leading foreign jurisdictions, enabling proactive sharing of intelligence, joint investigations, and supervisory cooperation."
2020-10-05-T-082-S-01324,2020-10-05-T-082,1324,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"I would like to assure this House that Singapore agencies are vigilant against money laundering risks, and MAS is working closely with financial institutions to continually strengthen our safeguards against these risks."
2020-10-05-T-083-S-01325,2020-10-05-T-083,1325,Murali Pillai,"asked the Prime Minister in light of the recent cases of trade financing fraud involving billions of dollars leading to steps taken by banks to de-risk from this area, what steps will be taken to (i) ensure that there will be a sufficient number of banks providing such facilities on reasonable terms to traders (ii) reduce the fraud risks involved in such transactions on banks and other stakeholders and (iii) restore Singapore's reputation as a premier global trade financing hub."
2020-10-05-T-083-S-01326,2020-10-05-T-083,1326,Murali Pillai,
2020-10-05-T-083-S-01327,2020-10-05-T-083,1327,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The fraud cases in the commodities trading sector have been attributed to weak disclosure practices and internal controls among a minority of trading companies. However, we do not take this lightly. To prevent such fraudulent activities and restore confidence, there needs to be a strengthening of standards and practices of transparency and governance in the commodities trading sector, more robust credit risk assessment, as well as a move away from paper-based processes as they are more susceptible to risk of fraud. These are the follow-up actions that banks, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and other government agencies are undertaking."
2020-10-05-T-083-S-01328,2020-10-05-T-083,1328,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS), with the support of MAS, Enterprise Singapore (ESG) and Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA), is developing a code of best practices to enhance commodity financing standards in Singapore. The banks are currently consulting the trading companies, who themselves have an interest in higher standards being practised amongst all players in the industry. The code should be finalised in Q4 2020."
2020-10-05-T-083-S-01329,2020-10-05-T-083,1329,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Importantly, MAS is also partnering the industry and other government agencies to digitalise trade financing, and replace the current paper-based systems with electronic documents and data flows. This will better ensure authenticity of documents, and allow banks to obtain data directly from Singapore Customs to perform risk assessment."
2020-10-05-T-083-S-01330,2020-10-05-T-083,1330,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"As we take progressive steps to improve the system, trading companies are facing more rigorous credit assessments and tighter financing conditions. They will be able to access the bank financing that they need, commensurate with their creditworthiness. But the initiatives are necessary, to enhance commodity financing standards and practices, and strengthen Singapore's resilience, relevance and competitiveness as a global commodities trading hub."
2020-10-05-T-084-S-01331,2020-10-05-T-084,1331,He Ting Ru,asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the Government tracks the take-up rate of green financing loans and products for SMEs; and (b) what are the plans to make green financing more accessible to SMEs.
2020-10-05-T-084-S-01332,2020-10-05-T-084,1332,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Green and sustainable financing flows are growing strongly in Singapore. From 2019 till the first half of this year, approximately SGD 4.8 billion of green and sustainability bonds were issued in Singapore. Singapore corporates also borrowed SGD 10.2 billion through green and sustainability-linked loans"
2020-10-05-T-084-S-01333,2020-10-05-T-084,1333,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"MAS does not have data on SMEs' take-up of green and sustainability-linked loans. But we do know that Singapore-based banks have been stepping up on such lending. Notable examples include a SGD 27 million ten-year sustainability-linked loan structured by DBS to Chew’s Agriculture in 2019; and a SGD 14 million green loan from UOB to LYS Energy Group, a home-grown independent solar power producer, earlier this year."
2020-10-05-T-084-S-01334,2020-10-05-T-084,1334,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"We are taking further steps to promote green and sustainability-linked loans to SMEs. One possible solution is to develop lending frameworks that provide simplified processes and set out clear standardised criteria for borrowers. With these frameworks, there would be no need to engage external reviewers to develop, verify and maintain customised green finance frameworks for each borrower. HSBC’s Green Loan Framework for SMEs, which was launched in Singapore in March 2020, is a promising start and MAS will encourage more lenders to develop such frameworks."
2020-10-05-T-084-S-01335,2020-10-05-T-084,1335,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"MAS will also help borrowers defray the cost of customised green and sustainability-linked loans. Later this year, MAS will launch a Green and Sustainability-Linked Loan Grant Scheme which will be open to SMEs and other corporates4. This grant will defray the cost of obtaining independent external reviews to demonstrate that sustainability targets are material, and to verify that the loan proceeds will be channeled to green and sustainable activities."
2020-10-05-T-084-S-01336,2020-10-05-T-084,1336,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"As green and sustainable finance activities grow in Singapore, the anchoring of relevant capabilities here will help to bring such loans into the mainstream while encouraging more SMEs to adopt green and sustainability financing."
2020-10-05-T-085-S-01337,2020-10-05-T-085,1337,Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider extending the Cross Island Line Punggol Extension, which will connect Pasir Ris to Punggol, to Seletar Airport, Seletar private estate and Fernvale."
2020-10-05-T-085-S-01338,2020-10-05-T-085,1338,Ong Ye Kung,"MRT lines are built based on projected travel demand, given that these are very significant publicly funded investments. There are currently no plans to extend the Cross Island Line further to Seletar Airport, Seletar private estate and Fernvale based on projected travel demand."
2020-10-05-T-085-S-01339,2020-10-05-T-085,1339,Ong Ye Kung,"Notwithstanding, commuters have access to the MRT network, through various bus and LRT services. These include bus Services 50 and 102 connecting to Sengkang MRT station on the North East Line, bus Services 70 and 86 connecting to Yio Chu Kang MRT station on the North South Line, and Sengkang LRT connecting to the North East Line."
2020-10-05-T-085-S-01340,2020-10-05-T-085,1340,Ong Ye Kung,"In addition, the opening of the Cross Island Line Phase 1 and Cross Island Line Punggol Extension will add 15 new MRT stations or interchanges to the eastern and north-eastern parts of Singapore, including stations such as Tavistock and Serangoon North which can serve Seletar private estate residents. I have asked LTA to review the connections from Fernvale and Seletar to these stations so that residents can benefit from these stations when they open and enjoy better connectivity to more parts of Singapore."
2020-10-05-T-086-S-01341,2020-10-05-T-086,1341,Hany Soh,asked the Minister for National Development whether all HDB and URA car parks will (i) implement a transitional parking of at least 15 minutes grace period and (ii) provide designated food delivery pick-up points at loading and unloading bays for registered food delivery riders.
2020-10-05-T-086-S-01342,2020-10-05-T-086,1342,Desmond Lee,"HDB and URA car parks generally offer a 10-minute grace period. The grace period was extended to 20 minutes from April to June this year to cater to the increase in delivery of food and other daily essentials, as a result of Circuit Breaker measures."
2020-10-05-T-086-S-01343,2020-10-05-T-086,1343,Desmond Lee,"Since then, based on our monitoring of HDB and URA carpark usage, the proportion of people using the carparks for less than 20 minutes has largely reverted to pre-Circuit Breaker levels, where a 10-minute grace period was generally sufficient for motorists to conduct pick-up or drop-off activities."
2020-10-05-T-086-S-01344,2020-10-05-T-086,1344,Desmond Lee,"As the demand for HDB and URA car parks is high, the grace period has to be kept short to ensure quick turnover of vehicles. This prevents congestion in the car park, allows more motorists to use the car park, and ensures that the interests of residents who drive or have season parking are adequately safeguarded."
2020-10-05-T-086-S-01345,2020-10-05-T-086,1345,Desmond Lee,"In addition, loading and unloading bays are provided at HDB blocks for quick loading and unloading activities. Delivery riders can use these designated spots for food delivery and pick-up."
2020-10-05-T-086-S-01346,2020-10-05-T-086,1346,Desmond Lee,"Nonetheless, we will continue to monitor the situation on the ground, understand the needs of different groups of car park users including delivery drivers and riders, and review the grace period as necessary."
2020-10-05-T-087-S-01347,2020-10-05-T-087,1347,Liang Eng Hwa,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether complaints against smoking, second-hand smoke and cigarette butt littering at HDB estates have increased in the past six months; and (b) whether the measures implemented so far have been effective."
2020-10-05-T-087-S-01348,2020-10-05-T-087,1348,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Over the past six months, the National Environment Agency (NEA) received about 21,000 instances of feedback related to smoking, second-hand smoke and cigarette butt littering at HDB estates, up from about 14,000 during the same period in 2019, or a 50% increase. This increase is likely due to more residents working from home during the Circuit Breaker in April and May, a situation which has continued even post-Circuit Breaker. This has resulted in a higher concentration of people in residential estates and more activity taking place in homes, rather than workplaces."
2020-10-05-T-087-S-01349,2020-10-05-T-087,1349,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"NEA takes a multi-pronged approach, including education, surveillance and enforcement, to tackle unlawful smoking at common areas of residential estates such as common corridors, lift lobbies, void decks and staircase landings. Generally, smokers appreciate the rationale behind the smoking prohibition and most comply willingly after being advised by NEA, Town Councils and HDB. Sometimes, smokers forget and light up where they should not, and friendly reminders from family and friends are helpful to signal the positive social norms that smokers should abide by. Visual reminders put up by Advisers and community leaders, such as posters in lifts and HDB areas where there have been feedback on unlawful smoking, are also useful in reminding smokers to be considerate and entrenching positive social norms."
2020-10-05-T-087-S-01350,2020-10-05-T-087,1350,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Where unlawful smoking feedback persists, NEA conducts surveillance of the affected block. Since January 2019, NEA has enhanced its surveillance capability with thermal cameras which can detect objects emitting high heat and capture images of the smoking offence. NEA uses the images along with other forms of evidence, such as public feedback, for investigations. Thus far, 270 thermal camera deployments have been made, resulting in enforcement actions being taken against about 100 offenders."
2020-10-05-T-087-S-01351,2020-10-05-T-087,1351,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Overall, the number of enforcement actions taken by NEA against smoking and cigarette butt littering in HDB estates has increased to more than 8,400 in the past six months of 2020 compared to more than 7,700 in the same period last year. The increase in enforcement actions has been boosted by the use of thermal cameras for surveillance, as well as ramped up enforcement operations by NEA."
2020-10-05-T-087-S-01352,2020-10-05-T-087,1352,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The issue of smoking is one that requires everyone to play their part. While NEA has improved its enforcement capability, it is not realistic for NEA to constantly monitor all smoking-prohibited places or respond immediately to every instance of feedback, given the fleeting nature of such acts. I urge smokers to be mindful of the health of others, and not light up in smoking-prohibited places. Families and friends of smokers, as well as the general public, can help reinforce the right social norms."
2020-10-05-T-088-S-01353,2020-10-05-T-088,1353,Ang Wei Neng,"asked the Prime Minister (a) in the past three years, how many high net worth individuals have set up or have been given approval to set up family offices in Singapore; (b) what is the total quantum of assets that have been attracted to Singapore through these high net worth individuals; and (c) how many Singaporeans have been employed by such family offices in Singapore."
2020-10-05-T-088-S-01354,2020-10-05-T-088,1354,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"As Single Family Offices (SFOs) do not manage third party monies, they are not registered with or licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). So MAS does not have hard data on the scale of their operations."
2020-10-05-T-088-S-01355,2020-10-05-T-088,1355,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,There are about 200 SFOs in Singapore. The number has grown in recent years.
2020-10-05-T-088-S-01356,2020-10-05-T-088,1356,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Industry research1 estimates that each SFO typically manages assets in excess of US$100 million. So total assets under management by SFOs could be around US$20 billion.
2020-10-05-T-088-S-01357,2020-10-05-T-088,1357,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"SFOs would usually employ small teams of trusted advisors and investment professionals, and there could be several hundred in the industry. Beyond direct employment, they generate indirect employment in Singapore through their engagement of external finance, tax and legal professionals for advice on wealth planning and operational matters."
2020-10-05-T-089-S-01358,2020-10-05-T-089,1358,He Ting Ru,"asked the Prime Minister across the last three general elections (a) how many voters are allocated to each polling station on average; (b) how many polling stations have had the number of allocated voters exceed 25%, 50% and 100% of the average; and (c) what is the respective maximum number of voters allocated to a given polling station."
2020-10-05-T-089-S-01359,2020-10-05-T-089,1359,Chan Chun Sing,"For GE 2020, the Elections Department (ELD) had split polling stations with larger numbers of voters at HDB void decks and pavilions, to allow for safe distancing measures. As a result, there was a larger number of polling stations with fewer voters than the previous two general elections. The percentage of polling stations with 2,000 and below voters, increased from 5.2% in GE 2011 to 9.3% in GE 2015 to 38.7% in GE 2020. Table 1 shows the distribution of voters across polling stations of different sizes."
2020-10-05-T-089-S-01360,2020-10-05-T-089,1360,Chan Chun Sing,
2020-10-05-T-089-S-01361,2020-10-05-T-089,1361,Chan Chun Sing,"Correspondingly, the average number of voters per polling station dropped from 3,021 in GE 2011, to 2,960 in GE 2015, and to 2,417 in GE 2020. As the average number of voters per polling station varied across the GEs, it would not be meaningful to compare the number of polling stations exceeding the average using different baselines."
2020-10-05-T-089-S-01362,2020-10-05-T-089,1362,Chan Chun Sing,"For GE 2020, there were three large polling stations with more than 5,000 voters, which were not split. They were located in schools and community centres/clubs, and had been used as polling stations in previous elections without problems. Nonetheless, as ELD had noted in its findings on why some polling stations saw long queues in GE 2020, larger polling stations should have been better resourced. For future elections, ELD will split large polling stations where possible. If it is not feasible to do so (e.g. due to a lack of alternative premises in the area), ELD will ensure that these large polling stations are better resourced, including by providing additional manpower and equipment."
2020-10-05-T-090-S-01363,2020-10-05-T-090,1363,Sitoh Yih Pin,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) what is the reason why purchasers of a second property who are single do not qualify for the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty remission even if they meet the same conditions that married couples do to facilitate their changing of homes; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider extending the remission to singles who meet the same conditions in the future.
2020-10-05-T-090-S-01364,2020-10-05-T-090,1364,Heng Swee Keat,"The policy intent for Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) is to moderate demand, and to ensure a stable and sustainable residential property market. This in turn will help both existing and aspiring homeowners by keeping price increases in line with economic fundamentals."
2020-10-05-T-090-S-01365,2020-10-05-T-090,1365,Heng Swee Keat,"ABSD is applicable on the second and subsequent residential property purchases of all Singaporeans. This applies regardless of whether they dispose of their first property subsequently. This is because even if the first property is eventually disposed of, the purchase of the second property adds to the demand for residential properties at the time of purchase."
2020-10-05-T-090-S-01366,2020-10-05-T-090,1366,Heng Swee Keat,"We have made one exception, namely for Singaporean married couples. A Singaporean married couple may need to change home due to changing family needs, such as when they have children or when their children are growing up. It is in this context that we have an ABSD concession for Singaporean married couples buying a second property. Under the concession, we allow Singapore married couples to claim a refund of the ABSD paid on their second property, provided they sell their first property within 6 months after the purchase of a completed property, or the TOP date of an uncompleted property."
2020-10-05-T-090-S-01367,2020-10-05-T-090,1367,Heng Swee Keat,"This ABSD concession is not available to other groups of property buyers, as our overall key objective remains to moderate the demand for residential properties including that for second residential property of Singaporeans. Buyers who do not wish to incur the higher ABSD on second residential properties may wish to consider selling their first property before purchasing their second property."
2020-10-05-T-091-S-01368,2020-10-05-T-091,1368,Murali Pillai,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) how many Singapore citizens who acquired their citizenship by registration, have turned 21 years of age this year, have taken their Oaths of Renunciation beforehand and provided their bank account details to the Government, have received their Solidarity Payments late, i.e. after 14 April 2020; (b) what contributed to the delay; and (c) what steps have been taken to address this matter."
2020-10-05-T-091-S-01369,2020-10-05-T-091,1369,Heng Swee Keat,"All Singapore Citizens by descent or registration who are 21 years old and above before the Solidarity Payment was paid out on 14 April 2020, need to have taken the Oath of Renunciation, Allegiance and Loyalty. Of all Singaporeans turning 21 this year, 1,320 need to complete their Oath to be eligible for the Solidarity Payment."
2020-10-05-T-091-S-01370,2020-10-05-T-091,1370,Heng Swee Keat,"Of the above, 306 Singaporeans had completed their Oath before the Solidarity Payment was made, and received the Solidarity Payment together with all other Singaporeans. The payments were made between 14 April and 13 May, depending on the mode of payment."
2020-10-05-T-091-S-01371,2020-10-05-T-091,1371,Heng Swee Keat,"A further 392 subsequently completed their Oath, informed MOF, and have received their Solidarity Payment, as of September 2020."
2020-10-05-T-091-S-01372,2020-10-05-T-091,1372,Heng Swee Keat,"Of the remaining, 410 have not completed their Oath. They have until their 22nd birthday to do so, and to inform MOF. They will then receive the Solidarity Payment in about a month after informing MOF."
2020-10-05-T-092-S-01373,2020-10-05-T-092,1373,Ang Wei Neng,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) whether the Ministry considers whether Singapore-registered companies are making profits before disbursing Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) payouts and, if so, what is the quantum of JSS payouts disbursed to such companies; (b) whether the Ministry will consider asking Singapore-registered companies that declare profits before JSS payouts in FY2020 to return the JSS payouts in whole or in part; and (c) how many companies have declined JSS or returned the JSS payouts disbursed to them."
2020-10-05-T-092-S-01374,2020-10-05-T-092,1374,Heng Swee Keat,The objective of the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) is to support employers in retaining local employees in the face of the severe and widespread economic impact brought about by COVID-19.
2020-10-05-T-092-S-01375,2020-10-05-T-092,1375,Heng Swee Keat,"Given the severity of the shock and its wide impact across the economy, the JSS was designed to flow help to businesses fast. Profitability of businesses during the crisis was not a criterion for the payout. In practice, as businesses would not have filed their income tax returns, information on profitability was also not available to Government during the unfolding crisis."
2020-10-05-T-092-S-01376,2020-10-05-T-092,1376,Heng Swee Keat,"However, to better target help and for fiscal prudence, JSS support was tiered according to the severity of the economic shock facing broad sectors. For example, the aviation and travel sectors which had suffered a near complete loss of revenue, were accorded the highest tier of 75% support."
2020-10-05-T-092-S-01377,2020-10-05-T-092,1377,Heng Swee Keat,"We have made further refinements to the tiering for the extension of the JSS announced in August. For example, firms in the biomedical sciences and financial services sectors, which have been managing well, would see their support level fall to 10% for the period September – December 2020 and thereafter to zero."
2020-10-05-T-092-S-01378,2020-10-05-T-092,1378,Heng Swee Keat,"Given the design intent of the JSS, we do not intend to instruct firms that report profits to return their JSS payouts, whether in whole or in part. But we have and will continue to encourage firms that do not need the payout to do so voluntarily. As at 24 September 2020, over 700 firms have declined and/or returned JSS payouts. Alternatively, firms can also make use of the JSS scheme to hire more local workers, or to accelerate their transformation efforts."
2020-10-05-T-093-S-01379,2020-10-05-T-093,1379,Sitoh Yih Pin,asked the Minister for Defence whether the RSAF will consider reducing the number of early morning training sessions of military aircraft near residential areas in light of the substantial increase of residents who work from home due to the COVID-19 measures.
2020-10-05-T-093-S-01380,2020-10-05-T-093,1380,Ng Eng Hen,"As a small country with no strategic depth, it is critical for Singapore’s survival to maintain a capable and operationally-ready RSAF. Without this crucial deterrence, Singapore's national defences can easily be compromised and with potentially catastrophic consequences. Our own history demonstrates and reminds us of this existential vulnerability. Within hours after Japanese forces invaded Peninsula Malaysia in 1941, General Yamashita sent an air raid over Singapore – 17 planes were involved. With air superiority established, Japanese forces advanced swiftly down and reached Singapore within days. The British forces had to retreat into Singapore and blew up the causeway to slow down the Japanese assault. But without an airforce then to protect our skies, residents on our island were still at the mercy of bombs that fell from Japanese fighter planes. The death and destruction that ensued was horrendous. As one survivor, Mr Conceicao, who was 17 years old at that time, vividly recalled ""we saw hands, heads maybe, legs and parts of the human body lying about… this affected us throughout the course of the war and our life""."
2020-10-05-T-093-S-01381,2020-10-05-T-093,1381,Ng Eng Hen,"That we have a capable RSAF today able to defend our skies is taken for granted. It’s a virtuous state of affairs, but one that can slip if ever the capabilities of our pilots and planes degrade. And to keep up their skills, RSAF pilots need to train adequately. We recognize the inconvenience and disruption to residents here. MINDEF/SAF has done as much as we can to keep the RSAF training tempo locally to essential levels and activity. Let me elaborate."
2020-10-05-T-093-S-01382,2020-10-05-T-093,1382,Ng Eng Hen,"The RSAF has reduced its local training as far as possible. About half of actual flying training occurs overseas in countries that are willing to provide us those opportunities. On one of my visits to Luke Air base, where our F16s pilots train, I hosted the mayor and residents of the surrounding town to an appreciation lunch. I thanked the mayor for their support and understanding for our fighter detachment's training there, especially to tolerate the noise, just as our resident here do. He smiled, and replied, ""it's the sound of freedom."" Singapore is thankful that we have our good friends and partners in many countries who support our defence efforts."
2020-10-05-T-093-S-01383,2020-10-05-T-093,1383,Ng Eng Hen,"Even for local training, a significant proportion is done through simulators. During actual flying, the RSAF has introduced measures to reduce the noise. First, most of the local flying is conducted over waters rather than land, and avoiding residential areas except during take off, landing and transit to and from training areas. To illustrate, the northern end of the runway at Paya Lebar Air Base is approximately six kilometres from our territorial boundary. The fighter pilots have mere seconds after take-off to bank a sharp left in order to keep within our territorial airspace."
2020-10-05-T-093-S-01384,2020-10-05-T-093,1384,Ng Eng Hen,"Sorties taking off from Paya Lebar Air Base and Tengah Air Base are already clustered where possible, in multiple groups, even when smaller number of aircraft are involved."
2020-10-05-T-093-S-01385,2020-10-05-T-093,1385,Ng Eng Hen,"In addition to these routine measures, the RSAF does adjust its training tempo to accommodate sensitive periods. When national school examinations are held, the frequency of flights are reduced and night flying activities end earlier. During this COVID-19 pandemic where more residents are working and studying from home, the RSAF has kept the level of local flying activities to the minimum needed to maintain operational readiness. Flying is also spread across the week and on selected weekends."
2020-10-05-T-093-S-01386,2020-10-05-T-093,1386,Ng Eng Hen,"This regular training both locally and overseas keep the RSAF sharp and able to protect us well. It’s not against theoretical or imagined threats. Since the 9/11 twin tower attacks in Manhattan, the RSAF has put its pilots and Ground Based Air Defence systems on alert. On any given year, the RSAF responds to more than 350 suspicious air threats. In June last year for instance, there was a bomb threat on an inbound Scoot flight. Our fighters were scrambled and took to the skies within minutes to intercept the aircraft and escorted it back to Changi Airport. That case was reported in the news; many more go unreported for a variety of reasons."
2020-10-05-T-093-S-01387,2020-10-05-T-093,1387,Ng Eng Hen,This state of high operational readiness of the RSAF is only possible with regular and realistic training. I thank Singaporeans for their continued support to maintain an operationally ready and capable RSAF.
2020-10-05-T-094-S-01388,2020-10-05-T-094,1388,Don Wee,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs in order to prevent more Singaporeans from being scammed, whether the Ministry can work with MAS to require financial institutions to display pop-up reminders whenever their clients perform an overseas remittance via their mobile phone and computer."
2020-10-05-T-094-S-01389,2020-10-05-T-094,1389,K Shanmugam,The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has been working with MAS and the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) to develop measures to protect clients of financial institutions from scams.
2020-10-05-T-094-S-01390,2020-10-05-T-094,1390,K Shanmugam,"To prevent banking clients from falling prey to scams while they are completing online transactions, many banks now display messages in their One-Time-Password (OTP) notifications to warn customers not to share their OTPs with anyone. The banks also prominently display warnings about scams on their websites and mobile applications to increase their customers' awareness and vigilance."
2020-10-05-T-094-S-01391,2020-10-05-T-094,1391,K Shanmugam,"Other measures that have been introduced include multi-factor authentication to verify customers' identities, transaction alerts to notify customers of their online transactions, and fraud monitoring."
2020-10-05-T-094-S-01392,2020-10-05-T-094,1392,K Shanmugam,"MHA, MAS and ABS are working together as part of the Inter-Ministry Committee on Scams (IMCS) to explore other means of detecting and flagging suspicious transactions to prevent Singaporeans from falling prey to scammers. In particular, ABS member banks are working to implement more advanced fraud detection and transaction monitoring systems to identify suspicious and unusual transactions. There are also ongoing efforts to improve information sharing and coordination within the industry to facilitate recovery of scammed funds. ABS is also working with SPF to develop an online scam quiz to raise customers’ knowledge of scams and cyber hygiene before the opening of internet banking accounts."
2020-10-05-T-094-S-01393,2020-10-05-T-094,1393,K Shanmugam,We will study the Member's proposal on pop-up reminders for overseas remittance.
2020-10-05-T-095-S-01394,2020-10-05-T-095,1394,Jamus Jerome Lim,asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether there has been any systematic study by the Ministry as to the deterrent effect of a life sentence relative to the death penalty; and (b) whether the study has been conducted in cases where the reasoning capacity of the perpetrator may have been compromised such as by mental illness or addiction.
2020-10-05-T-095-S-01395,2020-10-05-T-095,1395,K Shanmugam,"In deciding whether to apply the death penalty to a particular offence, the Government takes into account (amongst other factors) three key considerations. First, the seriousness of the offence, in terms of the harm that the offence will cause to the victim and to society. Second, how frequent or widespread the offence is. Third, the need for deterrence. These considerations are considered in totality. For example, the fact that an offence is not widespread now, may not, by itself, be a decisive factor."
2020-10-05-T-095-S-01396,2020-10-05-T-095,1396,K Shanmugam,"The death penalty is imposed for offences such as intentional murder, gang robbery with murder, trafficking of significant quantities of drugs, terrorist bombing, and the use of firearms. While the capital sentence thresholds for drug trafficking may not seem high to the layperson, they actually involve significant quantities of drugs. For example, the capital sentence threshold amount of 15g of pure heroin (diamorphine) is equivalent to 1,250 straws of heroin, and feeds 180 drug abusers for a week. This is bringing death, or at least a life of ruin, to a large number of abusers and their families."
2020-10-05-T-095-S-01397,2020-10-05-T-095,1397,K Shanmugam,"There have been some studies commissioned by the Government on the deterrent effect of the death penalty compared to life imprisonment, as well as on public views on the death penalty."
2020-10-05-T-095-S-01398,2020-10-05-T-095,1398,K Shanmugam,"Last year, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had commissioned a survey of 2,000 residents' attitudes towards the imposition of capital punishment. The majority of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the death penalty is more effective than life imprisonment as a deterrent against using firearms in Singapore (70.8%), committing murder (70.6%) and drug trafficking (68%)."
2020-10-05-T-095-S-01399,2020-10-05-T-095,1399,K Shanmugam,"MHA had also commissioned a study of a sample of non-Singaporeans who are likely to visit Singapore and hence might potentially encounter Singapore laws and penalties. The study was conducted in 2018. The majority (76%) believed that compared to life imprisonment, the death penalty is more effective in discouraging people from committing serious crimes (e.g. intentional murder, smuggling firearms, and drug trafficking) in Singapore. The majority (84%) also believed that compared to life imprisonment, the death penalty is more effective in discouraging people from trafficking drugs into Singapore."
2020-10-05-T-095-S-01400,2020-10-05-T-095,1400,K Shanmugam,"We want to emphasise that the studies need to be taken in context. Some tentative conclusions can be drawn, but the very nature of these studies is such that more work will have to be done over periods of time."
2020-10-05-T-095-S-01401,2020-10-05-T-095,1401,K Shanmugam,"There is also some evidence that drug traffickers who had been arrested, had known about the death penalty and the amounts that would attract the death penalty, and this had caused a reduction of the amount of drugs trafficked. MHA found that there was a 66% reduction in the average net weight trafficked for opium, in the four-year window after the mandatory death penalty was introduced in 1990 for trafficking more than 1,200g of opium. Similarly, in the four-year period after the introduction of the mandatory death penalty for trafficking involving more than 500g of cannabis in 1990, there was a 15 to 19 percentage point reduction in the probability that traffickers would choose to traffic above the capital sentence threshold."
2020-10-05-T-095-S-01402,2020-10-05-T-095,1402,K Shanmugam,"Another study conducted by MHA on convicted drug traffickers and non-drug traffickers (e.g. drug abusers) showed that traffickers who stated that they had higher awareness of and were mindful of the severe legal consequences, had limited their trafficking behavior. This points to restrictive deterrence, as trafficking activities were intentionally limited when there was greater awareness of sanctions. The majority of the offenders who were non-traffickers (85.1%) likewise felt that the death penalty has a deterrent effect."
2020-10-05-T-095-S-01403,2020-10-05-T-095,1403,K Shanmugam,"There is also some evidence of the deterrent effect of the death penalty, by reference to other offences, beyond drug trafficking."
2020-10-05-T-095-S-01404,2020-10-05-T-095,1404,K Shanmugam,"Prior to 1973, firearms robbery was on the rise, reaching a peak of 174 cases in 1973. A dramatic drop was witnessed over the decades following the introduction of the death penalty for such offences. Firearms offences immediately fell by 39% to 106 cases the next year, and fell further within the next three to four years to an even lower level, and remains at a very low level today. At Annex 1 is a chart showing this. Today, firearms robbery is rare in Singapore, with no cases reported in the last 13 years. This is an indicator of the strong deterrent effect of the death penalty."
2020-10-05-T-095-S-01405,2020-10-05-T-095,1405,K Shanmugam,"The introduction of the death penalty for kidnapping under the Punishment of Kidnapping Ordinance in 1961 likewise resulted in a dramatic drop in such cases. In the three years before 1961, there were on average, 29 kidnapping cases a year in Singapore. But this fell to only one case in 1961. Except for six cases in 1964 and three cases in 2003, kidnapping cases have not exceeded two cases per year since the death penalty was introduced. At Annex 2 is a chart showing this."
2020-10-05-T-095-S-01406,2020-10-05-T-095,1406,K Shanmugam,There is majority public support for the death penalty. Various surveys have been conducted which show this.
2020-10-05-T-095-S-01407,2020-10-05-T-095,1407,K Shanmugam,"The Member asked about whether there has been a study of the deterrent effect of the death penalty, in respect of persons whose reasoning capacity may have been compromised by mental illness. If the offender was of unsound mind at the time of the commission of the offence, the offender will be acquitted of the offence by reason of the defence of unsoundness of mind under section 84 of the Penal Code. This defence applies to all offences, including offences outside the Penal Code."
2020-10-05-T-095-S-01408,2020-10-05-T-095,1408,K Shanmugam,"The Member asked about cases involving offenders with addiction. Intoxication – whether induced by drugs or other substances – is a defence under section 85 of the Penal Code. However, the offender needs to show that as a result of the intoxication, he did not know what he was doing, or he did not know that his conduct was wrong, and the intoxication was caused without his knowledge or against his will."
2020-10-05-T-095-S-01409,2020-10-05-T-095,1409,K Shanmugam,"The Government has the responsibility to ensure the safety and security of Singaporeans, while maintaining a fair and just criminal justice system. The rights of offenders need to be considered, in the context of the rights of victims and the right of Singaporeans to live in safety and security."
2020-10-05-T-095-S-01410,2020-10-05-T-095,1410,K Shanmugam,The approach we have taken has resulted in Singapore being one of the safest places in the world to live. This is something deeply valued by Singaporeans.
2020-10-05-T-095-S-01411,2020-10-05-T-095,1411,K Shanmugam,"We invite the Member to share with MHA whether he is supportive of the death penalty, for what offences and why. And if he is against the death penalty, then it will also be useful to hear from him on his reasons for his position. The Member’s views will be given careful and respectful consideration."

2020-10-05-T-096-S-01415,2020-10-05-T-096,1415,Derrick Goh,asked the Minister for Law in the last three years (a) what is the number of court cases involving employers and their foreign domestic workers (FDWs); (b) what is the number of cases wherein the employer has been convicted; and (c) what is the number of cases wherein the FDW has been convicted.
2020-10-05-T-096-S-01416,2020-10-05-T-096,1416,K Shanmugam,"The agencies have considered the High Court judgment, and are conducting reviews. These reviews are still in progress."
2020-10-05-T-096-S-01417,2020-10-05-T-096,1417,K Shanmugam,"I will address the questions raised by Members, after the reviews are completed. I expect to do so at the November sitting. As I have indicated, I will be making a Ministerial Statement."
2020-10-05-T-097-S-01418,2020-10-05-T-097,1418,Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for Law for Singaporeans with mobility needs who encounter significant difficulty going out from the home, what avenues are available for them to obtain legal aid or pro bono legal services."
2020-10-05-T-097-S-01419,2020-10-05-T-097,1419,K Shanmugam,The Ministry of Law and our partners provide various avenues for individuals with mobility needs to obtain legal assistance without having to leave their homes.
2020-10-05-T-097-S-01420,2020-10-05-T-097,1420,K Shanmugam,"For such individuals seeking civil legal aid, the entire provision can be done remotely. Individuals can and are encouraged to submit their applications online via the Legal Aid Bureau's website1, and can correspond with the Bureau online or by telephone. Similarly, for criminal legal aid, applicants may complete an online declaration and application form on the Law Society Pro Bono Services’ website2. Subsequent communications can take place over the phone or via email. If the applicant is unable to use online modes of communication, we will try to assist the applicant over the phone."
2020-10-05-T-097-S-01421,2020-10-05-T-097,1421,K Shanmugam,"Persons in need of legal advice may also seek help and legal advice via video conferencing from the Law Society's Community Legal Clinics, as well as several other legal clinics."
2020-10-05-T-097-S-01422,2020-10-05-T-097,1422,K Shanmugam,"Members of the public can also access various online self-help tools. For example, the iLAB chatbot on the Legal Aid Bureau’s website provides tailored legal information on divorce, family violence and issues related to COVID-19, and can generate simple legal documents, and the Community Justice Centre's online Automated Court Document Assembly and Generation provides guidance in filing certain court forms."
2020-10-05-T-098-S-01423,2020-10-05-T-098,1423,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"asked the Minister for Law for each year since 2015, how many cases lodged with the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal (CDRT) for neighbourly disputes in HDB flats are in relation to neighbourly disputes involving (i) noise disturbances (ii) smoking and (iii) obstruction of common areas."
2020-10-05-T-098-S-01424,2020-10-05-T-098,1424,K Shanmugam,"The number of Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal (""CDRT"") claims filed to date in respect of certain complaints is as follows"
2020-10-05-T-098-S-01425,2020-10-05-T-098,1425,K Shanmugam,
2020-10-05-T-098-S-01426,2020-10-05-T-098,1426,K Shanmugam,State Courts does not track data on the type of dwelling involved in each claim and is unable to provide specific data on how many of the above claims involved disputes between HDB neighbours.
2020-10-05-T-099-S-01427,2020-10-05-T-099,1427,Joan Pereira,"asked the Minister for Health with smaller class sizes and most classes going virtual due to the continued threat of COVID-19, how can the Government ensure that courses tailored for the elderly are still effective and accessible."
2020-10-05-T-099-S-01428,2020-10-05-T-099,1428,Gan Kim Yong,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruptions to how people work, live and learn. However, the accelerated push towards digital delivery and services also presents new opportunities. The Government has worked closely with our stakeholders to ensure that learning opportunities for seniors continues to be accessible, effective and safe against the backdrop of COVID-19."
2020-10-05-T-099-S-01429,2020-10-05-T-099,1429,Gan Kim Yong,"Since March 2020, many face-to-face courses and activities have moved online, so seniors can continue to participate safely within their homes. For example, the Council for Third Age (C3A), Health Promotion Board (HPB), People’s Association (PA) and SportSG now make use of online platforms such as Facebook, ZOOM and YouTube to host their activities and talks."
2020-10-05-T-099-S-01430,2020-10-05-T-099,1430,Gan Kim Yong,"As many seniors are new to virtual classes, course providers put in extra effort to help them make the transition successfully. For example, they provide technical assistance before and during class, and adjust the course content based on real-time feedback so that seniors can keep pace with the class."
2020-10-05-T-099-S-01431,2020-10-05-T-099,1431,Gan Kim Yong,"To help seniors who are less digitally savvy access online content, the SG Digital Office (SDO) under the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) has mobilised 1,000 Digital Ambassadors to provide one-to-one coaching to seniors on useful day-to-day digital skills such as making video calls and use of smartphone apps. To date, Digital Ambassadors have engaged more than 21,500 seniors at 34 SG Digital Community Hubs in Community Centres/Clubs (CCs). In addition, IMDA is also partnering the Agency for Integrated Care's (AIC) Silver Generation Office (SGO) to reach more seniors in the heartlands through the digital clinics at the SGO Satellite Offices."
2020-10-05-T-099-S-01432,2020-10-05-T-099,1432,Gan Kim Yong,"Beyond online delivery, we have also worked with our stakeholders to make learning content accessible through traditional media platforms such as TV and radio which some seniors may be more familiar with. For instance, AIC and HPB worked with MediaCorp to air dedicated programmes for seniors aimed at improving their psycho-social wellbeing, especially during the circuit breaker period. These were broadcast in Chinese, Malay and Tamil, and reached around 445,000 seniors. Bite-sized health messages were also shared through the radio in all four languages to supplement the TV broadcast."
2020-10-05-T-099-S-01433,2020-10-05-T-099,1433,Gan Kim Yong,"With the resumption of small group activities for seniors since early September, many course providers have since moved towards a hybrid approach where courses can be offered both virtually and in-person. This improves both access and convenience for seniors."
2020-10-05-T-099-S-01434,2020-10-05-T-099,1434,Gan Kim Yong,"The Ministry of Health will continue to work with our stakeholders to explore novel ways of delivery, to ensure that learning opportunities for seniors continue to be effective, accessible and safe under the COVID-19 new normal."
2020-10-05-T-100-S-01435,2020-10-05-T-100,1435,Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there has been an upward trend over the past year of people seeking telemedicine; (b) what are the reasons for them seeking telemedicine; and (c) whether feedback from patients who have used telemedicine can be compiled and shared to enable the public who are thinking of using telemedicine to be well-informed.
2020-10-05-T-100-S-01436,2020-10-05-T-100,1436,Gan Kim Yong,The Ministry has observed a recent increase in the number of public and private healthcare providers offering telemedicine services. MOH does not track the number of persons seeking telemedicine services.
2020-10-05-T-100-S-01437,2020-10-05-T-100,1437,Gan Kim Yong,"The telemedicine Regulatory Sandbox was launched by MOH in 2018 to work with providers and gain a better understand of emerging telemedicine services. We understand that patients use telemedicine services mainly for greater convenience. Specifically, telemedicine enables easy access to care for those who are less mobile or otherwise unable to present themselves for an in-person consultation, saves time for those with conditions suitable for telemedicine (such as those with stable chronic conditions), and provides added convenience when combined with medication delivery."
2020-10-05-T-100-S-01438,2020-10-05-T-100,1438,Gan Kim Yong,"Providers should communicate clearly to patients the limitations of the service, as well as the appropriate and safe use of telemedicine. For instance, telemedicine is not suitable for conditions requiring immediate medical attention or a physical examination, and that the telemedicine consultation should allow for privacy of the patient. These insights have been collated into the MOH Telemedicine e-Training programme launched in March 2020 to guide healthcare professionals on designing and delivering telemedicine services that prioritise patient safety and welfare. To-date, over 5,000 healthcare professionals and administrators have completed this online training."
2020-10-05-T-100-S-01439,2020-10-05-T-100,1439,Gan Kim Yong,"With increasing use of telemedicine, MOH will also be improving patients' understanding of the safe and appropriate use of telemedicine through additional consumer education efforts planned in the coming months."
2020-10-05-T-101-S-01440,2020-10-05-T-101,1440,Sitoh Yih Pin,"asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the estimated timeline of when a viable rapid COVID-19 test kit will become widely available; and (b) whether this, coupled with universal contact tracing, can allow sectors such as aviation, hospitality and other related businesses to resume progressively."
2020-10-05-T-101-S-01441,2020-10-05-T-101,1441,Gan Kim Yong,"The Ministry of Health (MOH) currently deploys Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing using nasopharyngeal samples as the main mode of testing and sampling. As new testing technologies become available, MOH actively evaluates these alternative tests and sampling methods to ensure that they can be deployed in a safe and effective manner. The key evaluation considerations include  the combined clinical performance of the test and sampling method, ease of administration, throughput, total turnaround time when using the test, and cost."
2020-10-05-T-101-S-01442,2020-10-05-T-101,1442,Gan Kim Yong,"Some of the rapid COVID-19 test kits under evaluation are showing promising results. Increased testing facilitated by such rapid test kits, coupled with strengthened containment efforts including contact tracing, and adherence to appropriate safe management measures, have potential to allow us to resume more activities, including travel related industries and larger scale events. We hope to be able to deploy some of these alternative tests in the months ahead, as we work out practical ways to incorporate such rapid testing into our national COVID-19 response."
2020-10-05-T-101-S-01443,2020-10-05-T-101,1443,Gan Kim Yong,"While testing can help to reduce transmission risks, it is not foolproof. A negative test does not mean that an individual is free from COVID-19. For example, an individual who may be incubating the virus might not be picked up at the point of test."
2020-10-05-T-101-S-01444,2020-10-05-T-101,1444,Gan Kim Yong,"We therefore need to combine testing with contact tracing and other public health measures. The public must also continue to adhere to safe management measures such as the wearing of masks, practising good personal hygiene, and observing safe distancing, to keep everyone safe."
2020-10-05-T-102-S-01445,2020-10-05-T-102,1445,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the number of people who have called the National CARE Hotline since the COVID-19 pandemic started; (b) what is the percentage of repeat callers; and (c) whether there are any plans to better support residents who are facing mental resilience issues in this prolonged fight against COVID-19.
2020-10-05-T-102-S-01446,2020-10-05-T-102,1446,Gan Kim Yong,"The National CARE Hotline (NCH) has managed over 30,000 calls since it commenced on 10 April 2020. Of these, over 12,000 calls required mental health support, and were handled by Duty CARE Officers (DCOs). The DCOs are trained to provide mental health first aid and make the appropriate referrals either to public healthcare institutions or community service providers to follow up if necessary. The remaining calls were regarding other needs such as finance and employment issues and were directed to the appropriate hotlines. As individuals’ mobile numbers are not tracked, the NCH does not have information on the number of repeat callers."
2020-10-05-T-102-S-01447,2020-10-05-T-102,1447,Gan Kim Yong,"The COVID-19 pandemic has generated increased stresses for individuals in Singapore. To help individuals build resilience to cope with this crisis, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) created ""Stay Well to Stay Strong"", a one-stop resource hub at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. This resource hub provides individuals of all ages with useful tips and ideas on how they can maintain a healthy lifestyle and stay mentally well. In addition to exercise videos and healthier meal recipes, the portal also provides articles, infographics and tools to help individuals manage their stress and emotions, as well as maintain a positive outlook. Since its launch in February, the resource hub has reached out to over 450,000 users and has garnered over 700,000 page visits, as of 21 September 2020."
2020-10-05-T-102-S-01448,2020-10-05-T-102,1448,Gan Kim Yong,"HPB and the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth have also recently launched the ""Brave the New"" campaign in August. The campaign seeks to build psychological resilience among Singaporeans, by equipping them with skills to cope with challenging situations, and encouraging those who need additional support to seek help. As part of the campaign, Singaporeans can access information on how to care for themselves as well as others around them through the ""Brave the New"" website."
2020-10-05-T-102-S-01449,2020-10-05-T-102,1449,Gan Kim Yong,"Access to subsidised mental health services in the public healthcare institutions, polyclinics, and the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) General Practitioners is available to those who require more support for their mental health needs."
2020-10-05-T-103-S-01450,2020-10-05-T-103,1450,Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Health what further measures can public healthcare institutions put in place to promote and increase public awareness among patients of the option of medication delivery.
2020-10-05-T-103-S-01451,2020-10-05-T-103,1451,Gan Kim Yong,"Public healthcare institutions have been providing medication delivery services since 2003, and uptake has increased tenfold during the COVID-19 pandemic."
2020-10-05-T-103-S-01452,2020-10-05-T-103,1452,Gan Kim Yong,"Public healthcare institutions are promoting public awareness of the service over different mediums (videos, pamphlets, posters and signages) at patient waiting areas as well as the websites and mobile apps of the healthcare institutions. A summary of available services is also available on MOH’s HealthHub one stop-portal and mobile app and the website of the Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore."
2020-10-05-T-103-S-01453,2020-10-05-T-103,1453,Gan Kim Yong,"In addition, staff at public healthcare institutions actively inform eligible patients about medication delivery options through their clinics, pharmacies, call centers and other patient touch points. In some instances, patients who meet the criteria for the service might be automatically enrolled."
2020-10-05-T-103-S-01454,2020-10-05-T-103,1454,Gan Kim Yong,"Besides medicine delivery services, selected polyclinics also offer the option of medicine collection from Pilbox lockers, selected parcel deposit lockers or certain retail pharmacy outlets. These services are advertised through notices at the pharmacy and on the polyclinic website."
2020-10-05-T-103-S-01455,2020-10-05-T-103,1455,Gan Kim Yong,Patients may approach the pharmacy staff at the public healthcare institutions for more information and to arrange for medication delivery or collection.
2020-10-05-T-104-S-01456,2020-10-05-T-104,1456,Lim Wee Kiak,asked the Minister for Health what is the progress on developing the Woodlands Health Campus and whether this has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
2020-10-05-T-104-S-01457,2020-10-05-T-104,1457,Gan Kim Yong,"Singapore’s construction industry has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This is due to disruptions to international supply chains and construction manpower availability, and the implementation of the Circuit Breaker from April to June this year, which led to the suspension of most construction activities during that period."
2020-10-05-T-104-S-01458,2020-10-05-T-104,1458,Gan Kim Yong,"While construction works at our healthcare development sites have gradually resumed since the Circuit Breaker measures were lifted in June, they have not reached the pre-COVID pace as the resumption of work needs to be done in a safe and controlled manner and in phases to minimise the risk of new COVID-19 outbreaks. Based on our current assessment, these disruptions may result in delays by up to a year or so for many of our healthcare infrastructure projects. This includes Woodlands Health Campus (WHC), which was originally scheduled to progressively open from 2022. It is now scheduled to open from 2023 instead."
2020-10-05-T-104-S-01459,2020-10-05-T-104,1459,Gan Kim Yong,"Similarly, the Tan Tock Seng Hospital Integrated Care Hub and the Singapore General Hospital Emergency Medicine Building are now expected to open one year later in 2023 and 2024 respectively. The new polyclinics in Eunos, Kallang and Bukit Panjang, which were originally planned to open by end-2020, are now expected to open by end-2021."
2020-10-05-T-104-S-01460,2020-10-05-T-104,1460,Gan Kim Yong,"As the COVID-19 situation is evolving and construction works are still ramping up progressively, we can expect further changes in the timelines for the completion of our healthcare facilities."
2020-10-05-T-104-S-01461,2020-10-05-T-104,1461,Gan Kim Yong,"These delays in the completion of our public healthcare infrastructure projects may have an impact on overall healthcare capacity in the short term. MOH is thus exploring other measures to expand capacity within our existing facilities, and to reduce the demand on our public healthcare institutions, for example through the promotion of telemedicine and community-based care options."
2020-10-05-T-105-S-01462,2020-10-05-T-105,1462,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Health (a) in each year of the past five years, for systemic lupus erythematosus and spondyloarthritis respectively, what is (i) the number of Singaporeans and permanent residents with the condition and (ii) the number of unique patients seeking outpatient care in public hospitals; and (b) whether the Ministry will start collecting this data if it is not available."
2020-10-05-T-105-S-01463,2020-10-05-T-105,1463,Gan Kim Yong,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic multisystem autoimmune disease that has a wide range of clinical manifestations that can affect virtually any organ. Spondyloarthritis is the term for a group of diseases that causes inflammation in the spine and joints.
2020-10-05-T-105-S-01464,2020-10-05-T-105,1464,Gan Kim Yong,Available data on the total number of unique patients with SLE and spondyloarthritis seeking outpatient care at Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOC) in public health institutions (PHIs) over the past five years is presented in the table below
2020-10-05-T-105-S-01465,2020-10-05-T-105,1465,Gan Kim Yong,
2020-10-05-T-106-S-01466,2020-10-05-T-106,1466,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Health in each of the last five years, how many patients have been treated in polyclinics and CHAS clinics for chronic conditions that are not one of the 20 chronic conditions included the Chronic Disease Management Programme."
2020-10-05-T-106-S-01467,2020-10-05-T-106,1467,Gan Kim Yong,The number of patients treated in polyclinics for chronic conditions not under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP) from 2014 to 2018 are shown in Table 1. Allergic rhinitis and soft tissue disorders were some examples of non-CDMP chronic conditions seen.
2020-10-05-T-106-S-01468,2020-10-05-T-106,1468,Gan Kim Yong,"MOH does not have comprehensive data on patients with non-CDMP chronic conditions who are treated at Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) GP clinics, as we do not collect data for patient visits where CDMP/CHAS subsidies are not claimed."
2020-10-05-T-106-S-01469,2020-10-05-T-106,1469,Gan Kim Yong,
2020-10-05-T-106-S-01470,2020-10-05-T-106,1470,Gan Kim Yong,"CDMP was introduced to help patients manage their chronic conditions well and reduce out-of-pocket costs through the use of Medisave. MOH regularly reviews the list of conditions covered under CDMP to meet the needs of Singaporeans, while ensuring that Medisave balances are not prematurely depleted."
2020-10-05-T-106-S-01471,2020-10-05-T-106,1471,Gan Kim Yong,"We have increased the coverage of chronic conditions under CDMP and by extension, CHAS coverage, from 15 conditions in 2014 to 19 conditions in 2015, and then to 20 conditions in 2018."
2020-10-05-T-106-S-01472,2020-10-05-T-106,1472,Gan Kim Yong,"Conditions for CDMP are selected in consultation with clinical experts in a CDMP Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC), based on various considerations, such as disease prevalence, effectiveness of early intervention to reduce complications and availability of clear guidelines to support their coverage under CDMP. MOH will continue to work with the CDMP CAC to review the conditions to be covered under CDMP."
2020-10-05-T-106-S-01473,2020-10-05-T-106,1473,Gan Kim Yong,"Patients with chronic conditions not covered under CDMP can still tap on the usual subsidies at polyclinics as well as CHAS Acute subsidies at CHAS GPs for the management of their conditions. Patients who face financial difficulties for the management of their chronic conditions, regardless of whether such conditions are included in the CDMP, can tap on financial assistance, including MediFund, at public healthcare institutions."
2020-10-05-T-107-S-01474,2020-10-05-T-107,1474,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Health in each of the last five years, how many patients reached their annual MediSave withdrawal limit of (i) $500 allowed under the Chronic Disease Management Programme and (ii) $200 allowed under the outpatient Flexi-MediSave scheme."
2020-10-05-T-107-S-01475,2020-10-05-T-107,1475,Gan Kim Yong,"The annual MediSave withdrawal limit for the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP) was raised from $400 to $500 per year in June 2018. In 2019, less than 15% of patients reached the $500 withdrawal limit, most of whom had complex conditions. To better support patients with complex chronic conditions, we have further increased the withdrawal limit to $700 for those receiving treatments for two or more conditions under the CDMP from 1 January 2021 onwards."
2020-10-05-T-107-S-01476,2020-10-05-T-107,1476,Gan Kim Yong,"The age limit for Flexi-MediSave was lowered from 65 to 60 in June 2018. Patients aged 60 and above can withdraw up to a combined total of $200 per year from their own or their spouse’s MediSave accounts under the Flexi-MediSave scheme, for treatments at public Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOCs), polyclinics, and GP clinics under the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS). This may be used for standalone outpatient expenses, or in conjunction with other outpatient MediSave schemes, such as MediSave for CDMP mentioned above. In 2019, fewer than 2 in 10 of those eligible to use Flexi-MediSave reached the annual $200 limit."
2020-10-05-T-107-S-01477,2020-10-05-T-107,1477,Gan Kim Yong,"We will continue to review the MediSave withdrawal limits regularly, to strike a balance between helping Singaporeans pay for their current healthcare services and retaining sufficient savings for their longer-term needs. Those who cannot afford their treatment after subsidies and MediSave can approach the medical social workers for MediFund and other financial assistance."
2020-10-05-T-108-S-01478,2020-10-05-T-108,1478,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Health in each of the last five years, how many patients have reached (i) their monthly $450 MediSave withdrawal limit for renal dialysis outpatient treatment and (ii) their monthly $1,200 MediSave withdrawal limit for chemotherapy."
2020-10-05-T-108-S-01479,2020-10-05-T-108,1479,Gan Kim Yong,"Singaporeans can claim up to $1,000 monthly from MediShield Life and withdraw up to $450 monthly from their own MediSave accounts for their renal dialysis treatment. From 2015 to 2019, fewer than 1 in 5 patients reached the $450 monthly withdrawal for renal dialysis treatment. This proportion has remained stable year on year."
2020-10-05-T-108-S-01480,2020-10-05-T-108,1480,Gan Kim Yong,"Singaporeans can claim up to $3,000 monthly from MediShield Life and withdraw up to $1,200 monthly from MediSave for their chemotherapy treatment. From 2015 to 2019, approximately 1 in 10 patients reached the $1,200 monthly withdrawal limit for their chemotherapy treatment. This proportion has remained stable year on year."
2020-10-05-T-108-S-01481,2020-10-05-T-108,1481,Gan Kim Yong,"We will continue to review the MediShield Life and MediSave withdrawal limits regularly, to ensure that healthcare remains affordable for Singaporeans. Those who cannot afford their treatment after subsidies, MediShield Life and MediSave can approach the medical social workers for MediFund and other financial assistance."
2020-10-05-T-109-S-01482,2020-10-05-T-109,1482,Tan Wu Meng,asked the Minister for Health over the past three years (a) what has been (i) the screening rate for breast cancer and (ii) the rate of late-stage breast cancer diagnosis; and (b) how do these rates compare across (i) housing types and (ii) household income deciles.
2020-10-05-T-109-S-01483,2020-10-05-T-109,1483,Gan Kim Yong,"The screening rate for breast cancer is 38.7% in 2019, up from 30.9% in 2017. This improvement is seen for all socio-economic groups when we take educational levels as a proxy (as household income will vary across time). However, while the breast cancer screening rate is around 50% for women with tertiary level of education, it is 28% for women with primary level of education. The rate of late stage breast cancer diagnosis at Stages III and IV amongst Singapore women has remained relatively consistent at 28.6% between the five-year interval of 2009 to 2013 and 26.9% between 2014 to 2018."
2020-10-05-T-109-S-01484,2020-10-05-T-109,1484,Gan Kim Yong,"We will continue to encourage women to go for regular screening. Misconceptions and fears are common barriers – some examples include thinking that screening isn’t necessary when one feels healthy, that 'it's better not to know', and that mammograms are painful. To counter these misconceptions, HPB and its partners will continue to conduct annual breast cancer awareness campaigns and on-the-ground activities, as well as reach out to women via social media."
2020-10-05-T-110-S-01485,2020-10-05-T-110,1485,Jamus Jerome Lim,"asked the Minister for Health in light of the recent relaxations on meetings, incentives, conferencing and exhibition (MICE) events allowing for gatherings of up to 250 people, whether there is a specific timeline that the Ministry is considering for key life events, in particular weddings."
2020-10-05-T-110-S-01486,2020-10-05-T-110,1486,Gan Kim Yong,"Since 3 October 2020, we have increased the cap for marriage solemnisations to 100 persons, and allowed wedding receptions to increase up to the same cap. Organisers and venue operators are required to put in place the necessary safe management measures, including having no more than 50 persons in each zone or time slot. From next month, we will also be launching a pilot for wedding receptions to be held in common areas of Housing Development Board estates."
2020-10-05-T-110-S-01487,2020-10-05-T-110,1487,Gan Kim Yong,"The risk of transmission at weddings is high because of the tendency of attendees to socialise while celebrating a joyous occasion together with relatives and close friends. Attendees are also likely to be unmasked as they enjoy the meal and/or take photos together, further increasing the risk of transmission. We are therefore taking a cautious approach to the expansion of caps for weddings and other similar social gatherings, and will continue to monitor the situation before considering further expansion in attendee caps."
2020-10-05-T-111-S-01488,2020-10-05-T-111,1488,Tin Pei Ling,asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether he can provide an update on the digital ambassador outreach effort since its implementation.
2020-10-05-T-111-S-01489,2020-10-05-T-111,1489,S Iswaran,"Since the SG Digital Office (SDO) was established in June this year, it has mobilised 1,000 Digital Ambassadors (DAs) to drive e-payment adoption among stallholders under the 'Hawkers Go Digital' programme, and equip seniors with digital skills under 'Seniors Go Digital'. Through these efforts, more than 7,200 stallholders have signed-up for the SGQR Unified e-Payment solution. Our DAs have also engaged more than 21,500 seniors at the 34 SG Digital Community Hubs at community centres that SDO has set up island-wide. 21 more community hubs will be set up at our libraries in the coming months."
2020-10-05-T-111-S-01490,2020-10-05-T-111,1490,S Iswaran,"There have been good outcomes from SDO’s efforts. In a survey of seniors who completed SDO’s training programmes in July, 95% were satisfied with the training they received, and 80% continued to apply at least one digital skill that they had learnt. We have also seen a 65% increase in SGQR transactions since the launch of Hawkers Go Digital."
2020-10-05-T-111-S-01491,2020-10-05-T-111,1491,S Iswaran,"SDO is also working with partners to amplify its efforts. To support digital skilling of seniors, SDO has partnered with community organisations such as Youth Corps Singapore to support the rollout of digital training at Senior Activity Centres. For businesses and hawkers, SDO has been working closely with grassroot volunteers to reach out to stallholders, and is supporting IMDA and ESG's joint efforts to uplift digitalisation capabilities in the heartlands."
2020-10-05-T-111-S-01492,2020-10-05-T-111,1492,S Iswaran,"SDO will sustain its efforts to support all Singaporeans as Singapore continues its digitalisation journey. We encourage our seniors to visit SDO’s community hubs and engage with our DAs and volunteers, who can help them to go digital."
2020-10-05-T-112-S-01493,2020-10-05-T-112,1493,Don Wee,asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what is the utilisation rate of NLB's book dispenser located at Lot One shopping mall; and (b) whether NLB will consider installing such book dispensers at the void decks of HDB rental blocks with higher densities of young families.
2020-10-05-T-112-S-01494,2020-10-05-T-112,1494,S Iswaran,"The National Library Board (NLB) is currently piloting the book dispenser at Lot One shopping mall, as a temporary replacement for the Choa Chu Kang Public Library (CCKPL), which is being revamped. With the book dispenser, patrons can borrow from a selection of curated books and collect reserved items. Between its launch on 17 July and 15 September 2020, the book dispenser has generated around 4,200 loans."
2020-10-05-T-112-S-01495,2020-10-05-T-112,1495,S Iswaran,"NLB will review the utilisation and cost effectiveness at the end of this pilot project when CCKPL reopens in 2021, before evaluating whether to deploy the book dispenser more widely. Any further deployment should complement the existing network of 26 public libraries across Singapore, which makes public libraries accessible for most Singaporeans. NLB also runs outreach programmes to bring library books to under-reached and under-privileged groups. In addition, reading corners have been set up in partner spaces such as Community Centres, Senior Activity Centres and Family Service Centres."
2020-10-05-T-113-S-01496,2020-10-05-T-113,1496,Cheng Li Hui,asked the Minister for Communications and Information with regard to the Auditor-General's Report detailing that the National Archives project exceeded its renovation budget by $1.72 million due to a lack of scrutiny (a) when is the internal review expected to be completed; and (b) whether the review will also look into ways to strengthen internal financial controls.
2020-10-05-T-113-S-01497,2020-10-05-T-113,1497,S Iswaran,NLB takes a serious view of the lapses identified by the AGO in its 2019/2020 financial year report. It has since completed its internal review of the lapses and has further tightened its procurement and contract management processes. Enhancements have been made to the contract variation and project monitoring processes to ensure timely and well-documented approvals for all variation works. NLB has also taken disciplinary action against the staff involved in these lapses.
2020-10-05-T-114-S-01498,2020-10-05-T-114,1498,Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry will look into ways in which the advantages of biodegradable plastics may be harnessed and advertised so as to reduce reliance on Singapore's landfill.
2020-10-05-T-114-S-01499,2020-10-05-T-114,1499,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Plastic waste generated in Singapore is either recycled or incinerated. Unlike in many other countries, plastic waste is not landfilled directly. As such, the environmental benefits of using biodegradable plastics do not apply in Singapore’s context. Biodegradable as well as oxo-degradable plastics could even interfere with the recycling process when mixed with conventional plastics."
2020-10-05-T-114-S-01500,2020-10-05-T-114,1500,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"A more sustainable approach for Singapore is to reduce the use of all disposables and increase the recycling of plastics. We are doing this through public education, and upstream regulation through the Resource Sustainability Act that will mandate key responsibilities to enable recycling at the systems-level."
2020-10-05-T-114-S-01501,2020-10-05-T-114,1501,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"To raise awareness of the impact of excessive consumption of disposables and the need to reduce usage, the National Environment Agency (NEA) launched the second run of the nationwide ""Say YES to Waste Less"" campaign last month. Operators of more than 2,100 premises have partnered NEA to encourage consumers to bring reusables and decline disposables for takeaways and online food orders. NEA also started a Citizens' Workgroup last month to address the excessive consumption of disposables."
2020-10-05-T-114-S-01502,2020-10-05-T-114,1502,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Moving upstream, NEA will be rolling out mandatory reporting of packaging waste for large generators as well as their plans for reducing, reusing or recycling packaging from 2021. This will increase companies' awareness of the potential for waste reduction in their business operations. We will also implement a Deposit Refund Scheme (DRS) for beverage containers from 2022 and the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework for managing packaging waste, including plastics, no later than 2025. Collectively, these measures will help to reduce plastic waste and improve its recycling rate, and contribute to the effort to extend the lifespan of Semakau Landfill."
2020-10-05-T-115-S-01503,2020-10-05-T-115,1503,Tin Pei Ling,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether there has been an increase in rat sightings since the circuit breaker period and what measures are in place to address them.
2020-10-05-T-115-S-01504,2020-10-05-T-115,1504,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"During the circuit breaker period in April and May 2020, an average of about 350 instances of feedback on rat sightings were reported each month. Of these, an average of 23 instances of feedback were received by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) in relation to sightings at food establishments monthly, while the rest were received by the National Environment Agency (NEA) in relation to sightings at other public spaces."
2020-10-05-T-115-S-01505,2020-10-05-T-115,1505,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"To keep the incidence of rat infestation low, NEA carries out islandwide surveillance to identify places which can attract rats, such as bin chutes where food waste is not well-managed. The surveillance information is shared with relevant government agencies and Town Councils (TCs) so that they can take preventive measures, such as improving housekeeping and conducting rat proofing works. NEA incentivises TCs with funding under the Rat Attack Programme to implement customised rat control measures in public housing estates. NEA also conducts regular inspections to ensure that agencies, TCs and premises owners implement adequate rat control measures and proper waste management practices, and will take enforcement action against them for any rat infestation."
2020-10-05-T-115-S-01506,2020-10-05-T-115,1506,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Similarly, SFA requires operators of food establishments to keep their premises clean and free of pest infestations, including rats. Operators must have a pest control contract to ensure that their premises are free of pest infestation. It is also their responsibility to keep their premises clean and well-maintained; and failure to do so constitutes an offence. Repeated offences or serious offences can result in suspension or even cancellation of the food establishment's licence. SFA conducts regular inspections at food establishments to ensure that they comply with food hygiene and safety, including keeping their premises free from rat infestation. These inspections continued during the circular breaker period. From January to August 2020, more than 40,000 inspections were conducted on food establishments."
2020-10-05-T-115-S-01507,2020-10-05-T-115,1507,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"While we keep up the rat surveillance and control measures in Singapore, all stakeholders have the responsibility to institute a robust system of housekeeping, refuse management and regular pest control checks and treatment. Members of the public, operators of food establishments, and businesses are advised to store food properly in covered containers, not to leave food or food waste behind, and to bag, tie and properly dispose of food waste into covered bins."
2020-10-05-T-116-S-01508,2020-10-05-T-116,1508,Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment how will the Ministry engage with supermarkets and consumers to reduce plastic pre-packaging of fruits and vegetables.
2020-10-05-T-116-S-01509,2020-10-05-T-116,1509,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Plastic pre-packaging for fruits and vegetables has practical uses, such as extending shelf life and minimising cross contamination. Nevertheless, my Ministry recognises the need to avoid excessive use of all packaging, including plastic pre-packaging."
2020-10-05-T-116-S-01510,2020-10-05-T-116,1510,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Next year, we will implement the mandatory packaging reporting framework, where producers of packaged products as well as retailers such as supermarkets with an annual turnover of more than $10 million will have to submit packaging data and plans to reduce, reuse or recycle packaging. This will make companies more aware of their packaging use (including plastic pre-packaging of fruits and vegetables) and encourage them to minimise waste and reduce business costs. The reporting framework will lay the foundation for an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework to manage packaging waste including plastics, which will be put in place no later than 2025. The EPR ensures that producers are responsible for the collection and end-of-life management of the packaging materials for their products, and encourages producers to reduce the amount of packaging used."
2020-10-05-T-116-S-01511,2020-10-05-T-116,1511,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"To complement the regulatory measures, the National Environment Agency (NEA) is also encouraging supermarkets and consumers to reduce the use of packaging for grocery shopping through the ""Say YES to Waste Less"" national campaign. For example, a partner of this campaign, Dairy Farm Singapore, has provided visual cues at the fresh produce plastic roll stands to encourage customers to reduce usage of plastic bags when bagging fruits and vegetables. NEA is also raising awareness of packaging-free grocery stores such as Unpackt and Scoop, where consumers are encouraged to bring their own containers and buy what they need."
2020-10-05-T-116-S-01512,2020-10-05-T-116,1512,Grace Fu Hai Yien,My Ministry and the NEA will continue to work closely with all stakeholders to reduce the consumption of all types of packaging and move towards becoming a Zero Waste Nation.
2020-10-05-T-117-S-01513,2020-10-05-T-117,1513,Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what are the protocols for enforcement of safe distancing measures at coffeeshops and hawker centres in HDB heartlands after office hours; and (b) how are safe distancing ambassadors trained to handle drunk and rowdy patrons.
2020-10-05-T-117-S-01514,2020-10-05-T-117,1514,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Compliance with Safe Management Measures (SMMs) and Safe Distancing Measures (SDMs) is an important part of Singapore's national effort to curb the transmission of COVID-19.
2020-10-05-T-117-S-01515,2020-10-05-T-117,1515,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Every day, around 3,000 Safe Distancing Ambassadors and Enforcement Officers from government agencies are deployed to enforce these measures, with more being deployed during peak dining hours and weekends, and in more crowded hawker centres and coffeeshops. They take on different shifts, starting as early as 6am for certain areas."
2020-10-05-T-117-S-01516,2020-10-05-T-117,1516,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In recent weeks, agencies have stepped up enforcement at Food and Beverage establishments, including hawker centres and coffeeshops. As at 1 October 2020, three drinks stalls at coffeeshops have been temporarily suspended for serving and allowing the consumption of alcohol by their patrons after 10.30pm. Two coffeeshops were fined for not adhering to one metre safe distancing between tables, and another was fined for allowing gatherings in groups of more than five."
2020-10-05-T-117-S-01517,2020-10-05-T-117,1517,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Before they are deployed, our ambassadors and officers are trained on the safe distancing and management measures, as well as the rules of engagement with premise operators and members of the public. They are deployed in teams of at least two officers and the more experienced staff will be partnered with new officers to guide and support them. They are reminded not to put themselves in harm’s way, and to engage the assistance of the Police when needed. While most residents in the community have been cooperative, a small number of individuals have been defiant and abusive, especially when they are drunk and rowdy. For such cases, agencies were given the full support of the Police in identifying, apprehending and eventually charging the culprits."
2020-10-05-T-117-S-01518,2020-10-05-T-117,1518,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Enforcement is only but a part of how we manage the COVID-19 pandemic with the aim of keeping our community safe. What is equally, if not more important, is the cooperation from premise operators and the community to do their part in observing the safe distancing and management measures, even when there are no ambassadors and officers around, so that we continue to keep community transmission under control."
2020-10-05-T-118-S-01519,2020-10-05-T-118,1519,Sharael Taha,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether there is any criteria to determine the number and size of wet markets in a town; and (b) if so, whether there are plans to review and upgrade the wet markets in towns that are growing in size."
2020-10-05-T-118-S-01520,2020-10-05-T-118,1520,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Most of our markets were built as part of hawker centres between 1967 and 1985, to resettle street hawkers into purpose-built buildings such as those built in new public housing estates to serve the residents’ needs."
2020-10-05-T-118-S-01521,2020-10-05-T-118,1521,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Over time, consumer trends and preferences have shifted due to changing demographics, as well as the widespread availability of alternative options such as supermarkets and online retailers. Wet markets in their current form have gradually become less popular. Thus, when these older markets underwent the Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme from 2001 to 2013, market stalls vacated by stallholders retiring from the trade were removed to free up space for wider passageways and bigger areas for the remaining stalls. Similarly, when the Government announced in 2011 that it would restart the building of hawker centres, efforts were focused on increasing the number of cooked food stalls in new estates or existing estates with insufficient affordable eating options."
2020-10-05-T-118-S-01522,2020-10-05-T-118,1522,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Currently, the provision of new markets or expansion of existing ones will be considered only if there is strong demand and support, or where there is a shortage of other sources of market produce in the area. This is to ensure the viability of the market stalls. From our experience, new markets, such as the one at Jurong West Hawker Centre, have generally not fared well. The concept of future markets would need to evolve to meet the emerging needs and preferences of consumers who have the options to buy online and from full-day, even 24-hour, supermarkets. To this end, the National Environment Agency will continue to work with relevant government agencies and the community to monitor the situation and ensure that residents’ needs are met."
2020-10-05-T-119-S-01523,2020-10-05-T-119,1523,Tin Pei Ling,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how have businesses in the Central Business District been affected since the circuit breaker period; and (b) whether there will be a special assistance package to help these affected businesses.
2020-10-05-T-119-S-01524,2020-10-05-T-119,1524,Chan Chun Sing,"Since the end of the Circuit Breaker on 1 June 2020, Singapore has gradually resumed activities across sectors. Most businesses in the CBD have also been gradually allowed to reopen. However, as many employees continue to work from home, footfall in the CBD has yet to return to normal levels and sales for F&B and retail establishments in the CBD have remained sluggish."
2020-10-05-T-119-S-01525,2020-10-05-T-119,1525,Chan Chun Sing,"On 23 September 2020, the Government announced a revised set of workplace safe management measures, whereby amongst other measures, employees who are able to work-from-home may return to the workplace, subject to various rules, to better support work and business operations. While working from home will remain as the default mode of working, more employees are likely to head back to their workplace and business within the CBD will likely improve."
2020-10-05-T-119-S-01526,2020-10-05-T-119,1526,Chan Chun Sing,"The Government is aware of the difficult situation businesses are in. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Heng Swee Keat, had unveiled four budgets totalling close to $100 billion to support people and businesses in this crisis. These include the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) and various loan schemes to ease the cash flow for businesses."
2020-10-05-T-119-S-01527,2020-10-05-T-119,1527,Chan Chun Sing,We are also providing support for businesses to transform themselves and build new revenue streams. These include schemes such as the   (a) Enterprise Development Grant (EDG) with a support level of up to 90% for businesses to grow and transform; (b) Productivity Solutions Grant with a support level of up to 80% for businesses to adopt proven pre-scoped solutions (e.g. IT solutions) and (c) e-Commerce Booster Package which supports 90% of the costs for retailers to on-board e-commerce platforms.
2020-10-05-T-119-S-01528,2020-10-05-T-119,1528,Chan Chun Sing,We encourage enterprises in the CBD and elsewhere to leverage these schemes to strengthen their businesses.
2020-10-05-T-120-S-01529,2020-10-05-T-120,1529,Christopher de Souza,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Ministry will consider implementing virus drills whereby certain pockets of industries can take turns to implement business continuity plans for one week including the distribution of masks and other essential items, such as hand sanitisers, to employees."
2020-10-05-T-120-S-01530,2020-10-05-T-120,1530,Chan Chun Sing,"The Ministry fully agrees that businesses must prepare themselves for disruptions arising from COVID-19 and other public health emergencies. That is why Enterprise Singapore released a guide on ""Business Continuity Planning for COVID-19"" to help companies, especially small and medium sized enterprises, put in place a basic Business Continuity Plan (BCP) to deal with the COVID-19 situation. This includes protocols to maintain a safe workplace, handle employees who may be COVID-19 positive, and recommendations to diversify supply chains and staffing arrangements so that the company can continue operating under different scenarios."
2020-10-05-T-120-S-01531,2020-10-05-T-120,1531,Chan Chun Sing,We will consider the Member's suggestion to implement 'virus drills' as we continue working with the business community to enhance their preparation for COVID-19.
2020-10-05-T-121-S-01532,2020-10-05-T-121,1532,Yeo Wan Ling,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how many companies applying for Enterprise Singapore's financing support schemes do not meet the minimum 30% local shareholding criterion; (b) how many of such companies have been granted financial support by Enterprise Singapore; and (c) whether concessions can be made for such companies with high levels of local employment.
2020-10-05-T-121-S-01533,2020-10-05-T-121,1533,Chan Chun Sing,"Enterprise Singapore (ESG)'s financing schemes involve a high degree of Government risk-sharing (50% to 90%). As such, we have imposed a minimum 30% local shareholding criterion to ensure that the schemes support mainly companies owned by Singaporeans."
2020-10-05-T-121-S-01534,2020-10-05-T-121,1534,Chan Chun Sing,"As of 30 September 2020, over 18,000 companies have taken up loans supported under the enhanced financing schemes. For companies that do not meet the eligibility criteria, ESG may consider exceptional cases on a case-by-case basis, based on factors such as their local employment and strategic importance to the economy. Six companies with local shareholding below 30% were supported under the enhanced financing schemes."
2020-10-05-T-122-S-01535,2020-10-05-T-122,1535,Gan Thiam Poh,asked asked the Minister for Education (a) what is the total number of children in the 2015 cohort in Fernvale constituency; and (b) whether the three primary schools in Fernvale constituency will be able to accommodate all the children in the 2015 cohort.
2020-10-05-T-122-S-01536,2020-10-05-T-122,1536,Lawrence Wong,"We have been closely monitoring the demand for Primary 1 (P1) places from the new housing developments in Sengkang i.e. within Fernvale, Anchorvale and Sengkang West areas. There are currently five primary schools within 1 kilometre and another 11 primary schools within 1 to 2 kilometres of Fernvale constituency. For this year’s P1 Registration Exercise, which is for the 2014 birth cohort, two out of these 16 schools have a total of about 70 vacancies remaining at the end of Phase 2C (Supplementary). For the 2015 birth cohort which will be registering in the 2021 P1 Registration Exercise, we have projected that there would be a similar number of P1 registrants as the recent 2020 P1 Registration Exercise, and thereafter, we expect demand for P1 places in Fernvale constituency to come down."
2020-10-05-T-122-S-01537,2020-10-05-T-122,1537,Lawrence Wong,"We will continue to ensure sufficient places for the area around Fernvale constituency, and if necessary, will consider adjusting the P1 intake in some primary schools where needed based on the latest estimate of P1 demand."
2020-10-05-T-123-S-01538,2020-10-05-T-123,1538,Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for Education how is the success of SkillsFuture and related Continuing Education and Training programmes measured in providing Singaporeans with opportunities for new careers and employability.
2020-10-05-T-123-S-01539,2020-10-05-T-123,1539,Lawrence Wong,"Since the launch of SkillsFuture movement in 2014, the Government has adopted a range of approaches to evaluate the outcomes of training."
2020-10-05-T-123-S-01540,2020-10-05-T-123,1540,Lawrence Wong,"We closely monitor placements for all placement-related training programmes. Since 2016, we have achieved 5140 placements via Professional Conversion Programmes, and 9554 placements via SSG's Train-and-Place programmes."
2020-10-05-T-123-S-01541,2020-10-05-T-123,1541,Lawrence Wong,The longer-term impact of training on outcomes such as employability and wages are also reviewed via longitudinal studies conducted every few years. A 2018 MTI study found that individuals who underwent Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) training were more employable and enjoyed a real wage premium of 5.8% in the year after training. A 2019 MTI study found that recent graduates of the SkillsFuture Work-Study post-diploma programme enjoyed a sustained wage premium of about 10% over polytechnic diploma graduates.
2020-10-05-T-123-S-01542,2020-10-05-T-123,1542,Lawrence Wong,"Additionally, we conduct surveys to collect feedback from key stakeholders such as employers. In the 2019 SkillsFuture Public Perception Survey, 77% of employers indicated that SkillsFuture training programmes had helped their employees take on more responsibilities, and 75% of them felt that SkillsFuture training programmes could help their company recruit and retain valued employees."
2020-10-05-T-123-S-01543,2020-10-05-T-123,1543,Lawrence Wong,"One of the ways we ensure better alignment of training to industry needs, is through training led by companies themselves. Companies such as Google, IBM and PBA Robotics have come on board the SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programme, to equip individuals with industry-relevant skills to boost their employability. We have also engaged SkillsFuture Queen Bee companies to train beyond their own needs and support skills upgrading for other companies in their industry and value chains, in particular for SMEs. These SkillsFuture Queen Bee companies help transfer their knowledge and impart their capabilities to employees of smaller companies, by co-creating industry-led skills and training solutions/programmes with SSG."
2020-10-05-T-124-S-01544,2020-10-05-T-124,1544,Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Education whether national education such as the meaning of the national anthem and meaning of the colours and symbols on our flag are taught in lower primary school.
2020-10-05-T-124-S-01545,2020-10-05-T-124,1545,Lawrence Wong,"At Primary 1, students learn to sing the National Anthem in their Music lessons and recit e"
2020-10-05-T-124-S-01546,2020-10-05-T-124,1546,Lawrence Wong,"Students' learning in these areas is then deepened over time. For example, Music teachers would revisit the National Anthem with their students in subsequent years, to go through commonly mispronounced words and help students understand the meaning of the lyrics. Similarly, in Primary 4 Social Studies, students delve more deeply into the significance of the National Symbols."
2020-10-05-T-124-S-01547,2020-10-05-T-124,1547,Lawrence Wong,"Resources such as animated videos are available to support these efforts. For example, we have videos that explain to lower primary students, in an engaging way, the significance of the National Anthem as well as the meaning of each line of its lyrics, as well as the compelling story of the origins of the National Anthem and its composer, Pak Zubir Said."
2020-10-05-T-124-S-01548,2020-10-05-T-124,1548,Lawrence Wong,All these efforts ensure that students understand the significance of singing the National Anthem and reciting the Pledge daily.
2020-10-05-T-125-S-01549,2020-10-05-T-125,1549,Raeesah Khan,"asked the Minister for Education (a) what types of support do students facing mental health issues receive in schools; (b) currently, what is the ratio of counsellors trained to work with students with mental health issues to students in primary, secondary, and tertiary institutions, including autonomous universities; (c) what is being done to ensure that students with mental health issues belonging to different income groups receive the support they need; (d) what is being done to de-stigmatise mental health issues in schools; and (e) whether the Ministry will consider annual reports tracking support for mental health issues in schools to be presented to Parliament."
2020-10-05-T-125-S-01550,2020-10-05-T-125,1550,Lawrence Wong,"MOE closely monitors the state of well-being of our students and is committed to meeting their needs. As part of Mental Health Education in the Character and Citizenship Education curriculum, students learn about mental health issues, coping skills, emotional regulation and help-seeking strategies. We are also strengthening peer support in schools, encouraging students to look out for each other’s well-being and to alert an adult if their peers are feeling distressed or struggling with mental health issues."
2020-10-05-T-125-S-01551,2020-10-05-T-125,1551,Lawrence Wong,"To destigmatise mental health issues, students are taught to show care, respect and empathy to all, including people with mental health issues. Discussions on related issues such as anxieties and uncertainties that students face, unhealthy expectations and social comparisons, stigma and other barriers to help-seeking also help to normalise conversations on mental health."
2020-10-05-T-125-S-01552,2020-10-05-T-125,1552,Lawrence Wong,"These efforts continue in the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), where curricular and co-curricular mental health programmes and peer support networks seek to further raise awareness, equip students with knowledge of mental health and build resilience."
2020-10-05-T-125-S-01553,2020-10-05-T-125,1553,Lawrence Wong,"As part of the eco-system of support, teachers and lecturers are trained to identify signs of distress in their students, monitor their well-being, and provide guidance and support. Counsellors also provide additional support to students who need it. Each primary school, secondary school and junior college has one to two counsellors while each polytechnic and ITE college has four to seven counsellors. The Autonomous Universities are similarly equipped with counsellors depending on their size and student profile. They are further augmented by a pool of Teacher Counsellors, Para-counsellors and Flexi-Adjunct Counsellors. For students who require further assessment and intervention, our counsellors tap on community mental health professionals such as the Response, Early Assessment and Intervention for Community Mental Health (REACH) teams and Community Health Assessment Team (CHAT)."
2020-10-05-T-125-S-01554,2020-10-05-T-125,1554,Lawrence Wong,"All students with social-emotional needs, including those with mental health issues, will receive the necessary support regardless of their family’s financial situation. Some schools also have Student Welfare Officers (SWOs) who mentor and provide social support to disadvantaged students and we plan to further expand the pool of SWOs. Our schools and IHLs work closely with community partners and social service agencies to support students and their families in a holistic manner, as well as to promote youth mental well-being."
2020-10-05-T-125-S-01555,2020-10-05-T-125,1555,Lawrence Wong,"MOE will continue to find different ways to put out information on the mental well-being of our students, and to raise public awareness. We are also mindful that students dealing with mental health issues, as well as their parents, often prefer to keep their issues and support they are receiving confidential and private. We have to respect their preferences and wishes, and find the right balance in tackling these difficult issues."
2020-10-05-T-126-S-01556,2020-10-05-T-126,1556,Cheng Li Hui,asked the Minister for Education with the rise in the number of young teens indulging in unprotected sexual activities and contracting HIV and other diseases (a) what are the Ministry's efforts to promote sex education; and (b) what is the Ministry doing to keep up with the changing attitudes towards sex among the young.
2020-10-05-T-126-S-01557,2020-10-05-T-126,1557,Lawrence Wong,"Our schools equip students with age-appropriate knowledge and skills to understand themselves, maintain healthy relationships, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters."
2020-10-05-T-126-S-01558,2020-10-05-T-126,1558,Lawrence Wong,"Students learn about media influence, cyber relationships, dating and romantic relationships, and the social-emotional and legal impact of sexual behaviours. They also learn about sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the consequences and impact of STIs/HIV, and protection against STIs/HIV."
2020-10-05-T-126-S-01559,2020-10-05-T-126,1559,Lawrence Wong,"The MOE Sexuality Education is reviewed regularly, taking into consideration emerging trends, local and international research, input from specialists in relevant fields and our local context. This ensures that the content is relevant and responsive to the changing attitudes of students towards sexuality matters."
2020-10-05-T-126-S-01560,2020-10-05-T-126,1560,Lawrence Wong,"As parents play a significant role in sexuality education, schools also work closely with parents to support their children."
2020-10-05-T-127-S-01561,2020-10-05-T-127,1561,Carrie Tan,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the manpower resourcing plan for the Home Visitation Programme under KidSTART, in terms of the number of home visitors the programme aims to hire in the next two to five years; (b) what are the required skills or eligibility criteria for home visitors that the programme is looking for; and (c) what is the job scope they are expected to perform."
2020-10-05-T-127-S-01562,2020-10-05-T-127,1562,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The KidSTART Home Visitation Programme aims to (a) help families optimise child health and developmental outcomes, (b) improve parents' knowledge and skills on child health, nutrition and development, and (c) promote parent-child bonding and positive interactions. Regular screening of the child’s developmental milestones as well as maternal well-being is also carried out to identify and address any concerns early."
2020-10-05-T-127-S-01563,2020-10-05-T-127,1563,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"To carry out this work scope, practitioners in the KidSTART Home Visitation Programme are professionals with backgrounds in early childhood, psychology, nursing, social work, counselling, or other related fields, and have relevant experience in the early childhood or social service sectors. They are hence skilled in advising on child development issues, conducting child developmental and maternal mental health screening, as well as a holistic assessment of the needs of children and families. In addition to case management and building rapport with the families, practitioners must also work collaboratively with community and social service agencies, and participate in multidisciplinary case reviews in order to provide child-focused support for the families."
2020-10-05-T-127-S-01564,2020-10-05-T-127,1564,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Over the next three years, in line with KidSTART's expansion plans, the number of practitioners in the Home Visitation Programme will increase from 19 today to 45. We will step up the recruitment for this group. Given the positive community interest to support KidSTART families, we are also looking to engage volunteers who are prepared to commit to supporting KidSTART families to complement the efforts of the practitioners."
2020-10-05-T-128-S-01565,2020-10-05-T-128,1565,Don Wee,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many children have been enrolled under the Enhanced Pilot for Private Intervention Providers (Enhanced PPIP) in 2017 and 2018; and (b) whether the quota of children can be increased.
2020-10-05-T-128-S-01566,2020-10-05-T-128,1566,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Enhanced Pilot for Private Intervention Providers (PPIP) involves private sector operators who provide developmental and therapy services for preschool-aged children who are at risk of moderate to severe developmental delays. It serves as a complement to the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC) run by social service agencies. Parents whose children are referred to EIPIC can choose to enrol their child in an approved PPIP programme, and children generally receive the same Early Intervention (EI) subsidies regardless of whether they enrol in PPIP or EIPIC."
2020-10-05-T-128-S-01567,2020-10-05-T-128,1567,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In 2018, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) increased the number of PPIP providers from 6 to 10. In 2019, to ensure that more children are able to access PPIP, MSF also worked with the PPIP providers to increase the number of PPIP places, based on the demand in their centre(s). The number of children served in PPIP therefore doubled from an annual average of 130 children for 2017 and 2018, to 266 children in 2019."
2020-10-05-T-128-S-01568,2020-10-05-T-128,1568,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MSF strives to ensure the adequate provision of EI services and to enhance our support for children with developmental needs. In addition to working with providers to maximise the current PPIP capacity, we are working on expanding the number of EIPIC places to serve children with moderate to severe developmental needs. We have also expanded the range of EI services within preschools to support more children with developmental needs. For example, we introduced the Development Support Plus (DS-Plus) programme last year, to cater to children who have made sufficient progress under EIPIC and are able to transit to receiving EI services within preschools. We have also set up the Inclusive Preschool Workgroup (IPWG) to develop recommendations on how to better support children with moderate to severe developmental needs within preschools."
2020-10-05-T-129-S-01569,2020-10-05-T-129,1569,Hany Soh,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the take-up rate of registering Lasting Powers of Attorney since the establishment of the Office of the Public Guardian; (b) what is the profile age groups of the applicants who have registered their Lasting Power of Attorney; and (c) whether the Office of the Public Guardian has plans to implement online registration for Lasting Powers of Attorney.
2020-10-05-T-129-S-01570,2020-10-05-T-129,1570,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As at 31 August 2020, there are 93,398 registered Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPAs)."

2020-10-05-T-129-S-01572,2020-10-05-T-129,1572,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As part of the overall digital transformation effort of the public service to better serve Singaporeans, we intend to allow LPAs to be made and registered online. We also intend to amend the Mental Capacity Act to allow this. We will share more details when ready."

2020-10-05-T-130-S-01575,2020-10-05-T-130,1575,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"ComCare provides assistance to low-income households for their basic living expenses. ComCare Long-Term Assistance (LTA) is provided to those who are permanently unable to work due to old age, illness or disability, and have little or no means of income and family support. Applicants who are unable to work and receiving some income such as allowance from their children or CPF-related payouts may also qualify if their income is insufficient for their basic needs. ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance (SMTA) and Interim Assistance (IA) have income eligibility criteria of a monthly household income of $1,900 and below or per capita household income of $650 and below. The number of applications for ComCare SMTA and IA where the applicant has exceeded the income eligibility criterion is summarised in"

2020-10-05-T-130-S-01577,2020-10-05-T-130,1577,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The income criteria for ComCare schemes are not hard thresholds. Each household that applies for ComCare assistance is considered on a case-by-case basis, to ensure that they receive the assistance that they need for their basic living expenses. For applicants who exceed the income criteria, we consider their respective circumstances and exercise some flexibility where warranted to provide ComCare or connect them with other relevant assistance. For example, households with higher essential expenses such as housing rental or children’s special education expenses may be provided ComCare even if their household income exceeds the criteria. The Social Service Office may also connect them with other assistance schemes and community organisations that can provide additional assistance or in-kind support to help them cover their expenses and address their needs."
2020-10-05-T-130-S-01578,2020-10-05-T-130,1578,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,MSF reviews the ComCare eligibility criteria every two to three years to ensure that ComCare objectives are being met. The last review was conducted in 2019. We do not have plans to review the income criteria in the next 12 months.

2020-10-05-T-131-S-01580,2020-10-05-T-131,1580,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As part of the national fight against COVID-19, the Malay/Muslim community, alongside other faith communities, has made important adjustments to their religious life. Both the young and old within the community recognise the need to adopt safe management measures in our religious activities, whilst coming forward to help those who are more vulnerable and in need."
2020-10-05-T-131-S-01581,2020-10-05-T-131,1581,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Our mosques are central to the religious life of the community. Our religious leaders have worked closely with healthcare professionals through the Malay/Muslim COVID-19 Working Group to proactively provide guidance on how we can adapt our religious practices to be COVID-safe.

2020-10-05-T-131-S-01583,2020-10-05-T-131,1583,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"(b)   The religious leadership, in consultation with MOH, made the early decision to defer this year’s Haj pilgrimage to the following year for the health and wellbeing of our pilgrims, while also protecting the wider community in Singapore from the risk of infection."
2020-10-05-T-131-S-01584,2020-10-05-T-131,1584,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"(c)   As the public health situation improved, we have progressively resumed Friday congregational prayers and worship services in a safe manner since the start of Phase Two. As of 25 September, 40 mosques have been cleared to provide 100 spaces for Friday congregational prayers. In addition to this, funeral prayers have also been allowed to be conducted at designated mosques, with the necessary safety measures in place. We will gradually allow more mosques to expand their worship services when they are ready, and the level of community transmission remains low."
2020-10-05-T-131-S-01585,2020-10-05-T-131,1585,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,(d)   I thank the community for their understanding on the limited prayer spaces and their cooperation with the mosques’ safe management measures. Muis will take into account the community’s feedback as it enhances the booking system for Friday prayer spaces.
2020-10-05-T-131-S-01586,2020-10-05-T-131,1586,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Muis has also worked closely with the mosques and asatizah to introduce new ways to support the community’s religious needs. Let me share some examples.

2020-10-05-T-131-S-01588,2020-10-05-T-131,1588,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,(b)   We added online components to aLIVE (Living Islamic Values Everyday) classes for children and ADIL (Adult Islamic Learning) for adults. 9 in 10 of parents surveyed agreed that their children enjoyed the home-based learning (HBL) component of the aLIVE programme. Muis has also provided a two-month 50% fee subsidy for aLIVE students who cannot afford the full fees. Muslim adults attending ADIL have welcomed the online courses and some even requested for more courses.
2020-10-05-T-131-S-01589,2020-10-05-T-131,1589,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,(c)  We introduced more digital religious content to engage the youth and others in the community through videos and podcasts on the MuslimSG mobile app and various social media platforms.
2020-10-05-T-131-S-01590,2020-10-05-T-131,1590,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Many in the community have also reached out to those who are less digital-savvy, such as elderly family members. We heard stories of how children assist their parents in making donations to the OurMasjid.sg crowdfunding platform to sustain mosque operations, while others set up IT systems at home so that their grandparents are able to attend home-based Quran recitation classes via video-conferencing platforms. These efforts allow the elderly to continue their religious practices even while they heed advice from our asatizah and medical experts to stay at home."
2020-10-05-T-131-S-01591,2020-10-05-T-131,1591,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Our community has also demonstrated a spirit of compassion and charity to support others in need.
2020-10-05-T-131-S-01592,2020-10-05-T-131,1592,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"(a)   Zakat contributions remain strong this year, with 96% of contributions made through digital transactions and cheques."
2020-10-05-T-131-S-01593,2020-10-05-T-131,1593,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"(b)   On Hari Raya Haji, the Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation, in collaboration with Muis, Free Food for All and New Life Stories, delivered meals to almost 6,000 migrant workers staying in Factory-Converted Dormitories. This brought comfort to the migrant workers away from home during this significant religious occasion."
2020-10-05-T-131-S-01594,2020-10-05-T-131,1594,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Our collective response during this pandemic has shown that we are a resilient and adaptive Muslim Community of Success. As Singapore steels itself for a long fight against COVID-19, I am confident that our community will continue to adapt and support each other, so that we can safely preserve our religious life and emerge stronger from this pandemic with fellow Singaporeans."
2020-10-05-T-132-S-01595,2020-10-05-T-132,1595,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (a) from 2017 to 2019, what is the annual number of appeals received by the MUIS Appeal Board regarding judgments issued by the Syariah Court of Singapore for divorce cases; (b) what are the main reasons for the appeals; and (c) how many cases are reported by ex-husbands and ex-wives respectively."
2020-10-05-T-132-S-01596,2020-10-05-T-132,1596,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Between 2017 and 2019, a total of 70 appeals against the Syariah Court (SYC) decisions on divorces were made to the Muis Appeal Board. There were 26 appeals in 2017, 20 appeals in 2018, and 24 appeals in 2019."
2020-10-05-T-132-S-01597,2020-10-05-T-132,1597,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The most common reasons for appeal were on the division of matrimonial assets, and disputes regarding monetary orders made by the SYC, such as the quantum of nafkah iddah and muta'ah award to wives."
2020-10-05-T-132-S-01598,2020-10-05-T-132,1598,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"During this 3-year period, there was a roughly equal number of male and female appellants."
2020-10-05-T-133-S-01599,2020-10-05-T-133,1599,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs what is the progress of investigations into allegations of questionable halal certification practices by MUIS's Halal Certification Strategic Unit.
2020-10-05-T-133-S-01600,2020-10-05-T-133,1600,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Muis takes a serious view towards the allegations made earlier this year against Muis by foreign online media in relation to the recognition of Foreign Halal Certificate Bodies (FHCBs). Muis has since set up an internal investigation team, led by Deputy Chief Executive, Dr Albakri Ahmad."
2020-10-05-T-133-S-01601,2020-10-05-T-133,1601,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"An Independent Review Panel (IRP) was also formed to investigate the complaint and review the findings of the investigation team. The IRP comprises members who do not have any executive roles in Muis. The IRP is chaired by Muis Council member and retired audit director from the Auditor-General’s Office, Mr Abdul Hamid Abdullah."
2020-10-05-T-134-S-01602,2020-10-05-T-134,1602,Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the progress of the construction of the new bus depot near Seletar West Farmway; and (b) with this new bus depot, what plans are there to improve the bus services in Fernvale."
2020-10-05-T-134-S-01603,2020-10-05-T-134,1603,Ong Ye Kung,"Due to the Circuit Breaker and phased re-opening since April this year, the completion of Sengkang West Bus Depot is delayed from 2023 to 2024. This delay does not affect the provision of bus services to serve Fernvale residents, as it is a bus depot and not an interchange."
2020-10-05-T-134-S-01604,2020-10-05-T-134,1604,Ong Ye Kung,"Residents at Fernvale are currently served by the Sengkang LRT and bus services along Sengkang West Avenue and Sengkang West Way that connect residents to Sengkang Bus Interchange / MRT Station and areas like Ang Mo Kio, Bishan, Hougang and Yishun."
2020-10-05-T-134-S-01605,2020-10-05-T-134,1605,Ong Ye Kung,"LTA will continue to monitor travel demand and patterns. Where necessary, LTA will adjust the provision of bus services to cater to increases in demand."
2020-10-05-T-135-S-01606,2020-10-05-T-135,1606,Murali Pillai,asked the Minister for Transport what is the progress on the national project to widen footpaths and build more cycling paths involving Bukit Batok SMC.
2020-10-05-T-135-S-01607,2020-10-05-T-135,1607,Ong Ye Kung,"Due to COVID-19, which affected the availability of cycling path construction materials and workers, our cycling path projects may be delayed by up to 12 months."
2020-10-05-T-135-S-01608,2020-10-05-T-135,1608,Ong Ye Kung,"The Government remains committed to tripling our cycling paths from 460 kilometres now to around 1300 kilometres by 2030, under the Islandwide Cycling Network programme. This will provide our towns, including Bukit Batok, with a wider active mobility network to support the uptake of active mobility in a way that is safe and convenient for all path users."
2020-10-05-T-136-S-01609,2020-10-05-T-136,1609,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether LTA is looking into the feasibility of incorporating low-noise pavement mix for all sections of expressways running close to residential blocks, in particular along the section of the Tampines Expressway between Sengkang and Punggol estates; (b) what are the preconditions for implementation; and (c) what other measures are being implemented to mitigate the impact of traffic noise."
2020-10-05-T-136-S-01610,2020-10-05-T-136,1610,Ong Ye Kung,"With the help of National Parks Board, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) lined Tampines Expressway with dense planting, which act as screens that absorb light and noise from roads. Noise mitigation measures are also implemented in the development of public housing, which has to be at a minimum distance away from roads. The Housing Development Board developments in Sengkang and Punggol estates adhere to this minimum separation distance from the Tampines Expressway."
2020-10-05-T-136-S-01611,2020-10-05-T-136,1611,Ong Ye Kung,"LTA is currently studying the feasibility of other noise mitigation measures, such as low-noise pavement mix and vertical noise barriers, along expressways near residential areas. The study will help LTA understand the extent of improvement of noise reduction due to the pavement mix, the impact of road geometry, and cost-effectiveness."
2020-10-05-T-136-S-01612,2020-10-05-T-136,1612,Ong Ye Kung,
2020-10-05-T-137-S-01613,2020-10-05-T-137,1613,Hany Soh,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many pedestrian overhead bridges are there in Singapore and how many have lifts installed to provide barrier-free access; and (b) whether there are plans to install more lifts for pedestrian overhead bridges, especially at mature estates like Woodgrove."
2020-10-05-T-137-S-01614,2020-10-05-T-137,1614,Ong Ye Kung,"Currently, there are about 580 pedestrian overhead bridges (POBs) in Singapore. To provide barrier free accessibility for the elderly and less ambulant commuters, ramps have been provided at 71 POBs and lifts installed at 48 POBs."
2020-10-05-T-137-S-01615,2020-10-05-T-137,1615,Ong Ye Kung,"LTA is presently making plans to progressively install lifts at around 50 more POBs. Given the high cost of installing lifts, LTA will give priority to POBs at locations that would benefit large numbers of seniors and commuters with mobility challenges, barring site constraints. Particularly attention will be given to those near public transport nodes and healthcare institutions without nearby at-grade and other barrier-free crossings. We will continue to study how we can improve barrier-free access, including in estates such as Woodgrove."
2020-10-05-T-138-S-01616,2020-10-05-T-138,1616,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the percentage of applications under the Self-Employed Income Relief Scheme that have been rejected due to the applicants' spouses earning more than $70,000; and (b) whether the Ministry can review this criterion as part of its study on the possible extension of SIRS in light of the prolonged economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis."
2020-10-05-T-138-S-01617,2020-10-05-T-138,1617,Josephine Teo,The Self-Employed Person (SEP) Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) is a means-tested scheme to help Singaporean SEPs with less means and family support to tide over this period of economic uncertainty.
2020-10-05-T-138-S-01618,2020-10-05-T-138,1618,Josephine Teo,"To target SIRS at SEPs with limited household wealth, married individuals will not qualify for SIRS if the assessable income of his or her spouse exceeds $70,000 a year. $70,000 is significantly above the median assessable income and is in line with other national schemes such as Workfare. As with the other qualifying criteria, we have also been exercising flexibility for this criterion. About 10% of the unsuccessful SIRS applicants had spousal incomes that far exceeded the $70,000 threshold and hence could not be covered by our appeal guidelines."
2020-10-05-T-139-S-01619,2020-10-05-T-139,1619,Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether guidelines for cross-deployment of foreign domestic workers (FDWs) can be tightened and made available to both employers and FDWs for greater clarity; (b) what kind of outreach has been done to ensure employers and FDWs are aware of their rights and the platforms to seek assistance; and (c) how can the Ministry better address FDWs' fears of losing their jobs if they report errant employers.
2020-10-05-T-139-S-01620,2020-10-05-T-139,1620,Josephine Teo,"Foreign Domestic Workers (FDWs) generally should perform household and domestic duties only at the residential address stated in the work permit. With the consent of the FDW, an employer can deploy the FDW to perform household duties at a relative's house to look after the employer’s child or aged parent under the supervision of the relative. In such situations, the employer is required to inform the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) of any such arrangements made, and must ensure that the FDW does not perform the full load of housework in both households."
2020-10-05-T-139-S-01621,2020-10-05-T-139,1621,Josephine Teo,"This approach balances the interest and well-being of the FDW and accommodates variations in household living arrangements in a practical way. The rules concerning how FDWs can be deployed are published in the FDW's Guidebook (which is given out to all first-time FDWs) and in the FDW Employer's Guide (which employers can download from MOM's website). During the FDW Settling-in Programme (SIP), first-time FDWs are also informed of the scenarios and circumstances under which they are allowed to work outside of their employer’s household. Likewise, first-time employers are briefed through the Employers' Orientation Programme (EOP). The SIP and EOP also provide specific examples on arrangements that are disallowed. For example, an FDW is not allowed to work for a neighbour after completing chores for an employer, and an employer is not allowed to ask an FDW to engage in cleaning activities in their offices or shop spaces."
2020-10-05-T-139-S-01622,2020-10-05-T-139,1622,Josephine Teo,"In addition, the SIP educates first-time FDWs on the list of support channels that they can go to for assistance. We have also started a programme to interview first-time FDWs conducted in their native languages, where they are able to raise any employment or well-being issues."
2020-10-05-T-139-S-01623,2020-10-05-T-139,1623,Josephine Teo,"FDWs who are illegally deployed should step forward to report their cases to MOM. Those who are assisting in MOM investigations will not be repatriated. The Ministry will assist affected FDWs to look for temporary employment or transfer to another employer during and after the investigation is completed. There have also been instances where FDWs made unsubstantiated complaints against their employers. This is why it is important for MOM to hear both sides and investigate, so as to arrive at a fair conclusion."
2020-10-05-T-140-S-01624,2020-10-05-T-140,1624,Desmond Choo,"asked the Minister for Manpower over the last five years, what is the trend of female workforce participation for those with younger children across the income deciles."
2020-10-05-T-140-S-01625,2020-10-05-T-140,1625,Josephine Teo,"Labour force participation for a given group informs us of the percentage of persons (working or not working) who are participating in the labour force. But since individuals without work do not draw an income, labour force participation cannot be measured by income deciles. However,"
2020-10-05-T-140-S-01626,2020-10-05-T-140,1626,Josephine Teo,
2020-10-05-T-140-S-01627,2020-10-05-T-140,1627,Josephine Teo,"On this front, Singapore fares well internationally. Our overall female labour force participation rate for those with at least one child aged below six was ranked amongst the top five OECD countries in 2018, the latest year for which comparison data is available﻿1."
2020-10-05-T-141-S-01628,2020-10-05-T-141,1628,Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) in each year in the past five years, how many cases have there been of residential addresses being falsely declared as housing addresses for foreign workers; and (b) what measures are taken to ensure that housing addresses declared for foreign workers are accurate."
2020-10-05-T-141-S-01629,2020-10-05-T-141,1629,Josephine Teo,"MOM takes a multi-pronged approach to ensure accurate addresses are declared for foreign workers. First, we hold employers responsible for reporting accurate residential addresses of their foreign workers. They are required to do so in the Online Foreign Worker Address Service. Employers remain responsible even when their workers source for their own accommodation. The online service ensures the occupancy limit of the address is not exceeded, and it also checks against tenancy registration records from the Housing and Development Board to ensure that the foreign worker is registered as a tenant by the homeowner."
2020-10-05-T-141-S-01630,2020-10-05-T-141,1630,Josephine Teo,"Second, MOM introduced the Foreign Worker Tenant Enquiry System in December 2018 to help detect misuse of home addresses. Homeowners can use the system to check the details of foreign workers registered at their address, and report to MOM if there are discrepancies. A significant increase in the number of false declaration cases were detected this way, explaining the increase in number of cases in 2019 from the previous year. The Foreign Worker Tenant Enquiry System also allows homeowners to block their addresses in the system to prevent any registration of foreign workers."
2020-10-05-T-141-S-01631,2020-10-05-T-141,1631,Josephine Teo,Table 1 shows the number of cases from 2015 to 2019 involving false declaration of residential addresses as housing addresses for foreign workers. This includes cases reported by homeowners as well as proactive inspections by MOM.
2020-10-05-T-141-S-01632,2020-10-05-T-141,1632,Josephine Teo,
2020-10-05-T-141-S-01633,2020-10-05-T-141,1633,Josephine Teo,"When cases of false declaration of residential addresses are detected, employers and workers involved will be investigated. Culpable employers will be barred from hiring foreign workers and workers who knowingly provided false information will have their work passes revoked."
2020-10-05-T-142-S-01634,2020-10-05-T-142,1634,Derrick Goh,asked the Minister for Manpower what is the rationale for further consultations with AGC to decide on what further action ought to be taken against Parti Liyani's previous employer when the Ministry has previously issued a warning to the employer in 2018.
2020-10-05-T-142-S-01635,2020-10-05-T-142,1635,Josephine Teo,"In determining punitive actions for illegal deployment, MOM's key considerations are the degree to which the well-being of the Foreign Domestic Worker has been compromised, and the extent of the illegal deployment. Ms Parti Liyani's case of illegal deployment was handled by the Ministry of Manpower in accordance with these considerations."
2020-10-05-T-142-S-01636,2020-10-05-T-142,1636,Josephine Teo,"At the conclusion of MOM's investigations in May 2018, in consultation with the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC), the Ministry took no further action against Mr Liew. A Caution was issued to Mrs Liew, and an Advisory Notice to Mr Karl Liew. The actions taken against the three individuals were in line with actions taken in past similar cases."
2020-10-05-T-142-S-01637,2020-10-05-T-142,1637,Josephine Teo,"From 2017 to 2019, there were an average of 550 complaints of illegal deployment each year. Of these, MOM took actions against an average of 155 employers per year for illegally deploying their Foreign Domestic Workers. About 60 of them were issued with an Advisory Notice. 80 were issued with a Caution. On average, 16 employers were issued with financial penalties each year, ranging from $3,300 to $24,000."
2020-10-05-T-142-S-01638,2020-10-05-T-142,1638,Josephine Teo,"There is a review ongoing for this particular case, arising from the High Court's observations. MOM will give an update when the review is completed."
2020-10-05-T-143-S-01639,2020-10-05-T-143,1639,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the current number of CPF members aged between 21 and 60 who are not covered under the Dependants' Protection Scheme, with a breakdown based on the key reasons for exclusion; (b) whether the scheme can be automatically extended to all CPF members aged above 21 who have sufficient CPF savings but have not made their first CPF working contribution; and (c) whether the scheme can be extended beyond the current age cap of 60 to be in line with the prevailing retirement age."
2020-10-05-T-143-S-01640,2020-10-05-T-143,1640,Josephine Teo,"The Dependants’ Protection Scheme (DPS) is a term-life insurance scheme that provides insured members and their families with a sum of money to tide them over the initial period should the insured members pass away, suffer from terminal illness or total permanent disability."
2020-10-05-T-143-S-01641,2020-10-05-T-143,1641,Josephine Teo,"As of December 2019, about 1 in 5 CPF members between age 21 and 60 are not insured under DPS. This can be due to a variety of reasons. For example, some members chose to opt out as they have no dependants, have similar private insurance coverage, or have sufficient CPF or other savings set aside for bequest. There are also a small number of members who could not meet the underwriting requirements."
2020-10-05-T-143-S-01642,2020-10-05-T-143,1642,Josephine Teo,Automatic inclusion under DPS is only extended to active members who are making regular CPF contribution from work as income protection for these members is likely to be more critical if they have dependants. A regular income also helps these members maintain sufficient CPF balances to keep up with DPS premiums. Members who are not automatically included but wish to be covered can apply directly to private insurers for DPS coverage. Their DPS premiums can be paid using their available CPF savings or cash.
2020-10-05-T-143-S-01643,2020-10-05-T-143,1643,Josephine Teo,"From 1 April 2021, the maximum age of DPS coverage will be increased to cover members up to age 65. Members aged 60 and above but below 65 years, whose DPS covers have ceased or will cease before 1 April 2021, can rejoin DPS by applying directly with the appointed insurer."
2020-10-05-T-143-S-01644,2020-10-05-T-143,1644,Josephine Teo,
2020-10-05-T-144-S-01645,2020-10-05-T-144,1645,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"asked the Minister for National Development in 2019 and 2020 to date, what is the maximum and median number of application attempts for first-time applicants before they are successful in being invited to select a HDB flat."
2020-10-05-T-144-S-01646,2020-10-05-T-144,1646,Desmond Lee,"In both 2019 and 1H2020, more than half of the first timer families were successful at their first attempt in a Build-To-Order or Sale of Balance Flats exercise.  The highest number of consecutive unsuccessful attempts before a successful attempt in 2019 and 1H2020 were 14 and 10 respectively.  In these cases, the applicants had applied mostly for new flats in the mature estates."
2020-10-05-T-145-S-01647,2020-10-05-T-145,1647,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) in each of the past five years, what is the number of prosecutions that have been brought in relation to instances of illegal wildlife trade; (b) of these prosecutions, how many also involved charges of corruption, money-laundering or fraud; and (c) whether the Ministry will start collecting this data if it is not available."
2020-10-05-T-145-S-01648,2020-10-05-T-145,1648,Desmond Lee,The number of prosecutions that have been brought in relation to instances of illegal wildlife trade since 2015 is provided in Table 1 below.
2020-10-05-T-145-S-01649,2020-10-05-T-145,1649,Desmond Lee,
2020-10-05-T-145-S-01650,2020-10-05-T-145,1650,Desmond Lee,"No association with corruption, money-laundering or fraud was established during the investigation of these cases."
2020-10-05-T-146-S-01651,2020-10-05-T-146,1651,He Ting Ru,asked the Minister for National Development with regard to the Allotment Gardening Scheme (a) how many allotment garden plots have been made available each year since its inception in 2016; (b) how many allotment garden plots have had their lease terminated and on what basis; and (c) whether there are plans to expand the programme to allow more residents access to sustainable farming in their neighbourhoods.
2020-10-05-T-146-S-01652,2020-10-05-T-146,1652,Desmond Lee,"Since 2016, NParks has made available 1,080 allotment garden plots as part of its Allotment Gardening Scheme. The annual number of plots made available is provided in Table 1 below."
2020-10-05-T-146-S-01653,2020-10-05-T-146,1653,Desmond Lee,
2020-10-05-T-146-S-01654,2020-10-05-T-146,1654,Desmond Lee,"Thus far, seven allotment garden plot leases have been terminated early. These were at the gardeners' requests, for reasons such as ill health, relocation, or lack of time. These plots have since been taken up by new gardeners."
2020-10-05-T-146-S-01655,2020-10-05-T-146,1655,Desmond Lee,"NParks will continue to progressively make available more allotment garden plots, many of which will be in parks near residential areas."
