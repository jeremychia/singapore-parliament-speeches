2021-03-05-T-001,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the Government undertakes systematic preventive measures to engage the children of drug offenders in programmes that aim to mitigate the risk of these children becoming drug offenders themselves in future; and (b) if so, what criteria or metrics are used to evaluate the effectiveness of such programmes.",1,1,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00001
2021-03-05-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for the question. First, we need to be clear on what are the primary causes of the drug problem which lead to children being affected.",1,2,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00002
2021-03-05-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"The Member's question focuses on measures to engage the children of drug-abusing parents, to prevent them from becoming drug offenders themselves. Looking at this narrowly, from that perspective, will not give an accurate picture.",2,3,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00003
2021-03-05-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"The primary issue is the trafficking and pushing of drugs in society. If we do not deal with those issues upstream, before the harm is caused, then there will be serious consequences to the lives of people and loss of children. So, we have to focus on deterring and disrupting the supply of drugs.",3,4,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00004
2021-03-05-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"If we do not do that properly, the children will suffer neglect at best from their families and many will face the risk of getting into a life of crime and drugs. Downstream efforts to help the children, will really be like fighting against the tide in such situations. We are very concerned about the children and the other people affected by drugs. That is why we take a tough approach on drugs.",4,5,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00005
2021-03-05-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"I will ask the Member if he agrees with the tough approach we have taken on drugs, the approach to severely punish the traffickers and suppliers responsible for this problem, if we are concerned about children, then I assume the Member will agree with us.",5,6,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00006
2021-03-05-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Let me give an example – a five-year-old boy, I do not want to name him – died after being scalded with hot water in 2016. Every year I can name you a case of such a child. Five years old, four years old, parents affected by drugs. The court heard that his mother, who had thrown the hot water on him, told the IMH psychiatrist that she had abused meth for years and that she was probably suffering from withdrawal symptoms in the days before the boy's death, because she was unable to buy drugs from her usual supplier.",6,7,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00007
2021-03-05-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"In such cases I asked Members, what could have been done to save the child, which is part of the question the Member is asking. What we have done is to save the lives of thousands of such children with our focus on preventing widespread use of drugs through our very tough drug policies; probably one of the only country, if not, one of the few countries in the world that have dealt with this problem effectively.",7,8,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00008
2021-03-05-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"That helps prevent such cases from happening in the first place. We could identify the problem accurately if we want to find the right solutions. I have tried to explain how we try and make sure we reduce, minimise the risks of the situation that the Member has been referring to, from even arising in the first place.",8,9,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00009
2021-03-05-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"But despite all our efforts, and despite our tough laws and stance, there will be persons who will continue to abuse drugs and place their families and children at risk. In those cases, how do we help the children? The Government works closely with the community to help them. Newly admitted offenders are encouraged to participate in the Yellow Ribbon Community Project (YRCP). Under the YRCP, volunteers reach out to the families of inmates through home visits and link them up with various social support and community programmes.",9,10,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00010
2021-03-05-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"They also identify vulnerable children of inmates who may require support in their education or who may require counselling and refer them to relevant community programmes. There are now more than 1,200 YRCP volunteers, who have reached out to more than 15,000 families. This is real hard work on the ground. Not glamourous, but thousands of people going, spending thousands of hours, helping.",10,11,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00011
2021-03-05-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Prisons will also refer inmates and their family members who require assistance to the Family Resource Centres, (FRCs). FRCs operate from the Prison Link Centre in Changi. They render financial assistance, accommodation and social assistance. Where necessary FRCs will refer the families to the Family Service Centres (FSCs) for further casework support within the community.",11,12,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00012
2021-03-05-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"The FRCs have assisted close to 4,000 inmate families in the last two years. FSC social workers will try and review the family's risks and needs, and coordinate intervention and support across different agencies. For school-going children, FSCs will also link up with the schools to discuss their needs – the types and level of support needed by the children.",12,13,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00013
2021-03-05-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Besides FSCs, we also have youth agencies, which provide support services for children and young persons who have behaviours which put them at risk, or who require constructive engagement. These include mentoring programmes, interest-based activities and career coaching.",13,14,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00014
2021-03-05-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Then, there is the aspect of parent-child bonding. Prisons get involved in that. It provides inmates with family-centred programmes, like the Social Skills Training Programme and the Family Reintegration Programme, to equip them with communication skills, to engage their children and loved ones more effectively.",14,15,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00015
2021-03-05-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"In the past five years, Prisons has provided about 21,000 programme places to inmates for this purpose. Prisons also works with various other community partners on programmes and services, aimed at addressing the impact of the parents being in jail. These include counselling, tuition assistance, parenting programmes and family bonding programmes, for example, run by The Salvation Army, Centre For Fathering and the Singapore Children's Society.",15,16,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00016
2021-03-05-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Over the last two years, 282 inmates and their families attended these programmes. The Member has also asked about how do we evaluate the effectiveness of these programmes? I think the first question is, when I lay this out, I think Members will agree that this has to be done. I cannot believe that any Member here would say, we should not do any of these or should be cutting back on these.",16,17,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00017
2021-03-05-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"In terms of quantifying it, this is a very difficult to study, because there are too many factors that are outside of Prisons' control. Let me name some  how a child grows up, how a child averts the risk of a life in crime and drugs depends on family circumstances of the children involved; the social influences on the children; the willingness of the family to be fully involved and engaged in the programmes offered; also, how available the drugs are to that child, for children; the susceptibility of the family members including the children to the attraction of drugs. I can name many such factors.",17,18,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00018
2021-03-05-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"So, it is not an area you can easily quantify. You have to make an assessment and go ahead and do it; as we have been able to convince thousands of volunteers to do, together with Prison's officers and NGOs which see the benefit of doing these activities.",18,19,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00019
2021-03-05-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"While no specific quantification has been done, Prisons' professional assessment, based on the interactions, is that the programmes have helped the families which have a positive attitude towards receiving such help.",19,20,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00020
2021-03-05-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Prisons generally look at how the effectiveness of its various programs can be assessed. When they next assess, I will ask them to consider again whether there are ways in which some kind of measurement be done, either now or in the future because we are also talking about children growing up to be adults. So, you are talking about 20 years or so.",20,21,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00021

2021-03-05-T-001,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. I thank the Minister for his reply. I certainly do agree that penalties have a critical role to play to control the supply and availability of drugs, as the Minister has explained. Rehabilitative approaches and preventive and early intervention programmes, such as what the Minister has explained, also have a critical role to play as well.",1,25,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00025
2021-03-05-T-001,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,I thank the Member for his unqualified support and I assume Workers' Party's position on the drug policies.,1,26,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00026

2021-03-05-T-001,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"A good way to start the morning, Minister. Sir, I believe some years ago, the hon Member Mr Christopher de Souza filed a Motion on the drug issue, and I made a speech in that debate. It was really about acknowledging that this is a serious issue, the drug problem, especially internationally. And certainly, I would support a tough stance against drugs.",1,28,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00028
2021-03-05-T-001,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,I thank the Leader of Opposition.,1,29,2021-03-05-T-001-S-00029
2021-03-05-T-002,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs given the escalating developments in Myanmar involving the use of violence by security forces against demonstrators such as the violence seen in Mandalay on 20 February 2021 (a) what concrete steps will ASEAN take to facilitate a return to stability in Myanmar; and (b) what are the immediate and long-term consequences for the region if the situation does not abate.,1,30,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00030
2021-03-05-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether Singapore will consider sending another consignment of humanitarian aid to the Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazaar, Bangladesh, since the efforts to repatriate the Rohingya refugees back to Myanmar have stalled.",1,31,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00031
2021-03-05-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Mr Speaker, may I answer Question Nos 2 and 3 together, with your permission?",1,32,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00032
2021-03-05-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,33,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00033
2021-03-05-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. It has been more than a month since the 1 February 2021 detention of Myanmar's civilian government leaders including President U Win Myint and State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The situation in Myanmar unfortunately remains fraught with much uncertainty and there remains significant risk of escalation. The United Nations reported that on 3 March alone, 38 people died.",1,34,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00034
2021-03-05-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,MFA has strongly advised all Singaporeans to defer travel to Myanmar at this time and we have also advised Singaporeans who are currently in Myanmar to consider leaving as soon as they can by commercial means whilst flights are still available.,2,35,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00035
2021-03-05-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"I have spoken extensively on Singapore's response to these developments in Myanmar, including during my Ministry's Committee of Supply (COS) debate on 1 March. On 2 March, I joined other ASEAN Foreign Ministers via video-conference for an Informal ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (IAMM). At that meeting, the representative of Myanmar's military authorities, Mr Wunna Maung Lwin also briefed us on his account.",3,36,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00036
2021-03-05-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Singapore believes that ASEAN should play a constructive role in facilitating a return to normalcy and hopefully, stability in Myanmar, in line with the principles enshrined in the ASEAN Charter. The Chair of ASEAN issued a Statement on 1 February, the very day the NLD government was ousted. The Informal ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (IAMM) I referred to earlier, was convened on 2 March 2021. The meeting reaffirmed the practice for ASEAN to discuss important issues of common concern whenever they arise. This meeting was an opportunity to have frank and open, candid discussions, and to reflect the international community's concerns directly to the representative of the military authorities.",4,37,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00037
2021-03-05-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,Members would be aware of the media coverage of that meeting. We also provided a full transcript of my intervention during that meeting.,5,38,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00038
2021-03-05-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"The ASEAN Foreign Ministers urged the Myanmar military authorities to exercise the utmost restraint and to refrain from the use of lethal force against unarmed civilians. I conveyed Singapore's grave concerns over the situation in Myanmar. We are appalled by violence, inflicted by security forces against civilians. It is the height of national shame for the armed forces of any country to turn its arms against its own people.",6,39,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00039
2021-03-05-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,The use of lethal force against unarmed civilians is inexcusable under any circumstances. The immediate concern is to step back from a rapidly deteriorating situation.,7,40,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00040
2021-03-05-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"I called on the military authorities to seek a peaceful solution for Myanmar. The alternative is prolonged instability and to quote Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, ""an enormous tragic step back"" for Myanmar.",8,41,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00041
2021-03-05-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"The military is an institution in the body politic of Myanmar. In fact, the military authorities in Myanmar played a role in Myanmar’s political journey towards democracy in the past decade. It has to reach a modus vivendi with the other key stakeholders in Myanmar including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. There remain prospects for a peaceful resolution as long as all sides can come together, engage in genuine and direct dialogue, and find a way to return to Myanmar’s democratic transition.",9,42,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00042
2021-03-05-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"We thus hope that the military authorities will release President Win Myint and State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, so that these discussions can commence.

2021-03-05-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Mr Speaker, if events continue to escalate, it will become even more challenging for all parties in Myanmar to achieve that essential reconciliation. If tensions do not abate, the longer term stability of our region will also be affected, with potential serious consequences for everyone. There will also be further humanitarian impact given the current severe COVID-19 and economic stresses confronting their people, and do not forget the unresolved resettlement of displaced persons from Rakhine State.",11,44,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00044
2021-03-05-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,Singapore's assistance to the displaced persons from Rakhine State is on-going. Singapore has contributed over S$1 million in bilateral humanitarian aid to both Bangladesh and Myanmar. We also made contributions through the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management.,12,45,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00045

2021-03-05-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"It is important to resume efforts to ensure the safe, voluntary and dignified repatriation of refugees back to Rakhine State. We have lent strong support towards ASEAN's efforts to help improve the ground conditions in Rakhine State, such as through the Preliminary Needs Assessment (PNA) and the ASEAN Secretariat's Ad-Hoc Support Teams, which focused on implementing the recommendations of the PNA teams. These recommendations include priority projects, such as the supply of radio receivers to the local community, in order to strengthen the dissemination of accurate information.",15,48,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00048

2021-03-05-T-002,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I thank the Foreign Minister for his comprehensive reply and his clear condemnation of the situation in Myanmar. I think since I filed this question several days ago, the situation seems to to have worsened. I just have one supplementary question for the Foreign Minister, which is that at the ASEAN level, is this being monitored with a view to keeping other options open to nudge the government in Myanmar towards reconciliation, towards political settlement, should the situation worsen even further in the days and weeks ahead?",1,54,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00054

2021-03-05-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I thank the Minister for the reply. I have raised this issue in Parliament quite a number of times. I know the Minister is deeply concerned about the refugees as well.,1,56,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00056
2021-03-05-T-002,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Like him, I have been to the refugee camps in Cox's Bazaar and it really is suffering at a scale that is unimaginable. I met many of the children there, many of whom have watched both fathers and mothers get killed. So, I really hope and I asked MFA to consider sending another consignment of humanitarian aid this year, and that will really help the refugees that are currently in Cox's Bazaar.",2,57,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00057
2021-03-05-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Mr Speaker, as I said earlier, we would certainly consider additional assistance, but there are many obstacles.

2021-03-05-T-002,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for his comprehensive answer. My supplementary question refers to two instruments  the ASEAN Charter and the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration.,1,59,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00059
2021-03-05-T-002,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In the discussions with Minister's counterparts in ASEAN, would reference be made to both those instruments and the general principles elucidated in those instruments, to have some level of forbearance over the actions of the military in Myanmar?",2,60,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00060
2021-03-05-T-002,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),My view is that the actions do go against the whole tenor and principles laid down in the ASEAN Charter and the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration.,3,61,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00061

2021-03-05-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"But I also want the House to have a realistic assessment of the factors at play. The history of Myanmar over the past 70 years, and I mentioned that earlier this week, is a long and tortured history of a large, wealthy talented country, unable to come together and achieve national unity, unable to reconcile differences between ethnic groups, political ideologies, between the different pillars of the political construct that is Myanmar.",2,63,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00063
2021-03-05-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Again, if you look over the past 70 years, the military authorities in Myanmar frankly do not respond to economic sanctions, do not respond to moral opprobrium. And certainly, references to the ASEAN Charter in Human Rights, whilst essential, are not sufficient to change their behaviour. So, we do need to be realistic in what we say or do. I want to emphasise that my key objective – again, perhaps, influenced by my medical background – is, first, do no harm. Do not raise false hopes, do not incite and do not encourage further crystallisation of disputes and violence.",3,64,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00064
2021-03-05-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"I say all this so that Singaporeans, both within this House and outside this House, will understand that despite all our fervent and earnest hopes of reconciliation, the keys ultimately lie within Myanmar. There is a limit to how far external pressure will be brought to bear. It does not mean we approve of what they have done and how they do it, and we are clear in our expressions of disapproval. But let us also be realistic and let us hope that good sense prevails.",4,65,2021-03-05-T-002-S-00065
2021-03-05-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"There are also profound lessons for us in Singapore, to count our blessings since Independence, that we have been able to come together as one people, regardless of race, language or religion. We have been able to build a democracy that functions. We have been able to reconcile differences.

2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),We have had some cases for the past few years relating to sexual and hurt offences which triggered much discussion on whether the sentences imposed were adequate.,2,81,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00081
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"In September 2020, last year, we started off an important broad-based conversation on the position of women in Singapore, how we can better deal with the issues they face, not just crimes but the overall position of women. That review goes beyond the law, beyond the narrow context of sexual and hurt offences.",3,82,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00082
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"This particular review here, which I am going to speak about, is on the context of sexual and hurt offences. Stiff and effective punishments are necessary, but they are only one part of the picture. The penalties may deter, but they are not going to remove the attitudes behind such conduct.",4,83,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00083
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"As a society, we must look deeper. The broad-based review will look into how equality and respect for women can be better ingrained in our society and inculcated as a fundamental value from young; and to change mindsets, tackle underlying attitudes and behavioural patterns.",5,84,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00084
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"We have had many discussions with various groups, many more discussions are planned and we are on track to issue the White Paper later this year. Today, for the purposes of my Statement, I will focus specifically on our approach on punishments that sexual and hurt offenders will face.",6,85,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00085
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),Let me start by referencing three cases.,7,86,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00086
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"First, in September 2019, we have the case of a 22-year-old university student who molested a woman on a MRT train. The Court gave him 21 months of probation. The probation report stated, and I quote, ""good academic performance in school, highlighted his potential to excel in life"". AGC appealed against probation. They did not agree that a sentence of probation was appropriate and the High Court agreed with the AGC and imposed two weeks imprisonment.",8,87,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00087
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"The second case was in July 2020, a 22 year-old university student caused hurt to his ex-girlfriend. He had put his hands around her neck, choking her and pressed her eye as well. He was given a 12-day Short Detention Order (SDO), 80 hours of Community Service Order (CSO) and a five-month Day Reporting Order (DRO).",9,88,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00088
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"The third case in July 2020, a 23-year-old undergraduate, used a handphone recorded a video clip of a female person in a bathroom. He was sentenced to a 14-day Short Detention Order and a 130-hour Community Service Order. AGC felt that the sentence was too light and they appealed, but the sentence was upheld in Court.",10,89,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00089
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"These cases generated public discussion. There were also other cases where male university students took videos of females in bathrooms. There was a public sense that the sentences were not adequate, questions were asked – was there more leniency because of the educational qualifications of some of the offenders?",11,90,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00090
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"In this speech, I will set out the Government's approach on sentencing adult offenders for hurt or sexual offences; and second, what should be the relevant factors in sentencing.",12,91,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00091
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"When it comes to sentencing, the Government decides on the policy, puts it before Parliament and the philosophy, principles – what we want to see in the laws, what should be the range of sentences, what factors are relevant – those are matters of policy that the Executive works on and puts before Parliament and Parliament decides. The Courts then apply these laws.",13,92,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00092
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Thus, it is for the Government and Parliament to decide whether the punishments are adequate. The Courts look at the laws, the range of sentences and decide each case on its on its facts, because sentencing in the end is fact-specific.",14,93,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00093
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"So, when it comes to sentencing, what should our philosophy be? There are four principles that are often referred to.",15,94,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00094
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"First, prevention – where an offender poses a threat to public safety, the sentence should prevent the offender from causing further harm.",16,95,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00095
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Two, deterrence – the sentence should deter the offender as well as others from similar behaviour in future.",17,96,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00096
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Three, rehabilitation – the sentence should, where and to the degree appropriate, seek to encourage the reformation of the offender.",18,97,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00097
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Four, proportionate punishment – the sentence should punish the offender according to his blameworthiness and seriousness of crime.",19,98,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00098
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"I will now deal specifically with sexual and hurt offences. The Government takes a tough approach on sexual and hurt offences. We have made significant amendments over the years to enhance the protection for victims of sexual and hurt offences. I have set them out in the Annex. With your permission, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the clerk to distribute the Annex. Members may also access these materials through the SG Parl MP mobile app.",20,99,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00099

2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In 2019, we amended the Penal Code and Protection from Harassment Act, or POHA. Under the amended provisions, those who commit sexual and hurt offences against vulnerable victims, face enhanced penalties. That would include  victims in intimate and close relationships with the offender; children under the age of 14; domestic workers; and physically or mentally disabled victims who are substantially unable to protect themselves from abuse, neglect or self-neglect.",2,102,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00102
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Offenders who commit offences against such vulnerable victims are now liable for up to twice the maximum prescribed punishment.,3,103,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00103
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"For example, if you take the unfortunate case for the Myanmarese foreign domestic work Ms Piang – if those facts had taken place after 1 January 2020, then those found guilty could face much higher punishments.",4,104,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00104
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"For example, giving another example, there was a case some years ago, husband and wife abused their foreign domestic helper. The husband had slapped, punched and kicked the victim, hit her with canes and bamboo sticks and pushed her against the cabinet. The wife had slapped and punched the victim. They were convicted of numerous offences including voluntarily causing hurt under the Penal Code.",5,105,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00105
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The husband was sentenced to 43 months' imprisonment. The wife was sentenced to two months imprisonment. If those assaults had taken place after 1 January 2020, their sentences are quite likely to have been higher because the penalties have been enhanced.",6,106,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00106
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We also specifically made criminal acts like voyeurism, dissemination of intimate images without consent – these have become more prevalent with technology – the conduct were offences previously, but not specifically identified as voyeurism offence or a dissemination of intimate images offence.",7,107,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00107
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Voyeurism, for example, previously would have been charged under insulting a person's modesty. Dissemination of intimate images, for example, would have been charged under distributing pornography. Maximum penalty for voluntarily causing hurt has been increased from two to three years imprisonment. We have also enhanced penalties under POHA for harassment of persons in an intimate relationship with the offender and for repeated breaches of Protection Orders.",8,108,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00108
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Both the penal code and POHA amendments took effect on 1 January 2020 and the amendments apply to offences committed on or after that date.,9,109,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00109
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In 2018, the CPC and the Evidence Act were amended. The accused and counsel were required to seek the Court's permission before questions could be asked about a victim's physical appearance, sexual behaviour, where these do not relate to the charge. We also prohibited the release of identity of victims before a complaint is made and the default position for trials is closed-door hearings when the victim testifies. We also allowed the use of physical screens to shield victims from seeing the accused when testifying in court.",10,110,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00110
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Earlier in 2012, the Evidence Act was amended to remove provisions based on outmoded assumptions about victims of sexual offences. When it comes to sentencing of adult offenders who commit sexual and hurt offences, our position is that the sentences must reflect that such acts are deeply offensive to our fundamental values.",11,111,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00111
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Outrage of modesty is not merely an offence that a man commits because he is tempted by the way a lady dresses. Voyeurism is not merely a thoughtless act that a young student commits in a moment of folly. These and other similar offences, whether committed against a female or male victim, should be dealt with seriously. These actions must be seen as an affront of fundamental values. There can in general, be no excuses for these offences.",12,112,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00112
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mitigation pleas based on the offender's educational qualifications or academic potential should not carry much weight. For such offences, principles of proportionate punishment and deterrence should generally take precedence over rehabilitation.",13,113,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00113
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"This means, if you touch a woman inappropriately without her consent, if you upload intimate images of an ex-girlfriend or any other woman; if you video record a woman showering, you must face serious consequences in law. And you should not be able to come to Court and say you have a bright future you will go far and so on. You can go far, but first serve the sentence. [Applause.]",14,114,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00114
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"If we make examples of some offenders, however bright their potential outlook in life, then the message of deterrence will likely be stronger. I am going to ask MOE to summarise these points and send to all students, boys and girls, so that everyone understands where we stand, and they must realise that a moment of folly can lead to very serious consequences. We will make sure our laws reflect this severity.",15,115,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00115
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"That said, there may be exceptional circumstances. Let me give a couple of examples. An offender, for example, may have a very low IQ, that affected his judgement as to right and wrong; or a serious mental illness that had a causal link to the offending conduct.",16,116,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00116
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Relevant offender-specific mitigating factors should generally continue to be taken into account. These factors should be assessed on a case-by-case basis with due consideration given to the harm caused to the victim and the need for deterrence.,17,117,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00117
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"With this in mind, I will set out three steps that we are going to take now  one, increase penalties for three specific sexual offences; two, AGC will generally object to rehabilitative sentences for adult offenders who commit certain sexual and hurt offences; and three, a guide on sentencing will be published.",18,118,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00118
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"First, increase in penalties for three sexual offences. As Members know, I have been coming repeatedly to amend these laws and you can see that from Annex 1A. So, we have been constantly reviewing. We did a further review of our penalties for sexual and hurt offences in the Penal Code, including voyeurism, distribution of intimate images, outrage of modesty and voluntarily causing hurt.",19,119,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00119
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In our view, the maximum penalties are properly calibrated for most of these offences. We have set them out in Annex 1B. There are, however, three areas where we intend to increase the maximum punishments.",20,120,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00120
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"First, outrage of modesty under section 354(1) of the Penal Code. From 2016 to 2020, on average, we had 1,190 cases of outrage of modesty reported each year, which is about 24% higher than the previous period of 2011 to 2015.",21,121,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00121
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We want egregious cases to be dealt with more severely. We will increase the maximum imprisonment term from two years, to three years.",22,122,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00122
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Next, where sexual activity in the presence of a minor takes place, or sexual images are shown to a minor between the ages of 14 and 16 years; and if you compare that with exploitative sexual activity in the presence of a minor or showing a sexual image to a minor who is between the ages of 16 and 18 years. These two offences are similar in nature to offences involving sexual communication with minors.",23,123,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00123
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,We will therefore correlate the penalties – increase the maximum sentence from one year to two years’ imprisonment.,24,124,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00124
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Second, unless there are exceptional facts, AGC will, as a general rule, object to rehabilitative sentences for adult offenders who commit certain sexual and hurt offences.",25,125,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00125
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Where adult offenders – I emphasise adult – commit sexual and hurt offences, the need for proportionate punishment and deterrence must take precedence over rehabilitation. This is a matter for the Government to decide. It is a matter of policy.",26,126,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00126
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I have discussed this with AGC and AGC agrees with our view. Therefore, AGC will generally object to rehabilitative sentences, such as probation and community-based sentences, where the offenders are adults who commit certain types of hurt or sexual offences. I should add that that is the general position they have taken anyway, but they are going to be much stricter about it.",27,127,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00127
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We will need to give due consideration to exceptional circumstances, which may justify deviation from this general position. We have to, in Parliament, and the Executive, and of course, AGC in court.",28,128,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00128
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"For example, where the facts of the case are such that rehabilitation should be the dominant sentencing consideration. Take a situation, where a first-time adult offender with an intellectual disability touches a woman. It may, in certain circumstances, better serve the public interest to impose a rehabilitative sentence with appropriate conditions, to reduce the likelihood of future re-offending, rather than to impose an imprisonment term.",29,129,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00129
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Take another example, where the offender suffers from a treatable psychiatric condition that contributed to the commission of the offence, a Mandatory Treatment Order may be appropriate.",30,130,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00130
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,The third step that we will take is to publish a guide on sentencing in Singapore.,31,131,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00131
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"To better educate the public about the sentencing process, MHA and MinLaw have worked with AGC and the Law Society and we have prepared a guide on sentencing in Singapore. This guide explains sentencing process in our courts, addresses important questions of public interest like  (a) what are the objectives of sentencing? (b) what are the common types of sentences imposed by the Courts? (c) what factors does the Court take into account during sentencing? (d) how does the Court decide what sentence to impose? The guide will be published on the MHA, MinLaw and AGC websites.",32,132,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00132
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Therefore, if I may summarise this part, in respect of sexual and hurt offences, based on what I have said, it should be clear that an offender will not receive a lighter sentence simply because he has higher educational qualifications, or has better prospects in life.",33,133,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00133
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,There is another important step that we are going to take. MHA and MinLaw have also been considering how we can achieve greater consistency in sentencing and how there can be greater public education about sentencing.,34,134,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00134
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We studied the experience in other jurisdictions  England and Wales, and Scotland. We noted that the formation of a Sentencing Body that promulgates sentencing guidelines can be useful. It can enable proactive publication of guidelines to pre-empt or address areas of concern, and that can facilitate a more consultative process. And it will allow views of more stakeholders to be taken into consideration.",35,135,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00135
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"MHA and MinLaw have discussed with various stakeholders, including AGC, the Judiciary. We will set up a Sentencing Advisory Panel. The key function of the Panel will be to issue non-binding sentencing guidelines.",36,136,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00136
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"To illustrate, if the Panel decides to issue a sentencing guideline for a hurt-related offence, the Panel can set out the sentencing framework, sentencing bands, based on the twin factors of harm and culpability. The framework can include relevant aggravating and mitigating factors to be considered in sentencing.",37,137,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00137
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The guidelines will be published and be accessible to the public. It will be persuasive, but of course, not binding on the Courts. The Courts decide each case on the facts before them.",38,138,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00138
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We envisage that in working out the guidelines, the Panel will consult other stakeholders, where appropriate. And that will provide greater clarity to the public about the likely sentence and the relevant factors to be considered in sentencing, as compared to the current position where the legislation only sets out the maximum penalties.",39,139,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00139
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"It is expected to be an inter-agency Panel. It will comprise stakeholders from the criminal justice system, including Members of the Judiciary, AGC, MHA and SPF. We will give more details on the Panel later.",40,140,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00140
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Let me now, in the context of the points I have made, consider again the cases I mentioned at the start of the Statement.",41,141,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00141
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The first case, the one in April 2020, where the High Court overturned the initial sentence of probation and imposed imprisonment, our view is that that was appropriate and that would be the case now with the amendments.",42,142,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00142
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The second case, the 22-year-old university student who hurt his ex-girlfriend in May 2019. The sentence in the case was decided in accordance with the law at the time and rightly so. Had the acts been committed on or after 1 January 2020, he is likely to have been charged under the new Penal Code provisions, voluntarily causing hurt to a victim with whom he was in an intimate or close relationship. He would have been liable for up to twice the maximum penalty. For voluntarily causing hurt, twice the maximum penalty is up to six years’ jail, $10,000 fine, or both. Because that is the maximum penalty, he would then not be eligible for community-based sentences, which by law, are only generally available for offences punishable with a maximum imprisonment term of not more than three years.",43,143,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00143
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The third case is the 23-year-old university student who committed voyeurism. Before the Penal Code amendments came into force in 2020, such acts were usually prosecuted under the rubric of insulting the modesty of a woman, punishable with up to one year’s imprisonment, or fine or both. Now, with the introduction of a specific offence of voyeurism which carries double the penalty – two years’ jail, or fine – there is now also the possibility of caning.",44,144,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00144
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As I said, AGC will also, in general, object to probation or community-based sentences being imposed in cases involving voyeurism offences. Offenders who commit such offences should not expect to be treated leniently.",45,145,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00145
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Speaker, I have set out our philosophy, a tough stance towards sexual and hurt offences.",46,146,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00146
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Beyond these penalties, the criminal justice system also reflects the values of society. Such acts must be seen as penalising a gross violation of fundamental values in Singapore. The usual mitigating factors will have less force when viewed in this prism. The starting point should be the conduct should never have happened. No excuses. Offenders should expect to face the full force of the law.",47,147,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00147
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Society needs to play its part as well to unequivocally repudiate sexual and hurt offences as violations of fundamental values. Collectively, with right laws and policies, and more importantly, with the right societal mindset in place, we can move towards being a society that fully lives up to our values.

2021-03-05-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thank you, Speaker. I thank the Minister for the Statement. My query pertains to hurt offences. I take the Minister back to the debate when the Criminal Law Reform Bill was tabled in Parliament in 2019. There was a discussion amongst Members of how voluntarily causing hurt, being a non-arrestable offence, is dealt with by the Police. Then-Senior Parliamentary Secretary who at the round-up speech confirmed that Police do look at voluntarily causing hurt (VCH) offences in some broad classes – I do not think those were closed classes. These included road rage, secret society members, fighting, racial, religiously-aggravated VCH cases. The Senior Parliamentary Secretary then in the round-up speech mentioned that, I will quote what he said, ""post-amendment we can assess if there is a need to create a more expedited framework for the resolution of other types of VCH cases and if this can be done without compromising due process or compromising the delivery of Police response to other more serious offences"".",1,150,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00150
2021-03-05-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I would just like to confirm whether the Ministry has considered looking at VCH offences, the section 321 type of offences, the non-arrestable offences, in a more variated manner so that we can take expedited action in the appropriate cases.",2,151,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00151
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Thank you. That question actually highlights one of the more involved discussions that MHA has been having, with me involved. Let me put it this way. Voluntarily causing hurt, as Mr Singh would know, it can cover a broad ambit. Let me give a couple of examples.",1,152,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00152
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"You are in a supermarket. Someone goes past you and push you. Let us leave out the sexual part of it – just two men. He pushed you aggressively. That is at one level. You did not feel hurt, nothing, but he should not have pushed you. You go and file a Police report.",2,153,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00153
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"On the other end of the scale, could be a more serious assault which does not result in grievous hurt – because then, it would be voluntarily causing grievous hurt – but nevertheless, leaves you in a state of shock.",3,154,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00154
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"It is quite clear the second category — I mean, we talk about Singapore being a safe society. My position to the Police has been that those sorts of cases, you want to be able to walk in the streets, feeling safe. You need to know that if there is that kind of conduct, that will end up in court. But if you start taking every assault to court, I do not think we are doing justice as a society either. Because you will get into a detailed involved assessment of intent, cause.",4,155,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00155
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I think the intent of your question then and now, Mr Singh, is that the criminal law is not the best solution for these cases. It should be dealt with through other ways, without undermining the rule of law. We agree. There are some internal frameworks for the Police to try and assess that and deal with it. If the Police try to deal every single case of police report on voluntarily causing hurt, it would be an impossible situation. And I do not think we will be better off as a society either.",5,156,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00156
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, there is a framework to try and deal with this. Of course, people who are not happy, there are other routes, as the Member knows as well; through a magistrate's route as well.",6,157,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00157
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"If you want more details of how we work it, to the extent that it is possible to give it, because we do not want people gaming it either, I am happy to share the details.",7,158,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00158
2021-03-05-T-005,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"I thank the Minister for his Statement. I think we certainly welcome the new framework. I have spoken on this on a number of occasions and I welcome the updates. Just one clarification I seek from the Minister. In the last two years, one of the questions that was raised is, quite a number of cases relate to those who have a position of trust with the victim. Just to rattle off some recent cases  teacher molests seven boys, former Secondary school teacher abuses 15-year-old students, Secondary school teacher molests boy in school lab, Primary school teacher molests 12-year-old boy and so on. You also have, recently  male nurse allegedly molests male patient, Statutory Board director outrages modesty of female subordinate, doctor at Mt E accused of molest against a female patient.",1,159,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00159
2021-03-05-T-005,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Many of these are in a position of trust. Would the Ministry consider further enhancing the sentencing framework and increase the penalties for those who not only cause hurt or sexually abuse the victim, but start out from a position of trust, so that we ensure that such crimes where the victim already feels a sense of comfort in the presence of the person, does not fall prey to such offences.",2,160,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00160
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,I thank the Member for the question. I mean he reeled off a list of cases where people have abused that position of trust to molest or otherwise hurt someone close to them.,1,161,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00161
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Let me make the general point first. We are a low-crime society. Societal relationships, man's behaviour with man, these things happen everywhere. I do not want people to go away thinking that, in some way, in Singapore, it is more extreme. In fact, it is much lower. It is much lower because, as I have said before – and I think Senior Minister Teo might have, too – in Singapore, a few things are quite certain. When you have done wrong, you are likely to be investigated. Second, the investigations do not usually take very long. Third, if you are guilty, you are likely to be found guilty and you are likely to face the penalties because we start off from that framework. Also, on the whole, we have a highly law-and-order-based society. People obey the laws. I think we have managed to keep the criminal behaviour to a much smaller context than many other countries do. So, we start from a position which would be of some envy to most well-ordered societies.",2,162,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00162
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"With that, the specific question that Mr Yam has asked, these factors are already relevant, highly relevant, for sentencing. If you are in a position of trust, if you are a teacher, that is a very serious consideration that is taken into account in sentencing. So, there will be no question in the minds of people, if you are a teacher, if you are a doctor, you are in a position of fiduciary relationship where you have control or you have oversight over the other person and you take advantage, the Courts treat that very seriously, and we have reflected that approach quite clearly.",3,163,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00163
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"And that is, of course, without considering, if you are a professional, the professional bodies will have something to say. For doctors, the Medical Council will follow up. So, you will face both professional consequences and criminal consequences. So, I think we ought to be quite clear that being in a position of trust is a very material – in fact, central – consideration in enhancing penalties.",4,164,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00164
2021-03-05-T-005,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Christopher de Souza.,1,165,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00165
2021-03-05-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I agree with the Minister that we are starting from a position of strength. My question is in relation to the handout provided. At section 73, it says that there are enhanced penalties for offences against domestic workers, and that can be twice the maximum penalty.",1,166,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00166
2021-03-05-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"My question here is really that it is good that we protect our foreign domestic workers because they are in a position of vulnerability. But I think that section 73 should be widened not just to include foreign domestic workers, but people who are in a position of vulnerability because of their employment. And that can expand beyond the FDW matrix. So, if we are, indeed, wanting to protect the vulnerable, then would a reconsideration of section 73 and the widening of it be considered in this review?",2,167,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00167
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I thank Mr de Souza. I think the current position, we were quite deliberate that it should cover vulnerable victims. And in my speech now, as well as when I moved the amendments, the way we saw our society, what is happening, you have children who are vulnerable, you have domestic workers who are vulnerable and, in a fast-ageing society, you have senior citizens who are vulnerable, who are not able to take care of themselves, and you have intellectually-challenged people who are vulnerable. So, we have sought to define people in vulnerable categories; and offences against them, the penalties are much more severe. So, we have already gone down that route and the definition is quite comprehensive in terms of starting with what we mean by ""vulnerable"". So, all those categories I have mentioned are considered vulnerable.",1,168,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00168
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We then added on another category that would not, in the usual sense, be considered vulnerable – girlfriends or people in an intimate partner relationship when they are subjected to violence. If you are in a marriage situation, the Women's Charter allows you to go and take an application, a Personal Protection Order (PPO). But if you are an unmarried partner, you cannot go and take a PPO under the Women's Charter because, by definition, it only applies to people who are married, spouses. So, we extended the protection to persons in an intimate partner relationship. So, if you abuse your girlfriend, now these enhanced penalties will apply to you, and your girlfriend can take out the appropriate orders under POHA, for example. So, we have covered vulnerable categories. But I will be happy to ask my Ministry to relook at it. But we were quite focused in the way our society was changing. Particularly, I was concerned about senior citizens who now are at homes, and elder abuse, and I felt that we ought to stiffen the law before it becomes prevalent.",2,169,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00169
2021-03-05-T-005,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Ms Sylvia Lim.,1,170,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00170
2021-03-05-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thank you, Speaker. I have two clarifications for the Minister on what he said earlier regarding the policy that the AG in general will object to a rehabilitative sentence for certain kinds of offences. So, my first clarification on this is  is there going to be a change in the law to specifically provide that rehabilitative sentences will not be available to certain categories of offences?",1,171,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00171
2021-03-05-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"My second clarification is  I think it is important also for the Minister to confirm that these moves in no way undermine prosecutorial discretion which is provided for under the Constitution. So, I would like him to confirm that, so that there is no misunderstanding on this point.",2,172,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00172
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Thank you. On the first question that AG, AGC or prosecution will generally object in general, in fact, as I have said in my speech, for some time now, that has been the position of prosecution in general when it comes to sexual and hurt offences. They object to community-based sentencing or rehab-based sentencing, and they focus on deterrence and sending the message. I am re-emphasising and reaffirming that approach and saying that AGC will be even clearer in that approach hereafter.",1,173,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00173
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"On the second question whether this undermined prosecutorial discretion, absolutely not. I mean, as I have mentioned in my Ministerial Statement, you will have cases where individuals – intellectually-challenged, did not know what they were doing was right or wrong or on the margin – these are not matters that we can set out in broad terms here in Parliament, and AGC will have to decide, case by case, and the Courts will have to decide case by case. But what is important is that Parliament understands and affirms, and the Executive, my Ministry, puts before Parliament the Government's policy and this Ministerial Statement sets out the Government's policy for Singaporeans, which we put before Parliament that we will take a no-nonsense approach to sexual and hurt offences. Rehabilitation will not be the primary consideration. The primary considerations will be deterrence and prevention and sending the message clearly, and consistent with what I have articulated, as a fundamental tenet and value. So, it is for the Government to set out that policy. It is for Parliament to put that policy in law where it is not already in law. And I have said we will make amendments in three specific situations, and we set out what we believe should be the approach which is good for society as a whole. And that then has got to be the guidelines for AGC to apply in exercising their prosecutorial discretion. The discretion has got to have a framework to be applied; framework has got to be supplied by Parliament. And for the Courts, with their judicial independence to apply, the Courts also need a framework. So, that is the context to the Statement. Thank you, Sir.",2,174,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00174
2021-03-05-T-005,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Murali Pillai.,1,175,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00175
2021-03-05-T-005,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the hon Minister for his Ministerial Statement. I think his unequivocal Statement, in relation to the fact that qualifications of an offender would not matter in relation to sentencing, will go a long way to assuage members of the public that he were concerned about the sentences imposed on offenders that the hon Minister mentioned.",1,176,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00176
2021-03-05-T-005,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"My clarification is on the Sentencing Advisory Council. The hon Minister mentioned that his Ministries will be looking at this. May I ask whether the remit of the Advisory Council would extend to not just offences dealing with hurt or having sexual elements, but really to the entire spectrum of offences, so that members of the public would be able to be apprised as to the sentencing guidelines and this would improve access to justice as well.",2,177,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00177
2021-03-05-T-005,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The second clarification concerns the Attorney General's role. The hon Minister spoke about the case whereby the 22-year-old undergraduate strangled and I think injured his ex-girlfriend's eye as well. I note that, in that case, actually, there were two offences that he committed. The Attorney General, or rather, the Public Prosecutor applied for the criminal trespass charge to be taken into consideration for purpose of sentencing and I also understand that there was no appeal arising from the sentence. Given that the hon Minister mentioned, in answer to the hon Member Ms Sylvia Lim, that it has been a practice of the AGC to object to rehabilitative and community sentences in relation to such offences, why then was there not an appeal? And in relation to the offence that was taken into consideration, it was criminal trespass but, as I understand, the offence was that he broke into the house of the girlfriend, and the Penal Code has an aggravated form of offence. Housebreaking is an offence for which the offence is punishable by three years' sentence. So, may I understand what is the AGC policy in relation to such matters where there is hurt in the context of a relationship?",3,178,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00178
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I thank Mr Murali Pillai for the questions. On the Sentencing Advisory Panel, the remit is being worked out. I think it makes sense for the remit to be covering beyond sexual and hurt offences, and that is the intention. Precisely which offences would be covered, I do not want to prejudge that at this point.",1,179,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00179
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Second, specific to the facts of the 22-year-old undergraduate, under the criminal trespass charge that was taken into consideration, this goes directly into what Ms Sylvia Lim had asked. It is really not for me to second-guess and say, on specific cases, why the Attorney General's Chambers did or did not do something. That is a matter of discretion. But let me recall or put across the facts as I remember them.",2,180,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00180
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I think Mr Murali Pillai will remember. It was a case where, yes, there was a break-in but the ex-girlfriend then spent some time talking to the young man. And, in fact, took him – if I recall correctly – to a part of the house. It may well be, if I were the prosecutor, I would look at it and I will say that that is not going to be an easy case, because, yes, there was initial trespass but was there subsequent consent? So, one has got to look at the facts carefully. There can be a variety of reasons why charges are taken into consideration.",3,181,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00181
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Why was there no appeal? As I said, it was dealt with in accordance with the law at that point in time. Today, we have enhanced the penalty. For example, this would have been treated like an intimate partner violence case, where the penalty would be higher. The Courts imposed a sentence that was in line with the precedents at that point in time and AGC's assessment was that it was not going to be easy to challenge. I cannot be dealing with every specific discretion that AGC exercises.",4,182,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00182
2021-03-05-T-005,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Speaker, I would really like to thank the Minister and the teams from MHA and MinLaw behind this review and for hearing the voices of many young women as well as the effort to engage and review the framework. I have three clarifications.",1,183,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00183
2021-03-05-T-005,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"The first, from a victim-centric point of view. Other than the intention to amend the maximum penalties for three sexual offences, will the Government consider putting in place programmes and training to better ensure trauma literacy within the criminal justice system to safeguard the interest of victims of hurt and sexual offences?",2,184,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00184
2021-03-05-T-005,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"Second, Sir, the trauma on victims can be irreversible. But I have spoken in this House about going beyond second chances and I have worked with young offenders and families with people incarcerated. I know that some offenders pay for a very long time, beyond their sentence, and society includes them too. I hope the Minister can elaborate more about how the sentencing principles of deterrence and rehabilitation to prevent future incidence of reoffending are balanced in the second proposal as the range of sexual and hurt offences is very wide. What do certain offences where rehabilitation will not be considered include?",3,185,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00185
2021-03-05-T-005,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"My last point. It is very evident from heated discussions online that there is significant public interest in this space. What steps are being taken to educate the public and, in particular, youths about consent and power dynamics in sexual interactions and what role can the media and public more responsibly play to elevate the conversation? I appreciate the sentencing guideline and just hope that it can be made friendly to the layman so that it is easily disseminated, for example, by social media.",4,186,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00186
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,I thank Ms Nadia Ahman Samdin for those questions. Let me start off with one point that I think we should all be very clear about. We can express our views set out in the Parliament through legislation – tough laws – but let us not walk out of this Chamber with the belief that the laws alone or even the enforcement of them is going to prevent all offences. No society works on that basis.,1,187,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00187
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The one thing I have learned in 30 years in the law, in one way or another, is that the laws are there, the majority of the people do not need laws to keep them straight and a small minority who will be tempted, many of them will not be tempted as long as they know that the laws are tough and there will be enforcement. But there will always be, regardless of what steps you put in to prevent fraud, what steps you put in to prevent criminal action, there will always be a group that breaks the laws.",2,188,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00188
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Having the laws is important for the bulk of society but let us be clear – there will be people who will break them and we will have to deal with it. That is the starting point. Whether it is laws against sexual offences or laws against fraud or laws against speeding; any of which.,3,189,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00189
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"With that, how do we take into account victims' interests and protect them? You have victim impact statements. They can be submitted to the Courts so that the Courts are very informed about the impact of the offence on the victim, and the emotional and physical trauma that has been suffered. I have talked about it earlier. In order to protect the identity of the alleged victim, gag orders can be made. I have given you in my Ministerial Statement a framework in such cases on how the victim could be protected from some types of cross examination, from having to face the accused, from having screens to protect them. Of course, in addition, there are Protection Orders available and Expedited Protection Orders available under the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA) and the Women's Charter, as appropriate.",4,190,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00190
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We are also exploring, we are talking to the Courts about the possibility of recording video-recorded interviews of victims and then, using those videos as evidence in court in lieu of examination-in-chief. And we think that that might help reduce the victim's trauma from having to recount again in court the ordeal the person went through. We are trying to reduce the number of times a person has got to talk about the ordeal that he or she went through; usually a ""she"".",5,191,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00191
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But when we speak about all of this, do not forget the presumption of innocence and the accused's right to a fair trial and have the allegations tested in court. So, never forget that.",6,192,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00192
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Second, Ms Nadia Ahman Samdin also asked about the role of media and members of the public. In order to have meaningful discourse, you need a better understanding. To raise the level of understanding, we are, for example, publishing the guide on sentencing that I spoke about in my Statement. We are also talking about the Sentencing Advisory Panel issuing guidelines. But, of course, I think we must be realistic. Not every member is going to check out the MHA website on guidelines and read them. I think a few days ago I recall Mr Pritam Singh saying that he did not realise that I had made nine speeches. I am realistic about how many people read my speeches and visit the MHA website. But we will put it out and we will try and get people to understand. Of course, lawyers will be better informed as well.",7,193,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00193
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The media, I think they play a very important role, in helping the public get a fuller and better understanding of the process and what is the framework. But I think one point to which I do not really have a solution is that individual cases, partially reported, without the full facts, tend to invoke a lot of passion, excite a lot of passion, and then people form views. We have to be careful about the cases being trialed in the court of public opinion. Or there being decisions which are pushed upon by the public with not a full understanding either of the law or the facts. Because not the full facts are out in the media most of the time. We have to allow judges to carry on and do their jobs.",8,194,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00194
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But public opinion is important and for the Parliament to be aware of the public sense of right and wrong is also important because that allows us to calibrate and make sure our laws accurately reflect where the balance ought to lie. Now, we ought to decide that – in the best interests of the public. But public viewpoints and public opinions are relevant in coming to that assessment.",9,195,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00195
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Ms Nadia Ahman Samdin also asked about the balance between deterrence and rehabilitation in sentencing. Most of my speech – quite a lot of my speech – was targeted at dealing with that. Again, it is for the Parliament to decide, depending on the offence, what the balance ought to be.",10,196,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00196
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"It should depend on age. That is why in my Ministerial Statement I spoke about adult offenders being treated more severely. You would treat a 15-year-old differently from a 25-year-old or a 23-year-old. So, we need to look those factors. We need to look at the degree of active consideration of what the person was going to do, the culpability, the seriousness of the offence.",11,197,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00197
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"For younger offenders, the general approach – the dominant factor – ought to be rehabilitation. Because they do not have the full maturity of adults and they are still in their formative years. The chances of reforming are higher.",12,198,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00198
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But other sentencing principles, like deterrence and proportionate punishment, may take precedence over rehabilitation, even for younger offenders, where the offence is serious, the harm caused is severe, the offender in our assessment is hardened or recalcitrant, or the conditions that make rehabilitation options viable do not exist.",13,199,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00199
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Say, a young offender has committed rape. The Courts may impose imprisonment and caning instead of a rehabilitative sentence like probation or reformative training, because of the nature of the offence, its severity and the likelihood or the possibility that this may happen again and other people need to be protected.",14,200,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00200
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"For adult offenders, I have explained, for sexual and hurt offences, rehabilitation would not be the dominant consideration unless there is a strong propensity to reform and specific factors strongly point to rehabilitation. But I have also said, ""I am a person with bright prospects"" or ""I am an undergraduate who is going to do well in life"" – those are not very relevant factors. I have been quite clear about that.",15,201,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00201
2021-03-05-T-005,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I thank the Minister for Law for that very clear statement. As an advocate to end domestic violence, I really appreciate the statements made. I have two clarifications. One on the guidelines themselves, second on the composition of this advisory panel.",1,202,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00202
2021-03-05-T-005,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"On the guidelines, I understand that the guidelines are non-binding but highly persuasive. In the UK, they amended the Evidence Act to make those guidelines binding upon the courts but the courts can depart from them if it is in the course of justice to do so. But if I may offer another alternative position used in the Victorian courts, where the panel themselves can be invited by the court of appeal to provide some views before the sentencing of a particular case. I say this so that we do not shut out any possibility or flexibility to cater to evolving societal needs and specific individual cases.",2,203,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00203
2021-03-05-T-005,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"On the second part, the composition of the panel, I ask the Ministry to consider a diversity, both in terms of gender and also expertise. In the UK, it is about 60% women but also entirely made up of legal professionals and judiciary. But in Victoria, it is about 50% women but comprising victims, crime support advocacy groups and also criminal justice professionals. Perhaps the Minister can see whether the Ministry can consider such diversity in the panel.",3,204,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00204
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"On Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim's two questions, and as to whether the panel can be invited to give views, we will give consideration but the situation in Singapore is slightly different from Australia. Let me explain why.",1,205,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00205
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"This is a relatively small place. The panel will also have judges. First off, it would look a little odd that judges appear before judges to give their views.",2,206,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00206
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, the composition that we are thinking of will have judges, practitioners, lawyers certainly, appointed by the Law Minister. The way we are thinking of, MinLaw might appoint two. Who those two persons will be, we will decide on whether it needs to be from the Bar or from other places. Other stakeholders will be involved.",3,207,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00207
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"A sentencing guideline issued by such a body, would be as I said, highly persuasive. It will be widely known across the legal and judicial circles. And I think that it helps us put up a framework beyond the legislation. Whether you need to go further, we can look at things as they evolve, but we also need to be careful how we structure it.",4,208,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00208
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Second, I know, its a buzzword, diversity. I am a believer that you appoint the appropriate persons to the right job. This requires expert viewpoints. The guidelines from the panel must carry weight. It must have gravitas for judges to take it seriously. That does not mean that you cannot take in the viewpoints of a variety of people interested in this matter. NGOs will have interest, others would have an interest, people who want specific laws or specific types of penalties to be changed will have an interest. And you must appoint a panel that is open to hearing all these viewpoints. But the panel must have the expertise to make an assessment based on the law and what makes sense, and put it across. Open-minded, but an open mind is not an empty mind. It must also not absorb whatever nonsense that comes up. It must be able to assess what makes sense, what does not make sense, make an assessment, give guidelines that would carry authority and respect.",5,209,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00209
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Who can provide that? There are many who have viewpoints. They will all be welcome to give their views. By necessity, the panel will not be a very large panel and there will be limits on how many people can be there. There is, in principle, no disability imposed on people, but I do not think we should run after this with diversity as a primary goal. The primary goal must be a sentencing body that would carry respect. In terms of gender diversity, I do not think Mr Zhulkanain or Members need to worry. That is something that my Ministry will keep front and centre, and even if we did not, I think more than half the profession are women anyway. So, you will expect that to be reflected in the panel.",6,210,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00210
2021-03-05-T-005,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"Mr Speaker, we welcome the Government taking a tougher stand on sexual and hurt offences, and we also support the position that the offenders' academic achievements should not be a factor in sentencing.",1,211,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00211
2021-03-05-T-005,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"But I do have a clarification though, on the Sentencing Advisory Panel. While it says that this panel's decisions will not be binding on the Court, it does create a situation, if the Courts were to deviate from the guidelines issued by this panel, it does create a situation that requires an explanation and therefore could create some pressure.",2,212,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00212
2021-03-05-T-005,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"So, my question is, how does the Minister address the concern that this could be viewed as the Executive arm going into an area that has traditionally been under the Judiciary, and could this potentially compromise the independence of the Judiciary in the area of sentencing?",3,213,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00213
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I am having difficulty following the question. But perhaps can I ask Ms Poa, in principle, does she support the setting up of a Sentencing Advisory Panel? Then, we may be able to discuss further.",1,214,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00214
2021-03-05-T-005,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa,I am afraid that I will not be able to answer that question because I need clarifications on how this sentencing panel will influence the Judiciary. My concern is actually about whether it would compromise their independence.,1,215,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00215
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I think Ms Poa understands what I am asking, but she does not want to answer.",1,216,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00216
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Why should it compromise the independence of theJudiciary? First of all, I said more than half the members would be from the Judiciary. Second, the purpose is guidelines for the future without referring to any specific case. Just like here, we are discussing what the laws ought to be. Do we compromise the independence of the Judiciary by doing so? Do we compromise the independence of the Judiciary when we set out in the law, what the punishments ought to be? Maximum, minimum, sometimes we say mandatory? Those decisions are made, that is a framework in which the laws are applied.",2,217,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00217
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The guidelines are guidelines which will flesh out a little bit more. And it is for the Courts and the judges in the individual cases to decide whether the guidelines need to be departed from or need to be applied. How do the giving of these guidelines, how do the guidelines that the Courts have internally, how does any of this compromise the independence of the Judiciary? On Ms Poa's reckoning, the judiciaries in Australia and UK are no longer independent. May I have a view, please?",3,218,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00218
2021-03-05-T-005,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa,"The range of sentencing will be actually specified in the law. And within that, the Courts then mete out individual sentences for each case. But so how does this Sentencing Advisory Panel add on to what is in the law? How does it further restrict? I need further clarification on how it will work.",1,219,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00219
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I think I have tried to explain this a number of times. Let me make a further attempt. The law sets out maximum penalty – four years, five years – for such an offence. The law cannot, if you look at the legal provisions, go into much more detail than that. Sometimes, you can have illustrations, you can have some examples. And the Second Reading speech tries to flesh it out a bit more.",1,220,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00220
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But a Sentencing Advisory Panel looking at different types of cases can set out, flesh out a little bit more, in non-binding language in cases that fall into this sort of factual matrix involving offenders above a certain age, involving this type of offence. Generally, we think the range of sentences, our view is that it should be between this and this. That is what the Sentencing Advisory Panel can do. And as I indicated, more than half of the Sentencing Advisory Panel will comprise judges anyway. It is bringing together a combined wisdom to set out a framework for how cases can be dealt with and it is aid for the individual judges faced with individual cases and applying the law and the guidelines to the specific facts to see whether the facts come within, should it fall within this range or there are facts which take it out.",2,221,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00221
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As I said, on the reasoning of Ms Poa, a number of judiciaries around the world would not be considered independent.",3,222,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00222
2021-03-05-T-005,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"I thank the Minister for his Statement. I fully support the measures and the framework. I just want to make a point on behalf of workers, particularly, in four sectors  healthcare workers, transport workers, private security workers, as well as cleaning sector workers. I am fully aware that section 6 of the Prevention of Harassment Act does extend to Public Service workers and we have enhanced that. Whether Minister can consider in view of the vulnerability or should I say in a sense that they are essential workers, consider covering them within the ambit of this framework.",1,223,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00223

2021-03-05-T-005,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Perhaps consider them as in a position where we need better protection for them and in more deterrent sentences.,1,225,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00225
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I think we need to be careful about using the tag of vulnerability. There are two points here. Certain categories of workers that you have mentioned perform essential services, they are front facing, they face people and we need to help them because they are more often abused. That is a fair point. But you got to find the right rubric.",1,226,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00226
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The right rubric is therefore not to extend the categories of vulnerable victims. I think the right rubric is to say these people face bigger risks and can we identify them or people who fall in those categories for some additional protection? For example, public sector workers, essential workers, these are all defined and may help them. And I think upon your advocacy, we have also extended greater protection to other categories of workers. So, it is possible to work the law towards covering different categories, but you must use the right framework.",2,227,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00227

2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As I understand Mr Giam's question, for harassment, there is a continuum. There is harassment which does not cross the threshold of criminality and then there is a harassment that does cross that threshold.",1,234,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00234
2021-03-05-T-005,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Once it crosses the threshold, that is what I have been talking about, amongst other things. The law takes over, criminal sanctions apply. I am not sure Mr Giam was in Parliament then, but when POHA was amended, it specifically allows individuals who feel harassed to take steps and to prevent the harassment, because, as I said, not all harassment amounts to criminal conduct. We drew a line ahead of whatever is criminal and said individuals, you can go and get remedies.",2,235,2021-03-05-T-005-S-00235

It is a fundamental value for society. And every boy and girl has got to grow up learning that respect for women is a non-negotiable point. And, therefore, it is not cool to go and do this.

The fares follow an integrated distance-based structure. Commuters are making more transfers during trips but the trips are shorter. Travel time has also reduced drastically. Now there are many integrated routes to get to your destination. The average fares are lower, especially for bus trips. In previous fare review exercises, the actual fare increase was found to be less than that determined by the current fare adjustment formula.

Earlier in the Budget debate, I spoke on the need to revamp the bus routes to be sustainable. For train operations, the most profitable train operator in the world is Hong Kong MTR which uses the rail plus property model. Hong Kong government is the majority shareholder of MTR and it gives land and development rights to MTR at the greenfield price, that is, the price of the land before the railway is built. MTR subsequently builds malls, offices and private residential houses around the MRT stations and collects lucrBative rent to subsidise the train operation.

In June 2020, five years later, the MKBF was an amazing 1,638,000 train-km – a 12-time improvement. The dramatic improvements were due to the hard work of public transport workers, MOT and LTA.

This was especially crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic when the ridership plunged, and so did the fare collection.

Our brothers and sisters are hit with the double whammy of low street hails, having to drive aimlessly around, wasting fuel and time, on having to deal with the petrol tax hikes. Would the Ministry consider allowing for more flexibility for our P2P drivers, to allow them to stop and wait in taxi stand bays outside the designated waiting lots, and even around taxi drop-off points, during the night when there is no longer any traffic or road safety worries about parked taxis along the road.

Having undergone technological change with ride-hailing apps, diversifying into transport services like deliveries, or even just facing the economic realities of COVID-19 crisis, our P2P drivers are a resilient bunch. However, the Government must anticipate, ease and enable our drivers to prepare for these changes. We must not let the P2P transport sector become a byword for creative destruction, just as rickshaws and trishaws are looked upon today, but beckon and support them along the evolution journey of our P2P transport sector.",5,336,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00336

2021-03-05-T-008,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"Would MOT consider capping the number of PHCs like what MOT has done to limit the number of taxis? In fact, our founding Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, did not want so many Singaporeans driving taxis. Thus, the growth of taxis was restricted and only Singaporeans above 30 years old could drive the taxis. The rationale is not to hog too many young people in the driving profession.

In totality, there are 2.5 times P2P vehicles today as compared to eight years ago. Do we really need so many P2P vehicles and drivers in Singapore?",5,342,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00342

2021-03-05-T-008,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),Among these features are rest points and roundabouts. The former is to allow road crossing in two stages and the latter is to smoothen traffic flow and traffic conflict points. I would like to ask LTA to consider adding construction of shelter for pathways and pedestrian crossing to the existing list of the Silver Zone features. These feature should be constructed at locations where LTA deem necessary and feasible.,5,377,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00377

Popularised in the 1960s, cycling as a mode of transport is not new to Singapore. It gives life to our city, it is more affordable, healthier and possibly, more convenient.

2021-03-05-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Finally, let me talk about aviation. When COVID-19 struck, passenger volume at Changi fell to 0.5% of pre-COVID-19 levels. Almost a year later, the good news is Changi is now carrying five times that. The bad news is, that works out to only 2.5% of pre-COVID 19 volume. So, we are still in crisis mode.",42,440,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00440

I then checked with our Universities, who told me that most aerospace graduates still found jobs this year, but likely in non-aviation sectors. So, fortunately, engineers are a very versatile bunch.",46,444,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00444
2021-03-05-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Mr Dennis Tan asked about help for the aerospace sector. There are three areas of help, and this was covered in the Budget Statement. One is the Jobs Support Scheme. The aerospace sector is now in the top tier, 30% for the next three months, and then 10% for the following three months. They also enjoy the Enhanced Training Support Package which provides stronger support when they send their workers for training. Thousands have gone and it has been very helpful for the aerospace sector. And also, EDB put in a lot of effort to temporarily redeploy talents to other sectors while the sector waits for recovery.",47,445,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00445
2021-03-05-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Mr Dennis Tan asked what proportion of workers benefited from the COVID-19 related grants? I will say everyone who kept their jobs. That is the impact of the Jobs Support Scheme and the	Enhanced Training Support Package. It helped all these companies stay above water, and retain core capabilities so that there is still a future for the sector. And that strategic outcome is either there or not there, either you believe it will work or you do not believe it will work, and you decide to do not do. You cannot quite measure or audit it.",48,446,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00446

To do so, it is transmitting without symptoms, and it is mutating.",49,447,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00447
2021-03-05-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"So, in terms of prospects, I can only say this  first, this year I do not think it is realistic to expect a V-shape recovery for the aviation sector. Second, it is also possible that the virus becomes endemic, meaning it is something we have to live with, to cope with and to adapt to in the long term, just like the influenza virus. And third, notwithstanding this, with vaccines, and the realisation of governments around the world that they cannot perpetually close up their borders, I believe there will be some re-opening of borders this year, and some recovery this year.",50,448,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00448

2021-03-05-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"As I explained to the House before, what kills travel is quarantine and Stay-Home Notices (SHN). Very few people will want to travel abroad if they know they have to go through a lengthy isolation. So, to revive aviation, we need to replace quarantine and SHN with other methods that can also substantially mitigate the risk of transmission. Now, I think there are four ways after all these months of experience.",56,454,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00454
2021-03-05-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The first is testing, which is key to re-opening borders. Nationally, we can now perform more than 60,000 tests a day. And with tests, we can detect infections early and prevent transmissions.",57,455,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00455
2021-03-05-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The second is to ""bubble wrap"" travellers. Ensure that they are kept to a tight itinerary, restricted premises, away from community, do not see anybody in the community. This is how we managed to do maritime crew change and this is how the new Connect@Changi facility works.",58,456,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00456
2021-03-05-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The third is to recognise that travellers from certain places are safe, because they have successfully controlled the virus. That is why we unilaterally opened our borders to places such as Australia, New Zealand, Brunei and China. And so far, the scheme has not led to any increase in our local transmission. It works.",59,457,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00457
2021-03-05-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"If other places reciprocate what we do, we have an Air Travel Bubble (ATB). We have yet to launch an ATB successfully.

In fact, I think ATBs are going to be important, which I will explain.",60,458,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00458
2021-03-05-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"And that leads to the fourth way, which is a new critical development – and that is vaccinations. As more scientific data become available, we will be able to ascertain the extent to which vaccination reduces the likelihood of someone carrying the virus and passing it to somebody else. And this will enable us to allow vaccinated individuals to travel with fewer restrictions, perhaps even without SHN. It will require a system of certification, like the yellow booklet, which some of us have, that records our vaccinations against Malaria or Yellow Fever. And these discussions are happening bilaterally and also at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). And Singapore, we have been active in all these discussions.",61,459,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00459
2021-03-05-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Aviation is like the lung of Singapore. So, this lung needs inflating, but our head is under water.

And each snorkel cannot work in isolation. They must work together.",62,460,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00460

I thank the Minister, the Senior Ministers of State and the Senior Parliament Secretary for painting a very exciting scene that we would have in the next few years for public transport, and especially for aviation.

Activities would include a lot of supplementary industries. And we know that it could be the best in class, but I hope that it will be best in class supported by a best in class MRT station as well. I did not hear Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat saying anything about having a train connection there, but he mentioned about having a new housing estate. So, we hope that he can clarify, because by 2030, as what Minister said, there will still be no train to the Tuas Port area.",2,586,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00586

If so, it does not seem very exciting. For example, in Nanyang estate, there are a lot of cyclists, but there are zero cycling paths, zero kilometers of cycling path.

So, we have to look at how to minimise the inconvenience and at the same time, look at how we can bring benefits to the community and look at how to mitigate some of the trade-offs.",3,592,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00592

2021-03-05-T-008,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"I would like to thank Minister for answering my question about the financial sustainability issues that I raised. My question is with regard to fare concessions. The last fare concession increase, if we look at MOT's website, the last inclusion into the fare concession coverage was in 2019, where PTC extended student concessionary fares to Polytechnics and other diploma students. And I think it benefited more than 80,000. My question is, are there any new concessions in play going forward, in future as fare adjustments come on stream. And the Minister highlighted that fare increases might come in going forward, and what are the plans in terms of concessions? The reason why I highlighted about the adult learners, is to capture some elements of adult learners who are studying in the Polytechnics. Some may not be captured in the move on 2019.",3,599,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00599
2021-03-05-T-008,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"The second question is with regard to Mr Chee's response just now, the seafaring and shore-based jobs, and the green maritime sector jobs. How many jobs will be created in those sectors? And whether more can be done to entice more Singaporeans, young Singaporeans, to explore good jobs there? I think not many of our young or our Singaporeans are aware of some of these jobs there. I think those are good jobs that we need to let them know even more about going forward.",4,600,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00600
2021-03-05-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I want to assure Mr Saktiandi, I really understand what you are saying. I really understand. In 2019, in fact, I was really happy that fare concession was extended to Polytechnic students, because the then Minister for Education lobbied very hard for it. And the then Minister for Transport was kind enough to also support it. So, I fully understand. But I think going beyond that, it becomes less obvious. But let us keep an open mind.",1,601,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00601
2021-03-05-T-008,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I think the principle is this. I am merely mentioning that over the years, from time to time, there have been fare increases and that same system will continue. And in the second half of the year, PTC will have to convene and have to consider. But whenever there is a fare increase, should there be one, we must always protect the vulnerable groups, like the low-income, the students, the seniors, and fare concession is one way to do so. And I think we keep to that principle and see how we can best ensure that those who find difficulty affording can be protected against fare increases.",2,602,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00602

2021-03-05-T-008,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"In the maritime sector, our aim is to be able to create an inclusive and diverse range of jobs. If you look at the port sector, this will be the traditional roles that we have, crane operators, drivers, but increasingly, we are also looking at new roles that we need different skills and different groups of individuals to come in to fill these roles. When we pursue environmental sustainability, green growth, de-carbonisation of shipping and port operations, I think this will open up new opportunities and new possibilities.",2,605,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00605
2021-03-05-T-008,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Similarly, I think for the maritime services which actually go hand-in-hand with the port, because when we grow our port and shipping lines call at Singapore, they register their ships here with our registry, they base their headquarters – their regional and global headquarters – here in Singapore, we can then offer them all the other maritime related services – financing, insurance, legal, brokering and so on and so forth.",3,606,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00606
2021-03-05-T-008,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"All that will create a lot of opportunities for different groups of Singaporeans. Different age groups as well. Young graduates, but also mid-career entrants who want to join the sector. So, they may transit, for example, from engineering, from finance sector, from IT, and they want to now enter this growth sector. We welcome them.",4,607,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00607
2021-03-05-T-008,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Lastly, I want to say this. It is not just the number of jobs – which is very important and we will try our best and we will try and create as many as we can – but in the end, it is also about whether we are able to raise the quality of jobs. This is something which is very crucial because it requires a strong tripartite partnership to work hand in hand with companies and the Labour Movement to be able to redesign the jobs and to be able to upskill the jobs. I think in the process of doing so, together with growth, we are then able to provide higher pay, better prospects, and I think this will allow us to attract more Singaporeans to enter the sector.",5,608,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00608

2021-03-05-T-008,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,The first question I have is in respect of what Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey has shared with us regarding safe riding. I agree with Member Ms Yeo Wan Ling's concern regarding safe riding on footpaths. I would like to implore on LTA to continue to improve efforts at public education as well as at consistent enforcement.

2021-03-05-T-008,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Yesterday, I shared during the MND Committee of Supply in a cut on safety of the Park Connector Network (PCN). The reason why I shared during the MND Committee of Supply – but it is related to, I think, a lot on LTA's efforts on this – is that I believe that a busy PCN, especially during peak times, is always a good indicator of the state of our culture of path sharing by different users. I expressed concern that over two years because – I shared a previous cut on this two years ago in the same MND Committee of Supply – I felt that there is not many changes in terms of the culture. Therefore, I would like to implore LTA to continue to work on public education as well as consistent enforcement.",4,613,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00613

Can I continue to implore LTA to consider public education from the point of view of not just giving information to interested users who will draw information from the Facebook but rather to think about how to disseminate public education on safe and considerate use of footpaths and the PCN, to people who do not consciously look for it. Because these are people who use our footpaths, the aunties and uncles who may get upset with people ringing the bell when cyclists are passing by, keeping left or keeping right, people walking their dogs on the PCN or footpaths, stopping to chat. These are all very everyday moments. That is one.",5,614,2021-03-05-T-008-S-00614

It is not compelling. First of all, the demand for hospital cleaners and hospital attendants is the same throughout the year. There is no seasonal component involved. It does not vary much throughout the year. And in a COVID-19 world, it makes sense for team members to stay based within the same healthcare institution rather than moving from place to place amidst a pandemic.",30,662,2021-03-05-T-009-S-00662

I cite some of the most common reasons pertaining to their decision. They are worried about immediate side effects. Moreover, the two approved vaccines in Singapore are based on a novel technology, so the long-term effects are unknown. Some are also questioning the need for vaccination as the community infection rates are low. They may not go for the vaccination if there is no need for a vaccination certificate to travel.",2,668,2021-03-05-T-009-S-00668

Other than the response to my recent Parliamentary Question for what I understand the most recent publicly available data on health risks, behaviours and outcomes by socio-economic class was 2010 National Health Survey. The National Registry of Diseases already collects data on the incidence of cancer and chronic kidney failure. It is an easy next step to include SES indicators like income and education. We must also study the entire life cycle of chronic diseases. Are low-income groups contracting more diseases, more severe diseases or even earlier diseases?",5,682,2021-03-05-T-009-S-00682

Are they receiving a later diagnosis with poorer outcomes compared to wealthy Singaporeans who can choose top tier private care, for example? I am not suggesting that this is the case but it would be useful to have the data. Some doctors have observed COVID-19-related backlogs and patients transferring from private to public to save money, pressuring the public system and lengthening waiting times for subsidised patients.",6,683,2021-03-05-T-009-S-00683

Who is scrutinising the other players in the healthcare costs equation?",26,747,2021-03-05-T-009-S-00747
2021-03-05-T-009,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, in 2013, the Government started allowing the use of MediSave for IVF, subject to a withdrawal limit per cycle and per patient. Recently, many couples have called for an increase in these limits to better meet IVF costs.",1,748,2021-03-05-T-009-S-00748
2021-03-05-T-009,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"MOH has said, ""Couples who find themselves unable to cope with unexpectedly large bills, for instance, as a result of complications, even after co-funding, may appeal to use MediSave beyond the current limits"" on a case-by-case basis. It has been over seven years since we reviewed these withdrawal limits. I hope we can conduct a review and consider increasing the limits on the use of MediSave for IVF and not just on a case-by-case basis. IVF is a costly procedure. It would be a pity for couples who are unable to afford it but have funds in their MediSave, to be denied the gift of parenthood.",2,749,2021-03-05-T-009-S-00749
2021-03-05-T-009,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In the dialogues I have organised on IVF, many couples told me that they have achieved better results from supplementing their IVF treatments with TCM. Some doctors recommend TCM treatment for certain patients as it may optimise results. TCM treatments such as acupuncture can act as a supplementary method for patients to increase their chances of success.",3,750,2021-03-05-T-009-S-00750
2021-03-05-T-009,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My wife also, upon the advice of our doctor, did TCM during our IVF treatments. Some might say that TCM does not work, while others say it does, but we can all agree that it does help provide an ease of mind, that we have tried everything we can do to have a successful IVF cycle.",4,751,2021-03-05-T-009-S-00751
2021-03-05-T-009,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"TCM can be expensive. Couples I have spoken to end up spending around $500 to $1,000 a month, on top of already mounting IVF costs. Can we allow couples to use their MediSave which they are allowed to use for IVF and subject to the current withdrawal limits, for TCM treatments associated with IVF?",5,752,2021-03-05-T-009-S-00752
2021-03-05-T-009,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Last month, I proposed extending co-funding to the seventh and eighth IVF cycles to support couples who need more cycles to conceive successfully. MOH responded that, ""We also need to balance the need to meaningfully and responsibly allocate public funds on this.""",6,753,2021-03-05-T-009-S-00753
2021-03-05-T-009,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In this case, rather than provide additional funding after the sixth cycle, will MOH allow co-funding leftover from the first six subsidised IVF cycles to be rolled over into the seventh and eighth cycle? Can it also allow any co-funding leftover from the three subsidised fresh cycles to be used for the subsidised frozen cycles?",7,754,2021-03-05-T-009-S-00754
2021-03-05-T-009,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),These are funds the Government has already budgeted for. It is win-win solution as it allows couples to complete additional cycles using subsidies that we have already budgeted for without additional allocation needed.,8,755,2021-03-05-T-009-S-00755

Both overseas and local research have pointed to the impact of maternal health on the health of our children. One of such findings is from a homegrown Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes or GUSTO study conducted by researchers in the National University Health System, KK Women's and Children's Hospital and A*STAR Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences over the last 10 years.",1,756,2021-03-05-T-009-S-00756
2021-03-05-T-009,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling,"The study found that one in five mothers-to-be develop gestational diabetes and this heightened the risk of their children developing obesity Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and even neurodevelopmental disorder later in their lives. Another concern pointed out by the study is the mental health of pregnant women. Mental well-being of mothers-to-be will also affect children, who are likely to develop neuro-developmental disorders such as anxiety, depression or disruptive behaviour disorders.",2,757,2021-03-05-T-009-S-00757

2021-03-05-T-009,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling,"Secondly, would the Government consider piloting more care services for maternal and child health such as the new Temasek Foundation Integrated Maternal and Child Wellness Hub at SingHealth Polyclinic at Punggol, to better understand what kind of intervention can improve the outcomes of maternal and children health.",5,760,2021-03-05-T-009-S-00760

So, we need to watch. Within Singapore, the COVID-19 situation has stabilised, with one or two new community cases on some days. Imported cases are isolated on arrival and the risk of transmission to the community is low. However, the World Health Organization has just warned that we need to stay vigilant as the pandemic is not likely to be over within this year.",2,772,2021-03-05-T-009-S-00772

Insurance plays a useful role in helping us stretch our resources through pooling, so that those who are ill can tap into the pool to pay for the healthcare services they need. That is why we introduced MediShield Life. But insurance has an inherent risk of over-consumption. This is because of OPM syndrome. What is OPM? Other People's Money. Because through insurance, we are pooling resources and we are tapping on other people’s money in the pool to pay for our healthcare services.

But this has affected their physical and emotional well-being. Without the in-person group exercises and the opportunity to meet their friends, they have less motivation to exercise. The online programmes are useful. But they are simply not quite the same. Our Action Plans to encourage active ageing must evolve with the pandemic. What is the progress on these?

Having GPs and community nurses with special interests and training, giving GPs and nurses direct access to specialist advice and closer teaming and better communication with doctors, which I know some private doctors do really effectively over email and WhatsApp, giving GPs and nurses access to a broader range of diagnostic tests are proven levers to transfer care to the community and, at the same time, reducing overall demand through direct demand management at the GP level and continued education efforts to make informed patients.",12,853,2021-03-05-T-009-S-00853

Therefore, we will unify B2 and C subsidies into a common framework, maintaining the same minimum and maximum range at 50% to 80%.

Some preferred air-conditioning and others wanted more privacy in the private wards. But the cost of a potentially long tail of SOC consultations upon discharge worries them. For this reason, some patients have sometimes had to forgo their preference and request for a subsidised ward instead.

First, regarding the Senior Minister of State, Dr Janil's observation that relooking healthcare needs to be through the lens of longer term issues in a COVID-19 world and looking at the larger social eco-system. I agree with this approach. It is essential in our approach to society and healthcare.",1,1113,2021-03-05-T-009-S-01113

If it is supply chains, countries are looking, ""at just in time"" as compared to ""just in case"". And may I suggest that on issues of workforce, we also may want to look at economies of efficiency, but juxtaposing this and considering as well the resilience of solidarity across the entire healthcare team. And I hope MOH will consider this as part of a longer term review for the COVID-19 world, and what comes next.",3,1115,2021-03-05-T-009-S-01115
2021-03-05-T-009,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Chairman, I thank Dr Tan for his clarification. I would agree with him that as needs evolve over time, and certainly COVID-19 is a very challenging time, for us to also take stock post-COVID-19, what kind of healthcare model will we have, and in that case, to build resilience within maybe certain critical parts of our healthcare system; do we need to review the current structure in which we engage with outsourcing of our staff?",1,1116,2021-03-05-T-009-S-01116

Regarding the vaccination programme, I am happy to hear that a huge percentage of our seniors has been vaccinated for flu as well as for pneumococcal. The issue now is, of course, the outreach to the rest. There is currently now no specific outreach programme to reach out to seniors that have not been vaccinated. So, I hope that MOH can review this and then take a look.",2,1121,2021-03-05-T-009-S-01121

2021-03-05-T-009,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak,"My second clarification goes to the Senior Minister of State Janil. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State on a hypothetical question  if COVID-19 outbreak were to happen in Singapore, in the sense, let us say it happened in November 2019, could our current system or our NCID have picked up the unusual presentation of pneumonia, and could we have the capability to diagnose such a novel virus? Looking back, do we have the ability to do so?",4,1123,2021-03-05-T-009-S-01123

The key thing about vaccination is getting them to be aware of it. So, we did try to roll out a public education campaign and this is something that we can build on. The other thing is to work with the General Practitioners (GPs), with the doctors, to get them to routinely advise their patients on vaccination needs, especially every time they come to visit, we would ask them to inform their patients, so that this will also increase awareness and their interest and uptake for vaccination.",2,1125,2021-03-05-T-009-S-01125

2021-03-05-T-009,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The short answer is yes. We pick up outbreaks of disease on a regular basis. Our level of paranoia, anxiety, concern about this increased after SARS, as a result of which clinical teams across the healthcare network have to report any number of either confirmed or suspected infectious diseases. And we have surveillance systems.",2,1130,2021-03-05-T-009-S-01130
2021-03-05-T-009,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"So, the real answer is not really whether we would have picked it up, but how quickly would we have picked it up and how quickly would we have responded and put in place many of these strategies that we now see as normal for containing disease outbreak. Whether it is the testing, the tracing, speed of that, the ability to quarantine individuals, the ability to do the sequencing and stand up therapeutics. So, certainly, our capabilities have improved and increased quite significantly since the first outbreak.",3,1131,2021-03-05-T-009-S-01131

2021-03-05-T-009,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"One of the reasons why we can do it much better today is because this is not SARS. We have learned the lessons from SARS, we have learned the lessons from COVID-19, and we have to prepare that Disease X, the next pandemic and the next crisis, will be like neither. And we need that institutional agility and institutional capability to deal with the unknown, which is one of the more difficult things that we have to do.

Maybe I add a bit more information on that, specifically about whether it is based on amortisation of assets, land cost, rental cost, all these – I hope to be clarified.",2,1136,2021-03-05-T-009-S-01136

I would like to ask for clarifications that the MediShield Life Scheme indeed is unaffordable, as one gets older, and there is a drain on the CPF resources on the Singaporean And that is a very high number, up to $110,000 for a family.

I have actually done an extensive explanation when I gave an update to this House late last year. I think the answer still applies. Mr Leong should check the Hansard. I think his point that the MediShield Life premium is unaffordable, the older the Singaporean gets, is not correct. Because if he checks my speech in the Hansard, he would have understood the fact that, for the Pioneer Generation, who are the older Singaporeans in Singapore, they get MediSave top-ups to pay for their premiums. In fact, for many of the oldest in the Pioneer Generation, they get virtually free MediShield Life because they virtually pay no premium at all.",1,1141,2021-03-05-T-009-S-01141

This is an area where the academics and the professionals working with people with mental health issues are very interested in looking at.

I called for several key gaps to be addressed, for more progress reporting and for more inclusion of the voice of PWDs in policy-making.",1,1306,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01306
2021-03-05-T-010,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),I wish to speak on two other topics today.,2,1307,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01307
2021-03-05-T-010,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"First, on Enabling Masterplans for the Disabled. The Singapore Government has supported the development of three five-year Enabling Masterplans for the Disabled. These plans list recommendations to enable PWDs to realise their potential and to become integral and contributing members of society. The current plan will be expiring this year and a new one is expected.",3,1308,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01308
2021-03-05-T-010,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"I would like to seek the latest update for the current third Enabling Masterplan. Next, I would also like to propose suggestions for the next Enabling Masterplan.",4,1309,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01309
2021-03-05-T-010,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"The current Enabling Masterplans take a life-cycle approach and cover general disability issues. But the needs of different disability groups are not homogeneous. I hence propose that the next masterplan also incorporate the inputs of each major disability group. The autism group, for example, where I help and volunteer, has just completed their own enabling masterplan, which I hope will be supported by the Government and the rest of society.",5,1310,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01310
2021-03-05-T-010,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"By encouraging each major disability group to take ownership, study the landscape, prioritise their top needs and invite solutions and partners, the national Enabling Masterplan will be all the more relevant and richer in content.",6,1311,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01311
2021-03-05-T-010,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Masterplans that are five years long also should be constantly updated and reported to reflect the latest achievements and challenges. The last published third Enabling Masterplan (EMP3), for instance, was not updated with the most significant change of our time—the COVID-19 pandemic.",7,1312,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01312
2021-03-05-T-010,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Next, on strengthening disability social service agencies, or SSAs. Many of the early intervention, special education and services for PWDs are run by these social service agencies. They provide disability expertise and harness the support of the community assets.",8,1313,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01313
2021-03-05-T-010,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Beyond programme grants, the Government has been supportive through measures such as the Government matching of charity donations through the 250% tax exempt benefit and the latest Change for Charity initiative. I call for the Government to provide more tailored support to its partner SSAs.",9,1314,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01314
2021-03-05-T-010,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Smaller SSAs will need greater support in resources such as shared services in fundraising, human resource, volunteer management and financial reporting and compliance. Larger SSAs too will need support. It is a fallacy that larger charities do not need help nor that they will naturally do well on their own.",10,1315,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01315
2021-03-05-T-010,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Just as Deputy Prime Minister Heng has encouraged the support of large local enterprises (LLEs), so should the same be considered for these larger SSAs.",11,1316,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01316
2021-03-05-T-010,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),Some specific ways of support include the following.,12,1317,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01317
2021-03-05-T-010,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),Identify their needs and support larger SSAs as they scale or develop deeper capabilities to move into new essential territories. Seed and better support the social enterprises of these SSAs so they can help meet targeted social bottom lines that are important for the community such as jobs in sheltered or supported worksites.,13,1318,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01318
2021-03-05-T-010,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Next, pay or co-fund corporate services such as the CEO and key financial, technology and human resource positions so that these SSAs can focus on and excel in their core services. Most donors do not fund important corporate services, but these are essential for compliance, for growth and for governance.",14,1319,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01319
2021-03-05-T-010,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Help the larger SSAs safely generate better returns from their reserves, which are sometimes large because of the need to save to pay for recurring high-cost services such as day activity centres. Consider setting aside a percentage of Singapore Savings Bonds or infrastructure bonds for the larger SSAs.",15,1320,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01320
2021-03-05-T-010,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Sir, in conclusion, the only way to predict the future is to help create it. The disability sector needs as much help as it can get. The Government cannot do it alone.",16,1321,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01321
2021-03-05-T-010,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Mr Chairman, I gave birth to my son, Ayden, in 2017 and having him is one of the best things that has happened in my life. Ayden has Down Syndrome and was also recently clinically diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum. There are some challenges for the family but I have so many things to be grateful for and I am glad for the support that I receive to raise my child.",1,1322,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01322
2021-03-05-T-010,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I am grateful for a Government that cares. The Enabling Masterplans and their evolution over the years reflect the efforts of the Government in creating an inclusive environment for persons with disabilities (PWDs). This is an on-going effort and we need to continue building on existing initiatives, but I am grateful for the effort of the team at MSF, who continues to look at various ways to support PWDs and their families.",2,1323,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01323
2021-03-05-T-010,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I am also grateful for activists and advocates who have blazed a trail for many PWDs and their families. Take hon Member, Ms Denise Phua, for example. Her years of advocacy and labour of love opened the doors for discussions and reviews and led to many meaningful initiatives that have made an impact to the sector.",3,1324,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01324
2021-03-05-T-010,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I would also like to mention Dr Lim Hong Huay and the team at Caring SG. I would declare at this juncture that I have been asked to sit as an advisor to this organisation, but I must sincerely say that I am heartened by the efforts and their passion to support care-givers of PWDs and provide them with helpful resources.",4,1325,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01325
2021-03-05-T-010,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I am also truly grateful and indebted to family members and friends who have provided unconditional support and love and have made this journey so much more meaningful. Their kindness and graciousness have let me to believe that there are many out there who are open and willing, and are keen to see a more inclusive society, one that embraces different abilities.",5,1326,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01326
2021-03-05-T-010,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"In my own experience and through conversations with parents of PWDs and people in the disability sector, there are still concerns about the level of understanding and inclusiveness in our society. Many parents have shared about unkind remarks people have made to them or the rude stares they receive when their child misbehaves in public. Some parents have shared about challenges they had in finding a suitable child care or pre-school in the vicinity of their neighbourhood. I have heard many instances of PWDs, especially those with intellectual disability, being bullied or taken advantage of in school or at work.",6,1327,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01327
2021-03-05-T-010,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Above all, what families of PWDs hope to see is for their family member to be treated with dignity. They are no lesser human beings and are as entitled to be treated with respect, like any of us here.",7,1328,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01328
2021-03-05-T-010,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"At this juncture, I would like to offer some observations and thoughts on creating a kinder and more inclusive society. Firstly, I would ask if the Ministry has been tracking the effectiveness of the various campaigns and effort in encouraging the public to be more inclusive? I am heartened by efforts by various agencies like the ""See The True Me"" campaign and I am always excited to participate in events like the Purple Parade. I believe there is now more awareness and sensitivity, but there is still some way to go before we can say that our community is truly inclusive and embracing of people with different abilities.",8,1329,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01329
2021-03-05-T-010,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),Have the different campaigns and efforts to encourage inclusiveness in the community been successful? Do we have indicators in place to help us measure how we are doing as a community and targets which we can work towards? What more can we do to nudge behaviours and encourage people to be more open and compassionate towards PWDs and their care-givers? May be useful to do a review of study so that we could assess a better approach to build on the current efforts.,9,1330,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01330
2021-03-05-T-010,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Secondly, I would like to propose that we take a more holistic approach in looking at opportunities to normalise different abilities within the society, in school, at work, and then the community. PWDs have much to offer society. We should equip PWDs with skills and empower the community so that PWDs may contribute to society in some way.",10,1331,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01331
2021-03-05-T-010,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I had in my speech for MOE's COS debate, shared my thoughts on how this could be done in the school setting. I would encourage a similar approach for the workplace and in the community. For example, I think there is a need to engage extensively and meaningfully with employers to create better understanding of different abilities and provide support for the redesigning of jobs.",11,1332,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01332
2021-03-05-T-010,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I appreciate that there are already efforts on this front and it is a challenging exercise. I feel though, in the long run, there is much value to be gained. Otherwise, we will continue to typecast PWDs, especially those with intellectual disabilities to just do menial tasks and we do not get to tap on their full potential. Another area, I believe we could work on, is to develop various infrastructure within our communities to accommodate different needs. We do see a few inclusive playgrounds, Braille in the lifts, quiet rooms in public places. And that is always very encouraging. However, such awareness and sensitivity to various needs should be more pervasive as we continue to build our common spaces in this country.",12,1333,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01333
2021-03-05-T-010,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Thirdly, I think we need to continue to educate the community on the appropriate norms or social interactions and empower them to embrace people with different abilities. We should create opportunities for PWDs to fully participate, physically and socially, in the community, but I think we also need to learn how to do so meaningfully. I have been to events where PWDs were invited to attend as guests, but they were seated at a separate table or space and there was no interaction with the rest of the participants or guests.",13,1334,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01334
2021-03-05-T-010,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Some families of PWDs would get upset or offended with reactions from the public. I think often people behave the way they do because of ignorance. I believe the Government can play a role in educating and creating understanding, but families of PWDs also need to be open and willing to embrace people who lack understanding, not shun or criticise them. Teach them, tell them kindly about the appropriate vocabulary, the appropriate approach, the appropriate way to interact. I believe that a conscious approach of integration and inclusiveness is necessary at the policy, organisation and individual level. I hope that we will continue to grow as a nation, to be one that truly cares for the vulnerable and embrace differences.",14,1335,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01335
2021-03-05-T-010,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"Chairman, it may be difficult for some people to understand just exactly how it feels for some of us, to look around this gallery and see so many women in Parliament.",1,1336,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01336
2021-03-05-T-010,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"In the private sector, organisations like DBS Bank, have led the way with several women in leadership positions. But we are still far away from translating gender equality in our schools to gender equality at the leadership levels, both senior management and Board. And it is not just a matter of time, I have done the research. Around the world, this gap has persisted for a long time, long after we have achieved gender equality in schools.",2,1337,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01337
2021-03-05-T-010,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"Even in leading organisations, more can be done to push the envelope, for example ensuring that more women are in leadership positions in revenue functions, in addition to non-revenue, as well as technology functions.",3,1338,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01338
2021-03-05-T-010,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"Mr Chairman, it is proven that gender diversity drives performance. Our companies will do better with more women in leadership positions. In addition, women leaders are important because they are role models who inspire the future generation. So, out of the Conversations on Women's development, what are the emerging ideas for what more can be done to really move the needle on getting more women in leadership positions?",4,1339,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01339
2021-03-05-T-010,,The Chairman,"Mr Seah Kian Peng, would you like to take your both cuts together?",1,1340,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01340
2021-03-05-T-010,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Thank you, Chair. This is the year we have set aside to celebrate women. This may seem, to some of us, to be an artificial effort. Why do we need a year to celebrate women, when they should be celebrated all the time? Or, the word ""celebration"" – is it not condescending to ""celebrate"" women, as if it is something conferred by the power of men or by institutions?",1,1341,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01341
2021-03-05-T-010,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"All these could be true, but I feel the effort itself has merit simply because despite all the progress we have made in the last 50 years, many of the traditional inequalities still exist. Added to these are new ones of income and inherited wealth.",2,1342,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01342
2021-03-05-T-010,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Sir, in celebrating women, we make gender salient, we confront biases that otherwise would not have been noticed. Unconscious bias is real, and sometimes, without intending, we do great harm. In these conversations, and to make any sort of progress, it is important to have some moral clarity.",3,1343,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01343
2021-03-05-T-010,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"One such issue has to do with apologies. It is important to note that when one apologises for a misstep, not just in relation on such gender biases, but in general, we should not hide behind ""misunderstood"" intentions, neither should we call on the person whom we offended to be gracious and ""forgiving"" about the matter.",4,1344,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01344
2021-03-05-T-010,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"It is time we recognise that the lack of malicious intent offers no shield, no defence against the harm that is done. Indeed, it is the very nature of unconscious bias that it is unintentional. So, when we apologise, we should certainly make the intentions behind our acts known, but we should also recognise that this is the start and not the end of the matter.",5,1345,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01345
2021-03-05-T-010,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Women play many important roles in Singapore. They are mothers, care-givers, workers, and members of our society. And I am encouraged that the Conversations on SG Women's Development is focused on addressing the issues that women face at home, in schools, workplaces and the community in real life.",6,1346,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01346
2021-03-05-T-010,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"What are some of the issues which have been frequently raised by Singaporeans in the SG Conversation? In this effort, we must ensure that the interests of all women are represented. What is the profile in the Conversations on Singapore Women's Development?",7,1347,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01347
2021-03-05-T-010,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"In addition, this conversation takes place within a society, a society of all of us. How many among these are men? What are their views? I recall when I served on the Board of Directors of Centre for Fathering for some 14 years, we had a number of women on our Board – yes on Centre for Fathering. And the views and insights from these women Board members strengthened the Board and made the organisation better. Actually this year, it is Centre for Fathering's 20th anniversary.",8,1348,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01348
2021-03-05-T-010,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Speaking of Boards, wearing my NTUC Enterprise hat, in preparing for this cut, I also asked for some statistics on the women representation on our Board. The hon Member, Ms Mariam Jaafar, you will be pleased to note that across the boards of eight of our social enterprises, 36% are women. This compares favourably with Singapore Institute of Directors's (SID) target of 30% for Public Listed companies by 2030; we are already 36%. But these numbers show that we have made progress but still have some way to go. And again, amongst the leadership team at the NTUC group of Enterprises, 50% are women. But there is still progress to be made.",9,1349,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01349
2021-03-05-T-010,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),One last point. What are some of the practical ways to ensure that women enjoy the same financial freedom as men?,10,1350,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01350
2021-03-05-T-010,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Given that family is the first line of care and support for many Singaporeans, we have traditionally supported and encouraged strong families. The implicit, normative bias is this – our old mindset that ""preservation of families"" is inherently good. The MSF handbook for example, states that, ""The guide introduces readers to Intensive Family Preservation in the Singapore context. This guide offers good practices and intervention strategies. Readers will uncover knowledge and skills to preserve families and protect children and young persons"".",11,1351,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01351
2021-03-05-T-010,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"The protection of young children is key and unequivocal. But I wonder if we need the moral overtones of ""intensive preservation"". Can we be more neutral between preservation and creation? Between status quo and change? Can we, make a start at least, in according equal respect to the choice between staying in a marriage and leaving it?",12,1352,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01352
2021-03-05-T-010,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"In saying this, I do not mean to undermine our commitment to strong families. Rather, I would like to say that strong families can take different forms. Some strong families lie within marriages, others are not. And we ought to make provisions for both. In so doing, I would like to ask, what is MSF doing to help strengthen familial and couple relations?",13,1353,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01353
2021-03-05-T-010,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"In cases where it is not possible to save the marriage, how can we mitigate the negative impact of divorce on children? In cases where risk factors for divorce are observed earlier, how can we provide better support earlier?",14,1354,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01354
2021-03-05-T-010,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Last, given what I have said about the need for neutrality in choices, but also respecting the need for strong families, how can we together forge a strong narrative in line with the larger Singapore identity?",15,1355,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01355
2021-03-05-T-010,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Mr Chairman, our children are often the ones who suffer the most disproportionate consequences in cases of divorce, particularly when the divorce is a high-conflict one and the parents involved are unable to co-parent effectively.",1,1356,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01356
2021-03-05-T-010,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"According to the MSF Study on the Inter-generational Effects of Divorce on Children in Singapore, children generally tend to suffer divorce penalties in terms of their income and academic qualifications. They were less likely to get married themselves, and among those who did, they were more likely to get divorced.",2,1357,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01357
2021-03-05-T-010,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Sir, we need to do more to break this cycle, by going upstream to help strengthen the resilience of our family relations and keep healthy marriages intact. According to the latest divorce statistics released in 2019, there were about three divorces in every 10 marriages. Can MSF provide an update on the number of divorce cases in 2020? I worry that the added stress and anxiety from the prolonged pandemic might could cause a further deterioration of relations in unstable marriages.",3,1358,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01358
2021-03-05-T-010,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"I would like to ask what is MSF doing to help strengthen familial and couple relations, especially for families dealing with multiple challenges due to the pandemic. Can MSF examine ways to help couples identify early signs of marriage distress, especially for the most cited reason of ""unreasonable behaviour"" and help resolve such marital issues earlier, rather than waiting till pre-divorce proceedings have been initiated?",4,1359,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01359
2021-03-05-T-010,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Lastly, in unfortunate cases where it is not possible to save the marriage, what is the Ministry's plans to mitigate the divorce penalties on our children?",5,1360,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01360

2021-03-05-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Domestic violence, particularly those committed against young children, the elderly and people with mental and physical disabilities must be eradicated.

2021-03-05-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"During this pandemic, many survivors of domestic violence feel that they can no longer seek refuge at the home of a friend or relative, for fear they could expose them to the virus. How can we encourage an environment of support whereby neighbours, family members and schools, help to look out for the vulnerable group in our society?",3,1363,2021-03-05-T-010-S-01363
2021-03-05-T-010,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"We have also to ensure that our Social Service Agency (SSAs) remain financially strong.

The PEERS Network was officially formed in July 2019, and includes Social Service Agencies (SSAs), community groups and Government agencies. Some are befrienders. Others offer their premises as “Safe Sound Sleeping Places”, or S3Ps for short, and these provide localised interim shelter. Officers from MSF and MND join the partners’ outreach walks to offer assistance.

2021-03-05-T-012,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Early last year, there was an urgency to provide shelter to rough sleepers because of COVID-19. For their safety, we needed to find rough sleepers safe shelter quickly. MSF called for more groups to open their premises as S3Ps. Over 40 organisations answered our call. And this was a six-fold increase from pre-COVID-19 times. We also worked with HDB to provide vacant flats as temporary S3Ps. d.	The Network has sheltered about 900 rough sleepers since April 2020.",2,1464,2021-03-05-T-012-S-01464

Frontline officers can connect those in need to relevant support, if the families’ issues go beyond their own agency’s remit.

One example is the plan that Minister of State Faishal Ibrahim mentioned to strengthen information exchange between Singapore Prison Service and the FSCs – he described this during MHA COS. This enables offenders’ families to receive timely support from FSCs and community partners. Another example is Streamlined Assessment Protocols, or SAPs, that allow ComCare clients to access other forms of help schemes more easily. They now qualify for medical assistance at public healthcare institutions, childcare subsidies and MOE Financial Assistance without having to be repeatedly means-tested.

One platform is what we called One Client View, or OneCV, which was rolled out last month to officers from 12 agencies. In the past, the household who wanted to apply for rental housing, ComCare assistance and childcare subsidies, for example, had to submit income documents three times to these three different agencies. With One Client View, the family can do away with these submissions and simply give consent for agencies to retrieve the information through this platform.

Today, collaboration takes place over different modes – emails, phone calls, messages, handwritten notes. Valuable information can get lost when case workers change, or new partners come onboard, and you can imagine many, many agencies are involved. Case Connect will allow frontline officers and case workers to make referrals, share assessments and updates, and coordinate with other partners on a single platform. To reduce the administrative burden on frontline officers and our social service agency partners, we integrated the systems with single sign-in and will progressively build system linkages.

2021-03-05-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"SPED schools charge different fees to meet the diverse and specialised learning needs of students, as they customise their programmes and services according to the disability profile of their students. Currently, the majority of SPED schools charge monthly fees ranging from $14 to $20 for Singapore Citizens (SCs).  Three SPED schools charge around $60 to $70 per month, and six charge higher monthly fees of between $120 and $250. Across all SPED schools, the mean and median monthly fees are around $120 and $70 respectively.",2,1628,2021-03-05-T-015-S-01628

In January last year, the SPED schools which charge relatively higher fees reduced their fees by at least 25% for SCs. In the coming years, we will continue to engage schools on reviewing and keeping fees affordable.",3,1629,2021-03-05-T-015-S-01629
