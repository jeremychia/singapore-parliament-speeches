2021-04-05-T-001,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for Health whether there can be a standby queue at COVID-19 vaccination centres to allow interested members of the public to take the place of those who do not turn up for their scheduled vaccination.,1,1,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00001
2021-04-05-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will reconsider its stand and to allow Singaporeans who are required to travel for work and studies to opt in to receive early COVID-19 vaccination since more vaccine supplies have arrived.,1,2,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00002
2021-04-05-T-001,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Health whether there is a hotline number for members of the public who have had their COVID-19 vaccinations to call if they have queries regarding post-vaccination symptoms and for clarifications and assurance.,1,3,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00003
2021-04-05-T-001,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for Health whether staff and volunteers working in mosques can be prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination in preparation for conducting terawih and qiyamullail during the holy month of Ramadan.,1,4,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00004
2021-04-05-T-001,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"asked the Minister for Health (a) to date, what proportion of persons aged (i) over-70 years (ii) 60–70 years and (iii) under 60 years have taken the COVID-19 vaccine; and (b) what measures are in place to increase the voluntary take-up of the vaccine.",1,5,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00005
2021-04-05-T-001,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the proportion of persons invited to make COVID-19 vaccination appointments who have been rejected due to them failing the pre-vaccination questionnaire; and (b) how is the Ministry adjusting its vaccination plans to minimise wastage of vaccines.,1,6,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00006
2021-04-05-T-001,Abdul Samad,Mr Abdul Samad,asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the number of workers in the essential services sector who have gone through the COVID-19 vaccination; and (b) what are the criteria for the selection of workers.,1,7,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00007

2021-04-05-T-001,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether he can provide an update on the COVID-19 vaccination programme; and (b) whether the Ministry intends to measure the antibody levels of persons (either as a class or individually) over time after they have been vaccinated to assess whether these persons retain immunity against the COVID-19 virus.,1,9,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00009
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Health),"Mr Speaker, may I address Question Nos 1 through 9 on the Order Paper, please?",1,10,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00010

2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, we would like to thank everyone for their support of our vaccination programme. We will continue our efforts to encourage the take-up of the vaccine. Vaccination is free for all Singaporeans and long-term residents. We have expanded the number of vaccination centres to 31 today and there will be a total of 40 vaccination centres islandwide by mid-April, so that individuals can be conveniently vaccinated near their home or place of work.",1,12,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00012
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Our supply of vaccines remains limited by the ability of vaccine manufacturers to deliver, given the high levels of global demand. This has resulted in limited booking slots in recent days. I apologise for the inconvenience caused to those who have not been able to book earlier. As more supplies arrive, we will progressively open more slots.",2,13,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00013
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"We have had to prioritise our vaccinations, starting with our healthcare workers, vulnerable elderly and those involved in COVID-19 operations. The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination had also recommended that we prioritise those personnel whose job roles are of critical importance to the functioning of Singapore and are at higher risk of exposure to and onward transmission of COVID-19. This is critical to ensure that key sectors would be able to continue functioning effectively even during a local outbreak, and further reduce risks to our vulnerable populations and the community at large. Such personnel include those involved in safeguarding our borders and maintaining law and order, those involved in the provision of utilities such as water, energy and telecommunications services, workers who ensure the supply of essential food items, and land transport workers involved in ensuring that our transport services are kept running.",3,14,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00014

Older religious workers, aged 45 and above, are already eligible for vaccination. Religious workers are also required to comply with safe management measures in the conduct of religious services and in other engagements with worshippers or devotees.",4,15,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00015
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"We continue to make steady progress with our vaccination programme. As of 3 April 2021, around 1.52 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered. Around 1.05 million individuals have received at least one dose of the vaccine, of which more than 468,000 individuals have received their second dose and completed the full vaccination regimen.",5,16,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00016

2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"We have recently invited citizens and residents aged 45 to 59 to begin to register for their vaccinations and close to 500,000, or about half, had done so. We are encouraged by the strong response. Those who have registered will progressively receive invitations through SMS to make appointments for their vaccination. This may take some time given the number of people who have registered. To date, about 17% of eligible individuals have received the vaccination or booked their appointments and we expect the rest should receive the SMS by the middle of May and they can expect a booking slot by early June.",7,18,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00018

2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"People under the age of 45 have also been patiently waiting for their turn. Based on current schedule, we plan to begin inviting them in June to book their slots. If all goes well, we will complete the vaccination programme as scheduled by the end of the year.",9,20,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00020
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Some members of the public may wish to receive their vaccination early for a variety of reasons. Since 16 March, we have opened up an appeals channel for Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who need to travel overseas on compassionate grounds, for employment or study purposes. Applicants will need to meet certain criteria. These are listed on www.vaccine.gov.sg/appeal. They will need to submit sufficient documentation to support their appeal. We will prioritise appeals with earlier travel dates if they are able to complete the two-dose regimen prior to departure.",10,21,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00021
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,Close to 98% of those who booked appointments for COVID-19 vaccinations in the last 30 days have showed up for their appointments. We estimate that about 1% of those who turned up were rejected because of concerns about allergies and contra-indications. We encourage everyone to be vaccinated when your turn comes and to turn up at the vaccination appointments that you have made so that you do not deny another person the opportunity.,11,22,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00022
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"However, such cases do not result in vaccine wastage. We closely monitor the appointment bookings and historical take-up rate, and deliver the appropriate number of vaccine doses to the vaccination sites. Unopened vials can be stored at the vaccination sites for at least three days. Vaccination site providers will start a new vial only when they have checked that there are individuals awaiting vaccination, to avoid vaccine wastage. At the end of the day, to utilise any balance remaining in a multi-dose vial and further minimise wastage, there are pre-planned lists of individuals who will be invited to be vaccinated. These could be staff who are working at the vaccination sites or frontline volunteers who have an active role in engaging seniors on vaccinations.",12,23,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00023
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"As with other established vaccines, people who receive the COVID-19 vaccine may experience common side effects, such as pain at the injection site and fatigue.

2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"In very rare cases, the COVID-19 vaccine can cause a severe allergic reaction, such as difficulty breathing, swelling of face, throat, eyes or lips, a fast heartbeat, dizziness and weakness or a bad rash all over the body. In the event of a severe allergic reaction, please call 995 or visit the nearest hospital immediately.",14,25,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00025

2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"MOH will be conducting further studies to monitor and review the extent and duration of immunity provided by the COVID-19 vaccines. This includes collecting selected post-vaccination samples from groups such as healthcare workers, frontline staff and seniors, to monitor the persistence of antibodies up to 24 months. Currently, in line with international practices, there are no plans to test the serology of everyone who is vaccinated in Singapore. We will share more details about the studies once they are completed.",16,27,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00027
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Vaccination is a key enabler to reduce the risk of community transmission and allow more economic and community activities to resume. As more vaccine stocks arrive, we will continue to expand our vaccination programme to more segments of the population, so that all Singaporeans and long-term residents in Singapore will have the chance to be vaccinated by end-2021.",17,28,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00028

2021-04-05-T-001,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Thank you, Speaker. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State for Health two supplementary questions. The first is, the Senior Minister of State did explain about the measures taken to minimise wastage but I would nevertheless like to ask whether a standby system can be arranged to allow those who are not yet eligible for vaccination but willing to wait on standby basis at vaccination centres, to take the place of those who did not turn up, assuming the frontline people and volunteers have already had their turn. So, whether a standby system can be arranged for those who are willing, as it will take to the end of the year for the rest of the population to get their jab.",1,30,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00030
2021-04-05-T-001,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"The second question relates to prioritising vaccination candidates. Would mosque staff and volunteers involved in additional night prayers during the holy month of Ramadan be considered to be at increased risk of infection, given that they are expected to serve at least 250 congregants a day?",2,31,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00031
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for the suggestion for a standby system. We will continue to study how best to deal with the challenges of prioritising those most at risk, those who have some urgent need and having some equitable distribution across our population, even as we try to cover as many people as possible before the end of the year. But we will study her suggestion.",1,32,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00032
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The point she makes about the prioritisation for workers in certain religious settings highlights the need for continued safe management measures and vigilance from everybody involved. But if there are specific individuals who might have particularly high risks, we will look at their situation and try our best to accommodate.",2,33,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00033
2021-04-05-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Ms Sylvia Lim.,1,34,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00034
2021-04-05-T-001,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, I have two sets of clarification for the Senior Minister of State. First of all, could he confirm that there has actually been a change in the advice given to certain groups of people who initially were considered to be ineligible or asked to defer their vaccinations. By that, I mean in the initial stages of the online screening, people were asked whether they had allergies and whether they suffered from certain conditions, but I think there is now new advice given that these people who were originally considered not eligible, actually can take the vaccination. So, I would like him to confirm that there has been an update or a change in those instructions.",1,35,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00035
2021-04-05-T-001,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"And in that light, first, has the online screening been modified so that we do not exclude people who can actually take the vaccination; and secondly, are we catching up on those who were deemed to have failed the online screening initially but now with further scientific evidence they are actually eligible to take the vaccination? How are we catching up with those people?",2,36,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00036
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Ms Lim is correct; indeed, the advice has shifted. It is severe anaphylactic reactions that we are most concerned about. And as an increasing number of people has been vaccinated, we have confidence over the situations in which someone previously thought to be ineligible might now go forward and have the vaccine. Indeed, the online systems and our various guidance to people manning counters and hotlines has changed.",1,37,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00037
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The way in which we are catching up is that the citizens involved remain as part of our patients, the patients of the healthcare providers, the vaccine system will continue to track this process. Most people are able to go forward and complete the vaccination. If there are individuals who have been deemed ineligible, I would reinforce that this is about deferring the appointment and the consultation to a time where they might subsequently become eligible. We will continue to pay close attention to this segment of the population.",2,38,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00038
2021-04-05-T-001,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the hon Senior Minister of State for his answer to my Parliamentary Question. I understand that he mentioned that the Government does not intend to measure the antibody levels of persons as it stands now. May I please ask the reasons for this, given that, at least amongst some quarters, the understanding is that the effectiveness of the vaccination may peter out after several months? Also, would there not be a need to guard against variants and, in particular, the effect of this vaccination against variants?",1,39,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00039
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his questions. As I have mentioned, we are studying the matter of antibody levels. I think before we make a decision about how we would look at what is happening in the population, let us, first, do those studies.",1,40,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00040
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"For most vaccinations previously, that has not been the approach to go with a population-wide antibody assay. It is also logistically very difficult and would place a burden on our population. So, we need to be sure that it is useful and necessary before we would do such a thing.",2,41,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00041
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"However, with the issue of variants, assaying a set of antibodies to a prior vaccination is not going to be necessarily useful to inform the clinical risk for a new variant that perhaps was not there when the vaccination was delivered.",3,42,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00042
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"So, I think there are two separate issues – the issue of virus variants is being closely studied by our experts as well as international experts; and the matter of if, when and whether we should be doing serology and antibody testing is also being studied. So, let us complete those studies before we make any decision on that basis.",4,43,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00043

2021-04-05-T-001,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Two quick questions for the Senior Minister of State. Given the diversity of vaccines that will eventually be deployed, I am wondering if there has been any effort by the Government in persuading take-up based on specific types of vaccines. I am thinking, in particular, certain of my elderly residents may have a preference, for instance, for the Sinovac versus mRNA vaccines.",1,45,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00045
2021-04-05-T-001,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Related to this, the second question is whether the Ministry will actually have a threshold target for coverage associated with herd immunity and, if so, what would the next phase of relaxation of control measures look like were we to attain that threshold.",2,46,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00046
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for the questions. The take-up rate is healthy across the vaccines that have been licensed and are being used in our various centres. But Sinovac has not been licensed yet. So, it is a bit premature to talk about that at this point in time.",1,47,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00047
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The target is for as many of our eligible residents as possible to be vaccinated. Herd immunity, indeed, is useful. But you can also imagine that we would perhaps want to make sure that individuals who want to travel overseas would also continue to be protected and that requires them to be vaccinated because, once they are overseas, they will not benefit from herd immunity here in Singapore. So, let us get that number as high as possible and we hope to be able to offer the vaccinations to all eligible Singaporeans along with residents by the end of 2021.",2,48,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00048

2021-04-05-T-001,Abdul Samad,Mr Abdul Samad (Nominated Member),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Senior Minister of State for the earlier explanation. I just want to check for the essential services workers. It was after I had submitted my Parliamentary Question that the announcement came for those who want to be vaccinated under a certain age group. But for workers in the essential services group, how do we then ensure that they are all vaccinated for the second dose in the appropriate time? The risk is because we tend to mix with migrant workers a lot and we also do a lot of engagements.",1,51,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00051
2021-04-05-T-001,Abdul Samad,Mr Abdul Samad (Nominated Member),"Earlier, as far as I am concerned, the first group of essential workers are those who were working during the circuit breaker period. After that, all are not being given priority to go for their vaccination. Hopefully, MOH can review this.",2,52,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00052
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his concern. We are, indeed, tracking the completion of vaccinations among the essential workers closely and we do so through the employers as well as some of the regulatory bodies for the relevant domain. We could not wait to complete every single essential worker before we then started with the elderly, the vulnerable or other at-risk groups.",1,53,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00053
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"So, we have a parallel processing, if you like, that essential workers continue to be vaccinated although most of them have largely been done so, together with the roll-out to the elderly. And, just as now, not all the elderly are vaccinated, we have started with the next group and we will, in parallel, open up to more and more segments of our population as our vaccine supplies come in. But we will continue to pay close attention to make sure that those who are vulnerable or who are at high risk or who perform these essential functions will get priority.",2,54,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00054

2021-04-05-T-001,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sir, I have quite a large number of residents who wanted to travel for various reasons and who have made various appeals. Some of them may be for studies and some of them may be for other purposes, like looking after nephews, to attend weddings. For some reason, MOH has applied quite strict criteria to those who have made the appeals. I am asking MOH whether they will consider being more flexible about allowing people to get their vaccination earlier before they travel overseas, as contrasted to extending the vaccination programme to residents of a different age when they can be actually quite neutral about taking their vaccination earlier or later. So, we have one group who wants it earlier versus another group who are actually very neutral about whether they get their vaccination earlier. So, could MOH be a bit more flexible to allow those who want to get their vaccination earlier to get it earlier?",1,56,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00056
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for the question. The issue is the limit of our vaccine supplies. Even though there may be some people who are a little bit agnostic about exactly when they get it and are willing to defer, the reality is that we are vaccinating people as quickly as possible, given the supplies that come in.",1,57,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00057
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"So, if we were to prioritise one group, it will be at the expense of another who currently wish to be vaccinated. The slots are booked and the capacity is being used up and the vaccines are being used up. So, we recognise that there are people who wish to be prioritised. We do have an appeals channel. We will try our best. There are criteria and it is very helpful that documentation is submitted to support those criteria and we will work our way through these appeals to try to help as many people to be vaccinated as soon as possible. But, ultimately, the limit is not our wish to force people who are perhaps a little bit hesitant at this point – we do encourage everybody to do it – the limit is actually the rate at which the supplies are coming in.",2,58,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00058

2021-04-05-T-001,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"Thank you, Speaker. I have a supplementary question. A few elderly residents told me they felt pain in their legs and their knees the day after vaccination. One even showed me a rash at the vaccination area. So, they worry and they wonder if it was caused by the vaccination or would it go away or they needed to seek treatment. So, I would like to propose if MOH would consider having a hotline manned by a multilingual team who can speak the mother tongue and dialects. It would be helpful to assure them.",1,60,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00060
2021-04-05-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for her question. There are two points which are slightly separate. One is the importance of making sure that we make our materials, transactions and interactions available in multiple languages. Indeed, we will pay quite a lot of attention to this, especially on the ground at the service counters at the vaccination centres.",1,61,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00061

What the Member is describing is a situation where one has clinical symptoms a day after vaccination and was worried about whether these are problems where you need medical help. I would suggest that perhaps a MOH hotline manned by our non-clinical staff may not be the best first port of call for residents in such a situation. If they have clinical symptoms, if they have persistent pain, persistent fever, rash and, especially things like difficulty breathing, what they need is to seek clinical help and they should do so from the relevant hospital, polyclinic and clinical care providers that are close to them.",2,62,2021-04-05-T-001-S-00062

We will make it easy and convenient to prove one’s vaccination status, including for persons without smart phones. The measures required for the unvaccinated are generally based on public health considerations to prevent infection and, so, would not distinguish between those who choose not to be vaccinated and those who were not medically eligible. Other vaccines may be available in the future for those who are not currently medically eligible. We will continue to evaluate scientific data and review the eligibility criteria accordingly.",2,71,2021-04-05-T-002-S-00071

More data is needed to assess if changes to border measures, such as testing and Stay-Home Notice (SHN) requirements, can be made for vaccinated individuals. More information is also needed to assess if such measures will be affected by the different types of vaccines. We are actively discussing with international counterparts on the possible mutual recognition of vaccination certificates. However, most countries have only just started vaccinations. Border measures will also take into account other factors, such as the number of COVID-19 cases and the infection control measures implemented in the source countries. Hence, progress on cross-border recognition of vaccine certification may take some time. We will provide further updates when there is significant progress.",3,72,2021-04-05-T-002-S-00072

2021-04-05-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"We are exploring with several countries and regions, including Australia, on the mutual recognition of vaccination certificates.

2021-04-05-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"However, vaccinations are only one aspect of pandemic control.

2021-04-05-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Singapore will continue – together with MOH, MOT and other agencies – to holistically evaluate the COVID-19 situation in various countries and regions, and explore the possibility of restoring air travel when it is safe to do so.

2021-04-05-T-003,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Speaker, I thank the Minister for the comprehensive reply. I have two supplementary questions. One, how would the recent announcement by the Hong Kong government to bar SIA from flying to Hong Kong for two weeks, affect the negotiation or the preparation of the travel bubble between Hong Kong and Singapore. And two, will the Minister reveal which are the countries we are negotiating with and preparing for travel bubble over the next few months?",1,91,2021-04-05-T-003-S-00091
2021-04-05-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Speaker, in short, the recent suspension of SQ flights to Hong Kong does not affect the talks to establish or restore the air traffic bubble that did not get to start. The reason is this. Hong Kong's civil aviation authorities set in place very transparent criteria for airlines. Once they breach the criteria, they get suspended for 14 days. So, they have suspended 23 times before this latest incident, involcing SIA. The suspension came about because of technical reasons. One of the criteria was breached, which is that SIA had a transit passenger, not from Singapore, tested negative at pre-departure, but tested positive at post-arrival. So, maybe an old case with intermittent shedding.",1,92,2021-04-05-T-003-S-00092
2021-04-05-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"And at the same time, I believe there were a few passengers who tested negative but carrying certificates from labs that are not ISO-certified. The Hong Kong civil aviation authorities enforce the criteria very strictly. So, it triggered the suspension.",2,93,2021-04-05-T-003-S-00093
2021-04-05-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Any travel bubble will not carry transit passengers. The travel bubble operates on the basis that the flights travelling within the bubble carries only what we call OD – Origin Destination passengers. So, transit passengers are outside of the bubble. We continue to want to work with Hong Kong to restore this travel bubble.",3,94,2021-04-05-T-003-S-00094
2021-04-05-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As for how many countries we are speaking to, there are many. But let me explain. I actually do not quite like the term ""vaccination passports"". It gives you the impression like we carry a passport and we can go anywhere. It does not work like that. I think what happens is every healthcare authority, after vaccination, issues a vaccination certificate that has to be verifiable, tamper-proof. And then, we talk to other regions and authorities to mutually recognise our certificates.",4,95,2021-04-05-T-003-S-00095
2021-04-05-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"That is the part where we are talking to many partners because it is good to mutually recognise our certificates. In Singapore, we have a very strong certification system run by MOH – verifiable, notarised.",5,96,2021-04-05-T-003-S-00096
2021-04-05-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"And after you mutually recognise the certificates, then you ask yourself, ""So what?"" Are you therefore – which is a question that Ms Foo Mee Har asked – subject to shorter quarantine, fewer tests? These are things that we have to discuss. I think the first criterion in such discussions would be, how safe is this region? If a place is safe, such as Brunei, New Zealand, Australia, even before there were vaccines, we already opened our borders to them. So, that is the first and foremost criterion. Is the place safe? And if it is moderately safe, then we can consider relaxing restrictions for vaccinated travellers.",6,97,2021-04-05-T-003-S-00097

2021-04-05-T-004,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Second question is, since Mr Mendoza had come up originally to claim his rights, after we had done our check on our rights, why did we not actually press the issue further and asked him to admit plagiarism, rather than just letting him go like that? Because in Singapore, we are aspiring to be the global original arbitration centre. Dealing with such infringement of IP rights lightly, will affect our aspirations to be that. Can the Minister clarify, please?",2,128,2021-04-05-T-004-S-00128

2021-04-05-T-004,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Leong should not also confuse asserting our rights with necessarily taking legal action, legal proceedings. They are not necessarily the same thing. And in this case, it was far more efficient, quicker and a lot more effective for Mr Mendoza to be persuaded that his own position was untenable, for his claims to be withdrawn by himself and not in any way removing the Singapore Government's claim and, in fact, for all Singaporeans' interest in the songs to be preserved.",5,133,2021-04-05-T-004-S-00133

Under the Constitution, the Government is required to balance the Budget over the term of government. And so, I wanted to ask the Minister whether this requirement, does it lead to the Government typically being more conservative in the Budget during the early parts of the term, and then, distribute and spend a bit more in the later part of the term? Do we have that phenomenon because of that Constitution requirements?",1,146,2021-04-05-T-005-S-00146

2021-04-05-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his supplementary question. The Government seeks to run a balanced Budget over the term of government by spending prudently within the limits of its annual revenues and any accumulated surpluses. The Government has generally adhered to this in line with the Constitutional requirement. In general, this means that we avoid running deficits early in the term of government. This is not only to avoid a draw on past reserves, which should be reserved for exceptional situations, it also helps the Government to preserve fiscal headroom to deal with unexpected spending needs during its term of government.",1,148,2021-04-05-T-005-S-00148

And that is exactly what we have done this year because we have been facing one of the biggest crises of all. This year, the first full financial year of this term of government, we sought and obtained the President's approval to draw up to $11 billion for the continued fight against COVID-19.",2,149,2021-04-05-T-005-S-00149

2021-04-05-T-005,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"A number of clarifications from me. Firstly, in the Parliamentary Question, it was asked about the fiscal space, and I recall in 2018, when the idea of the GST hike was first raised, if you look at the IMF Article IV report that was published at that point in time, and ""looking at these taxes would reduce private income and consumption, especially of low-income households. A GST hike alone could lead to a lower path for GDP and private consumption, and limited external adjustment, relative to using more of the available fiscal space"".",2,155,2021-04-05-T-005-S-00155
2021-04-05-T-005,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"And, I think, again in 2019, the IMF also said that, ""Singapore has tended to overperform with respect to its fiscal rule of a balanced Budget over the political cycle, contributing to a large build-up of net assets suggesting that Singapore has substantial fiscal space.""",3,156,2021-04-05-T-005-S-00156
2021-04-05-T-005,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Mr Speaker, if we look at the situation in 2018 versus today, where we have COVID-19 in terms of what is impacting the cost of living, the question that I have is, is raising a regressive tax such as the GST really the best option for us in terms of raising revenues? Could there be other options that could be explored, for example, looking at the NIRC framework again?",4,157,2021-04-05-T-005-S-00157
2021-04-05-T-005,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"And this also brings me to the second clarification, which I also raised during the debate earlier in February, in that if you look at our reserves position today, we are looking at having drawn down about 20 years' worth of surpluses – some Members have said that it is about 10 years. Where do our reserve stand today versus, say, last 10 years or five years? That would help us to adequately frame the context of this GST rise as well.",5,158,2021-04-05-T-005-S-00158

2021-04-05-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"During the Budget, the Workers' Party, touched peripherally on the Budget. I believe Mr Louis Chua mentioned land sales.

2021-04-05-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"In their social media post, what they had actually said was that  ""the Government says that the Government expects a deficit of $11 billion"" and they said the deficit should only be $3.5 billion.

2021-04-05-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The Government has set out the correct fiscal position. We do expect in this year, a deficit of $11 billion and we have explained why. So, essentially, in the social media post, what the Workers' Party had done was to point just to cash surpluses. And as I explained earlier, you cannot look just at cash surpluses to understand the fiscal position. You also need to look whether or not all of that constitutes revenue under our budgeting rules. And as for the reasons that I explained earlier, it does not. So, that was the first point that I wanted to respond to the Member Mr Louis Chua.",4,162,2021-04-05-T-005-S-00162
2021-04-05-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Then, the second point that he raised I think – well, he went through quite a lot of things but I think that the question that he ultimately came back to was, is the raising of GST the best option? I think after going through what the IMF said and so on, that was the question, and is it time to look at the NIRC formula again?",5,163,2021-04-05-T-005-S-00163
2021-04-05-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"This has been explained in some detail by the Deputy Prime Minister during the Budget.

2021-04-05-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"But in summary, we all know, we are so badly constrained, because of COVID-19, we already have to go into actual reserves, we have to dip into actual reserves. It is no longer just a question of taking from income on the reserves. We are squeezed on the corporate tax front. Because of the economic situation, you can have a scenario where even your personal income tax is going to be affected. So, GST is one of the options that we have, but because we know that GST does have an impact on the lower income and the vulnerable, we take steps to deal with that.",7,165,2021-04-05-T-005-S-00165
2021-04-05-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, as the Deputy Prime Minister explained earlier, actually 60% of our GST revenue comes from tourists and from the higher income.

It is no magic to this formula but it is a fair formula  50% for today's generation and another 50% for tomorrow's generation.",9,167,2021-04-05-T-005-S-00167

2021-04-05-T-005,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"But I think the question is also about whether or not, looking at this NRIC framework, that is something that we can revisit again. I agree with Minister that, because of COVID-19, this has actually impacted a lot of Singaporeans, a lot of corporates. And all the more, I think a regressive tax such as GST, should be something that we should reconsider. Because while the Assurance Package could offset the impact of the increase of 2% for a number of years, I think this is going to stick with them basically for the rest of their lives.",2,170,2021-04-05-T-005-S-00170

The immediate issue before us is just a formula change. How much income can the Government draw from the past reserves? We are changing the formula. The new formula will allow us to spend somewhat more. But the deeper significance of this amendment is to establish a more sustainable and equitable basis for spending out of the investment returns. Sustainable and equitable, so that we have resources which can benefit both the present generation and future generations. While we spend for our needs, we also put aside a solid buffer for contingencies, for the proverbial rainy day. That is the deeper meaning. But the most fundamental significance of this amendment is that it reaffirms the importance of protecting our reserves..."".",3,175,2021-04-05-T-005-S-00175
2021-04-05-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"In that speech, the Prime Minister takes us through the history of how originally it was just protecting the principal amount; then after that, we had the NII framework and we spent a 100% of that. Then, we went to 50%.

For example, Workforce Singapore has worked with Government agencies and industry to develop Jobs Transformation Maps to provide detailed insights on the impact of technology and innovation on the industry and workforce. The Labour Movement has also been working with businesses to establish Company Training Committees, to help our workers upgrade while supporting their companies' transformation. More immediately, the Labour Movement's Job Security Council is working hard to match and place workers, minimise retrenchments and shorten unemployment periods for our workers. This way, we achieve inclusive growth which uplifts our workers.",9,193,2021-04-05-T-006-S-00193
2021-04-05-T-006,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The Government is acutely aware of the plight of vulnerable workers who have been hardest hit by the pandemic. We have, therefore, been providing additional support for these workers who require more time and effort to reskill, upskill and re-join the workforce. One example is the Jobs Growth Incentive, to which we have allocated another $5.2 billion during the recent Budget to extend the hiring window by seven months. A higher level of support is provided to employers who hire mature local workers, persons with disabilities and ex-offenders.",10,194,2021-04-05-T-006-S-00194

2021-04-05-T-006,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Firstly, in particular, the ITMs, I think two key focuses are on jobs growth as well as strengthening the Singaporean Core. I hope, as MTI and the respective sectoral ITMs flesh out their updates and do their revisions, to share where the jobs growth opportunities are as we overcome and emerge stronger together post-COVID-19.",2,198,2021-04-05-T-006-S-00198
2021-04-05-T-006,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"The second supplementary question I have is with respect to the ITMs. I think different ITMs have varying successes. I hope to see more best sharing of good practices and the successes and the key success factors as well. But I also want to urge MTI as we look at the 23 ITMs and as we prepare for the next bound, to continue the good work of the sectoral tripartite committees because I felt, being personally involved in some of them, they are very useful in overcoming the sectoral challenges. So, I urge that, as we prepare for the next bound, to continue the good work of these sectoral tripartite committees.",3,199,2021-04-05-T-006-S-00199
2021-04-05-T-006,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,I thank Mr Patrick Tay for his supplementary questions.,1,200,2021-04-05-T-006-S-00200
2021-04-05-T-006,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"To his first question on looking for new growth opportunities, I fully agree with him. In fact, as I have mentioned in my reply earlier, a post-COVID-19 world will be a very different world. We are already seeing many of these changes. Changes have been accelerated and, in particular, technological trends have also been accelerated, especially digitalisation. As I have said in my Budget speeches before, COVID-19 has accelerated digitalisation in a way which very few CTOs have been able to do. There have been significant changes in the nature of work and even in the nature of the way businesses conduct themselves. And I must say that our agencies are already responding to that quite well.",2,201,2021-04-05-T-006-S-00201
2021-04-05-T-006,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"If you take, for example, the whole digitalisation trend, we are not waiting for the update of these ITMs before we act. We have increased the number of digital leaders and performers, especially among SMEs, from 9% to 12% from 2019 to 2020, and the share of digital starters also fell from 68% to 62%. Some of our MNCs and large local enterprises are on par with our global peers in this digitalisation.",3,202,2021-04-05-T-006-S-00202
2021-04-05-T-006,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"What this digitalisation trend means is that the nature of the job and the nature of skills will be very different, which is why it is critical that we develop those skills of our workers in this respect. To meet this job growth, the answer is not just in the Government deciding which are the sectors that will grow and which are the sectors that will not.",4,203,2021-04-05-T-006-S-00203
2021-04-05-T-006,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"And the significance of the Jobs Growth Incentive is exactly that when companies decide that they are going to grow, we incentivise them to draw in more workers and that is what the whole SGUnited Jobs and Skills package is all about. There are another part which is about the Attachments programme so that workers can get attached to get a sense of the nature of the job and companies can have a chance to evaluate the workers. For workers in newer areas, they can also go for training. These are the different ways in which we are preparing our workers and to grow our Singaporean Core, to move Singaporeans into areas with growth opportunities.",5,204,2021-04-05-T-006-S-00204
2021-04-05-T-006,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"On Mr Patrick Tay's second question about the varying success of the ITMs. In fact, whether you do ITM or you do not do ITM, the nature of economic growth cannot be predicted in advance. You cannot say that in five years, these sectors will grow; in five years, these sectors will shrink. There are sectors which will face more challenging conditions for which we are helping them to stay resilient. I mentioned that air transport and tourism are the most obvious areas from this COVID-19 crisis. But at the same time, even in normal times, you will find that some sectors will grow faster than others. Therefore, the way that we are helping our workers is to ensure that we provide as much training as possible – and that is where I want to commend our Labour Movement for the very good work that they are doing – both in starting the company training committee so that when companies are looking at how they will change and transform, at the same time, the union is working together with them to look at how the workers can be retrained for that. And this is not something to be taken for granted. I think this tripartism where our Labour Movement is not there to just oppose change but, in fact, to facilitate change so that, at the end of the day, whatever changes that are made can be sustainable in that you have the full support of our workers and our workers can have a better life. So, this is really the crux of this. And I want to thank Mr Patrick Tay and his team for their very hard work in the Labour Movement in doing this.",6,205,2021-04-05-T-006-S-00205
2021-04-05-T-006,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Mr Patrick Tay asked whether there would be sharing of good practices. Indeed, in fact, I have just made some changes in the way we organise our ITM work to link it to our work on R&D so that as technology and innovation play a more critical role in our economic future, we can work on both simultaneously. How can we help companies to transform to be more technologically savvy? And, in turn, I mentioned about the jobs transformation programme. How do we design programmes to enable our workers to have better skills in order to access those better jobs so that not only do the companies have higher productivity but our workers can look forward to higher wages and better employment prospects?",7,206,2021-04-05-T-006-S-00206

2021-04-05-T-006,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I would like to pose two supplementary questions on ITMs. Given that the ITMs began a few years ago, much has changed since then and we have learnt a lot in the past one year from the pandemic and changing macroeconomic situation. Are we incorporating these lessons learnt and revising the ITMs to better prepare ourselves for the future? For example, in the manufacturing ITM, should we be incorporating capability for vaccination production or preparing for PPE production in preparation for the next pandemic? And for the healthcare ITM, should we explore the use of technology or develop more skills to build latent capacity in our healthcare system that can be called upon and scaled up quickly when the next pandemic arises?",2,210,2021-04-05-T-006-S-00210
2021-04-05-T-006,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"For the second question, coincidentally, today marks the first day, after close to a year, where working from home is no longer the default work arrangement. In an earlier Straits Times poll, three in four respondents do not wish to return to the workplace full-time. Work from home or work from anywhere has brought about many benefits for both businesses and employees, including for the vulnerable workers and workers with mobility challenges. Not only does it allow jobs to be more accessible to all, it could also be a competitive advantage for companies in Singapore to vie for jobs outside of Singapore. This could be a game-changer for our professional services ITM. Can we lock in the gains of remote and flexi-work arrangements before we revert back to the pre-COVID norms? Can we relook at the opportunities to incorporate this into our ITM, moving forward?",3,211,2021-04-05-T-006-S-00211
2021-04-05-T-006,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"I thank Mr Sharael Taha for his questions. Indeed, not only can we work from home, we can work from anywhere and you get calls any time as well.",1,212,2021-04-05-T-006-S-00212
2021-04-05-T-006,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Mr Sharael Taha mentioned about whether we should take into account the lessons learnt from the pandemic as well as the lessons from these few years of implementation. Indeed, we should do that. And to the Member's specific question, for example, on manufacturing, what are the new opportunities for production of vaccines, for example, or even some way in which we can play a role in the vaccine, the economic agencies have been working very hard on this and I would leave the economic agencies to provide the announcement. All I can say is that I have provided sufficient budgetary support for us to secure some of these projects.",2,213,2021-04-05-T-006-S-00213
2021-04-05-T-006,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"On the Member's question about the skills, for example, healthcare and for us to move towards digitalisation, indeed, that should be the way. And as I have said, digitalisation has been accelerated and we must take this opportunity to look at how we can not only digitalise as much of our companies' processes as possible but also help our workers to build the new skills to be able to access those opportunities. And, in fact, beyond that, I have seen in many of our community centres, for example, that many seniors are being taught how to use digital tools – and I just did one over the weekend – as well as the projects to help our hawkers go digital, help our stallholders go digital and these are achieving good progress. So, I will say, certainly, we must take into account the changes.",3,214,2021-04-05-T-006-S-00214
2021-04-05-T-006,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"As to the Member's second question about work from home and work from anywhere and that this is a game-changer, I fully agree with him that this is a game-changer. But let me add that this is a game-changer that cuts both ways. If you can work from home, anybody in the world can also work from home. And I have seen, for example, videos of how workers in very, very depressed areas being able to access jobs in very advanced economies because all they needed was a knowledge of English, a knowledge of basic skills in doing what they were good at doing, a laptop and an Internet connection. And I have seen companies that have actually chopped up a very complex project into different bits and different parts for which they put it online for bidding and then you have workers all over the world bidding for those projects. And in one of the reports I saw, the worker was extremely happy because he had never earned that amount in his whole life. The company was extremely happy because the the cost to him was a fraction of what he had to pay in an advanced economy with very strong laws regarding employment and so on.",4,215,2021-04-05-T-006-S-00215
2021-04-05-T-006,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"So, it is a major, major opportunity but also a major challenge. That is why in all of last year's Budgets and this year's Budget, we have placed a very, very strong emphasis on upgrading the skills of our workers and I look forward to our Labour Movement working closely together with us on the Company Training Committee and a Job Security Council so that we can help our workers access good jobs, better jobs and to be able to ride on this digitalisation trend. And I hope that the work that we are going to embark on in a refreshed way, linking our R&D efforts with the economic sectors and pulling together these different strengths of efforts will enable us to make even better progress.",5,216,2021-04-05-T-006-S-00216

2021-04-05-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Nevertheless, COVID-19 represents a big and complex crises for the industry. Beyond this Bill, it is necessary to arrest the manpower cost surge which has led to a dramatic increase in construction costs. This can be seen in the escalating costs of successful BTO construction tender bids from pre-COVID-19 days to today. The surging of manpower cost is, in turn, largely due to three factors  the cost of Safe Management Measures (SMMs), high attrition of assisting migrant workers and difficulty to safely bring in adequate replacement of migrant workers.",3,298,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00298
2021-04-05-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Let me go into the details. First, the cost of SMMs is unavoidable because it is the price of keeping COVID-19 under control.",4,299,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00299

2021-04-05-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Due to this higher natural attrition, a number of migrant workers, especially those in smaller firms, have asked for hefty pay increases in return for staying on. MOM has recently limited the number of workers that companies can poach from one another and this has reduced the pressure. But the real solution is to ensure the safe replacement of sufficient number of migrant workers.",7,302,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00302
2021-04-05-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"And so that brings me to my third point, the challenge of bringing in replacement workers. The industry faces high quarantine cost of $2,400 per migrant worker, which has not decreased even as we move quarantine from hotels to dedicated non-hotel facilities. Despite the COVID-19 insurance, many firms fear the potential extra medical costs in a range of tens of thousands of dollars should any of the incoming workers suffer from severe COVID-19 symptoms. As such, while large companies working on projects of healthy margins and has the financial muscle and the cash flow to absorb this cost in the short run, we need to urgently resolve the safe replacement to help the rest of the industry along.",8,303,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00303
2021-04-05-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"After discussing with some industry players, I would like to propose this. Given that a large number of general construction migrant workers come from countries such as India and Bangladesh, is it possible for the Government to work with the Built Environment sector to forward deploy resources in key cities in these countries, given that COVID-19 vaccination is proceeding very slowly in Asia. For example, can we run commercial processing centres in those cities that will give us full operational control to ensure that testing is done by vetted vendors? The workers who have passed the test or who have already acquired immunity can be immediately transported to Singapore safely. And once they arrive in Singapore, they can be immediately get tested and vaccinated during quarantine.",9,304,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00304
2021-04-05-T-012,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Mr Speaker, Sir, let me conclude. COVID-19 has brought upon an existentialist threat to the Built Environment sector.

The proposed extension is a recognition of the ground reality that there are still many businesses and individuals which continue to suffer adverse impacts from COVID-19.,2,310,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00310
2021-04-05-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I note that the Government has decided, however, not to extend Part 3, which provides for temporary relief for financially distressed individuals and entities.

It had also increased the time period to pay from three weeks from demand to six months. This Bill confirms that the provisions of Part 3 will end on 19 April this year as scheduled. Yet today, we still see individuals and businesses who are drastically affected by the COVID-19 restrictions from earning income to pay their bills. These include our residents who used to run excursion and catering businesses, who have so far been unable to pivot to other business models.",3,311,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00311
2021-04-05-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"As we inch towards economic recovery, COVID-19 support programmes are being scaled down or stopped. However, economic recovery has been uneven across sectors. On this note, it will be most useful for the Government to explain why it decided that there was no need to extend Part 3 of the Act to give individuals and businesses continued breathing space from insolvency proceedings.",4,312,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00312
2021-04-05-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, I move to the amendments to Part 8C of the Act. Part 8C deals with the extension of the delivery date of property under sale and purchase agreements. The rationale for Part 8C remains sound. It enables developers, HDB and JTC to have more time to complete construction projects delayed by the pandemic. It also enables purchasers of units to claim additional costs incurred by the delays such as the cost of alternative accommodation.",5,313,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00313
2021-04-05-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Part 8C was enacted into law by Parliament in November last year under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment No 3) Bill. From what I understand, Part C has not come into operation yet and I believe earlier the Minister of State did say it would be operational in a few months' time. I wonder why this is so since the amendments in November last year were brought to the House on a Certificate of Urgency. In comparison, the amendments relating to TraceTogether were brought to Parliament only in February this year and are already in force.",6,314,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00314
2021-04-05-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"In addition, could the Minister explain why the amendments to Part 8C are being made even before the provisions become operational? I recall that at the November sitting, the Minister had assured Members that those provisions were drafted after wide consultations with the industry and were supported by the industry associations.",7,315,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00315
2021-04-05-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, I wish to make two observations about clause 8 of the Bill. I particularly welcome the new Section 39 OA, which provides for subsequent determination by an assessor based on new information. This is an important avenue to correct any injustice caused by an original determination, which was later proved to be unwise. Clause 8 also introduces a new section 39 OB which provides that parties coming for an assessment cannot be represented an advocate and solicitor unless special permission is given. Such a ""no-lawyers-allowed"" clause is not novel and is present in other legislation that aimed to provide low cost and less formal dispute resolution mechanisms. Despite the good intention behind this no-lawyers-allowed rule, I wish to point out that experience has shown that this can inadvertently lead to unfairness.",8,316,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00316
2021-04-05-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Residents who have gone through such hearings have highlighted to me that parties who are corporations have the advantage of sending their legally trained employees to represent the corporate entity, thus somewhat circumventing the no-lawyers-allowed rule. This has happened in the Employment Claims Tribunal and before the Financial Industry Dispute Resolution Centre or FIDReC. Corporate employers and financial institutions send their in-house counsel, who are not considered advocates and solicitors, while the employee or bank customer has to appear in his own capacity. This imbalance of knowledge and power has the potential to lead to an unjust outcome.",9,317,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00317
2021-04-05-T-012,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"For this Bill, it is foreseeable that developers, HDB and JTC will send legally trained employees to present their cases in front of assessors, while the purchaser has to prepare his own case. I would like to ask if the assessors are alive to this risk of unfairness and how to address it.",10,318,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00318

2021-04-05-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My first point is about what factors that went into deciding on this extension. Can Minister clarify what factors were considered before granting the initial four-month extension in November and now this six-month extension?,4,323,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00323
2021-04-05-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The construction sector does indeed need help. But a strong economic recovery must also be built on the rock-solid foundation of contractual obligations. One year after the start of the pandemic, we are granting a second extension of contract deadlines that is even longer than the first extension.",5,324,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00324
2021-04-05-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"While I support these amendments, can I ask if MND has also studied the impacts to the companies the construction firms has been granted relief from? Are these companies also clinging on and will they go under due to these reliefs granted to the construction firms?",6,325,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00325
2021-04-05-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"We have said that during this relief period, parties are encouraged to negotiate and resolve their difference in an amicable and mutually beneficial manner.

2021-04-05-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Further, I hope that MND can help shed light on a few questions.",8,327,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00327
2021-04-05-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"First, can MND share what factors it considered in determining this particular course of action? Second, can MND share whether it will consider future extensions of the same nature and, if so, what factors it will consider before making such decisions?",9,328,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00328
2021-04-05-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, I think no one in this House disagrees that we want to help our businesses survive. But we should also be concerned about the unintended side-effects of our decisions.",10,329,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00329
2021-04-05-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Singapore has always had a reputation as a business-friendly country. With this Bill, we might risk that reputation by again intervening with how contracts play out. It remains unclear whether there will be a third, a fourth and then, a fifth extension. I hope the Government will articulate a long-term plan for our construction sector that clarifies these doubts.",11,330,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00330
2021-04-05-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),That brings me to my next point. My second point is about how MND and the rest of Government can help the construction sector bounce back on its feet.,12,331,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00331
2021-04-05-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"This crisis is an opportunity for our construction firms to become more nimble. More than ever, they need to embrace automation, upskilling and other productivity-related initiatives. But such processes take time to implement.

2021-04-05-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"MND has taken some steps in this direction by allowing workers that have previously obtained the necessary Skills Evaluation Certificate (Knowledge) test (SEC(K) test) qualifications in a particular trade to return and work in the same trade in Singapore, without retaking the test.",15,334,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00334
2021-04-05-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The unfortunate reality of COVID-19 is that many companies have shut down. During the painful months of circuit breaker and dorm lockdowns, many experienced workers did not manage to find new employers and were often repatriated rather than circulated back into our economy. These were workers with experience living and working here. They know the expectations, they know the environment. It is more efficient to rehire them than to roll the dice with new workers. But there is no easy way for companies to find and hire these workers.",16,335,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00335
2021-04-05-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),MND and other Ministries should work together to reduce the obstacles to rehiring such workers.,17,336,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00336

2021-04-05-T-012,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] COVID-19 has dealt a severe blow to our construction industry. Most construction projects have been delayed. In addition to developers and their employees, related suppliers, contractors and the blue-collar construction workers, even building owners, buyers, sellers and tenants have been affected. Many Singaporeans who anticipated their new HDB flats have had to delay moving into their new homes. The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Bill seeks to provide viable and reasonable solutions for all affected stakeholders.",2,340,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00340
2021-04-05-T-012,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"I would like to ask the Minister, if HDB is the developer and a flat applicant is not able to move into his new home because his flat’s construction has been delayed beyond the legal completion date and he needs to rent a place elsewhere or pay the buyer of his old residence damages as he continues to stay there, is HDB liable for these extra rental and compensation costs?",3,341,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00341
2021-04-05-T-012,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),Clause 3 of the Bill provides that the developer may only further extend the delivery date after the developer has already extended the original delivery date by a total of 122 days. I would like to ask how did MND derive 122 days? This 122-day duration is longer than the three months' circuit breaker period.,4,342,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00342
2021-04-05-T-012,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"As for the assessors appointed by the Government, would the Ministry provide details about them, such as their backgrounds and professional credentials and how does the Ministry determine that they are independent?",5,343,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00343
2021-04-05-T-012,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"Most main contractors will issue a bankers' guarantee to the developer in order to perform contractual obligations. Since the developers are allowed under the law to delay the projects, these developers should not file claims and lawsuits against sub-contractors downstream. Doing so will only heap additional burdens upon troubled SMEs. Can MND work with relevant commerce chambers and associations, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to inform the industry and banks here?",6,344,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00344
2021-04-05-T-012,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),One way to prevent similar delays from happening in the future is to reduce reliance on foreign labour and supplies coming from overseas by improving productivity and upscaling domestic manufacturing capabilities to produce more Precast Concrete Building Components. I believe the Government is already working on these changes.,7,345,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00345
2021-04-05-T-012,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"To prepare myself for the debate on this Bill, I had a chat with a successful ""TowKay"" (business owner), to understand more about the construction industry. I jokingly asked Mr Lee, ""You are already so wealthy, despite the on-going challenges. Why are you still going after every tender and cent?"" His reply was, ""I have many mouths to feed.""",8,346,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00346
2021-04-05-T-012,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"Indeed, like our Government, many local construction owners have a strong sense of responsibility to take care of their employees, many of whom are sole breadwinners. According to the Labour Market Report, as of December 2020, there were about 116,300 Singaporeans and 288,700 foreigners working in the construction industry. I believe the Government will work with the industry and address the concerns so that our country’s infrastructure development will not be compromised. Notwithstanding my queries above, I support this Bill.",9,347,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00347

2021-04-05-T-012,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),I generally support this Bill. This Bill extends many of the interim relief measures that were provided to the construction sector to deal with COVID-19 for a further six months.,2,349,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00349
2021-04-05-T-012,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The construction sector has been hard hit. The freezing of borders and shutdowns in various countries have meant delays in supplies arriving from overseas. Locally, manpower constraints have been acute as it has been difficult to get workers from abroad, while workers located in Singapore have been prevented from working or delayed from working both by the general lockdown and safety measures as well as dormitory specific constraints. Labour costs have also risen as employers compete with each other for the limited available manpower.",3,350,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00350
2021-04-05-T-012,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Against hits backdrop, the Government’s interventions have provided an important lifeline for those in the construction sector. Extensions of time have been given for performance of obligations, which is vital because liquidated damages may kick in otherwise. The rights to call performance bonds have been limited, and effectively, the legislation has prevented parties from penalising counterparties who cannot perform because of COVID-19.",4,351,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00351
2021-04-05-T-012,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Generally, I think this is a well thought through Bill that tries to carefully share the burden of the losses arising from COVID-19.

2021-04-05-T-012,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"One group that will suffer from delays in construction is the ultimate purchaser. To cushion the blow for these purchasers, there are provisions here permitting them to make claims against the developers for a portion of any additional rental expenses they may incur as a result of having to find alternative accommodation during the period of delay. Is the Minister of State able to share any data on how many purchasers have used this provision and what is the overall financial impact of these payments on developers would be?",7,354,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00354
2021-04-05-T-012,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Second, the aim of the legislation is to share the costs and losses across the value chain. I am interested to know how effectively this is being done in practice?",8,355,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00355
2021-04-05-T-012,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Third, while extensions of time are being given for project completion, payment is the lifeline of the construction sector and work is still expected to continue during this period. Is the Government aware of companies in hardship because they are expected to continue to work but are unable to receive payments in the meantime as a result of this legislation? This will typically apply to the main contractors and others who may be sandwiched. So, what will happen is the subcontractors who are below them, may be able to get extensions of time from delivering against their obligations; which means that the work the contractor higher up has to do to receive his payment, will not be complete. But this contractor higher up the value chain may have to pay other sub-contractors who had done their work.",9,356,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00356
2021-04-05-T-012,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),I am just curious whether any larger contractors or contractors at the middle of the value chain have been facing hardship and may face further hardship as a result of this.,10,357,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00357
2021-04-05-T-012,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"My suggestion to deal with this would be for developers and main contractors in turn to take a more reasonable approach in making payments to contractors lower down the value chain for partial completion of work, even if this means entire milestones may not have been completed as required under the contract. If this is not done voluntarily, then, further legislative intervention may be necessary to address this issue – otherwise, it is the parties in the middle of the value chain that may crack under pressure.

Firstly, I have laid out some of the considerations in my Second Reading speech earlier and want to assure the Member that we recognise that the relief measures are interventions into private contracts.

To clarify to the Member, while the sunset period for Part 3 ends on 19 April 2021, nonetheless, the measures relating to insolvency in Part 3 had already lapsed in October 2020 as the prescribed period was from 20 April 2020 to 19 October 2020. These are exceptional measures that temporarily suspended creditors' rights to provide breathing room for financially distressed debtors to negotiate with creditors and pursue next steps, including for personal bankruptcy, the individual voluntary arrangement and debt repayment scheme; for corporate insolvency, out-of-court work-about schemes of arrangement, judicial management and simplified Insolvency Programme; for sole proprietorships and partnerships, the Sole Proprietor and Partnership scheme.",8,367,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00367

2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"On Mr Ng's suggestion to facilitate the re-hiring of workers who have returned to their home countries and want to come back to Singapore to work, we are very pleased to have them back in Singapore. And employers know who they are and have applied for them to re-enter into Singapore.",17,376,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00376
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"However, the constraint is not this. The constraint now and the challenge we are facing is how to allow these workers to come back, to re-enter Singapore in sufficient numbers to meet the industry's manpower needs, while minimising COVID-19 importation risks, so as to safeguard public health. We are working closely with MOM and MOH on these aspects.",18,377,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00377
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,Mr Vikram Nair rightly pointed out that cashflow is the lifeline of the construction industry. BCA monitors the progress payments in the industry closely and receives frequent feedback from key developers and contractors. This is also why we need to extend the reliefs under the Act so firms do not get engaged in long-drawn litigations at this point in time.,19,378,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00378
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"During the circuit breaker period, most works were suspended and contractors received no progress payments. What we did to facilitate the cashflow was for Government agencies – and some private developers have also followed suit – to provide advance payment to help contractors tide through this challenging period. For public sector projects, we have provided at least $665 million of advance payment in total. The Government has also provided financial support, including waivers and rebates of the foreign worker levy, and subsidies for Rostered Routine Testing, or RRT for short.",20,379,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00379
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,Mr Vikram Nair also asked about co-sharing of additional costs for delays due to COVID-19 under Part 8B and how easy it is for such prolongation costs to be shared.,21,380,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00380
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"To facilitate such claims, BCA and SCAL have jointly developed a claims template and detailed guidelines, which are available on BCA's website.",22,381,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00381
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"In addition, BCA has also been working with SCAL and other Trade Associations and Chambers, to streamline the claims process. This includes introducing an accepted method to estimate the delays to projects due to COVID-19. We will continue to work with the various stakeholders, including SCAL and other Government agencies to expedite the claims process.",23,382,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00382
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Lastly, under Part 8B, contractors can also seek recourse for cost-sharing amounts that are due but not paid, through the existing adjudication mechanism under the Security of Payment Act, or SOPA, which the industry is very familiar with.",24,383,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00383
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Mr Don Wee suggested that we inform the industry and banks on extension of period where developers are prevented from calling on the performance bonds of contractors. Mr Wee may be pleased to know that the provisions for deferment of call of performance bonds is already provided for in the Act. MND and BCA have been in close contact with the industry and we have updated the industry on extension of arrangement under the Act, including through a press release.",25,384,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00384
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,Mr Don Wee also brought up the impact on the construction industry and it has affected home-buyers whose premises under construction have been delayed and who have to make alternative arrangements. And Mr Vikram Nair has also asked about the extent to which these purchasers have been affected.,26,385,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00385
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,The number of purchasers seeking reimbursement after Part 8C comes into operation in a few months will depend on the number of projects delayed and whether developers need and choose to tap on this relief. It is in the interest of developers for projects to be completed in a timely manner without having to tap on the relief.,27,386,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00386
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Currently, based on updates from developers for projects expected to be completed in 2021, most are still on track to meet their respective dates of delivery of possession.",28,387,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00387
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"We have also been encouraging developers who are unable to meet the date of delivery to first discuss with their purchasers and come to a workable and mutually agreeable arrangement, as this may result in a better outcome for both parties.",29,388,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00388
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Let me assure Members that even as we provide relief to developers, we recognise that purchasers face challenges on their end as well, and we have structured Part 8C accordingly.",30,389,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00389
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Under Part 8C, developers who face construction delays due to COVID-19 and require relief may serve a notice for an extension of the delivery date by up to four months, or 122 days, which is aligned with the period in Part 8A.",31,390,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00390
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Mr Don Wee asked why four months, why 122 days. This was also shared during the Second Reading of the COTMA Bill. It is because construction work stopped for approximately two months due to the circuit breaker period, and works were further delayed by at least another two months as all dormitories were only cleared in early August 2020. Therefore, adding two months together, two plus two, that is four months and 122 days.",32,391,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00391
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Should a developer need further relief for the delivery date to be extended by more than 122 days, they can apply for an assessor's determination on the length of construction delay, that is, to a material extent, caused by COVID-19.",33,392,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00392
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Mr Don Wee also asked about whether this relief will be applied to developments where HDB is the developer. I would like to share with Mr Wee that for HDB flats, purchasers can similarly claim up to 70% of the prescribed LD formula, which will be aligned with that of the formula stated in the Housing Developers Rules for private residential properties. This allows for co-sharing of such costs between the developer and purchaser. And if there is any dispute over reimbursement, both parties can seek an assessor's determination.",34,393,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00393
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"To also to reply Mr Don Wee's query regarding the assessors, similar to Part 2, the assessors making the determinations under Part 8C will be professionals with qualifications and working experience in the relevant fields, such as law, accountancy, finance, or building and construction. There will be mechanisms put in place to ensure that assessors declare any conflict of interest upfront.",35,394,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00394
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,Ms Sylvia Lim asked why Part 8C is not in operation yet and why amendments to Part 8C are being made at this juncture.,36,395,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00395
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"There are many urgent Parts to the amendment that we moved in November last year, including Part 8, Part 8A and Part 8B and we have made sure that those Parts are in operation as quickly as we can.",37,396,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00396
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"For Part 8C, we have been in active discussion over the last few months with the industry and partners that will run and operationalise the relief framework. And we are making amendments now as we incorporate their feedback in preparation for the operationalisation. We aim to streamline the process and help it be implemented more smoothly and more efficiently, given that it will be in effect for a longer period of time as compared to other reliefs under the Act.",38,397,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00397
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Ms Lim will be pleased to know that the relief will apply to all affected agreements for the sale and purchase of housing, commercial and industrial property that meet the criteria stated in the Act, regardless of when Part 8C comes into operation. Hence, developers will be able to tap on it after it comes into operation in a few months and purchasers will be able to seek reimbursement then.",39,398,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00398
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Ms Lim also asked how we will address the issue of fairness, given that legal representation will be not be allowed as a default under the assessor framework and she spoke in support of it. As with other Parts of the Act, the assessor mechanism is designed to provide for a quick and effective practical solution to disputes. The overarching role of the assessor is to make a decision that is just and fair in the circumstances and they have the power to ask for the appropriate information and documents from both parties, including information or documents not sought for by either party to achieve this.",40,399,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00399
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,Ms Lim raised the concern that a company may be represented by a legally trained employee.,41,400,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00400
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"In the first instance, we hope to minimise the need for developers and purchases to even require an assessor's determination and we will lay out clearly the qualifying costs that purchasers will be able to seek reimbursement for to make the process more efficient and easy for everyone. The Member will also know that in the ordinary case, if the matter were to go to Court, the company would have a right to legal representation.",42,401,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00401
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Therefore, we have taken the position that for assessments, companies cannot be represented by lawyers. But there is a difference if you say that no one who is legally trained should come before an assessor. What if the individual purchaser himself is legally trained? The point is that the assessment framework weeks to give relief on very simple facts when there would otherwise be no relief. So, simple process, simple facts. In the first instance, we hope to minimise the need for them to come before an assessor to seek determination.",43,402,2021-04-05-T-012-S-00402
2021-04-05-T-012,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Mr Speaker, in conclusion, the amendments before the House today seek to provide continued support to the Built Environment sector to ride out the lingering impact of the pandemic.

2021-04-05-T-013,Sim Ann,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Ms Sim Ann) (on behalf of the Minister for Communications and Information),"Sir, the Postal Services Act, or PSA for short, was enacted in 1999. It was amended in 2007 to provide a legislative framework for the liberalisation of the Postal Services sector. Since then, market and technological changes, especially the rise of e-commerce, have transformed the postal landscape. While we might receive fewer letters now, more of us are shopping online and parcel deliveries have become part of everyday life",2,415,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00415
2021-04-05-T-013,Sim Ann,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Ms Sim Ann) (on behalf of the Minister for Communications and Information),The volume of parcel delivery is expected to intensify given that domestic e-commerce parcel volume growth in Singapore is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 16% from now to 2025. The existing letterbox infrastructure is not designed for parcel delivery. And the current market for locker infrastructure is fragmented and unable to support projected growth. It is thus timely to update the PSA in response to the evolving landscape of last mile delivery amidst increasing digitalisation.,3,416,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00416
2021-04-05-T-013,Sim Ann,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Ms Sim Ann) (on behalf of the Minister for Communications and Information),"Parcels are typically delivered to the doorstep. However, based on industry estimates, about 7% of deliveries are unsuccessful, causing inconvenience to consumers and reducing the productivity of delivery service providers, or DSPs. Self-collection parcel lockers are also currently concentrated in high-traffic commercial areas catering to only 5% of total parcel volume and leaving residential areas under served. These parcel lockers, which are operated by individual DSPs are also not accessible to other operators, resulting in a fragmented market and infrastructure duplication.",4,417,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00417
2021-04-05-T-013,Sim Ann,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Ms Sim Ann) (on behalf of the Minister for Communications and Information),"To enhance DSPs' productivity and efficiency of Singapore's urban logistics sector, my Ministry previously announced that 1,000 parcel lockers will be rolled out in HDB estates, MRT stations, bus interchanges and Community Centres and Clubs by the end of this year.",5,418,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00418
2021-04-05-T-013,Sim Ann,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Ms Sim Ann) (on behalf of the Minister for Communications and Information),"We carefully considered the options available in arriving at the solution. Currently, SingPost is the only public postal licensee, or PPL, and this arrangement has served us well in a time where the postal service was used predominantly for the conveyance of letter mail. The rise of e-commerce and a multitude of players in the logistics sector innovating and seeking to deliver value to consumers have ushered in a different era.",6,419,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00419
2021-04-05-T-013,Sim Ann,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Ms Sim Ann) (on behalf of the Minister for Communications and Information),"The vibrant last mile delivery sector has thrived with open and free competition and should be given room to flourish. It is therefore our priority to facilitate an environment where all players can participate equitably. An open access nationwide parcel locker network, or Network for short, which any DSP and e-commerce marketplace can use will provide greater convenience and options for parcel deliveries while complementing the existing letterbox infrastructure. To best serve the interest of consumers and the industry and to avoid conferring an unfair competitive advantage upon any single player, Pick Network Pte Ltd, or Pick, was set up as a fully owned subsidiary of IMDA to establish, install, operate and maintain the Network as public infrastructure.",7,420,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00420
2021-04-05-T-013,Sim Ann,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Ms Sim Ann) (on behalf of the Minister for Communications and Information),This will ensure the neutrality of the Network and also allow it to be freely accessible to the industry and all consumers.,8,421,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00421
2021-04-05-T-013,Sim Ann,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Ms Sim Ann) (on behalf of the Minister for Communications and Information),"At this point, Sir, I would like to assure the House that it is not our intent for Pick to compete with DSPs. Pick is solely an infrastructure provider and operator and will not be involved in the conveyance of parcels, which is the core business of DSPs. Instead, Pick will give DSPs more options for the last mile delivery of parcels and increase their productivity and efficiency with fewer missed doorstep deliveries. The Network also includes an interoperability platform, which private locker operators can be part of.",9,422,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00422
2021-04-05-T-013,Sim Ann,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Ms Sim Ann) (on behalf of the Minister for Communications and Information),"Further, any DSP is welcome to use Pick's lockers. Pick has been working with all these partners to come on board the Network. This will ensure open and fair access to Pick's lockers, provide an opportunity for individual operators to extend their reach beyond their own parcel lockers and help level the playing field in the parcel last mile delivery market.",10,423,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00423
2021-04-05-T-013,Sim Ann,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Ms Sim Ann) (on behalf of the Minister for Communications and Information),"We are one of the first countries in the world with a nation wide open access locker network.

2021-04-05-T-013,Sim Ann,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Ms Sim Ann) (on behalf of the Minister for Communications and Information),"In addition, while the Network is operated by an IMDA subsidiary, there will be regulatory oversight of the Network and Pick under the Bill. The Bill also takes into consideration feedback from consultations with industry and the public. For example, a key change made was to allow the public to return their items at the Network's lockers at HDB estates and Community Centres and Clubs for greater convenience. This widens options for consumers and saves time and trouble.",12,425,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00425

Second, level the playing field for the parcel last mile delivery market. Third, support the continuity of postal services by ensuring the provision and maintenance of letterbox infrastructure.

2021-04-05-T-013,Sim Ann,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Ms Sim Ann) (on behalf of the Minister for Communications and Information),The new sections 23H to 23K will introduce obligations on owners and developers of buildings or land designated as specified premises to provide suitable space or facilities and access thereto for the installation or maintenance of the Network. Given that space in public areas is already limited. Specified premises includes the public places where the public parcel lockers previously announced by my Ministry will be located.,18,431,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00431
2021-04-05-T-013,Sim Ann,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Ms Sim Ann) (on behalf of the Minister for Communications and Information),"The new sections 23M to 22O allow IMDA to issue codes of practice, written notices and written directions concerning the provision of an access to space for the Network. Non-compliance with any such written notices or written directions without reasonable cause is an offence.",19,432,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00432
2021-04-05-T-013,Sim Ann,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Ms Sim Ann) (on behalf of the Minister for Communications and Information),"Respondents to the public consultation on the draft Bill raised concerns on the safety and security of the Network, citing the possibility of hazardous materials and illicit items being placed into the Network's lockers. To address these concerns, the Bill introduces offences relating to the Network and converse enforcement powers in relation to these offences, which are largely similar to those in place for postal services.",20,433,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00433
2021-04-05-T-013,Sim Ann,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Ms Sim Ann) (on behalf of the Minister for Communications and Information),"For example, IMDA will have the powers to direct the network operator to search the Network's lockers and to detain any suspected harmful items found in them. If any item in the Network's lockers is suspected to pose a threat to public security or public health, the Police and authorised IMDA officers will have the power to search the Network's lockers and seize the item. It will also be an offence for any person to place a prohibited item as specified under the amended PSA in Pick's lockers.",21,434,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00434
2021-04-05-T-013,Sim Ann,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Ms Sim Ann) (on behalf of the Minister for Communications and Information),"Other offences are introduced to protect the Network and ensure the security and integrity of parcels being delivered into the Network. For instance, the new sections 39B and 39E make it an offence to damage or tamper with the Network to intercept or obstruct the delivery or collection of parcels, and to wilfully remove, destroy or damage the Network's lockers or related installations or related software. Under the new section 39H, officers, employees, agents or contractors of the Network operator or a DSP may also be penalised with a fine and/or jail term if they destroy, steal or throw away parcels in Pick's lockers, or wilfully open or cause to be opened parcels or lockers without authorisation.",22,435,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00435

2021-04-05-T-013,Sim Ann,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Ms Sim Ann) (on behalf of the Minister for Communications and Information),"Some industry players have requested access to the letterboxes to deliver e-commerce items which can fit into existing letterboxes. We consider this to be reasonable, as wholesale access to letterboxes for letters is already in place today. Regulating wholesale access for the delivery of non-letter items also complements the introduction of the Network. Under the new section 7A, a PPL can be required via licensing terms and conditions to offer wholesale access to DSPs for the delivery of small packets and parcels which can fit into letterboxes, in addition to its existing provision of wholesale access for the delivery of letters. This will allow other industry players to have access to letterboxes, and provide consumers and the industry with more choices in the receipt and last-mile delivery of parcels. The amended section 24 will enable IMDA to regulate such wholesale access through codes of practice or standards of performance, including rates and charges. This will ensure that charges are fair and that consumers will ultimately benefit.",24,437,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00437

However, it is unclear which party is responsible for replacing letterboxes which are damaged or in need of repair, or providing additional letterboxes when a lot within a building is subdivided. Clause 8 amends section 16 to provide greater clarity on the provision and maintenance of letterboxes by introducing obligations on building managers, referred to as ""applicable persons"" in the Bill, to ensure that there will be no lapses in the delivery of letters due to inadequate letterbox infrastructure.

This is in recognition of the fact that both are business support services with a narrower scope of activity than what licensed Postal Services Operators offer. Mail handling by such services is also not the core business of an organisation and mail volumes are typically low, at around fewer than 50 pieces a day, compared to the three million mail items that SingPost handles daily.

2021-04-05-T-013,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"During the circuit breaker period last year, there was a sharp decline in face-to-face social interactions. As a result, many had resorted to purchasing parcels and gifts online to be couriered to friends and/or extended family as a means of keeping in touch with them. We also witnessed an increase in purchases made through e-commerce platforms, for work-from-home equipment such as monitors, desks, chairs and so on, and also essential items and groceries for household needs and use. If not for the instrumental role that the postmen and last mile delivery personnel played then and continue to play today, we would not have been able to receive our purchases and/or parcels from our friends and loved ones in a timely fashion.",2,449,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00449
2021-04-05-T-013,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"However, as circuit breaker measures were lifted, and people started commuting more, there was a corresponding increase in failed doorstep deliveries. This has practical implications for the logistics services' providers as repeated deliveries have to be made, which is a drain on both time and resources. For recipients of the parcels, they would be inconvenienced if they needed the items urgently.",3,450,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00450
2021-04-05-T-013,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"On my end, I also faced an issue for such deliveries. Just last month, my family had purchased a product from an online seller which cost less than $50. It was for an urgent use and we even paid for a special delivery package by SingPost for the item to be delivered to my home. On the day of expected shipment, even though the parcel was tagged and traced as delivered and I received a notification on the delivery, we eventually did not receive the item from SingPost. We contacted the seller and he said he checked and SingPost said they had delivered. I then had to contact SingPost to inform them that we did not receive the item and that it was for urgent use. The investigation took more than three days and we had to go ahead to make a repurchase due to the urgency. On the fourth day, we were told by SingPost that their postman had mailed the product to the wrong address.",4,451,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00451
2021-04-05-T-013,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"There was little recourse for me, as the seller who had paid SingPost to carry out the delivery was supposed to be the correct party to file a complaint and/or claim with SingPost, even though I had already paid the seller for the product. Legally, I needed to file a claim with the seller who in turn needed to counterclaim with SingPost for the negligent act.",5,452,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00452
2021-04-05-T-013,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),The multiple parties and various payments involved in this transaction made the recovery of that product or any ensuing claims a cumbersome exercise.

2021-04-05-T-013,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Some online companies or platforms do a better job by not releasing funds to the seller until the buyer receives the item. Such is the nature and challenge for e-commerce and online purchases. A serious situation of ""caveat emptor"". Perhaps the postal authority should re-look at such scenarios and establish better mechanisms for dispute resolution or mandate the way transactions are carried out so that buyers are not left with little or time-consuming recourse as many of these items may be of small or lower value purchases.",7,454,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00454

2021-04-05-T-013,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"First, security issues. From a security perspective, how would the Network be implemented? Would the Minister be able to share some of the technological safeguards in place to ensure that the parcel is not tampered with, given that multiple service providers have access to the same parcel box? Perhaps we could consider the installation of additional CCTVs? These are security issues which are less prevalent in the context of traditional letter boxes, where postmen simply slot letters into the letter boxes and only residents who have the keys to their letter boxes can collect the said letters.",11,458,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00458

Next, the Network is presently to be established at HDB estates and/or public areas. While residents living in HDB estates will no doubt stand to benefit from this initiative, are there plans to extend the same to those living in private estates and condominiums?

2021-04-05-T-013,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Third, employment issues arising from the development of the Network. From an employment perspective, while I am confident that the Network will make the jobs of our postmen as well as last mile delivery personnel less strenuous due to failed and repeated deliveries, it will also bring about a fresh set of challenges for our postmen and delivery personnel, such as adapting to technological advancements like enhanced tracking, electronic signatures and so on, and picking up new skill sets to multi-task and multi-skill. I am also particularly concerned about the wages, the welfare and work prospects of these postal and delivery personnel, in particular, the overall attractiveness of this sector which continues to play a crucial role as we navigate the pandemic, thrive in the next normal of a low touch economy and grapple with an ageing population.",16,463,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00463

2021-04-05-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, I can see the need for more parcel lockers to be set up near housing estates. Sometimes, deliveries get delayed because residents are not at home to receive the parcel, or they do not hear the courier at the door. This will require rescheduling to another delivery date. I also remember occasions when I would receive a delivery note in my mailbox to pick up a package from a POPStation, which is a 30-minute round trip by bus and foot from my home, when I had made it a point to be home when the original delivery was made.",1,468,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00468

2021-04-05-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"First, on market competition. While I welcome the creation of the Network, I would like to more clarity on the role of Pick Network Pte Ltd, in the existing ecosystem. Pick is a wholly owned subsidiary of IMDA, a which is a Government Statutory board. SingPost currently has POPStations, and Blu World Pte Ltd has a network of blue lockers. They are part of an existing parcel local network, the Locker Alliance, which has already set up parcel lockers in various locations across Singapore. What was the reason why IMDA did not contract these private sector players to provide more public parcel lockers near housing estates? They already have the experience of running parcel lockers and could take on the investment risk and bear the cost of expanding the network.",4,471,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00471
2021-04-05-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Is Pick's mandate to fulfil a need that is distinct and complementary to the services already provided by the private parcel locker providers, or will it be competing with them? If competition is part of this mandate, will it be contravening the Yellow Pages rule? This rule dictates that Government agencies should exit from market segments, which already have active private sector players.",5,472,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00472
2021-04-05-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"I note that Senior Minister of State said that it is not the Bill's intent for Pick to compete with delivery service partners, but does this non-competition extend to providers of parcel lockers?

2021-04-05-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Was there a public tender for the deployment and operation of a public locker network, which Pick eventually won? How long was the initial contract before? Are there plans for a subsequent tender, in which another public postal licensee or licensees can participate in? Is Pick expected to be profitable in future? If not, how much has IMDA spend and how much will it be budgeting every year to subsidise their operations of Pick?",7,474,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00474
2021-04-05-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Next, I have some questions for the Senior Minister of State about the location and coverage of the network lockers. While residents living in HDB estates will be served by the Network, how will the Network be implemented in condominiums and landed estates if at all? Will parcel lockers be set up in condominiums or in public spaces near condominiums? Given that 16% of resident households live in condominiums, we should strive to ensure coverage of this segment. Another five percent of residents live in landed housing. Will they be served by public parcel lockers?",8,475,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00475
2021-04-05-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Next, I understand that Pick will be in charge of the maintenance of these lockers. Given the COVID-19 situation, Pick should arrange for their own disinfection and cleaning of the high touch surfaces of these lockers regularly. Also, I hope that Pick clearly indicates that customer support contacts on their lockers and makes it convenient for customers to get in touch with them. This is so, that Town Councils or Members of Parliament do not get calls from members of the public to fix malfunctioning lockers.",9,476,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00476

2021-04-05-T-013,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Mr Deputy Speaker, the public parcel locker network should fill in gaps, which the private sector is unable to fill, rather than duplicate their coverage.

Deliveries mostly happen during work hours. So, customers often miss the delivery window, then worry that their packages are not safe. And, with the increasing volume of e-commerce transactions which is projected to reach US$2.9 billion in 2021 according to Statisca, the urban logistics of getting the packages to the intended recipients is going to grow in complexity and, very likely, so in cost and carbon emission. I recall that, back in 2017, when I was still with IBM, the IBM Garage worked with the Singapore start-up, Freshturf, to study the issues from the first-mile to last-mile logistics and to explore technology solutions like blockchain to design the concept of federated locker networks and to create a secure way of making these lockers available to any delivery company wishing to use them. While this prototype never got commercialised, Freshturf co-founder Kevin Lim, did share that they learnt much from the prototyping and went on to develop solutions targeted for specific logistics problems.",1,509,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00509

2021-04-05-T-013,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Ensuring long-term affordability of such a locker service is important because such a service is an effective alternative solution to door-to-door delivery. We have already heard from some of our colleagues about the challenges of waiting at home to receive some of their parcels and their deliveries. At the present moment, door-to-door delivery requires some degree of coordination also between merchants and consumers to ensure that someone is at home. This results in opportunity cost for consumers in terms of time lost as they must remain at home when their time could have been better spent on other activities.",9,539,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00539

Could this lead effectively to the demise of smaller players in the industry and perhaps even affecting door-to-door courier services adversely when demand for such services decline? Would IMDA thus consider working with some of the smaller industry players that might not necessarily run the nationwide network but is still able to contribute to its running in meaningful ways?",10,540,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00540

Some could continue to offer it, but at a much higher cost. Therefore, this may come across as working against the segment of the population that, in fact, stands to benefit most from the convenience of e-commerce. As such, businesses, particularly those offering essential goods and services, should continue to offer door-step delivery as an option and, hopefully, not at an unreasonable premium. Savings on labour costs should be passed on to consumers. Can the Government share how much can logistics service providers expect to save, if they utilise this network?",7,550,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00550

With the success of the trial in December 2018, will there be any changes to the system by which users retrieve their parcels? Are there plans to launch a public awareness campaign as the network progressively expands? How will the Government ensure that seniors and the less tech-savvy have access to assistance? Will there be a helpline in case a resident is unable to retrieve their parcel?",8,551,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00551
2021-04-05-T-013,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my second and last point is about delivery workers. Member Patrick Tay has also spoken on this. Delivery is often cited as a job that is at risk of being automated. It will not come as a surprise that some delivery workers will find themselves displaced. Can the Government share how many delivery jobs will be affected as a result of the locker initiative?",9,552,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00552
2021-04-05-T-013,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Many delivery workers may be doing deliveries to supplement their income because their main job does not pay well enough to support their family. Some are in-between jobs, trying to get by as they find more stable employment. Some are care-givers who appreciate the freedom to accept delivery jobs when they can, as micro-jobs. How can the transition be made smoother for them? Does this new infrastructure project offer them opportunities to upskill and move up to a bigger jobscope within the logistics industry?",10,553,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00553
2021-04-05-T-013,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am glad that the Government is taking the lead with this network of public parcel lockers. When logistics service providers have access to well-planned shared infrastructure with the right processes, they provide a more efficient last mile delivery service for Singapore. But we must always remember those homebound residents, especially seniors, who have difficulty accessing these lockers. We must also remember the challenges faced by delivery workers as a result of this initiative. I support the Bill.",11,554,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00554

2021-04-05-T-013,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"As the e-commerce sector grows and online purchases become more prevalent, there is a need to look into a critical gap in the industry for the provision of parcel lockers. Currently, we have multiple players in a fragmented market, with others intending to join in to provide this particular last mile delivery service. Current parcel locker providers are extremely differentiated and unstandardised. They vary in terms of business, operations and subscription models, customer interface and even locker size. As a result, customers and businesses who use parcel lockers face multiple challenges trying to navigate through the variety of particular last mile delivery services.",2,557,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00557
2021-04-05-T-013,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"With the provision of a nationwide parcel locker network via Pick Network Pte Ltd, we are able to provide standards and guidelines in order to protect customers and businesses. As mentioned by a few Members – Ms Joan Pereira and Ms Ng Ling Ling – there is a need to look into issues of accessibility for seniors and the less abled, as well as physical and cybersecurity requirements, particularly since we anticipate the sector to grow even further in the coming years. In the near future, customers using such services should have ease of access, which is to say, there should be sufficient parcel locker locations, making it convenient for customers to receive and collect their parcels in a safe and timely manner.",3,558,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00558
2021-04-05-T-013,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Currently, the custody of a parcel goes from seller to last mile delivery riders before it ends up with the customer. With the new proposed network, last mile delivery riders may no longer have direct contact with sellers and, instead, deposit parcels into lockers at designated locations. Therefore, from the moment the parcel departs from the seller until it arrives safely in the hands of the customer, it is essential to protect sellers, last mile delivery riders, customers and Pick Network from wrongful claims in the event of damage to the parcel even whilst in transit.",4,559,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00559
2021-04-05-T-013,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"We must especially keep in mind the delivery riders who currently deliver direct to customers. Customers receive the parcels in good condition and this protects the delivery riders from fraudulent claims. However, with the current proposal, delivery riders will deliver to parcel lockers. How can we ensure that the delivery riders are protected when the parcel is damaged between the point of him/her completing the delivery to the parcel lockers and the customers retrieving the parcels?",5,560,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00560
2021-04-05-T-013,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I have met a few delivery riders who are exceptionally cautious when delivering parcels and resort to taking pictures of the recipient receiving their parcels to ensure that he/she is safe from any claims of damages to the parcels as such fraudulent claims may pose a significant financial loss to the delivery riders. Assuming delivery riders earn less than $5 dollars per successful delivery, if a fraudulent claim of a damaged parcel worth $100 is made on him, it will mean he loses his entire income for a day or two. Thus, we must ensure a robust and reliable system of parcel delivery, with proper recourse, should parcels be damaged or lost.",6,561,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00561
2021-04-05-T-013,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Notwithstanding the need for a robust and reliable system to safeguard all the stakeholders involved, through the provision of such lockers, the common practice of delivery staff taking pictures of customers receiving parcels or even taking pictures of customers' homes upon delivery of parcel to avoid being unfairly penalised for parcel damage or as proof of delivery, will no longer be necessary. This would be of great benefit in terms of protecting the customers' privacy, too.",7,562,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00562
2021-04-05-T-013,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Another consideration that we should take note of is that, in the current market, each service provider operates independently, providing their own physical lockers which vary in terms of size and accessibility. They also often service only their own propriety platform, for example, Ninja Van lockers. If two or more competing service providers are at the same location, such as with Ninja Van and Bluport, it may result in under-utilisation of lockers and inefficient use of space. Provision of a nationwide parcel locker network and allowing access to these assets to last mile delivery operators would help promote more effective use of valuable space. This is in line with the current trend of co-sharing assets to promote its efficient utilisation, such as that seen on platforms like AirBnB, Grab and MoBike.",8,563,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00563
2021-04-05-T-013,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Additionally, in locations that experience a high volume of parcel delivery, we can also consider piloting the use of Automated Storage Retrieval Systems (ASRS) that are more volumetrically efficient at storage and has a more efficient physical footprint. With economies of scale, ASRS may also enable the use of technology to capture the condition of parcels at the point of delivery to ensure that there are no wrongful claims and disagreements between buyer, seller, third party last mile delivery providers and Pick Network.",9,564,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00564
2021-04-05-T-013,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Current businesses and customers face a 7% failed delivery rate at doorstep. Access to network of lockers will enable last mile delivery providers to increase their successful delivery rate. Hence, delivery companies can do more for the same amount of resource. There is the potential for less failed delivery and, hence, less wastage on travel times, leading to savings in fuel and operating costs. Consequently, this will also be beneficial for businesses and deliverymen who may only be paid upon successful delivery.",10,565,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00565
2021-04-05-T-013,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Parcel lockers also help improve individual productivity. Customers are better off as they no longer have to remain at home in anticipation of a delivery. We can also consider an accompanying messaging app to inform recipients that their parcel has been safely delivered at the respective collection points so that they can be retrieved. The faster the turnaround time for these lockers, the higher the capacity for the network. With this in mind, will there be a time-bound constraint for the use of these lockers? Will customers be charged accordingly? Are there any other costs incurred by businesses and customers using this facility?",11,566,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00566
2021-04-05-T-013,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Beyond costs, there are other considerations to these parcel lockers. Firstly, who will have access to these parcel lockers? Will it be limited to only some last mile service providers? Will small businesses or homebased businesses that do their own delivery for costs reasons have equal access to these facilities as it can potentially help with their operations and costs? How viable is it for us to extend the use of such facilities to them?",12,567,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00567
2021-04-05-T-013,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Can we also consider extending this service to parcel pick-ups and parcel returns, too?

2021-04-05-T-013,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"A final consideration would be, with the increased use of packaging, which will inevitably increase with the growth in ecommerce, how do we use these platforms to promote our Green Plan recycling effort?

The public parcel locker network is intended to complement commercial parcel locker network in private residential and commercial spaces.

Because if it is not affordable, there is no way to make a good business case ultimately to the consumers and we might still default to doorstep delivery, and that is what we are trying to change here. Pick is very conscious of the importance of making the numbers work and to offer a vey attractive business case so that the DSPs will find it worth their while to use these parcel lockers.",8,605,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00605

Ninety-six percent of residents indicated that they would use Pick's lockers due to reasons such as the convenience of 24/7 self-collection and the confidence of being able to access their deliveries safely rather than having their parcels being left at their doorstep unattended. With this kind of response from residents, we feel that we are on the right track.",10,607,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00607

2021-04-05-T-013,Sim Ann,Ms Sim Ann,"On Mr Patrick Tay's suggestion about providing greater recourse for e-commerce bias in the event of failed doorstep deliveries or missed deliveries, the current industry practice is for the e-commerce retailer to ensure the proper delivery of the item to the consumer through its shipping contract with a DSP. In this regard, Enterprise Singapore and the Singapore Standards Council have launched the Technical Reference 76 (TR 76), which outlines e-commerce retailers' responsibility among others on the handling of lost or damaged items during delivery to protect consumers' interests. My Ministry and IMDA are cautious about introducing a formal regulatory framework for parcel delivery services at this point as we do not wish to raise compliance costs unnecessarily, which could also translate into an increase in prices faced by consumers.",19,616,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00616

For example, we will add a segment on how to use Pick in IMDA's Seniors Go Digital programme. At the same time, we will widen the reach of the Seniors Go Digital programme which has trained over 69,000 seniors in digital skills to date to give even more seniors the confidence to embrace e-commerce.

Let me share that Pick and the National Library board are exploring the possibility of allowing residents to borrow and return library books through Pick's lockers. Ms Ng Ling Ling, Mr Don Wee and Mr Gerald Giam had also made similar suggestions on temperature-controlled locker units to facilitate delivery of medication, groceries and other kinds of temperature-sensitive goods. These are useful suggestions, especially during this COVID-19 pandemic when doorstep delivery for supermarket purchases and medicine becomes a practical option for many households.",25,622,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00622

Mr Gerald Giam and Mr Darryl David have spoken about Pick's role in the urban logistics eco-system. Against the backdrop of a flourishing last mile delivery sector, the current private sector driven market for parcel lockers is largely fragmented with competing players deploying their proprietary networks, which are accessible only by selected DSPs. This has given rise to deep inefficiencies for locker operators. The lockers are duplicated at high-traffic commercial locations, and e-commerce marketplaces and DSPs are unable to access all lockers which may be available.",31,628,2021-04-05-T-013-S-00628

However, these gains can be realised only if two key factors are met. First, the Network will need to be deployed expeditiously so that scale and network effects can be realised. Second, the Network should be deployed by a neutral operator to ensure open and non-discriminatory access for the industry.

Let me clarify that our intention is not to put Pick in a favoured position. Pick's exclusive privileges are confined to the provision of parcel lockers at specified premises only. In this regard, the Network, which would be available for use by all e-commerce marketplaces and DSPs will serve to complement, but not compete with existing locker offerings from the industry, which are accessible only by selected operators.

2021-04-05-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As part of its mandate to ensure the stability of the international monetary system, the IMF provides financial assistance to countries experiencing balance of payments difficulties. To carry out its functions, the IMF relies on resources provided by member countries. Singapore has been contributing to these efforts.",2,664,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00664
2021-04-05-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, the IMF has seen a surge in requests for financial assistance, especially from low-income countries. IMF has, therefore, called on its members to help bolster its financial resources to assist the most vulnerable members in recovering from the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.",3,665,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00665
2021-04-05-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The amendments to the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, approved by Parliament on 11 July 2016, enables MAS to make grants to the IMF as part of international efforts to assist low-income countries. This is subject to three conditions, as specified under the Act. First, such financial assistance is part of a collective action amongst IMF member countries; second, MAS publicly discloses key information about the financial assistance; and third, Parliament fixes, by resolution, the maximum amount of the grants.",4,666,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00666
2021-04-05-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,I will now explain the context and considerations for the three grants.,5,667,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00667
2021-04-05-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"First, Singapore's grant to the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust, or CCRT.",6,668,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00668
2021-04-05-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,The CCRT was established in 2015 to provide debt relief to the IMF's poorest and most vulnerable members in the event of a natural catastrophe or global health pandemic. The relief on debt service will free up scarce financial resources to continue strengthening the eligible countries' medical care capacities and address the social and economic fallout from the pandemic.,7,669,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00669
2021-04-05-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The CCRT is in urgent need of replenishment. Its pre-COVID balance was US$200 million. Since the onset of the pandemic, the IMF has disbursed over US$500 million in debt relief to CCRT-eligible members. So, the pre-COVID balance has been completely depleted. The disbursements were made possible through the additional contributions by other member countries, which has amounted to US$800 million so far.",8,670,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00670
2021-04-05-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The IMF has requested for Singapore to contribute US$17.6 million, or SDR 12.3 million, to the CCRT. This represents about 1.2% of the total amount of US$1.4 billion or SDR 1 billion, needed to replenish the CCRT. Singapore's contribution is based on our quota share at the IMF and similar to how other countries' contributions are determined.",9,671,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00671
2021-04-05-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Second, the COVID-19 Crisis Capacity Development Initiative, or CCCDI.  Singapore's grant to the newly launched CCCDI will help to meet the urgent capacity development needs of countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.",10,672,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00672
2021-04-05-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The objective of the CCCDI is to help these countries develop effective policies to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic and support economic recovery. This comes in the form of technical advice, practical tools and policy-oriented training to build skills to manage the crisis.",11,673,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00673
2021-04-05-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"IMF has reached out to member countries, including Singapore, to seek funding support for the CCCDI, and suggested that Singapore make a contribution of between US$2 million to US$4 million. MAS proposes that Singapore contribute a one-off grant amount of US$2 million, or SDR 1.4 million, to the CCCDI. It represents 2% of the total amount of US$100 million needed to support the CCCDI.",12,674,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00674
2021-04-05-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Third, contribution to the trust for Special Poverty Reduction and Growth Operations for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries for Somalia's debt relief, or PRG-HIPC Trust.",13,675,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00675
2021-04-05-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The Trust will provide support for the debt relief of Somalia, which is in urgent need of assistance. The majority of IMF member countries, including the ASEAN-4 countries, namely, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand, have already committed to contributing to Somalia's debt relief package.",14,676,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00676
2021-04-05-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,The IMF has requested Singapore to contribute US$0.97 million (or SDR 0.68 million). Singapore already holds funds in the other IMF accounts to cover overdue payments incurred by members which are unable to pay and the contribution will be drawn from these accounts. Singapore's contribution would form approximately 0.3% of the IMF's financing package of US$344 million (or SDR 242 million) for Somalia's debt relief.,15,677,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00677
2021-04-05-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Why are we making these contributions to the causes of the IMF? In short, we live in an interdependent world and Singapore needs to do its part.",16,678,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00678
2021-04-05-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Particularly, the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for decisive and urgent collective actions to manage global crises. As a highly open economy, Singapore has a strong stake in ensuring that the world contain the pandemic, restore people-to-people connections across the world and support global economic recovery. By contributing to the three funds I have mentioned above, we can play our part as a stakeholder of the international community.",17,679,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00679
2021-04-05-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The grants to the CCRT and the CCCDI will reduce the size of Singapore's Official Foreign Reserves by a total of US$19.6 million (or SDR 13.7 million). As explained earlier, the grant to the PRG-HIPC Trust will not affect the size of Singapore's Official Foreign Reserves. The proposed grant amounts are also reasonable and commensurate with Singapore's position and role in the global economy.",18,680,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00680
2021-04-05-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, MAS has issued a press release on 31 March 2021 to inform the public of the grants and that it would seek Parliament's approval. Following Parliament's resolution to fix the maximum amount of grants that MAS can allocate to the IMF's CCRT, CCCDI and PRG-HIPC Trust, MAS will publish in the Gazette key information about the grants. Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move.",19,681,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00681

2021-04-05-T-014,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Mr Deputy Speaker, the three Motions to contribute to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust, Crisis Capacity Development and Trust for Special Poverty Reduction and Growth for HIPC initiatives are an important step towards contributing to the commons as responsible citizens in our global village. But I will go further  as a country that has historically hung its hat and been a major beneficiary from globalisation, I would argue that doing so goes beyond responsibility, and is instead a duty and an obligation on our part. If anything, we are not doing enough and I wish to explain why we should do more.",1,684,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00684
2021-04-05-T-014,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"I should, of course, state at the outset that I have previously worked for seven years in the trenches as an economist in a Bretton Woods Institution and I maintain a small balance in my self-funded group retirement account and the staff account at the credit union. However, I do not receive nor maintain any direct financial interests in the Bank nor the Fund.",2,685,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00685
2021-04-05-T-014,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"As Members of this House are undoubtedly aware, despite our globalised footprint, Singapore has no formal foreign or development aid agency, and we do not, as a rule, channel any share of our Budget towards official development assistance. Nor do we have any concerted strategy for increasing our representation at international organisations, such as the United Nations (UN).",3,686,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00686
2021-04-05-T-014,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"For instance, we send a total of 64 staff to the UN system, 0.1% of the total or 0.001% of our population. Compare this to the 506 staff sent by Sweden, a country about twice our size, or the 559 sent by Denmark with a population comparable to ours.",4,687,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00687
2021-04-05-T-014,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Most of our citizens are narrowly affiliated with just two institutions – the IMF and the World Bank. Apocryphally, this position was motivated by our founding father, former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who was reluctant to risk the brain drain that could result when our talents went abroad to work at these international institutions.",5,688,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00688
2021-04-05-T-014,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Our legacy of ambivalence extends to our pocketbook. Remarkably, the official reason for our unwillingness to extend official aid is because, and I quote, ""Singapore is a developing country and does not provide official development assistance. We undertake South-South capacity building programmes with other developing countries."" The multiple rounds of assistance offered under the aegis of the Singapore Cooperation Programme has, undeniably, been welcomed by other nations in need, but it is befuddling that we would remain unwilling to extend financial resources to other countries, beyond merely technical assistance.",6,689,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00689
2021-04-05-T-014,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"To be fair, Singapore has also largely eschewed the receipt of foreign aid. But even so, historical development assistance inflows have come to a non-trivial amount. Statistics provided by the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD reports that between 1960 and 2004, Singapore received a total of US$14.4 million every year on average. This amount, while uncorrected for inflation, nevertheless represents a net receipt of funds from the international community over the course of our modern history.",7,690,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00690
2021-04-05-T-014,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"What is more, Singapore may yet be set to receive an additional US$5.33 billion, or S$7.17 billion, worth in new SDR allocations, were a new proposal by IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva be accepted by the IMF Executive Board. This amount actually far exceeds the comparatively small amounts that we are formally extending to the Fund today.",8,691,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00691
2021-04-05-T-014,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"To be fair, foreign aid has a mixed record and there is no clear evidence that foreign aid can reliably raise economic growth. Often, the reason is because of politics  donor countries tie aid to specific requirements, which may not be the most beneficial use for the recipient country. Or the governments which receive such foreign aid become more responsive to their foreign benefactors, as opposed to their own people.",9,692,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00692
2021-04-05-T-014,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"But by the same token, aid can be effective when it is conditional, albeit not by making it contingent on certain uses specified by the donor, but by extending support to countries that we observe exercise good policy. Aid can also be channelled to responsible multilateral organisations with a good track record of ensuring that the funds they receive are properly utilised.",10,693,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00693
2021-04-05-T-014,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"And if we are still reticent to provide aid because it would be managed by external parties, we can always direct the funds towards the formation of an international volunteer corps tasked to provide social and economic development assistance to other countries, especially those in ASEAN.",11,694,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00694
2021-04-05-T-014,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"So, the key, as in all good investments, is to carefully direct our foreign aid dollars towards initiatives that take into account returns but adjusted for risk. Indeed, countries, such as Luxembourg and the United Kingdom, demonstrate that it is possible to be simultaneously generous, as well as principled, in one's foreign aid practices.",12,695,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00695
2021-04-05-T-014,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Let me be absolutely clear  charity begins at home. We must take care of our own needs first and we should prioritise these needs. In crisis times, this is even more pertinent, as many Singaporeans are facing hard times and it is difficult to convince them that we should be looking out for the well-being of those in other nations. And indeed, this impression is not unique. When citizens from countries around the world are asked how much they think their country contributes, they systematically over-estimate this amount, compared to actual disbursements.",13,696,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00696
2021-04-05-T-014,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"So, we are certainly not unique in wanting to look out for ourselves first, and all the more during crisis times. But generosity has its own reward and I believe that we are more than capable of doing both. We should not think that just because we are in crisis mode, we neglect planning for the future. And that future must, surely, entail thinking about the performance of economies besides our own.",14,697,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00697
2021-04-05-T-014,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Because even from a purely self-interested perspective, uplifting our neighbouring economies can pay dividends in the long run. After all, what we export shows up as another country's imports. When the economies in our region grow richer and faster, they will increase the demand for all goods, including exports from us. And when their incomes are elevated, their consumers are better able to afford our goods and services, which skew towards those of higher value.",15,698,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00698
2021-04-05-T-014,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Generosity can also increase our soft power, our ability to influence the global agenda in ways that go well beyond our small size. Smaller nations understand this dynamic. The Netherlands, Switzerland, Qatar and the UAE know that they are able to punch above their weight because they have invested in multilateral organisations and in the international system. And if we establish a formal international volunteer corps, the experience gained by our returning volunteers will also contribute toward our goal of promoting greater sensitivity toward regional integration efforts.",16,699,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00699
2021-04-05-T-014,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Given how citizens' perceptions are that donor governments give more than they actually do, it seems like a short logical step to infer that what they generally want is less, not more foreign aid. But this inference would be misleading.",17,700,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00700
2021-04-05-T-014,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Somewhat surprisingly, the same study I referenced earlier also asked respondents how much aid they would like to see their countries giving. And these desired amounts actually fall short of how much donor-country citizens think is given and far short of how much they actually give.",18,701,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00701
2021-04-05-T-014,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"The reason, I think, is because we are fundamentally social creatures, and some degree of reciprocity and altruism is baked into our moral fibre. We are often willing to help those less well-off than we are, so long as we can afford it and so long as we are assured that the money is well-spent. But if we accept this premise, then I would submit that a more concerted effort to increase our official development assistance is essentially a problem to be resolved, rather than an insurmountable obstacle.",19,702,2021-04-05-T-014-S-00702

COVID-19 respect no borders or jurisdictions and all countries, big or small, strong or vulnerable, do get impacted in one way or another and we are in this together. In particular, countries in a better position should do our part to help those that face difficulties during the crisis, including the economic fall-out from the pandemic.

Just has been the case domestically, COVID-19 is disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable countries internationally. The impact on health, education, food security, and livelihoods is staggering. And these are cascading outcomes. Millions of children are at risk as routine vaccination programmes have had to be deprioritized and more children are also dropping out of school, especially girls.

2021-04-05-T-014,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"Secondly, we can encourage more of our people and our businesses to learn expertise and participate in the development and implementation of assistance programmes on the ground, particularly for lower-income countries in the region. This will help our people understand the region better and support our regionalisation and internationalisation efforts, bring us back to where I started, that the world is interconnected.

2021-04-05-T-016,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Let me try to answer some of the questions raised, starting with Mr Liang Eng Hwa who asked the reason for doing this. I think the simplest reason is we are helping the most vulnerable countries in the world. We are talking about countries like Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Nepal, Tanzania, Yemen, where the pandemic has really ravaged lives and livelihoods. And so, something like the CCRT will help, through debt relief, free up much-needed resources to tackle the medical, social, economic problems that they are facing.",2,728,2021-04-05-T-016-S-00728
2021-04-05-T-016,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"If we take a step back, the reason is really that we live in an interconnected world. And so, it is in Singapore's interest to be part of this international community where we work together, where we cooperate, where there are rules, there are norms, there are best practices that hold every country into account to ensure that we live peacefully together in a global village.",3,729,2021-04-05-T-016-S-00729
2021-04-05-T-016,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"So, in such a system there will be benefits, there will be obligations. And on balance for a small city-state like us, the benefits far outweigh the obligations and the costs. In fact, it is existential for us to live in such a global international cooperation system. That is why we want to do this.",4,730,2021-04-05-T-016-S-00730
2021-04-05-T-016,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Is there visibility? Yes, all the funds are subject to the oversight of the IMF Executive Board.

And in fact, I think what he has just described, is 50 over years of foreign policy and one of our key tenets – which is we want our neighbours to all do well, we want our region to do well. That way, there is global cooperation that a small country like us, can also do well.",6,732,2021-04-05-T-016-S-00732
2021-04-05-T-016,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Which is why for so many years, we contribute on various international fora, whatever we can do within our means as a small country. Today, we talked about IMF, but for many years, MFA had the Singapore Cooperation Programme. We do not contribute money per se, but we run so many training programmes and invite government officials, representatives of NGOs and other organisations to come to Singapore. We provide necessary training, they take reference on what we do, we learn from each other. And I think it started in 1992.

2021-04-05-T-016,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Our contribution is always commensurate with our size. It is not big. But I think it is important for us to contribute and it is beyond money. Often, it is about our know how. We learn by doing, and whatever we have learned, we share with the world. And sometimes, those are the lessons that are priceless. Likewise, we learn those lessons from others and those are priceless.",9,735,2021-04-05-T-016-S-00735
2021-04-05-T-016,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Assoc Prof Jamus Lim did say we should increase our monetary contribution. In the IMF, it goes by your voting rights and your quota. There is a formula. We go by that formula. But, of course, if you contribute more, the fiscal burden is higher and it has to be funded by tax collections as well. For us, as a small country, our stance is better not to go around to say that we have all these resources, we can give out more money. But instead, we are always struggling for relevance, always fighting to earn a living. And along the way, we learn many lessons and we can share those lessons with the rest of the world. I think this is a better way for Singapore to contribute to the common good and the larger global society.",10,736,2021-04-05-T-016-S-00736
2021-04-05-T-016,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Ms Mariam Jafaar gave a couple of good suggestions on raising awareness and educating the broader public including businesses on the work that we do internationally and how much Singapore can help. I think these are very good suggestions. When MAS put out our press release on these IMF contributions, it was a little bit disappointing because if you look through the threads, there were quite a few criticisms saying, ""Why is Singapore giving out money to other countries?""",11,737,2021-04-05-T-016-S-00737

So, I am quite glad that today, all the Members that stood up and spoke about this, supported this contribution to the IMF grants. It shows that as a small country, we can also be big-hearted, that we can also play our role. I think we also share our concern for the future of humanity and we will do our part.

2021-04-05-T-020,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The Government has been studying the implications of a low-carbon transition on our economy for some time.

The funding recognises the companies’ efforts in staff development. The Jobs Growth Incentive, which was introduced last year and extended at Budget 2021, provides further encouragement to employers during this time of greater uncertainty in the labour market.",3,760,2021-04-05-T-021-S-00760

The DEO aims to restrict the perpetrators from entering the shared residence, or parts of the shared residence. Some perpetrators also choose to leave the residence to temporarily stay with other family members or friends. This allows them the space and time to seek help to manage their emotions and tendencies, with the motivation of keeping their loved ones safe and their family intact.

The National Family Violence Networking System was established in 1996 to connect the Police, Courts, hospitals, social service agencies, and MSF in a tight network to provide support to families facing FV. The Taskforce on Family Violence, which I co-chair with MOS Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, has also done a recent stock-take of the landscape and possible causes of FV, so that we can intervene more effectively.

The risks posed by each type are different and so are our regulatory approaches.",2,858,2021-04-05-T-036-S-00858
2021-04-05-T-036,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile, as their value is typically not related to any economic fundamentals.

2021-04-05-T-036,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"As for securities tokens, they are subject to the same securities laws as traditional securities. Hence, an exchange that enables trading in securities tokens is regulated under the Securities and Futures Act and subject to the same rules, especially on fair, orderly and transparent trading, as any securities exchange. The size of the securities tokens market today is also small. Of more than 60 Recognised Market Operators currently regulated by MAS under the SFA, only three offer the trading of securities tokens, and with very small trading volumes.

The IHLs regularly review their counselling provisions, taking into consideration the demand for counselling support.

2021-04-05-T-044,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"All land reclamation projects are required to undergo environmental studies to assess the possible environmental impact, such as on water quality and marine ecology. The process includes an in-depth consultation with Technical Agencies such as NParks, NEA, MPA and SFA. The environmental studies guide the planning of the reclamation, including measures to mitigate the impact on the environment, where necessary. The environmental study reports are made publicly available, unless there are overriding security considerations that require us to maintain confidentiality.",1,908,2021-04-05-T-044-S-00908

This means building a consensus that has taken into account the views of workers and employers, as well as desirable social norms. Instead of legislation alone, we also rely on tripartite guidelines, standards and advisories to shape progressive workplace cultures. Where undesirable practices emerge, we will assess their extent and severity, and seek tripartite consensus on appropriate interventions. To address concerns about workplace harassment, tripartite partners have adopted several measures.",1,911,2021-04-05-T-045-S-00911
2021-04-05-T-045,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In 2015, we issued a Tripartite Advisory on Managing Workplace Harassment (Advisory).

Employers are advised that TAFEP will report to MOM egregious offenders who fail to provide a safe environment or refuse to improve their grievance handling process, which will trigger a review of the firm’s work pass privileges. Thus far, all employers engaged by TAFEP on workplace harassment matters have been cooperative and receptive. Their follow-up actions include rectifying lapses, taking preventive measures and bringing their practices in line with the Advisory.

As part of its education and outreach efforts, NParks also partners Town Councils, MSO, PA, and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) to engage feeders. This enables NParks to find out their motivations, address misconceptions, and discourage them from continuing to feed birds. In January 2021, NParks also launched the island-wide ""Say No to Feeding Wildlife"" campaign to raise awareness on the negative impact of feeding wildlife, including birds.",3,928,2021-04-05-T-047-S-00928

This includes measures such as camera surveillance at identified feeding hotspots, and carrying out targeted enforcement operations. Under the Wildlife Act, which came into force on 1 June 2020, NParks has also strengthened its regulatory regime by imposing stiffer penalties for the illegal feeding of wildlife. Offenders can be fined up to $5,000 for the feeding of any wild animal, including pest bird species, up from $500 for feeding pigeons before the Wildlife Act came into force.",4,929,2021-04-05-T-047-S-00929

Nonetheless, feedback we have received through consultations with the tripartite partners suggests that we need to be cautious about the potential impact of enhancing leave schemes. Employers have expressed concerns that more mandatory leave provisions will affect business costs and operations, and reduce the employability of those workers who are more likely to use these leave provisions.

Over the years, through the use of innovative technical solutions, HDB has provided LUP for the vast majority of these blocks.

It educates employers on their responsibilities of care towards their MDWs, as well as how to manage their relationships with them. The Settling-in-Programme (SIP) for first-time MDWs in Singapore was also launched in 2012. It educates MDWs on their conditions of employment, how to work safely, relationship and stress management.

We regularly reach out to employers, NGOs representing MDWs, and employment agencies to seek feedback on ground issues. In 2018, for example, employers and Employment Agencies highlighted miscommunications between MDWs and their employers as one of the reasons for early termination of contracts. This led MOM to work with the Centre for Domestic Employees (CDE) and the Foreign Domestic Worker Association for Social Support and Training (FAST) to provide free dispute resolution services to help employers and MDWs resolve their disputes amicably, thus promoting contract completion.",2,1036,2021-04-05-T-069-S-01036

2021-04-05-T-070,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,The home-based six-monthly medical examination (6ME) service was introduced in 2018 to give employers the option of having their migrant domestic workers (MDW) complete their 6ME without leaving the house. This is more convenient for households with caregiving needs. A healthcare personnel from an approved service provider will visit the employer’s home to collect the MDW’s blood sample. The test results are then certified by a Singapore-registered doctor appointed by the service provider.,1,1039,2021-04-05-T-070-S-01039

I know the Member feels strongly about making child seats compulsory in taxis, and if this rule can be implemented without significant costs and inconvenience to passengers and taxi drivers, LTA would certainly have done it.

Generally, travellers and returning Singaporeans from higher-risk countries and regions are subject to more stringent measures, including a 14-day Stay-Home-Notice (SHN) at dedicated SHN facilities, with a COVID-19 test administered on arrival and before their exit from SHN. These measures allow us to minimise the risk of the virus spreading to the community from imported cases.",1,1206,2021-04-05-T-102-S-01206

As these countries have lower incidences of COVID-19 and measures in place to detect and keep community spread at bay, travellers returning from these regions are assessed to have lower risks of spreading COVID-19 to Singapore.",2,1207,2021-04-05-T-102-S-01207
2021-04-05-T-102,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Singapore's border measures are not static and will evolve as the global situation changes. If the situation in a country or region deteriorates, more stringent measures will be put in place to limit the risks of importation and community transmission from imported cases. Similarly, if the situation in a country/region improves, we will consider relaxing our border health measures to facilitate travel.

After MediShield Life claims and MediSave coverage, the patient's out-of-pocket payment would be significantly lower.

2021-04-05-T-121,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Employers of Work Permit and S Pass holders are responsible for the medical expenses of their workers to ensure that such costs are not ultimately borne by taxpayers. For this reason, they are required to purchase insurance coverage of at least $15,000 per year. This covers about 95% of hospital bills incurred by such workers.",1,1292,2021-04-05-T-121-S-01292
2021-04-05-T-121,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"To have further protection against larger medical bills, employers may pay additional premiums for higher insurance coverage. Those who do not would have to bear these additional expenses out-of-pocket. In extenuating circumstances, MOM has stepped in to help and the worker is not denied appropriate treatment despite their employers' inability to meet their obligations. In the last three years, an average of 25 employers and their workers annually were supported, and most of the workers were domestic workers employed by Singaporean households. The average bill size of these workers was $45,000 and the amount supported was about $29,000 per worker.",2,1293,2021-04-05-T-121-S-01293

2021-04-05-T-122,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Indonesia informed employment agencies (EAs) in Singapore of its intent to implement a ""zero placement fee"" policy in 2020. This meant that the placement fee payable to the EAs in Indonesia would be borne by the employers instead of the Indonesian migrant domestic workers (MDWs). The ""zero placement fee"" policy has not taken effect in Indonesia yet. Indonesia is not the first country to propose a ""zero placement fee"" policy. The Philippines government introduced a similar policy since 2006. While employers of Filipino MDWs typically pay higher EA service fees than those who hire MDWs of other nationalities, there is still a sizeable demand for Filipino MDWs today.",1,1296,2021-04-05-T-122-S-01296
2021-04-05-T-122,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"When the Indonesian ""zero placement fee"" policy kicks in, some EAs here may charge higher service fees to employers hiring Indonesian MDWs. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will ensure that employers have full information of the cost implications before making their hiring decisions. EAs are already required to provide a clear breakdown of the fees charged to the employers.",2,1297,2021-04-05-T-122-S-01297
2021-04-05-T-122,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"We also have in place a good mix of approved source countries for MDWs. Indonesia, Philippines, Myanmar and India are the source countries which are more popular with employers here. Expanding the list of approved source countries is only useful if there is employer demand. For example, employers have been able to bring in MDWs from Cambodia since 2016, but interest has been relatively low.",3,1298,2021-04-05-T-122-S-01298
2021-04-05-T-122,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In any case, it will be unwise to rely only on dedicated-MDWs to meet our housekeeping and caregiving needs.

2021-04-05-T-123,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"This requirement does not apply to companies processing combustible dust on a smaller scale. Combustible dust takes many forms, including food products such as flour, sugar, and corn starch. Imposing this requirement on all companies would mean that many SMEs, including heartland bakeries, cannot be sited in residential areas. Given the remote risk of small-scale dust explosions affecting adjacent buildings, it would also be impractical to require all such companies to move away from residential estates.",2,1302,2021-04-05-T-123-S-01302

The vast majority of DP holders do not work during their stay in Singapore. Those who do are employed across a range of sectors, including Education, Information & Communications and Professional Services. MOM does not collect data on whether DP LOC holders are working full-time or part-time. Their salary information is also indicative at the point of application and generally aligned with those of the foreign workforce here. We do not publish the breakdown of our foreign workforce by nationality, including for DP LOC holders, as it is not in Singapore's best interest to do so.",1,1306,2021-04-05-T-124-S-01306
2021-04-05-T-124,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"From 1 May 2021, MOM will be aligning the requirements for DP holders who wish to work in Singapore with the requirements for all other foreigners working in Singapore. All DP holders who wish to work during their stay in Singapore will need to apply for a relevant work pass, such as an Employment Pass, S Pass or Work Permit. The impact to the overall workforce is likely to be minimal as the majority of existing DP LOC holders will be able to qualify for a mainstream work pass. As for the impact at the firm level, it will depend on LOC employers' willingness to accommodate them through adjustments to their HR arrangements. This change does not affect foreign spouses and children of Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents holding a Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) or LTVP-Plus (LTVP+) issued by ICA.

2021-04-05-T-128,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The CEPCC requires RESs to protect and promote the interests of their clients. RESs must therefore be fully conversant and comply with the relevant laws, regulations and codes that apply to property transactions, and must not do anything which may directly or indirectly lead their clients to infringe them. When advising their clients on their property purchases, RESs must give accurate and unbiased advice which takes into account their clients’ interests, including relevant factors such as affordability.",2,1328,2021-04-05-T-128-S-01328

This includes ensuring compliance with the Singapore Civil Defence Force's (SCDF) fire safety requirements. Town Councils and MCSTs should hence conduct regular checks and respond promptly to feedback on excessive clutter in common areas. SCDF can issue Fire Hazard Abatement Notices to require Town Councils or MCSTs to rectify any fire hazards identified during its inspections. If the fire safety risk is serious, SCDF can issue a notice of composition to the Town Council or MCST.",1,1332,2021-04-05-T-129-S-01332

For Town Councils, this includes by-laws that prohibit the excessive placement of objects that may cause obstruction at common areas. MCSTs are also required to adopt a set of prescribed by-laws, including one that prohibits residents from obstructing the use of the common property. The Town Councils and MCSTs work closely with SCDF to regulate and rectify obstructions that may cause a fire hazard. Residents who flout the Town Councils' by-laws are liable for a fine of up to $5,000.

This is regardless of whether they subsequently profit from the ownership of the flat.

2021-04-05-T-132,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"MND agrees with the importance of building local capability in the facilities management (FM) sector. Our tender requirements for the Tampines Integrated Municipal Operations Pilot emphasise upskilling, cross-training and smarter deployment of FM workers, regardless whether the Tenderers are local or foreign companies.
