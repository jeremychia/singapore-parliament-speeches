2021-05-11-T-001,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the progress of Sinovac vaccine approval; (b) whether Singapore is still considering to continue qualifying other vaccines that are claimed to be linked to blood clots; and (c) what is the likelihood for a need for another dose of vaccine in a year’s time.,1,1,2021-05-11-T-001-S-00001
2021-05-11-T-001,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,asked the Minister for Health whether the Government is in discussions with Pfizer and Moderna for the need for a potential COVID-19 booster shot to be administered.,1,2,2021-05-11-T-001-S-00002
2021-05-11-T-001,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 1 and 2 in my Ministerial Statement later today?",1,3,2021-05-11-T-001-S-00003

2021-05-11-T-002,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San,"asked the Minister for Transport in enhancing road safety, what other measures can the Ministry consider besides licensing cyclists.",1,5,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00005
2021-05-11-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Minister for Transport given that cyclists are more vulnerable on the roads, how can it be ensured that (i) cyclists are protected against inconsiderate and reckless drivers and (ii) the rights of both cyclists and motor vehicle drivers are deconflicted.",1,6,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00006
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Transport),"Speaker, may I have your permission to answer Question Nos 3 and 4 together?",1,7,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00007
2021-05-11-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,8,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00008
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Thank you, Sir. Sir, more people have taken up cycling since the pandemic started. This is a good development, as cycling is a convenient, environmentally friendly and healthy way to travel. The key is to ensure safety – safety for different groups of road users.",1,9,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00009
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Where possible, we will separate bicycles from motor vehicles by providing cycling paths. We are building more cycling paths, within and between towns, from about 460 kilometres today to more than 1,300 kilometres by 2030.",2,10,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00010
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"However, it is not always possible to have separate paths for motor vehicles and bicycles. There will be many instances and locations where motorists and cyclists have to share the same road space. To enhance road safety, it is important to have clear rules for motorists and cyclists, and for everyone to follow these safety rules.",3,11,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00011
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"For on-road cyclists, there are existing rules under the Road Traffic Act which they must follow. For example, cyclists must comply with all traffic rules, such as adhering to traffic light signals and avoiding the use of expressways and tunnels. They should also ride as near as possible to the far-left edge of the road. This means they should keep to the left on the leftmost lane unless they are turning right or making a U-turn. On single-lane roads, cyclists are required to ride in a single file, so they do not obstruct passing vehicles.",4,12,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00012
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"The majority of cyclists follow the safety rules. But there is a minority of errant cyclists who use their mobile phones while riding, refuse to stop at red lights, ride in the middle lane of a major road, including expressways where bicycles are prohibited, and some of them react aggressively when they are called out for their actions. We will enforce against such behaviours. Errant cyclists can face up to a $1,000 fine and a six-month jail term for the first offence, with higher penalties for repeat offenders.",5,13,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00013
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"There are also motorists who drive recklessly and endanger the lives of others, including cyclists, and we will take enforcement actions against them too. We should bear in mind that cyclists are more vulnerable than those travelling in motor vehicles. The Active Mobility Advisory Panel (AMAP) will review ways to raise awareness amongst motorists on how to share road space safely with cyclists and other users.",6,14,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00014
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Ultimately, there needs to be more graciousness, consideration, as well as give and take on the roads. Other countries have done it and I believe so can we. Beyond enforcement, the more enduring solution is public education. In his written Parliamentary Question, Mr Dennis Tan asked if we have a public education campaign on safe practices for cyclists and pedestrians. Since 2018, LTA has offered the Safe Riding Programme (SRP). This is a voluntary education programme that is free of charge, with both theory and practical components for all active mobility device users, including cyclists. LTA is revamping the SRP and will work with Traffic Police to reach out to road users and encourage public participation. We intend to roll out the new SRP in the next few months.",7,15,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00015
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"AMAP is also reviewing if our safety rules need to be strengthened and whether existing penalties need to be increased. For example, it is studying suggestions from the public on whether cyclists should be required to ride in a single file at all times on the roads and if there should be limits on group sizes for on-road cycling.",8,16,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00016
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"On whether to license on-road cyclists, there are mixed views from the public. Some are in support of licensing, so that errant cyclists can be more easily identified and punished. Others have expressed concerns that licensing on-road cyclists will increase compliance costs and affect the livelihoods of Singaporeans who are using their bicycles for work and commute. AMAP will adopt a fair and balanced approach in doing its review by consulting widely and hearing from different groups of stakeholders.",9,17,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00017
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Most jurisdictions, like the Netherlands and Denmark, do not license cyclists. Vienna licenses children aged 10 to 12 who ride alone on roads, to ensure they are educated with road traffic rules, but adult cyclists are not required to have a licence. Tokyo requires bicycles to be registered, but the purpose is to deter bicycle theft and not to enhance road safety. Beijing used to register bicycles too, but decided to abolish the scheme in 2004 as they found it to be costly and ineffective.",10,18,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00018
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,AMAP will review the practices in overseas jurisdictions and study the different options and trade-offs carefully before finalising its recommendations.,11,19,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00019
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, road safety is a collective effort by the community, requiring each of us, all of us, to play our part. Beyond reviewing the safety rules and penalties, I urge all road users to drive and ride safely, be considerate to one another and, in doing so, make our roads safer for everyone.",12,20,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00020
2021-05-11-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Ms Poh Li San.,1,21,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00021
2021-05-11-T-002,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Thank you, Speaker. I thank the Senior Minister of State. It is good to know that MOT does not intend to license cyclists. I have one supplementary question on enhancing safe cycling in Singapore. PCN and cycling paths across the whole of Singapore will take time to build. Can LTA embark on selective improvements to infrastructure that can enhance safety? For instance, widening of existing shared paths that are already too narrow and also adding more signages and markings on roadways, especially at road stretches with typically higher cyclist traffic and also junctions with blind spots.",1,22,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00022
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I thank Ms Poh for her supplementary questions. First, to clarify, AMAP is currently still doing its review. It has not come to any landing point at this moment. It is studying carefully the different options and trade-offs.",1,23,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00023
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"What I shared earlier in my main reply was to highlight some of the practices in overseas jurisdictions where they do not license cyclists or bicycles, but they have other ways of improving road safety. So, we do need to look at these carefully. I believe where Ms Poh and some members of the public are coming from is that licensing may seem like an attractive idea to improve road safety, but, in practice, and based on the experiences in other countries, whether that is, indeed, an effective way or are there other more effective ways, that is something AMAP is carefully studying.",2,24,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00024
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I agree with Ms Poh that while we look at how to expand our cycling paths, our Park Connectors, in the meantime, there are also other ways to improve the infrastructure, to improve road safety in our towns for all users. Just to give an example, in Toa Payoh, where I am looking after the town, we are working together with LTA, PUB and also the other agencies to cover up some of the open drains and convert them into wider footpaths. And in doing so, as Ms Poh pointed out, there will be more space for different groups of road users  pedestrians, cyclists. This is an important effort that must be complemented by users putting safety as a priority. The footpaths may be wider, but you must still ride safely and you must still look out for bicycles, other devices and other pedestrians when you are walking along these footpaths.",3,25,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00025
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"At the end of the day, I think what is most important is a combination of good infrastructure but also safety consciousness, placing priority on safety for all users.",4,26,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00026
2021-05-11-T-002,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for that sharing. The most important was on public education and I totally agree with the importance of public education. Would the Ministry consider conducting safety lessons in schools? That is one of the early touchpoints where we can educate our children. But most importantly, in that context, would the Ministry consider working closely with MOE to inculcate this, put it into the curriculum so that our students are given better ideas of safety and road safety in the future?",1,27,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00027
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I am unable to answer on behalf of MOE on this point. But I just wanted to highlight that, currently, Primary school students do go through activities to teach them about road safety. There is also a collaboration with Traffic Police and LTA to bring our students to the Road Safety Park and to expose them to different aspects of road safety. I think this is something which requires continuous reinforcement along the way.",1,28,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00028
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"I am not sure whether we want to put it into the curriculum because the curriculum is already, I think, very heavy with different content. This is something which we can find other ways of raising awareness, not just with students but also with other groups of road users. I mentioned earlier the Safe Riding Programme. LTA is working on this with Traffic Police and I hope that when the revised programme is ready, we can encourage the public to participate in this.",2,29,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00029
2021-05-11-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply to my question. I wanted to find out whether it is possible for the deployment of Auxiliary Police officers to help educate cyclists and motorists at this moment and pending the review and improvements to the infrastructure. I have noticed that in certain areas where cyclists like to go to, they normally cycle in a group and occupy the entire left lane. It is causing danger to themselves and also to motorists on the roads. Often, I find there are arguments as to who has the right to the lane.",1,30,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00030
2021-05-11-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"I agree with my colleagues who spoke earlier; I think education is key. And so, pending the review, is it possible for LTA to look at public education and enforcement, to make sure all cyclists keep in one single row —",2,31,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00031
2021-05-11-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Please keep the preamble short.,1,32,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00032
2021-05-11-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,"Yes, thank you. And just to keep to the extreme left lane.",1,33,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00033
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with Mr Gan that education and enforcement need to go hand in hand. That is what we have been doing.",1,34,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00034
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Gan may be aware that we have been enforcing adherence to safety rules. And this is a joint effort by Traffic Police and LTA. We do need to recognise as well that when cyclists are on the road, they are more vulnerable compared to those who are travelling in motor vehicles. I also urge drivers to bear in mind that if you are driving past cyclists, please remember that they are more vulnerable on the roads. And I think it is important to also remember that the current rule on a multi-lane road is that it is not against the rule for cyclists to ride on the left-most lane but riding two abreast. They need not be in a single file. This is the current rule. They are only required to ride in a single file if they are riding on a road with a single lane. That is mainly to prevent obstruction to traffic. But on a multi-lane road, and if they are riding on the left-most lane, they are currently allowed to ride two abreast.",2,35,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00035
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,There are some on-going discussions with different groups of stakeholders on whether this is a good practice or not.,3,36,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00036
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"From one perspective, it does help to enhance safety for the cyclists. I think some cyclists also agree that the group should not be too big, but they say if they are riding in a reasonably sized group, the cars that are driving past, treat this group as though they are one slow moving vehicle. You pay more attention to looking out for them, being more aware of their presence on the road. There are some valid reasons as well why this rule is currently crafted.",4,37,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00037
2021-05-11-T-002,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"But as I have said earlier, AMAP is reviewing, they are looking at the trade-offs. And I think they would consult widely with different groups of stakeholders before coming to the final recommendation.",5,38,2021-05-11-T-002-S-00038
2021-05-11-T-003,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) for each year in the last five financial years, what is the percentage of the Net Investment Returns (NIR) and the Net Investment Income (NII) that contributed to the Government's Budget as Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC); and (b) what is the estimated percentage of the NIR and the NII to be contributed to the Government's Budget as NIRC for this financial year.",1,39,2021-05-11-T-003-S-00039
2021-05-11-T-003,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance),"Mr Speaker, Sir, from FY2016 to FY2020, the Net Investment Income (NII) and Net Investment Returns (NIR) taken into the Budget as Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) was the maximum 50% allowable under the Constitution. We plan to take in the maximum 50% of NII and NIR for FY2021, in view of the expected overall Budget deficit.",1,40,2021-05-11-T-003-S-00040
2021-05-11-T-003,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Louis Chua.,1,41,2021-05-11-T-003-S-00041
2021-05-11-T-003,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I thank the Minister for his answer. I have got two supplementary questions. The first is, under the NIRC, I just wanted to understand if it is both the expected real rate of return that is estimated and is it also that of the net asset base.",1,42,2021-05-11-T-003-S-00042
2021-05-11-T-003,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"The second is, in terms of the 2021 numbers, as I understand, there would be the similar 50% that will be taken in 2021 as with 2016 to 2020. In terms of the increase in the absolute NIRC contribution, may I ask the Minister what would that increase be attributable to? Would it be based on the higher rates of return or higher net asset base?",2,43,2021-05-11-T-003-S-00043
2021-05-11-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer to the first question is yes. It is a combination of both, obviously. The absolute dollar amount that we get from NIRC will be both a function of the smoothened net asset base as well as the expected long-term rate of return. That is the NIRC framework.",1,44,2021-05-11-T-003-S-00044
2021-05-11-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As to the components which contribute to the FY2021 figures, I do not think we have the breakdown today. Because there would be a process based on what the smoothened base is and then, what the expected long-term rate of return is, and there are processes in place, as we have described in this House, to ascertain each of these figures which then are submitted to the President's Office for the President's approval.",2,45,2021-05-11-T-003-S-00045

2021-05-11-T-004,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) over the last three years, what average percentage of GST paid by the lowest 20% of households (by income) is offset by all forms of GST vouchers; and (b) what is the breakdown based on one-off versus permanent GST voucher schemes.",1,47,2021-05-11-T-004-S-00047
2021-05-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance),"Mr Speaker, Singapore operates a comprehensive and progressive system of taxes and transfers to support our citizens in meeting their needs, including housing, education, healthcare, public transport and a safe and secure environment.",1,48,2021-05-11-T-004-S-00048
2021-05-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance),"The GST Voucher (GSTV) is one permanent scheme that provides support to lower and middle income households and seniors for their living expenses. It comprises an annual cash payout, annual MediSave top-up for those aged 65 and above and quarterly utilities rebates (U-Save) for HDB households.",2,49,2021-05-11-T-004-S-00049
2021-05-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance),"In some years, there were additional one-off GSTV special payments. This was the case in the past three years. In 2019, a GSTV – Cash special payment was given to celebrate Singapore's bicentennial and to support Singaporeans who need more help. An additional $20 of U-Save rebate was also provided each year from 2019 to 2021 to mitigate the impact of the introduction of the carbon tax. In 2020, additional U-Save rebates were given to all eligible HDB households to help Singaporeans cope during the extraordinary uncertainty brought about suddenly by COVID-19.",3,50,2021-05-11-T-004-S-00050

So, that is for the permanent scheme.",4,51,2021-05-11-T-004-S-00051
2021-05-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance),"The GSTV special payments in 2019 and 2020 were equivalent to an offset of 33% of the GST payable by the bottom 20% of Singaporean households, again, on a per household member basis. This is on top of the 84% offset under the permanent scheme. In other words, in this extraordinary year, households in the bottom 20% got more from both the permanent and one-off GST Vouchers than the amount of GST payable.",5,52,2021-05-11-T-004-S-00052

Especially in light of COVID-19, I think there is a lot of concern as to inequality, especially if you look at the household income from work, I think it is the lowest 10% that saw the hardest hit in terms of income. So, in terms of the supplementary questions, I have got two.",1,54,2021-05-11-T-004-S-00054
2021-05-11-T-004,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"The first is in relation to the enhanced permanent GST Voucher scheme, in terms of the target amount of offset for the households involved, what is the target in terms of how much of the GST that would have been payable and how much of it do you want to offset? And what is the percentage of Singaporeans that will come under this GST Voucher scheme?",2,55,2021-05-11-T-004-S-00055
2021-05-11-T-004,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"The second is also in relation to that. If I look at the cut-off right now, in terms of the assessible income criterion, that is about $28,000, which works out to about $2,300 a month, which is significantly lower than the median monthly income from work of about $4,500. So, I just want to understand, in terms of the scope of this permanent GST Voucher scheme, the amount of help that could be rendered to the middle income households.",3,56,2021-05-11-T-004-S-00056
2021-05-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his questions. Inequality is certainly an issue that the Government is very focused on. We have been tackling this issue through a whole range of measures – Workfare, GST Vouchers, Senior Employment Credit, a whole range of different social support measures – for at least 20 years now. And you can see from the statistics that, in fact, the Gini coefficient in Singapore, post-tax and transfers, has been coming down. So, our measures are working. We will continue to do more to address inequality and social mobility, particularly, given that the concerns of COVID-19 and the impact of the pandemic are being felt disproportionately more by the lower income groups.",1,57,2021-05-11-T-004-S-00057
2021-05-11-T-004,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As to the enhancements to the permanent GST Voucher, that is something we are studying. We have committed; the Deputy Prime Minister did say when we talked about raising the GST rate, that we will also look at enhancing the permanent GST Voucher, not just providing a one-off offset but enhancing the permanent layer of the GST Voucher. We are studying that and will certainly get back with details when we are ready.",2,58,2021-05-11-T-004-S-00058
2021-05-11-T-005,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the restricted inflow of workers to Singapore has affected companies in Singapore and their ability and capacity to meet business commitments; and (b) what measures are being considered to mitigate the impact on companies and the products and services they provide to Singaporeans.,1,59,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00059

2021-05-11-T-005,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the contraction in total employment of non-residents by 181,500 throughout 2020 is also matched by a decline in the total population of non-residents in Singapore in the same period; (b) what are the reasons why non-residents who lose their jobs in Singapore may not be required to leave immediately; (c) how many non-residents who lost their jobs in 2020 have been allowed to remain in Singapore; and (d) how many non-residents who lost their jobs in 2020 have been re-employed in Singapore.",1,61,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00061
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Mr Speaker, Sir, may I take Question Nos 7, 8 and 9 together?",1,62,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00062
2021-05-11-T-005,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,63,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00063
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,Ms Jessica Tan and Mr Pritam Singh asked about the restricted inflow of workers and what we are doing to support businesses affected by these restrictions.,1,64,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00064
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Businesses have, indeed, been affected, quite badly, particularly with the Construction, Marine Shipyard and Process (CMP) sectors being the hardest hit as they rely heavily on migrant workers for jobs that few locals would want to work in. In 2020, the number of Work Permit holders in the CMP sectors declined by nearly 60,000 or about 16%.",2,65,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00065
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"We are very mindful of the manpower crunch that these firms face today. Besides providing financial relief to help them, we are also taking steps to alleviate the manpower shortage. From November 2020 right up to April 2021, we granted entry approvals to an average of 5,100 S Pass and Work Permit holders per month. However, restrictions on inflow of workers from higher risk countries is likely to persist for some time. This is as the size of the inflow coming in has to be reduced when the COVID-19 situation deteriorates in these source countries from where they come from, and we can only increase these inflows when the situation in these home countries improve. Because this is the only way we can ensure the safe inflow of the workers, whilst managing and mitigating the risk of transmission in our community.",3,66,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00066
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"So, to help businesses tap on workers from other countries, the Government recently announced that we are increasing the existing foreign worker levy rebates for Work Permit holders in the CMP sectors from $90 to $250 per Work Permit holder per month. This will last from May to December 2021. Employers can make use of these rebates to bring in workers from alternative sources, such as China, where the workers are generally higher skilled and, at the same time, command higher wages.",4,67,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00067
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"MOM and BCA also recently announced a temporary scheme to allow these new Work Permit holders from China to obtain their skills certification in Singapore, since some of the Overseas Testing Centres in China have not resumed operations. BCA and EDB will continue to engage firms and we will continue to review if additional measures are needed to help the CMP sectors through this crisis.",5,68,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00068
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"In the meantime, we encourage businesses to retain their existing migrant workers and tap on other workers that are already here in Singapore.",6,69,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00069
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Mr Leong Mun Wai asked if the non-resident employment decline in 2020 of 181,500 was matched by the decline in total population of non-residents within the same period. The answer is yes.",7,70,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00070
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"He also asked about repatriation arrangements. When a work pass expires or is cancelled, we typically require the worker to leave Singapore in two to four weeks. This depends, of course, on the pass type. Time is given for the employer to arrange repatriation and also for the worker to settle his or her own personal affairs, such as closure of bank accounts and termination of leases.",8,71,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00071
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Each year, about 30% of all work pass holders do not continue employment with their original employer and have their passes expired or cancelled. If the work pass holder is able to find new employment before repatriation, there is no reason for us to purposefully force this worker to return to his home country, for him to incur additional recruitment fees from overseas employment agents, to undergo additional COVID-19 testing and, on return to Singapore, to serve up to 21 days Stay-Home Notice (SHN). Furthermore, making the worker do this unnecessary round-trip would increase the risk of him returning with a COVID-19 infection.",9,72,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00072
2021-05-11-T-005,,,"On the other hand, however, if the work pass holder does not find new employment before the deadline, we ensure that his former employer will fulfil its obligation to successfully repatriate the worker.",1,73,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00073
2021-05-11-T-005,,,"If we had insisted that the worker had to leave Singapore even though he has already found an employer, we would have had to allow the entry of nearly double the number of workers last year, and this would further strain our SHN facilities. Of course, the alternative would be to compound further the manpower difficulties faced by businesses, as what the hon Member of Parliament Ms Jessica Tan and also Mr Pritam Singh have highlighted.",2,74,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00074
2021-05-11-T-005,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Pritam Singh.,1,75,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00075
2021-05-11-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister for replying to the Parliamentary Question (PQ). We have heard about anecdotes of companies applying for entry permits for their workers 30, 40, sometimes almost 50 times for one In-Principle Approval (IPA). It sounds like a large number; and, of course, the companies get frustrated. On the other hand, there is also an acknowledgement that the Government has to control the COVID-19 situation as best it can. So, it is a very fine balancing act.",1,76,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00076
2021-05-11-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Nonetheless, I have three supplementary questions for the Minister.",2,77,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00077
2021-05-11-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"First, how long is MOM proposing to extend the IPA of Work Permit and S Pass holders respectively in view of their repeated unsuccessful entry pass applications? I understand MOM extends it one time as a given. That means if the IPA is for three months for the Work Permit holder, MOM will extend it automatically. Is this going to continue?",3,78,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00078
2021-05-11-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second question is  would MOM be amenable to reimburse IPA application fees if, for whatever reason, the applying company decides, ""Look, I don't think it is possible to continue with this uncertainty"". So, would MOM consider reimbursing the IPA cost if the entry pass just does not come through?",4,79,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00079
2021-05-11-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The third question pertains to the second part of my two-part PQ. Some contractors have suggested non-traditional source countries like Vietnam as a potential source for workers. I know there is a long tail to this, it is not a case of just getting a person from any country; there is a whole process of training, and so on and so forth. Would this be something the Ministry would look into?",5,80,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00080
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"I thank Mr Pritam Singh for his questions. For the IPA, the In-Principle Approvals, and the entry approvals or the final entry approvals, there are actually two separate independent processes. Obviously, we do receive and we do give out a lot more IPAs than the entry approvals.",1,81,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00081
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"One of the key challenges of this pandemic is the fact that the situation is extremely fluid and dynamic. Why do I say it is fluid and dynamic? Because of the source countries where our workers come from, the situation back in many of these source countries – I think you have seen in the news – what we are seeing are successive waves of infection. So, as a result of that, you find that at the point of application of the IPA, as long as it fulfils the requirements of what we have in terms of what is needed for them to come in, we grant the approval. But to regulate the control in terms of the onboarding of these migrant workers coming into Singapore, we do it via the entry approval route. And that is dependent on the risk quota which we are able to accept. It is also a function of certain Not-to-Land (NTL) Restrictions, for instance, that the MTF decides and, at the same time, also a function of how many of these SHN facilities we have available.",2,82,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00082
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Earlier on in the year, we announced the set-up of the Migrant Worker Onboarding Centre, which is a one-stop centre to screen all of them, so as to make sure that it is safe before they go into the community. So, it is also a function of the number of beds that we have. Because of that, you find that the IPAs usually will far exceed the number of actual entry approvals coming into Singapore. So, I hope that part of it is cleared up.",3,83,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00083
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"To the Member's point about whether we can grant an extension – depending on the different Pass types, whether it is EP, S Pass and Work Permit – to the IPAs with different lengths of validity, today, the default answer to the point about the renewals and the automatic extension of IPAs – that is what we are now doing. However, we are seeing that because of the backlog of cases – that backlog has increased significantly. As a result, even if you allow for an automatic extension of that IPA, it does not make sense because that extension is going to go months ahead without any certainty as to whether, ultimately, we can grant the entry approvals. That is where the challenge is today. Because we have no way of telling how the pandemic, the control of the situation, the number of infections, the successive wave of infections from many of these source countries where we get our workers from, can actually provide certainty of control of the outbreak of these infections.",4,84,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00084
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"So, to that end itself, I guess the long answer to your question is that the extension of the validity of these IPAs is something that we are now reviewing. Because if it is too long again in the future, it does not make sense.",5,85,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00085
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"To the second point about refunds and reimbursements, indeed, we are considering that as well. We are trying to find a more nuanced way, so that we can make it a lot easier.",6,86,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00086
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"For the diversification of source countries, across the different Ministries – MND, BCA, ourselves, as well as MOT and ICA – we are exploring that collectively and we have started to reach out to counterparts in many of these other source countries, the non-traditional sources, to see how we can onboard them. But, obviously, this would take time because there are also language and cultural issues. These are things that we have to take into consideration.",7,87,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00087

2021-05-11-T-005,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"I thank the Minister for his response. I do have just one supplementary question. With regard to the industries, I know that the marine shipyard, construction and process industries have been most impacted. But I am also concerned about the small and medium enterprises or SMEs in terms of the services and their ability to continue to operate outside of these industries. There are some jobs – especially for Work Permit holders – that many of these SMEs are facing difficulty in terms of the ability to renew the Work Permits for, as well as to get sufficient workers for jobs that they are finding hard to fill, even as they look at alternative sources in Singapore.",1,89,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00089
2021-05-11-T-005,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"So, my question to the Minister is, in terms of the extensions for existing Work Permit holders or S Passes for workers in Singapore, can that be considered, especially for the SMEs, because one or two workers make a big difference for them in terms of their ability to continue to operate?",2,90,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00090
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"I thank Ms Jessica Tan for her very, very pertinent and very important question. Indeed, at this particular point in time, we are in crisis mode. So, all the appeals that come from all sectors, we will consider and we will review them. That is the reassurance that we can give.",1,91,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00091
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"On top of the appeals to grant extensions, we should also take note of the tremendous slew of measures that the Government has put forth to support SMEs – in the form of Job Support Scheme, the Job Growth Incentive. On top of that, we have got quite a number of other schemes to try and support our entire economy and our industry. So, it is not just one aspect or measure to help the SMEs only. Ms Tan will be comforted to know that the Government has also put in a very comprehensive set of measures to help support them as well.",2,92,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00092

2021-05-11-T-005,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have one clarification for the Minister. The Minister confirmed that last year, there was a contraction of about 180,000 in non-resident employment and there was also an outflow of these people from Singapore. Recently, there is also a number that said that there is a shortage of about 60,000 workers in the CMP sectors. So, can I confirm whether there has been a re-entry of 130,000 foreign workers into our country in the last few months?",1,94,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00094
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"I thank Mr Leong for his question. If I may sort of couch it this way  net net, in the entire industry itself, from March of 2020, right up till April this year, for the CMP sectors, which include the Work Pass as well as the S Pass, there is an average net outflow of 2,400 workers a month.",1,95,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00095
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"If you just take construction alone, the net outflow is about 1,800 per month. For the services sector, which we sort of follow through, we are about 42,000 lower than last year, same period, that means March 2020. So, that represents a net outflow of 3,200 per month. This is just for the services sector.",2,96,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00096
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"So, if you add both the CMP sector plus the services sector, the net outflow is about 5,600 per month.",3,97,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00097
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"From November last year till April this year, when we started to resume opening up the inflow of workers to address our severe acute shortage in all of our industries, on the average per month – as I have alluded to in my earlier statement – 5,100 workers came in for that few months. We could not sustain that inflow because of the fact that – as I have said – the situation is very dynamic and very fluid. The moment in any of these source countries the infection rates go up, we would have to throttle the number again.",4,98,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00098
2021-05-11-T-005,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"So, I hope that gives Mr Leong a sense of how acutely or how grave the shortage of workers is today in our industry.",5,99,2021-05-11-T-005-S-00099

2021-05-11-T-006,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"For the recent incidents at education institutions, investigations suggest that poor housekeeping practices in schools and lapses in cleaning, including within schools' in-house kitchens, could have contributed to the GE outbreaks.

This is not confined to a specific discipline or background, as our approach is to draw on the diverse expertise available to support the implementation of the Green Plan. So, all the relevant Ministries involved in the Green Plan will tap on this expertise when they spearhead efforts for their respective domains.",1,119,2021-05-11-T-008-S-00119
2021-05-11-T-008,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Our researchers' areas of expertise cover a wide range of sustainability-related fields like climate science, waste management and food safety. For example, the National Research Foundation (NRF) funds the Cooling Singapore project, which is co-led by the Singapore-ETH Centre and the Singapore Management University (SMU). The project studies ways to mitigate the Urban Heat Island effect.

Second, we are exploring the use of technology to improve the verification of these credits. In December 2020, DBS and Temasek, with Google Cloud, NUS, Verra and the World Bank as partners, launched the Sustainable Xcelerator to improve the efficiency of verifying emissions reductions and sequestration.

2021-05-11-T-009,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (East Coast),"Given the fact that we are now trying to do all these carbon sequestration with other countries overseas, over time, there will come a challenge between countries putting up their carbon taxes as well as how we are going to exchange this in terms of carbon credits. Is the Minister able to give us an insight on what are Singapore's plans if the carbon taxes do rise to a certain significant sum in other countries, because it does not make economic sense in terms of carbon credit offsets between countries?",2,137,2021-05-11-T-009-S-00137

2021-05-11-T-009,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"How does the Government plan to increase the awareness amongst Singapore companies with this relatively new product? We know Singapore has worked so hard to attain a stellar reputation as a credible and trusted hub and partner. As the Minister has shared just now, I am very excited to hear about all the opportunities as well as the work that we are doing to develop a taxonomy and guidelines and so on. How are we going to engage the companies in Singapore so that they will not be scammed or they can be better prepared as they prepare for their alignment to the Singapore Green Plan 2030?",2,142,2021-05-11-T-009-S-00142
2021-05-11-T-009,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"I thank Ms Janet Ang for her question. I think there are different types of carbon markets today. Suffice to say – I hope I am not over-simplifying them – that, broadly, there are two broad categories. They are the compliance markets and then you have the voluntary markets. The compliance markets are created. They are regulated by mandatory national, regional or international carbon reduction regimes. One of the examples is the European Union ETS, which is the world's first carbon market. Of course, at the international level, discussions are also underway at the UN Conference for Climate Change. Again, this kind of meetings seeks to recognise the use of carbon credits to offset national emissions.",1,143,2021-05-11-T-009-S-00143
2021-05-11-T-009,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"On the other hand, what I have shared with Members earlier on are voluntary markets. They function outside of these compliance markets. They enable companies, individuals to purchase carbon offsets on a voluntary basis to manage their carbon emissions. This is in addition to other decarbonisation strategies. They do not have an intended use for compliance purposes. So, these compliance credits may, in some instances, be purchased by voluntary non-regulated entities. They are not broadly accepted into a compliance regime unless they fulfil a broader perspective. And therein lies the challenge which the hon Member has alluded to.",2,144,2021-05-11-T-009-S-00144
2021-05-11-T-009,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"At our end, we have actually been working with the different groups to see how we can nuance this approach and the key thing is to articulate and communicate this strategy and also educate many more of our companies to embark on this roadmap and to come onto this platform with us. Many of the companies looking to invest in Singapore, particularly from the semi-conductors to even data centres and so on, they have also moved on to source for many of these carbon credits.",3,145,2021-05-11-T-009-S-00145

2021-05-11-T-012,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Mr Speaker, Sir, in recent months, global food commodity prices have risen due to strong global demand and tight supply, with the latter caused by adverse weather conditions and restrictions on food exports by some food-producing countries.

To reduce the impact of rising commodity prices on groceries, we have diversified our food import sources and also provided targeted assistance to lower income households.",1,179,2021-05-11-T-012-S-00179

Through our deliberate efforts to diversify our import sources, we were able to keep the prices of food supplies and daily necessities competitive. Such resilience in the essential supply of our food and daily necessities is made possible also because of our excellent connectivity and commitment to keep our ports and key transport operations running even at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.",2,180,2021-05-11-T-012-S-00180

However, we need to continue to encourage more to be vaccinated especially among the seniors, given their age, they are the most vulnerable. I urge all of us to encourage our elderly family members too.",29,236,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00236

2021-05-11-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Sir, I spoke about vaccine effectiveness earlier. We knew from the start that vaccine breakthroughs are possible. But vaccination would still significantly reduce the chances of infection. For example, based on a study published in Lancet, Pfizer vaccines can reduce risk of asymptomatic infection by 91%. Vaccination also prevents severe reactions to the infections and is likely to reduce onward transmission.",31,238,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00238

2021-05-11-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),Most of our local cases of infected vaccinated individuals were asymptomatic. None had severe COVID-19 disease requiring more intensive care. This is consistent with the international experience and emerging evidence that vaccines are highly efficacious in protecting against severe COVID-19 disease and likely to reduce the risk of transmission.,33,240,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00240
2021-05-11-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"There is also a question on re-infected cases, which are known to be possible from overseas and local experiences. As of 10 May 2021, 26 cases have been assessed to be re-infections. We are still investigating whether these are due to the general waning immunity over time or the lack of cross-protection against specific variants of COVID-19 that the individual is naïve to.

There is intense on-going global scientific evaluation for these variants, which our experts are also participating in. The current global consensus is that COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved can provide protection against these variants because these vaccines elicit a broad immune response involving a range of antibodies and cells.

We highlighted then that this re-opening process was not going to be a straightforward one and there would be potential stops and starts along the way because the virus has not been eradicated in our community and new cases can leak through our borders despite our precautions and safeguards. So, the more we open up and the more activities we undertake, the higher the risks of new cases breaking out in the community.",7,281,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00281

2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"One option for us is to shut our borders and minimise the flow of people into Singapore. Larger, continental-sized or resource-rich countries like China, Australia and New Zealand have taken this approach. They are able to keep things going with their own resources and people and sustain a living with their own domestic demand.",9,283,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00283
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"But Singapore is in a completely different position. We are a little red dot fully plugged into the world. Trade and travel are our lifeblood. For us, these are not just good-to-have; they are existential issues. They are how, as a country, we earn a living and remain relevant to the world. In other words, we can keep our borders closed for a short time, but not over a prolonged duration. That is why after we exited the circuit breaker last year, we also progressively lifted our travel restrictions and allowed travellers to come in, but in a controlled and safe manner.",10,284,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00284
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We recognised then that there would be a risk of some imported cases leaking into the community and we had taken several steps to strengthen our precautions and safeguards. For example, we put in place a system of regular testing for those working at the checkpoints and borders. We prioritised vaccination for them and those working in our Stay-Home Notice (SHN) facilities – the hotels. Vaccination rates are now above 90% for aviation and maritime; and 85% for the SHN facilities. We stepped up our testing protocols with pre-departure and on-arrival PCR tests. We tightened our SHN regime and ensured that the hotels we use for SHN have proper infection controls and security measures.",11,285,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00285
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We also continue to update the SHN regime to respond to the evolving public health situation here and abroad. Some Members have suggested extending the SHN to 21 days. Indeed, we did so initially for the incoming Construction, Marine and Process (CMP) workers, because they would be living and working in higher risk settings. So, these workers would serve out 14 days in the SHN facility, followed by seven days in the Migrant Worker Onboarding Centres.",12,286,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00286
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We also applied a 21-day SHN for arrivals from the few countries where the variant strains originated  the United Kingdom, South Africa, India.

2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"I should clarify that there is still no medical evidence that the new variants have a longer incubation period. But variant or not, there is always a very small tail risk of such long incubation cases. That is why we have moved recently to a tighter 21-day SHN regime for travellers from all higher risk countries during this period of heightened alert.",14,288,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00288
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Ms Nadia Samdin asked if it is possible for vaccinated citizens and PRs who travel abroad to serve their SNH at home. At this stage, we prefer to take a more cautious approach and have all travellers from higher risk countries serve the SHN in dedicated facilities. But we will continue to review and consider options for the future, especially as we gain a better understanding of the new variants and when more of our population are vaccinated.",15,289,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00289
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Mr Yip Hon Weng also asked about the business travellers who do not need to serve SHN. We have explained before that we allow a small group of such travellers for essential work reasons. We control the risks tightly by keeping the numbers small and requiring them to adhere strictly to a controlled itinerary. We also subject them to frequent testing while they are in Singapore to ensure they are free from the virus. The scope and usage of such travel passes are subject to constant review and close monitoring to ensure they are used in a safe manner, while minimising risks to the community.",16,290,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00290
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Importantly, besides the SHN and testing protocols, we control tightly the overall flow of travellers coming into Singapore. This is a dynamic process. We adjust the travel flows from each country regularly based on our assessment of the public health situation. Once we observe any deterioration in any country or region, we will throttle down the numbers and impose stricter border restrictions for that country or region.",17,291,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00291
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"That was the approach we took recently because of the rapidly deteriorating COVID-19 situation in India. In April, we reduced entry approvals for long-term pass holders and short-term visitors from India. Later, we moved to ban all travellers from India. This ban was extended to the entire South Asian region from the start of May.",18,292,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00292
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Let me share some numbers to provide a better perspective. Pre-COVID-19, we had 200,000 travellers coming through Changi Airport every day, both on transit as well as entering Singapore. This plummeted during the circuit breaker when we closed our borders temporarily. After the circuit breaker, as I mentioned, we eased some of our travel restrictions. By November last year, we had about 820 arrivals a day. Eight hundred and twenty arrivals a day, compared to 200,000 transit and arrivals. Between December and March this year, the figure has been stable at about 1,200 arrivals per day.",19,293,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00293
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"One reason for the increase in arrivals is that we had taken in more migrant workers for the Construction, Marine and Process (CMP) sectors as well as foreign domestic workers. This group was also the largest contributor to our imported cases – they account for about 40% of the imported cases over the recent six months. But even as we increased the flow of these workers, we also implemented a tighter screening and quarantine process for them. So, these imported cases were already in SHN when we detected them and they were not in contact with the community.",20,294,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00294
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"But the inflow of CMP workers we have allowed up to now is still unable to meet our needs. Because every day, every week, every month, many migrant workers have left to go back to their home countries. Whatever numbers we are bringing in barely replace those who have left. Our companies, including many SMEs, urgently need new workers to make up the shortfall and have been applying to MOM for approval to enter Singapore, as you have heard just now in the Parliamentary Question that was posed to Minister Tan See Leng. The application backlog has been building up significantly, even before we imposed the latest set of travel restrictions on the South Asian region. And now, the manpower crunch has worsened.",21,295,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00295
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"I fully understand and share the desire amongst many to be tight on our border measures. In fact, we have maintained a tight posture, as I have explained, and we will continue to do so. But we also need to be very clear what this means for Singapore and Singaporeans.",22,296,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00296
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Contractors will be especially hard-hit. Building projects will be delayed. In particular, we can expect many new BTO projects to be delayed by one year or more. Private home buyers may also face delays of varying lengths.",23,297,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00297
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Likewise, companies in the marine and process sectors will be badly affected. They will find it hard to deliver their existing projects on time and a few may even have to forgo new opportunities and projects. These are important sectors that we have taken decades to build. They hire thousands of Singaporean engineers and executives, and they remain crucial sources of highly skilled jobs.",24,298,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00298
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"The manpower shortage will not be confined to the CMP sector; it will have a cascading effect on the whole economy. In fact, any company seeking to bring in workers from higher risk countries will now face considerable delays. The waiting time for an entry approval could be more than six months. Our big concern is that if companies continue to face difficulties or are forced to close, we could then end up with higher unemployment and job losses for Singaporeans.",25,299,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00299
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),Stresses will be felt in our society too. Singaporeans will find it harder to reunite with their families abroad. Families applying for new foreign domestic workers to care for their children or elderly will have to wait for at least two months.,26,300,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00300
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"These are the consequences of keeping our borders tight.

2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Meanwhile, the Government will do more to assist the CMP sector which is bearing the brunt of the impact. The industry has been working very hard to become more manpower-lean. But this will take time. That is why MND has set out new legislation to allow existing construction contracts to be adjusted to take into account the increase in manpower costs; we are debating that later.",28,302,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00302
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"As announced recently, CMP firms will receive higher Foreign Worker Levy rebates from May to December 2021. The rebate for each Work Permit Holder will be increased from $90 per month to $250 per month. We will also continue to work with the CMP employers to find safe ways to bring in workers to alleviate the manpower shortage.",29,303,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00303
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Beyond the CMP sector, as well as the aviation and tourism-related segments, there are signs of improvement in the broader economy. Barring a setback to the global economy and provided we are able to keep the COVID-19 situation under control, we should be able to continue with our recovery trajectory.",30,304,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00304
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"But things are very fluid and the outlook remains uncertain. The Government will continue to keep a close watch over the economic situation and consider how best to support those who need more help to adjust. At the same time, businesses will also need to be more agile and to start factoring the need to pivot plans or operating models at short notice. We will all need to learn to adapt quickly and be more nimble in this new uncertain and rapidly changing environment.",31,305,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00305
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Even with the tightest of border controls, there may still be imported cases leaking into the community. I shared earlier that countries like China and Australia have adopted a tighter border regime than us because they can afford to rely on a larger base of domestic resources and demand. But even these countries have detected cases of new variants in their communities.",32,306,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00306
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"So, we cannot just rely on border measures to keep out the virus. We also need to have a full suite of protective measures and safeguards in our community. When a new case pops up, we move in quickly to isolate all the close contacts and ring-fence them, as we have been doing. We cast a wide net and conduct mass testing for all persons with possible exposures to the infected case, like what you have seen recently, when we went in quickly to test everyone in the schools or everyone working in the airport. Thus, we try our best to prevent large clusters and outbreaks from happening.",33,307,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00307
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Despite these efforts, there will be a few occasions when we will need more general movement restrictions. For example, with the recent Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) cluster, the transmission was detected some time after the virus was introduced into the ward. We have tested all the hospital staff, patients as well as visitors and tried to ring-fence the cluster. But we could not be sure if there were still hidden cases out there in the community. That is why we have decided to tighten the overall rules pre-emptively – to reduce our movement and social contacts more generally, so that we can reduce the risks of transmission and curb any further spread of the virus.",34,308,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00308
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"I recognise that these measures pose considerable inconvenience to all Singaporeans. As Minister Gan Kim Yong said just now, there are several public holidays coming up in the month of May. Many activities and plans have had to be adjusted. I know, in particular, this must be very disappointing for our Malay/Muslim community, having to observe these strict rules during Hari Raya and to curtail your normal family visits for a second year. Likewise, for the Buddhist community during Vesak day.",35,309,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00309
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),I hope everyone understands why the latest measures are necessary and I thank everyone for taking them in your stride. I seek your cooperation to abide by them – not just with the letter of the law but also the spirit of it. I think it is very important for us to understand that we are now on the knife's edge and our community cases can go either way over the next few weeks.,36,310,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00310
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We have a chance of getting things under control by the end of the month. But, as we know from experience, it only takes one lapse or one irresponsible action for an infection to spread and that infection may end up being a super-spreader event in the community. So, let us all do our part  work from home, cut back on social activities and interactions, and stay home as much as possible during this period.",37,311,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00311
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"This is not the first time we have had to deal with spikes in community cases. But compared to a year ago, our capabilities have significantly strengthened. Our testing capacity is much larger. We tested about 35,000 swabs per day in the past week and have the lab capacity to test up to 73,000 per day, or even more, with pooled testing.",38,312,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00312
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Trace Together and SafeEntry are now more pervasive, which means we can contact trace and ring-fence cases more quickly.

2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Importantly, vaccination is a major game changer. We have not vaccinated everyone yet but we have covered most of our older population as well as our healthcare and frontline workers at the air and sea ports and our SHN hotels and dormitories. This puts us in a much safer position.",40,314,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00314
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Our experiences over the last year have shown that if we act quickly to contact trace, isolate, test and, if we all exercise individual and social responsibility, we can effectively suppress the spread of the virus. We have brought down infection rates in the community before and we can do it again.",41,315,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00315
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We must also continue to support one another. Many have been fighting COVID-19 for more than a year. For example, our healthcare professionals testing, vaccinating and treating patients; our contact tracing teams; our public officers across multiple Government agencies; our Safe Distancing Ambassadors and Enforcement Officers and many, many more serving on the frontline. It has been very tough for all of them. So, to them, we say, ""Thank you, keep your spirits up and all of us are behind you every step of the way."" [Applause.]",42,316,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00316
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"The best way to support our frontline workers is to take all the prevailing measures seriously – do our part to reduce the risks of transmission and, when vaccination is offered to you, take it up as soon as possible. Avoid spreading falsehoods or unverified information that can cause needless fear or foster divisions and suspicions in our society. Remember, the virus does not respect ethnicity or nationality. This is not a Chinese virus or an Indian variant. This is a global pandemic – the virus and its variants are out there everywhere in the world. So, there is no place for discrimination, racism or xenophobia here in Singapore. We must continue to stand together, look out for one another, so that we can all get through this together.

Yes, we have had our share of setbacks, but we have learned and we have bounced back from them. Importantly, we have seen the Singapore spirit shine brightly throughout these challenging times.

2021-05-11-T-014,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Sir, it has been very hard for many healthcare brothers and sisters at TTSH. I hear of nurses who have been told by their landlords to move out at short notice. I know of a young mother of a newborn at home, her husband works at TTSH. He has had to move out of the home to keep her and her fellow healthcare workers working at another hospital safe from COVID-19 transmission between hospitals.",2,321,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00321
2021-05-11-T-014,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Can I ask the Ministers what is being done to help affected TTSH workers  nurses who cannot find a place to stay, healthcare workers who cannot find a Grab or a taxi to bring them to the hospital or to take them home after a shift; families which have been separated by necessary COVID-19 precautions who need help with childcare, help with getting the kids to continue in school? Is there a hotline for affected TTSH staff to call? Can the Ministry set up a care team connecting the different Government agencies to provide help to affected TTSH healthcare workers, especially for challenges that may be beyond the reach of individual hospital management?",3,322,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00322
2021-05-11-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Sir, I thank Dr Tan for raising this issue. Indeed, this is a very worrisome trend. As I have mentioned my speech, we have observed a minority of our resident Singaporeans taking steps to protect themselves at the expense of our healthcare workers' well-being. Some of them have been asked to move out of their homes by their landlords. Some of their co-workers are shunning them. I think these are wrong.",1,323,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00323
2021-05-11-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We are struggling because, on one hand, we know this is wrong and we should not condone such actions. But on the other hand, we are concerned about the well-being of the healthcare workers and we do need to find ways to help them and support them. So, MOH and the Multi-Ministry Task Force have been working together with the hospitals – TTSH as well as the other hospitals – to provide support for the affected workers. In fact, we have moved in to arrange with hotels for accommodation, to provide alternatives to these healthcare workers who have been affected.",2,324,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00324
2021-05-11-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Let me say that this should not be an excuse for the landlords to kick them out on the basis that there is now alternative accommodation and say why not just move over to the hotels rather than staying on in the flat? So, I think it is still our preference to encourage our landlords to understand the situation, to play their part to support our healthcare workers in the work that they do. I also want to urge Singaporeans to show their support to these healthcare workers. Because they are putting themselves in harm's way in order to protect us.

2021-05-11-T-014,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"I have a few supplementary questions for the Ministers. Minister Gan has mentioned that the vaccination supplies are limited. Indeed, they are, and very precious at that. First, what other drugs are being tested by HSA? We know that two of them have been certified; Sinovac is being tested. What if Sinovac is not approved? Do we have arrangements with the other drug companies that can increase the supplies from the other two companies, so that Singaporeans who have not been vaccinated can be assured that they will certainly get that vaccination?",2,328,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00328
2021-05-11-T-014,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"The second supplementary question, I know it is a bit further ahead, but we always like to plan ahead  booster jabs and second jabs. Soon, for those of us who have had our jabs, one year will be up. What next?",3,329,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00329
2021-05-11-T-014,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"And the third supplementary question is, I would like to know what is the all-in cost for each vaccination that is given.

2021-05-11-T-014,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"And that leads me to the last question. Minister Lawrence Wong talked about the implications, the overall costs of all this. All of us, whether in Government, business and public, consumers, we need to expect that for all these, there are consequences; that the end of the day, somebody has to pay for all this. I think consumers, the public, probably also would have to expect that certain costs will have to go up. I think we just need to be prepared for all these. Businesses need to absorb, need to find ways to work around some of these. The Government, I am sure, will continue to help subsidise some of these. But I think the public and consumers too need to think about what are the implications for all of us, as all of us are in this together.",5,331,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00331

2021-05-11-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"First, on the vaccine supply. Indeed, the vaccines continue to be limited in supply. Also, partly because there is still a resurgence of new cases every day in many other countries and, therefore, the global supply of vaccines is limited and not just the quantity but the logistics are also challenging. Therefore, we need to do what we can to diversify our sources and to ensure that our supplies that we have contracted arrive on schedule. And when we roll them out, we encourage Singaporeans to get vaccinated as soon as possible.",2,333,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00333
2021-05-11-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"As to what other vaccines are being studied, we have a diversified portfolio beyond Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Sinovac. We have several other alternatives with which we have entered into advance purchasing agreements. But I am not at liberty to share the details because many of these agreements contain confidentiality clauses that limit us and our ability to share details. But as and when these contracts materialise, as and when we are able to supply and to deploy these vaccines, we will share more details with fellow Singaporeans.",3,334,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00334
2021-05-11-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Mr Seah also asked about booster jabs. As I have mentioned, let us focus on the current vaccine roll-out. I understand that some Singaporeans are anxious and want to know, should the booster jab be required, what we need to do about it. Let me share that we have put in place a planning team to look at how we can deploy booster shots, starting probably next year, towards the end of the year or beginning of next year. So, the operational plans are being drawn up and we will be able to deliver booster jabs, if it becomes necessary.",4,335,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00335
2021-05-11-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"At the end of the day, it may turn out to be similar to the flu jabs that we get every year. Because of the variants, because of the different virus and bacteria that we are confronting, so we need to continue to have booster jabs for our flu vaccines. Similarly, for COVID-19, it may come a day that we have to continue to have regular booster jabs. And we are putting in place plans to operationalise that.",5,336,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00336
2021-05-11-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In terms of the cost of vaccination, it varies from vaccine to vaccine. Actually, a significant part of the cost is not in the vaccine Itself but in the logistics of it. The cost in organising the vaccination centres, mobilising the healthcare professionals, providing support for vaccine recipients; and all these are costly.",6,337,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00337
2021-05-11-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"But if you compare it with the cost of the impact on lives, on livelihoods, I think it is a small price to pay and we need to continue to prepare ourselves and to focus on the vaccination programme. Roughly, it may cost about – and this is off the top of my head and I need to verify that – off the top of my head, roughly, it costs about $100 per vaccine per regimen and that it will include some of these peripheral costs and so it is not cheap. But it is important for us to continue to press on with the vaccination programme to minimise the cost on the economy and the cost of lives.",7,338,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00338

Last Friday, 7 May, in the morning, a 55-year-old Indian lady was brisk walking towards Chua Chu Kang stadium. She said that she lowered her mask below her nose to prevent breathlessness. A man wearing a light-coloured t-shirt, accompanied by a woman, shouted at her to put her mask above her nose. She told him that she was exercising. The man then shouted at her again, used a racial slur, and she responded to him, ""God bless you"" and began to walk away. She said that the man then ran towards her and landed a ""flying kick"" on her chest, causing her to fall. She had scratches on her arms and hands.

That is dangerous and dangerous for Singapore because, first, it will be expatriate Indians, then it will come to Singaporean Indians. Anyway, not everyone can distinguish between foreign-born Indians and Singaporean-born Indians. The lady who was attacked has been a citizen for 25 years.",9,354,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00354

It is not the case now – far from it – but expression of overt racism is still there only amongst a minority in Singapore. The majority of Singaporeans are decent and not racist.

They are anti-Government; that is perfectly okay, but do not play with race. Comments on these sites – Indians being called cockroaches, rapists and so on – we should be ashamed that in the name of free speech, we allow such comments. This bad behaviour and open expression of racism, I invite all here to condemn. And when called out, we cannot seek to justify such racist behaviour by saying, ""Oh, it is because of Government policies"" or ""It is because of the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA)"" or that the Indians are behaving badly or that we are entitled to be racist and xenophobic because of these things.",11,356,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00356

I just want to confirm that that is correct. Can I confirm that this applies to all allergic reactions or is it only to anaphylaxis? And what kind of adverse events will rule out patients from taking the second vaccine? I am concerned that if we set the threshold too low, many people will be ruled out from their second dose after reporting allergic reactions and this will impact the overall immunity rate of our country.",1,368,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00368

2021-05-11-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"It is something that we are studying but it is not easy to swab all patients because some of them would already have symptoms and some of them may already have pre-existing conditions. Some of them, even after swabbing, could be negative. They could also be infected by visitors and they could also be within the incubation period and they can become positive thereafter. So, it is important for us to put in place safe distancing, safe management measures even within the hospital to ensure that precautions are taken. The staff, healthcare workers must wear the necessary protective wear, whether it is PPE, depending on the setting; even in the inpatient wards or outpatient areas, precautions have to be adopted.",1,381,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00381

2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, the experience from the latest cases picked up in Changi Airport as well as the clusters we have seen from ICA and Tan Tock Seng Hospital so far suggests that, as Minister Gan mentioned in his earlier speech, this strain or the variant that we are experiencing now is more infectious. Each time we pick up an infected case, we are seeing larger clusters. More people are being infected than, say, the experience last year.",1,387,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00387
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, what this means for us is that we really need to take this seriously. We should take all the safe management measures and all the infection protocols very seriously. People who need to wear PPE need to be very diligent about this. Those who are in close contact or doing high-risk jobs need to be very diligent about wearing of masks, for example, and make sure they are wearing a proper mask. So, these are all basic things but I think it is worth re-emphasising.",2,388,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00388
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The other point is that testing can be a big help. We have seen how, through very frequent testing, either by doing a special sweep of everyone or doing it on a regular basis, we are able to pick up cases very quickly. So, that is an important point that we should not give up. Vaccination is important but testing remains an important way for us to detect the virus quickly.",3,389,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00389

2021-05-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, to the Minister for Health.

2021-05-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"On to my question, it is about the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme which he gave some figures on just now. Earlier, he said that there were 104 applications received and about 30 applications were adjudged to have met the qualifying criteria. So, does that mean that these 30 claims are going to be allowed and some payment is going to be made on these 30 claims? Then, he also mentioned that there were 75 that were rejected. I would like him to clarify the reasons for rejection because, from the portal for submission of the application, it appears that every application has to be accompanied by a doctor's certification that the side effect is related to the vaccination. So, for these 75 rejected cases, was there actually an accompanying medical certification that the side effect is related to the vaccination? And could he clarify why those applications were rejected?",3,394,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00394
2021-05-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"For the Minister for Education, the recent round of tightening measures included some that affected the fitness industry. I think he is aware that this has caused a lot of unhappiness and anxiety, as it affects the livelihoods of trainers and also the customers. Subsequently, there was a slight adjustment to this announcement to say that low-intensity activities would be allowed to carry on indoors. But I understand that this has been accompanied by a requirement that the patrons have to bring their own equipment to the fitness studios or the gyms, which, to most people, would be a disincentive to go to the place in the first place because these are things you go to the studio for because you cannot do them at home.",4,395,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00395
2021-05-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"So, I would like to ask him whether the Government will review this requirement because it is already setting capacity limits, it is saying that the activities have to be low intensity, masks have to be on at all times. If there can be some additional measures, such as requirement to wear gloves and so on, would the Government re-look at this requirement for customers to bring their own equipment to the fitness studio?",5,396,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00396
2021-05-11-T-014,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Minister Gan. I am actually interested in the answer to the second question. There is an impact on our gym here in Parliament as well.,1,397,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00397
2021-05-11-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Thank you. Let me just clarify that 75 have been evaluated; 45 were rejected, 30 were approved. That is the number; not 75 are rejected. Among those that were rejected, some of them, the panel will have to assess whether it is more likely to be associated with vaccination or not. There is also a balance of probability that they have to assess. And some cases did not qualify because the severity did not meet the mark of a severe reaction. Some of it may be rashes, maybe some swelling, but does not require extensive medical care and, therefore, may not qualify for the application.",1,398,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00398
2021-05-11-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"So, there are a variety of reasons. But suffice to say that they are all assessed thoroughly by an independent panel before they were approved or rejected.",2,399,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00399
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, our approach towards these high-risk activities has been consistent, in the sense that if you look at what we have done for nightclubs, karaokes, for example, we have not allowed these activities which we think are of higher risk, but the premises have been allowed to pivot to other activities which are permissible. Last year, Members will recall, Zouk, maybe even now, has been transformed and changed to different kinds of activities.",1,400,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00400
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, in that sense, we continue to apply the same approach now to gyms and fitness centres. Why did we specifically identify this activity? Because we have seen evidence of spread in other places, we have had infected persons use gyms and fitness centres in Singapore, and we have been very worried of large clusters potentially breaking out in these settings. Because in a gym fitness centre, it is an enclosed space, many people are there, very often without masks on, spreading a lot of droplets each time you are exercising, shouting or whatever you are doing in the gym, Zumba or whatever that lesson is, the chances of a spread within that environment is very high. That is why we have decided, during this period of heightened alert, this is one of the highest risk kinds of activities; better to put a stop to it temporarily. But if the operators are able to pivot or do something differently, something of lower risk, then we will be able to allow it.",2,401,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00401
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the specific issue of equipment, we will be prepared to look at it. There is concern, obviously, because there will be infection, not just through droplets but also fomites and touching the surfaces. Remember how last year we encouraged everyone not to use your hands to touch your face? That basic advice still remains. You can still get infected by contact.",3,402,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00402
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, that is the reason why we suggested people bring their own equipment, but we will continue to monitor the situation very closely.

2021-05-11-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thought I would just add more to the answer that the Minister for Education had given to Mr Ang Wei Neng on the lessons learnt for Changi Airport. We know that the sea port and the airport are points of vulnerability when we have a pandemic. So, in fact, just this morning, we got information that, in Taiwan, their biggest airline has been infiltrated by the virus. So, they are tightening up rules on pilots. So, even for Taiwan, which has kept itself domestically very safe, the virus will find itself through the borders.",1,405,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00405
2021-05-11-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Airport, sea port, causeway, these are our points of vulnerabilities, regardless of where the variants and the virus come from. We have been implementing a very tight posture both for sea port and airport. The workers all observe safe management measures, masks on, some are even in full PPE when they carry out their work. We test them regularly – some on a seven-day cycle, some on a 14-day cycle – which is why we are able to pick up these cases quite quickly this round when we had the outbreak of cases.",2,406,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00406
2021-05-11-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Thirdly, it is to push them for vaccinations. They were one of the first to go for vaccination. Mr Ang asked about the airport. At the airport, in total, we are talking about 46,000 workers; 26,000 are what we consider more high-risk. They may come into contact; actually, they do come into contact with travellers, so they are higher risk. For that group, 92% are fully vaccinated. Then, there is an outer ring that does not come into direct contact but we, nevertheless, consider them exposed to some risk. That is another 20,000. And for that group, more than 80% have had at least one dose.",3,407,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00407

2021-05-11-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"So, what are the lessons learnt? I think never be complacent, not even when you are vaccinated; never be complacent.",5,409,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00409
2021-05-11-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"What are we doing? I put out some information two nights ago, but let me just briefly recap. The first thing when something like that happens is to press the reset button and contain the problem. Put two rings immediately, that Minister Lawrence Wong and Minister Gan Kim Yong mentioned. First ring, who are the close contacts, quarantine and then isolate. Second is the wider ring, who could have been affected; put them all through testing. So, today, we are putting several thousand through a one-time special operation. It should be carried out these few days; started yesterday.",6,410,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00410

2021-05-11-T-014,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Thirdly, we continue to do surveillance and the testing. One thing we can possibly do – and I have to discuss this with the Minister for Health, besides the PCR test once every 14 days – is how can we intersperse it with something like the antigen test, something faster? We are also developing a breathalyser test, something that can pick up quickly even though it may be less accurate. But the speed with which we pick up cases is absolutely critical. And, lastly, push those that have not gone for vaccination to go for vaccination as fast as we can.",9,413,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00413
2021-05-11-T-014,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Leon Perera.,1,414,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00414
2021-05-11-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),I would like to thank both Ministers for their very helpful Statements. Just two points of clarification for the Minister for Health.,1,415,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00415
2021-05-11-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, he mentioned that HSA is studying the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for adolescents and children. I understand that the US Food and Drug Administration has just approved the use of the Pfizer vaccine for children aged 12 to 15, and this is just a very recent development. So, I am wondering, assuming that HSA finds that it is safe to do so, can we assume that we will proceed to vaccinate school-going children above the age of 12 with the vaccines that we have?",2,416,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00416
2021-05-11-T-014,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"My second clarification is on the vaccination effort. I think the Minister for Health shared very heartening figures about the progress that we have made. The majority of people over 60 years old have been vaccinated. Given how key this vaccination effort is to our fight against COVID-19, I am wondering if MOH is studying the example of a handful of countries which have been very successful and made very rapid progress in vaccination – Israel is one example. I believe roughly 90% of those over 60 years old in Israel have been vaccinated in a very short time. Are we studying those examples to see what lessons we might be able to learn in order to accelerate the speed of this vaccine roll-out in Singapore?",3,417,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00417
2021-05-11-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Sir, as I have mentioned in my speech, HSA is now evaluating the use of Pfizer-BioNTech for the younger population. And I believe the results should be out quite soon. Once the results are out and if it is, in fact, deemed effective and safe for deployment to the younger population, we will roll out the programme to vaccinate the younger population, also shortly. So, be patient with us, we are doing the assessment. I have to also explain that the assessment differs from country to country. While WHO and some countries may have approved the use, we still need to assess the efficacy and safety of this vaccine in our own context. So, it will take some time and I believe the results should be out shortly.",1,418,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00418
2021-05-11-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Mr Perera also asked about whether we have learnt the lessons from other countries on the promotion of vaccination. Yes, indeed, we watched what the other countries do and we try to learn as much as we can from them, whether it is through promotion, through messaging and even through family members to encourage them.",2,419,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00419
2021-05-11-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"I think all of us will understand that every country is different, the culture is different, the context is different and beliefs are different. Therefore, we also have to evolve our own system of outreach to encourage people to sign up for vaccination. I must say that I am encouraged by the take-up rate so far. But I think it is always the last 20% to 25% that is most difficult to reach. Therefore, I would encourage all of us, Members of Parliament, as well as grassroots leaders, to do what we can to reach out, especially the harder to reach, the older population, to help to explain to them the importance of vaccination.",3,420,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00420
2021-05-11-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"I do house visits myself, before the recent tightening of the measures. I bring along my grassroots leaders to see whether we can persuade the individuals, the seniors at home, to sign up and we help them sign up on the spot because many of them are waiting for their children, and their children will be very busy and unable to help them. So, we tried our best to reach out to them and make it easy for them to sign up. We also organise activities on the ground; to invite the seniors to come down, explain to them why vaccination is important and to also help set up a station to help them sign up on the spot.",4,421,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00421
2021-05-11-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"I think there are quite a few things that we can do and we can have our own way of reaching out to the seniors, to see how we can further promote vaccination among them. Again, it is also important to stamp out false information, misinformation and rumours that may stop them or discourage them from getting vaccinated. So, I would encourage all of us to verify our message that we have received before we virtually just forward them to all our friends. Please verify them. If they are not true, please do not forward them.",5,422,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00422

2021-05-11-T-014,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to thank both Ministers for the updates and the tremendous efforts put in by everyone to safeguard life and livelihoods for Singaporeans during this difficult time. One clarification is that with the resurgence of the community cases happening just a few months after our Phase Three re-opening from end of December last year, and with the roll-out of vaccination, what is the learning? And how might we plan our re-opening differently this round, after the current tightening measures, ending May, especially with the June school holidays coming up? Should we be prepared for the measures to maybe last for a longer period?",1,424,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00424
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, as I think we have highlighted and shared, there is no place for complacency. Assuming we are able to curb the current community cases, bring things back under control, yes, I think there is a chance we will be able to then get back on track with our re-opening plans. But really, even if we were to be able to do that, there is no place for complacency in our community.",1,425,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00425
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We all still need to realise, whatever we do on our borders as you heard just now, even for places that have been very, very tight – China Australia, Taiwan – cases leak through. Leaks will happen. Even in our community, it is not likely that we have ever throughout this whole period been able to eradicate the virus. There has always been a low level of circulation.",2,426,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00426
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, even if we can get today's outbreak under control and we start resuming more activities, there is no place for complacency. We must remain alert, vigilant and uphold all the necessary safe management measures.",3,427,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00427
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Second, vaccinations, as I have said, is an important game changer. Today, you have heard where we are now, we are making good progress. By May, June, July, we will continue to scale up and get more of our population vaccinated. The more we do so, for example, once we cross 50% of the population getting vaccinated, all the models and all the studies suggest that then, even if a cluster were to happen, the number of people infected will not be as large. It would be more contained and we will be safer.",4,428,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00428
2021-05-11-T-014,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, if we stay alert, stay vigilant, uphold all the prevailing safe management measures, continue to press forward with our vaccination programme, then I think there is a good chance we can remain on track with our re-opening plans.",5,429,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00429

2021-05-11-T-014,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. First, a quick response to Minister for Home Affairs on his short statement. Yesterday, the Head of the Workers' Party media team, Mr Leon Perera, put out this Facebook post, this is 13 hours ago  ""It is important that as a society, we each do our part to help make sure that difficult times bring out the best and not the worst in Singapore. We should take heed of incidents like this as it is a reminder of the part we all play to deny acceptability to acts of hate such as this appears to be."" This was in response to the Police announcement that it was investigating a man accused of using a racial slur and kicking a 55-year-old woman. Insofar as the Minister for Home Affair's statement is concerned, indeed, we are in agreement. There is no place for racism in Singapore – no ""ifs"", no ""buts"".",1,431,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00431
2021-05-11-T-014,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),I have two supplementary questions with regard to the Statement by the Minister for Health.,2,432,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00432
2021-05-11-T-014,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The first pertains to the HSA safety update that was recently released. It covered the suspected adverse event reports and I think this is a very important document released by MOH, because there is significant misinformation fuelled by not just misinformation alone, but different understanding of the safety of the vaccine. So, it is not necessarily misinformation, but genuine concerns that people may have. As usual, when you are concerned, you tend to be more animated and this can take on a life of its own. So, my request to the Minister is to consider whether this very useful document can be made into an infographic for easy sharing amongst members of the public, particularly the last 20% to 25 % that Minister said is hard to get through to with regard to the messaging on vaccination. The Workers' Party Members of Parliament have been doing their part to encourage older Singaporeans, in particular, to get vaccinated.",3,433,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00433
2021-05-11-T-014,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"My second question is, again, to the Minister for Health. This pertains to the cluster at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. We have some residents – as I am sure Members in this House also have – who are in Tan Tock Seng Hospital because of some terminal illness or who are very ill. And the cluster at Tan Tock Seng Hospital has resulted in the visitation hours for family members of some of these patients to be severely curtailed. I am requesting the Ministry to consider whether there could be some regime to help these family members to have a bit more face time with their ill or terminally-ill family members.",4,434,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00434
2021-05-11-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Sir, the answer to both questions is yes. We will try to make our report as easy to understand as possible. Maybe we will rely on ""Mr Phua Chu Kang"" to help us convey some of these messages. I believe some of you have seen the recent video that we have put out, which has been very effective in communicating some of these messages. We will see how we can make it simpler, easier to understand and to also avoid misunderstandings and rumours.",1,435,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00435
2021-05-11-T-014,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Secondly, on the visitation to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, I think the Member would understand why we need to tighten our visitation rules because we do want to prevent any infection that is in the hospital from spreading to the community and also to prevent visitors bringing in new infection to the hospital that will complicate the management process at the moment. But we do understand that there are family members who want to visit their elderly, their frail loved ones, particularly those who are terminally ill. They want to spend time with them and the hospital will make exceptions. And if you do come across any of these cases, you can either appeal to the hospital or to me. We will make adjustments and we will make allowance for them to visit as much as possible, but to also take into account the various precautionary measures that have to be put in place.",2,436,2021-05-11-T-014-S-00436

As PABs are allowed on both public paths and roads, it is only logical that we need to require PAB riders to pass a theory test before they can ride on roads. Clause 15 gives effect to this.

2021-05-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Over the years, TP has done exemplary work and, with its partners and the cooperation of the public, brought down road traffic fatalities significantly.

It is clear that there has been a downward trend over the past 10 years, even discounting last year where there was a circuit breaker imposed.",2,486,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00486

2021-05-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"It is clear that legislation must not be the only policy instrument to protect our most vulnerable on the roads.

2021-05-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I start, however, by highlighting an area involving road safety that the Bill does not cover. In August 2018, I spoke in Parliament about the need to hold vehicle owners and operators of vehicles involved in fatal accidents owing to mechanical failure liable – and criminally liable – for these accidents. This liability must be commensurate with the weight of consequences – I had highlighted specific cases where death was caused because of poorly maintained vehicles.",5,489,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00489
2021-05-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I also articulated the need for legislation to cover the area. The Road Traffic Act focuses on driver conduct. The Workplace Safety and Health Act focuses on vehicular accidents causing injuries to the employer's own workers. Neither applies to accidents that caused injury or death to third parties, owing to mechanical failure.",6,490,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00490
2021-05-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"We might argue, as the hon Senior Minister of State who replied to me then did, that we may rely on the Penal Code which makes it a crime for a person, who, through his rash or negligent act, causes death. The same provisions may make corporations liable too. The problem, however, is that this is a general provision and a blunt instrument when it comes to a vehicle owner or operator in charge of maintenance.",7,491,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00491
2021-05-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"What is needed is a specific provision that makes it clear that a vehicle owner is liable so long as the lack of maintenance played a contributory factor, it is not necessary that it plays an effective factor, which is the Penal Code's requirement. What I am arguing for, therefore, is a lower threshold on which liability can be proven. I also pointed out that it would be easy for a corporation to escape liability because of the absence of a provision in law to impute liability to corporations as a result of a default on the part of its employees for not maintaining the vehicles.",8,492,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00492
2021-05-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Just earlier this year, I asked the hon Minister for Transport what is the average number of vehicles that caught fire per year in the last five years owing to mechanical failure. The hon Minister informed that there are 200 vehicular fires per year but for the majority of the fire incidents, it would be difficult to pinpoint the cause of the fire. Notwithstanding that, I think it is safe to assume that a significant percentage of these fires are caused by poorly maintained vehicles.",9,493,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00493
2021-05-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I am not alone. SCDF thinks so as well. Its officers carry the buck of extinguishing such fires on roads and putting their own lives at risk and I think we should listen to them. In its own advisories, it states as follows  (a) most vehicle fires in Singapore occurred while the vehicles are travelling on the road; (b) the primary cause of these fires is due to ignition sources, such as overheating and electrical faults within the engine compartment. SCDF also highlighted the need to service the vehicles regularly at authorised vehicle workshops to prevent vehicles from catching fire.",10,494,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00494
2021-05-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),It is time to make vehicle owners criminally responsible for fatalities and injuries arising from accidents caused by their poorly maintained vehicles. It is also time for vehicle owners and workshop owners to be criminally liable if they have made illegal modifications to vehicles that are involved in accidents causing fatalities and injuries where these modifications played a contributing factor to the accidents. I believe this is the point that hon Member Mr Derrick Goh would expand on in his own speech.,11,495,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00495
2021-05-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"With that, let me come to the Bill proper. I have three points to make.",12,496,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00496
2021-05-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"First, on the point about ensuring pillion riders wear safety helmets, I obviously support that. The issue I seek clarification on is the age of pillion riders. Under paragraph 36 of Road Traffic Rules, it is stipulated that no person riding a motorcycle or scooter on a road shall carry any child below 10 years of age. In comparison, pillion riders on PABs must be at least 16 years old. Why is there a difference in age? This affects the viability of parents escorting their children with PABs, especially school children in Primary schools. I would have thought that, if anything, it would be the other way around because the motorcyclist is likely to be travelling faster than a PAB rider.",13,497,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00497
2021-05-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Second, vehicle forfeiture in situations where the motorists engage in speed trials. I support the stiffening of penalties for illegal speed trials. They put other motorists and road users to great danger. My question concerns the proposed section 117(7) of the Road Traffic Act which makes the vehicle forfeiture regime non-mandatory where such vehicles are used for speed trials.",14,498,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00498
2021-05-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"It is stated in the provision that the Court ""need not"" make an order for forfeiture where the person who committed the offence is not the owner of the vehicle and he used it without the consent of the owner. How about a situation where the owner did not know that his vehicle was being used by the offender but he was wilfully blind? In other words, he suspected, he could have asked but he did not. However, he did not specifically know that his vehicle was used by the offender. I would be grateful for a clarification on the policy reason for the proposed change, as I understand the original reason for imposing mandatory forfeiture is to deprive would-be offenders from easily accessing vehicles for commission of offences.",15,499,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00499
2021-05-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Third and finally, I come to the definition of a ""responsible officer"" under the proposed section 81 of the Road Traffic Act that the hon Minister of State outlined. Under the proposed section 81, where the owner of the vehicle is a company, a partnership or an unincorporated body, it is the owner's responsibility to keep a proper record of the vehicle's usage and the persons driving the vehicle. So far so good.",16,500,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00500
2021-05-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In the proposed amendments, it is also provided that the owner should designate at least one of the responsible officers to ensure that a proper record is kept – it is a personal responsibility. The personal responsibility is reposed on the chairperson, managing director or the company secretary of a company or positions analogous to any of these offices.",17,501,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00501
2021-05-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"As the hon Minister of State mentioned, failure to do so attracts liability, criminal liability. With respect, this seems rather draconian. What is the rationale of making the chairperson, managing director or company secretary personally responsible for maintaining a proper record of a vehicle usage? Would it not be sufficient to require that the board appoint an employee to be a responsible person? Is it possible to write in a provision to state that the responsibilities on these senior officers are discharged, once such an appointment is made?",18,502,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00502
2021-05-11-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Mr Speaker, Sir, today, when our movements are curbed because of the COVID-19 safe management measures, we better appreciate the true value of easy mobility. Safety, respect for all users and a thoughtful, fair approach must govern the use of our roads. This Bill gives us the promise of a step in the right direction. It solves some legal issues, but the need for public education, improving the safety culture and deepening the respect amongst road users – all those remain work-in-progress.

2021-05-11-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, in recent months, several of my residents have been killed or maimed as a result of irresponsible driving by others. These tragic accidents could have been easily avoided. I thus agree with the overall rationale underlying this Bill to enhance safety on our roads, as well as to strengthen security on our public transport. That said, I have some queries and concerns about the provisions relating to illegal car racing, giving of false information to Police and the expanded powers of search on bus and train commuters.",1,504,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00504
2021-05-11-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, illegal car racing. Clause 22 of this Bill will increase the penalties for the offence of conducting illegal competitions or trials of speed involving vehicles, in short, racing. Earlier, the Minister of State for Home Affairs highlighted that there has been an increased incidence of such offences.",2,505,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00505
2021-05-11-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"In recent months, the public focus has been on the fatal crash at Tanjong Pagar that claimed five young lives. Based on questions from other Members of this House, illegal car races may be taking place in our neighbourhoods. Anecdotally, I have also received significant feedback from residents about vehicles racing at high speeds within Aljunied GRC – such as along Tampines Road, the Upper Serangoon Road Viaduct and Lorong Ah Soo – several times a week. I have been liaising with TP and LTA for several months over such threats to public safety.",3,506,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00506
2021-05-11-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"This Bill proposes to significantly increase the punishment for the offence of illegal racing, by doubling the maximum imprisonment and more than doubling the maximum fines. While such an enhanced punishment will send a stronger deterrent signal to would-be offenders, I believe that those seeking such thrills will still try their luck, unless there is greater certainty of being caught.",4,507,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00507
2021-05-11-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Earlier, the Minister of State mentioned that there are currently about 300 cameras nationwide to detect such offences.

2021-05-11-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, giving of false information. Clause 20 of the Bill proposes to change the law regarding the offence of giving false information to Police about the identity of the driver who committed an offence. We are aware of such cases where a vehicle owner falsely tells Police that another person was driving the vehicle in order that the owner escape punishment for a traffic offence.",6,509,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00509
2021-05-11-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I agree with the proposed section 81(3A) which will make it an explicit offence for that other person to pretend or falsely represent that he was the driver. He, too, will be liable for possible imprisonment. Hopefully, this will make it more difficult for vehicle owners to find fall guys to take the rap and thereby pervert the course of justice.",7,510,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00510
2021-05-11-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Clause 20 also proposes to increase the punishment for this offence, in particular, the maximum fine. It is now proposed to raise the maximum fine to $10,000. I note that just four years ago, the maximum fine had been raised from $1,000 to $5,000, a five-fold increase. Now, it is being doubled. Could the Ministry clarify why there is a need to do so? And, in particular, is there any indication that drivers are not deterred by the current levels of fines?",8,511,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00511
2021-05-11-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Finally, searches of bus and train passengers. Clauses 24 and 31 of the Bill provide for security screening of passengers upon entry into buses, bus interchanges, and trains and premises of the MRT and LRT. Although powers of search already exist in the Road Traffic Act and Rapid Transit Systems Act, these powers covered only passengers’ belongings but not searches of the passengers themselves. This Bill will expand these powers to cover frisk searches of passengers.",9,512,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00512

2021-05-11-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, I do not expect the power to do frisk searches to be widely used and I hope I am not wrong. Nevertheless, I have a particular concern about these provisions.",11,514,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00514
2021-05-11-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),The term “frisk search” is defined in the Bill as “a search of an individual by quickly running the hands over the individual’s outer clothing”. Frisk searches thus involve physical contact with the person being searched. My main concern revolves around the persons empowered to conduct frisk searches.,12,515,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00515
2021-05-11-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"To explain the basis of my concern, allow me to briefly describe the various actors in our security landscape. In our security eco-system, we have SPF officers, Auxiliary Police, unarmed security and other lay enforcement personnel. The levels of training of these groups are vastly different. Compulsory training of SPF officers requires six to nine months of residential training, while Auxiliary Police do residential training of eight to nine weeks or less than three months. Unarmed security training can be completed in about a week or two. I assume outsourced enforcement officers also undergo less intensive training.",13,516,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00516
2021-05-11-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, the nature of deployments for these different actors has typically been deliberately calibrated with these differences in mind. Those with less training typically handle more routine tasks, such as controlling entry to premises, guarding installations or manning security equipment. On the other hand, the SPF officers are expected to handle trickier situations involving the exercise of judgement and discretion and working with the community.",14,517,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00517
2021-05-11-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Of course, over the years, there has been some convergence and overlap, as the training of APOs and unarmed security has been enhanced to enable them to perform more tasks than before. But the need to draw a line is still solid and sound.",15,518,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00518
2021-05-11-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The Bill proposes that frisk searches may be conducted by Police officers and those defined as “senior approved persons”. “Senior approved persons” are, in turn, defined to include members of the Auxiliary Police, security officers engaged by the public transport operator, and outsourced enforcement officers. It is not clear to me that there is any requirement of seniority in the categories mentioned, so the term “senior approved persons” may, in fact, be a misnomer.",16,519,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00519
2021-05-11-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"More importantly, is enabling non-SPF actors to conduct frisk searches by force appropriate? For comparison, let us look at another piece of legislation. In the Public Order Act, Part III on Special Events Security reserves the power to search persons entering a special event area to SPF officers only; others, such as Auxiliary Police and private security are empowered to do less-intrusive forms of security checks, such as checking bags and manning scanners. This sensible demarcation is a recognition that a bodily search is an intimate security check which should only be performed by highly-trained persons. This Bill today marks a departure from that approach.",17,520,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00520
2021-05-11-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Concerns, naturally, arise. Are Auxiliary Police, security officers and the outsourced enforcement officers suitable to perform frisk searches? Do they have the requisite training, not only on how to perform the physical act of search, but also how to handle any confrontations that may arise? Another concern would be about searches on female commuters. Where are the precautions on how searches on women should be conducted, in order to have strict regard to decency?",18,521,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00521
2021-05-11-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Finally, the Bill provides that it is an offence for commuters not to comply with any request or order of a Police officer or approved person, on pain of punishment of a fine of up to $1,000. Since commuters have to comply, it is only reasonable that officers be easily identifiable. Clauses 24 and 31 provide that a Police officer in plainclothes or an approved person must declare his office to the person before he or she is required to comply. The only category of officers who are required to produce identification cards to the public are outsourced enforcement officers.",19,522,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00522
2021-05-11-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"May I ask why is it not provided that all Police officers and approved persons must show their warrant cards or identification cards if asked by the public? This Bill seems to be a lowering of the standards set by the Road Traffic Act itself, as section 128 of the Act currently requires Police officers not in uniform to produce their identification card to the public when asked.",20,523,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00523
2021-05-11-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"In my opinion, requiring plainclothes officers to merely declare their office is not sufficient, and cases of impersonation of Police officers happen all the time.

Nevertheless, it is important that the provisions are coupled with strong capacities to detect offences.

2021-05-11-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I have three points of clarification on the Bill.,2,528,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00528
2021-05-11-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My first point is about the language for the theory tests for riders of Personal Mobility Devices (PMDs) and Power-assisted Bicycles (PABs).,3,529,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00529
2021-05-11-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I commend the Ministry’s amendment to improve road safety by ensuring that PMD and PAB riders are well-equipped with a basic knowledge of the roads, just as all other vehicle riders already are.",4,530,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00530
2021-05-11-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"LTA’s website states that the handbooks for the tests are currently available in English and will, subsequently, be translated into Chinese, Malay and Tamil. Can the Ministry share if the notices to inform existing riders of the need to take these tests will also be delivered in multiple languages, so that non-English speaking riders will be fully aware of this development and not be blindsided because of a language barrier? Can the Minister of State also share if the test itself will be available in Chinese, Malay and Tamil?",5,531,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00531
2021-05-11-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My second point is on the cost of theory tests for PMD and PAB riders. As we can see on the roads, a sizeable number of our PMB and PAB riders are food delivery riders who work tirelessly to make ends meet. The test fees may be an additional cost and source of stress for them. Can the Minister share if the test fees will be kept low or whether the Ministry has plans to subsidise test fees for PMD and PAB riders who fall below a certain income bracket, to ensure that this test does not pose an additional burden on them?",6,532,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00532
2021-05-11-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My third point is on the authorities’ power to conduct security checks on public transport. The new section 127B provides a uniformed officer and authorised employees the power to conduct frisk searches. Such authorised employees, such as the bus operator, bus interchange operator, a security officer or an outsourced enforcement officer.",7,533,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00533
2021-05-11-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The new section 83 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) provides that women who are searched by a Police officer or ICA officer must be searched by a female officer, unless certain exceptions apply.",8,534,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00534
2021-05-11-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"While maintaining the security of our public transport systems is vital, I believe it is equally important to maintain a sense of dignity for all women undergoing searches, which the new section 83 of the CPC addresses. Can the Minister of State clarify if a similar limitation applies to frisk searches under this Bill?",9,535,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00535
2021-05-11-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"On this note, can the Ministry also commit to ensuring all relevant persons who may be considered an “approved person” under this amendment undergo the necessary training so that we can prevent instances where frisk searches are conducted erroneously? Notwithstanding these clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill.",10,536,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00536

2021-05-11-T-015,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. The Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill is introducing, among other things, the requirement of a competency test certificate for a rider to ride only a road-only power-assisted bicycle (PAB). Sir, I think it is reasonable to require all users of our busy roads to have a basic working knowledge of the rules of the road and the driving or riding etiquette vis-à-vis other road users, including pedestrians, motorists, PAB users and cyclists. This is important for the safety of other road users as well as law and order. After all, for our roads to be safe, the predictability of the behaviour of all road users must be there, at least to a large extent, barring a small number of errant users which should then be subject to the penalties of our laws.",1,538,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00538
2021-05-11-T-015,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),Some people have cited the cost of requiring certification as a cause of concern. I hope that the Government will ensure that the certification course and associated course fees are kept low at all times and that those who cannot afford the fees can receive financial assistance for these fees so that they are still able to use such forms of transport and that there should not be too regular renewals.,2,539,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00539
2021-05-11-T-015,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"The behaviour of many PAB users and, indeed, cyclists on the road seemed to imply that many riders either do not know the law or choose to disregard the law, for example, riders beating red lights or riding against traffic.",3,540,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00540
2021-05-11-T-015,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I also read from recent media reports that the Government has asked the Active Mobility Advisory Panel to study whether to require registration of bicycles or licensing of cyclists, including considering the possibility of requiring cyclists to take a theory test if they wish to ride on the roads.",4,541,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00541
2021-05-11-T-015,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"At first glance, this may not be a bad idea though it will not be popular with some riders. I would urge the Panel and the Government, in considering whether to have such requirements for cyclists or bicycles, to consider the regularity of breaches of Road Traffic and Active Mobility Rules by cyclists. Ask ourselves whether we see such acts on an almost everyday or regular basis  beating red lights, cycling against traffic, cycling without helmets when on roads, not keeping on the left lane. And how many of us cyclists actually know that it is, for example, illegal to cycle on the right side of a motor vehicle when not overtaking or planning to make a turn to the right?",5,542,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00542
2021-05-11-T-015,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"We see frequent social media postings on some of these acts and even a small number of cyclists challenging riders or pedestrians when they were reminded. When there is consistent taking of liberties by cyclists, this factor should be taken into consideration for it reflects prevailing riding culture, the lack of respect for the law and consideration for other road or footpath users, not to mention the occasional road rage, in turn, tarnishes what many other road users think generally of cyclists and will breed a lack of respect for cyclists. It does not help us cyclists in getting more respect and space from motorists on the road and even from pedestrians.",6,543,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00543
2021-05-11-T-015,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I first brought up the issue of riding culture in my speech at the debate of the Active Mobility Bill in early 2017. I said that despite riding in East Coast Park since I was young, I had in later years avoided cycling there because it has become unsafe. I said that cyclists do not always obey the directional signs or keep a proper lookout for pedestrians or other cyclists. Many pedestrians walk on or across the cycling path without caring for the safety of cyclists. Many cyclists cycle on the footpath. And I said that I have seen accidents in the park over the years, accidents that can be avoided if we had the right cycling culture. And I also said that the cycling culture in East Coast Park reflects the cycling culture nationally. I also said that, to improve our cycling culture, the Government must have the political will to do so.",7,544,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00544
2021-05-11-T-015,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"I then reflected that around 10 years before that, I remember there was at one time a flurry of complaints in the newspapers about non-enforcement against errant cyclists, cyclists cycling on the wrong side of the road or beating red lights were already common occurrences then. I remember once the authorities replied to say that they had inadequate resources to address the problem. I said in my speech then that we missed a great opportunity to solve the problem back then in the mid-2000s. In those days, the only people who seemed to have broken the law were elderly cyclists. But after that, there was a huge influx of foreign workers and this meant a huge increase in the number of people using bicycles and many also followed the cycling culture, ignored the road safety rules because of lax enforcement. And then from the late-2000s, with the increase in white collar foreign labour, we also saw many taking recreational road cycling at the same time as many Singaporeans did. This was before e-bikes and e-scooters became popular.",8,545,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00545
2021-05-11-T-015,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Mr Speaker, Sir, regrettably, previous Governments had, over the years, failed to invest sufficiently to improve on our riding culture. So, do we now think that we need to improve our riding culture or do we think it is merely only a small number of cyclists who flout the law and that we do not need to improve our riding culture?",9,546,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00546
2021-05-11-T-015,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"May I suggest that we should do more now? The number of recreational cyclists and e-bikes has continued to increase. The Government is building the much talked about extended cycling network. In recent times, the Government has also talked about looking at having more dedicated cycling lanes, which are non-shared footpaths, and are looking at cycling lanes on selected roads. But having more cycling lanes will not remove any existing cultural baggage. Riders, when left alone in such lanes, still need to be considerate, keep left, use the correct lights at night – which, by the way, many cyclists are not doing and there is inadequate enforcement.",10,547,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00547
2021-05-11-T-015,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Many people are still not happy with sharing the use of footpaths with cyclists; and in my view, this stems from the issues of riding culture too. I have spoken on this previously.",11,548,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00548
2021-05-11-T-015,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"In recent years, the Government has had to deal with usage problems with our e-bikes and e-scooters, primarily stemming from a poor riding culture. It has been told to me in Parliament previously that the extended cycling network will not connect to the HDB blocks directly and there will still be a connection via footpaths. So, how do we ensure that PMD and PAB users will always dismount consistently and take a walk through the HDB block they are heading towards?",12,549,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00549
2021-05-11-T-015,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"This is part of the problem leading to their ban from footpaths eventually. Sir, I am of the view that having a competency certificate or requiring bicycle, PAB or PMD licensing alone will not improve the situation, unless our riding culture improves. This, I think, is probably the most important and, arguably, the hardest objective we need to achieve.",13,550,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00550
2021-05-11-T-015,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"In my speech for the Active Mobility Bill debate in 2017 and on numerous subsequent occasions in Parliament over the past few years, I have harped on the need to work on having consistent enforcement and adequate public education in order to improve our riding culture, whether for e-scooters, e-bikes or bicycles. This remains true till today.",14,551,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00551
2021-05-11-T-015,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"I have cited my speech from more than four years ago just to highlight for today's debate that the issue with riding culture has been a tenuous one for a long time due to years of inadequate action in the past. Perhaps in the last four years, the Government has been too busy dealing with e-scooters after the Active Mobility Bill was passed, but I hope that the Government will address the riding culture once and for all for all groups.",15,552,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00552
2021-05-11-T-015,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"As I have said on numerous occasions previously, consistent enforcement must go beyond occasional or even weekly spot-checks in selected spots and public education must go beyond just safe riding courses or online publicity to educate those who do not solicit the information by themselves. This is the thrust of the written Parliamentary Question I have filed for today. If people are used to riding in a certain way for years and they do not bother to find out about LTA's safe riding courses or go to the LTA's Facebook to watch their videos on these topics, how do you get the message to these people? How do you tell them to stop beating red lights and cycling against the traffic, and to get a helmet or use bicycle lights?",16,553,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00553

2021-05-11-T-015,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"If this is considered to be too difficult, we should not be surprised, as we did not do it earlier when we had fewer categories of cyclists and with less busy roads, no busy connector or footpath networks used by different types of users. It will boil down to political will. And we should not be half-hearted about this if we have invested huge resources for cycling in our extended cycling network and have nice plans for cycling lanes elsewhere, if we intend to take cycling and other forms of active mobility seriously, and if we still believe in active mobility for last-mile connectivity. If the LTA still harbours any wish for e-scooters to make a return as a choice transport for last-mile connectivity, we had better get our riding culture right, right now.",18,555,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00555

It is simply impossible for our buses to overtake cyclists safely without infringing into the next lane. During bus lane operational hours, where there is peak hour traffic and where more buses are deployed, overtaking is both difficult and dangerous.

That has been more than 10 years ago. I am glad that Senior Minister of State has indicated that the Ministry would review the issue again together with the tripartite partners and factor in new advancement in vehicle manufacturing and seat belt technology.",22,578,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00578
2021-05-11-T-015,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"We also need to review the speed limit when passengers are on board goods vehicles.

Since 2018, LTA has offered the Safe Riding Programme (SRP). This is a voluntary education programme that is free-of-charge with both theory and practical components for all active mobility device users, including cyclists.

We formed the Active Mobility Advisory Panel in July 2015, more than five years ago.

2021-05-11-T-015,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"First, relating to certification and licensing. A major focus of the Bill is the licensing and certification of riders of “test-needed-to-ride-on-road vehicles”. These are power-assisted bicycles (PABs) that are prescribed by the rules under the Active Mobility Act 2017, and the new rules require that riders of such vehicles be certified to have passed a prescribed test of competence for that class or description of vehicle and the test of competence will cover riding on public paths and roads.",2,619,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00619

2021-05-11-T-015,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),I would like to raise a point of concern that I had in relation to the introduction of licensing.

All of us in this House have residents who rely on these test-needed-to-ride-on-road vehicles for their livelihoods.

Despite many pointing out the danger and unsustainable nature of our approach of importing cheap labour in sectors, such as the construction and marine industries, not much has been done by enterprises to shift away from this model towards a more productive, less labour-intensive model. While this is a topic for another day, it would naturally flow that any increased costs by more stringent transport safety standards would have less of an impact if we are not so reliant on employing a large force of cheap, low-skilled workers in our building sector.",17,634,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00634

This is actually a non-starter, as the statistics quoted include the number of injuries for all road users, and crucially include motorcycles, which have a higher casualty rate.

Because of these concerns, could we not directly build safeguards into the relevant provisions? For example, in view of the expansion of powers to include frisk searching, we could, as earlier suggested, mandate that only female authorised persons are allowed to frisk search other women.

2021-05-11-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"On the other hand, the concept of duty of care in common law already requires a driver and, indeed, all road users, to adhere to a reasonable standard of care when using the roads.

2021-05-11-T-015,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"While the Government embarks on projects to improve our infrastructure for cyclists, I hope that the Ministry can also factor in the needs of cyclists who are persons with disabilities to ensure that infrastructure in the pipeline is inclusive.",6,698,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00698
2021-05-11-T-015,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"For persons with disabilities, cycling is often a much easier way to get around than walking and it is estimated that about 40% of disabled cyclists use regular two-wheeled bicycles. Thus, while their disabilities may be invisible to some, research has shown that people with disabilities have a disproportionately higher need for protected cycling infrastructure and direct routes.",7,699,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00699
2021-05-11-T-015,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Obstacles, uneven surfaces and gradients could potentially cause discomfort to disabled cyclists or inadvertently exclude them from using the cycling paths as they may not be able to lift or push their bicycles.

2021-05-11-T-015,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"My first query relates to the training which will be provided to ""approved persons"", especially for those who are not Police officers or employees of an Auxiliary Police Force. Could the Minister share more about the training which approved persons will receive before they are authorised to frisk search commuters, if any? More specifically, does the Ministry intend to provide training and introduce guidelines to ensure the appropriateness and proportionality of action taken in relation to the assessed threat level? This could help prevent cases of abuse of authority, which include excessive behaviour, harassment or even sexual assault.",10,702,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00702
2021-05-11-T-015,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Additionally, how would the Ministry minimise the profiling of minorities and marginalised persons which may inadvertently arise in the process of identifying commuters to undergo additional security screening? Such profiling might amount to over-policing and could potentially be damaging to our social fabric. Perhaps the Ministry may consider publishing statistics pertaining to all frisk searches, including information on searches by gender, ethnicity, time, location and also justification.",11,703,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00703
2021-05-11-T-015,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"The second query I have relates to public awareness and education. Given that security checks can be conducted by Police officers who are not in uniform, as well as approved persons authorised by LTA in writing, how would commuters be assured that officers who are conducting these security checks are legitimate? How would commuters know if officers are behaving in an appropriate manner? Does the Ministry intend to provide avenues for commuters to seek recourse and remedies should they encounter inappropriate actions taken by these officers?",12,704,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00704
2021-05-11-T-015,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"On top of introducing safeguards to minimise the occurrence of such incidents, I hope that the Ministry will also consider conducting public education campaigns so that commuters can be aware of their rights with regard to security screening and frisk searches proposed by this Bill.",13,705,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00705
2021-05-11-T-015,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Mr Speaker, as we seek to expand the search and seizure powers beyond law enforcement officers, we should also ensure that proper and comprehensive training is provided to authorised personnel while ensuring that commuters are aware of the extent of these measures that they can be reasonably subjected to. This would help maintain trust in law enforcement while allowing us to remain vigilant against potential threats to our public transport system.",14,706,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00706
2021-05-11-T-015,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the implementation of a theory test for riders of power-assisted bicycles (PABs). This will help boost safety for the riders and other users on the roads. PABs are commonly used by delivery staff and it is not easy for them to make ends meet in this difficult economic climate. I am thus very concerned about the affordability of the tests and would propose that it be set at an affordable level. I would also urge companies who engage these essential workers to pay for the costs of the tests on their behalf.",1,707,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00707
2021-05-11-T-015,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"Next, it will be a new offence for motorcyclists to carry pillion riders who are not wearing helmets. In addition, there are dangers posed by helmets which do not meet regulatory requirements or are of unsuitable sizes. I have seen children pillion riders wearing helmets which are too big for them. How will the Ministry ensure that motorcyclists provide their pillion riders with the correct type of helmets? Will there be more public education programmes to highlight the importance of wearing right-sized helmets?",2,708,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00708

While I support this measure to ward off potential security attacks, I have concerns about imposters taking advantage of passengers. As the Bill had stated, these personnel may or may not be in uniform, so it is really not easy for commuters to tell if they are genuine. Molesters or pickpockets may pretend to conduct frisk searches. Would the Minister share what measures are in place to reduce the likelihood of this happening?",4,710,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00710

2021-05-11-T-015,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. From 2018 to 2020, a total of 31 people have been arrested over four cases of illegal street racing. During the circuit breaker period, we have seen videos of an illegal street race along KPE where six men and two women were eventually arrested. In a separate incident, also during the circuit breaker period, 57 motorists in 50 vehicles were investigated for taking part in an illegal car race in Tuas. The roads of Lim Chu Kang, Seletar, Tuas have been observed at times to be used for drag competition, with multiple cars gathering at these locations to watch the race. And how can we forget the shocking deaths of five young men earlier this year after they sped through Tanjong Pagar?",1,719,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00719
2021-05-11-T-015,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"These illegal racers not only put themselves at serious risk of harm, but also expose other road users and innocent bystanders to these risks. While I understand that some people are passionate about cars, these racing-related activities do not have a place on our public roads. We have been lucky thus far that no innocent bystanders have been hurt, which makes it even more important for us to act now to ensure that our roads remain safe for everyone who use them.",2,720,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00720
2021-05-11-T-015,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Hence, to keep our roads safe, I am in support of the increased penalties for racing and speed trials. In addition, to ensure that the right punishment is meted out to the right individual, I am also in support of the stiffer penalties for individuals who mislead the Traffic Police in their investigations.",3,721,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00721
2021-05-11-T-015,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Additionally, I am in support of disqualifying motorists for road rage. However, I would like to seek some clarification on this matter. What if the accused was a cyclist exhibiting road rage to a motorist? How do we ensure the consequence to cyclists and motorists can be equally meted out as we have seen videos of cyclists verbally abusing and punching motorists on several occasions already?",4,722,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00722
2021-05-11-T-015,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),I support the penalisation of motorists who fail to ensure their pillion wears an approved helmet and the introduction of stiffer penalties for those selling poor quality non-approved helmets. I think that this legislation would provide a good baseline safety standard for helmets that should be used on our roads and improve the overall safety of our motorcyclists and their pillions.,5,723,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00723
2021-05-11-T-015,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),I would also like to seek clarification on the penalising of motorcyclists who fail to ensure their pillion wears an approved helmet as well as the stiffer penalties for those selling non-approved helmets.,6,724,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00724
2021-05-11-T-015,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I appreciate and understand the intent in ensuring that helmets pass certain safety standards so that they can protect both rider and pillion. In Singapore, the standards follow the TUV SUD PSB Standard. It involves one-drop test on the front, back and side of the helmet, a penetration test using a sharp object falling on the helmet and a chin strap test using a weight pulling on the strap. These tests are conducted in batches, meaning dealers have to put about 1% to 4% of each batch of helmets that they bring in, that they import in, through these destructive tests.",7,725,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00725
2021-05-11-T-015,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"According to the Singapore Motor Cycle Trade Association (SMCTA), the price of testing open face helmets is S$1,283 for a minimum of four pieces, with the next five pieces costing S$194 each. There is also an additional stamp duty of S$110. The high price, compulsory batch destructive testing and the small market make helmet testing an economical burden to both the dealers and the riders. The dealers will have to then pass on this cost to the riders and this may be a deterrent to the riders, especially if we have riders from the lower income group. Hence, while we seek to ensure better safety standards for more of our motorcyclists and their pillions, the economics of testing may hinder the intent of the legislation.",8,726,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00726
2021-05-11-T-015,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Given Singapore's small motorbike market compared to the world, by requiring an additional destructive test on an already small batch of helmets increases the helmet price prohibitively and may act as a deterrent for motorcyclists to get the good helmets that can keep them safe.",9,727,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00727
2021-05-11-T-015,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"One way we can overcome this is if we can consider accepting other standards that are internationally accepted. Renowned bike helmet manufacturers like Shoei and Arai that are declared safe for MotoGP use, the ""Formula 1"" of motor racing, usually come with the ECE or SNELL standards. ECE refers to the Economic Commission for Europe safety standard, which is used by more than 50 countries, including Europe, and recognised by international racing bodies. World safety standards for helmets also include the US Department of Transportation (DOT) and SNELL standards.",10,728,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00728
2021-05-11-T-015,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"We must also consider motorcyclists who have already purchased such high-end helmets with internationally-accredited standards but without the soon-to-be mandatory PSB certification. It would be economically costly for these motorcyclists to have to purchase yet another helmet when the present high-end helmet they have, such as those produced by Arai and Shoei, are already internationally-certified as safe.",11,729,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00729
2021-05-11-T-015,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"In addition to considering accepting ECE and SNELL standards, some other proposed solution could be conducting the destructive test once per model rather than per batch and possibly making the testing free or at a highly subsidised rate to ensure affordability and, hence, enhance the safety of riders.",12,730,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00730
2021-05-11-T-015,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"If, however, the concern was counterfeit products from these renowned manufacturers, perhaps the Ministry can consider dealers showing proof of source direct from manufacturer.",13,731,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00731
2021-05-11-T-015,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The challenge of scale in Singapore's small domestic bike market is even more evident if special helmets are required. For example, since the demand for a good kid's pillion helmet is small in Singapore, it does not make economic sense for a dealer to provide for PSB-approved kids' helmets. This may subsequently result in the child riding pillion having to wear an ill-fitting, oversized PSB-approved helmet as compared to a correct fitting helmet approved by the ECE or SNELL standards.",14,732,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00732
2021-05-11-T-015,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"This seems counter intuitive to the intent of the legislation, which is to improve the safety of our motorcyclists and their pillions. In a Facebook video created by content creator TRI333PLE for the motorcycling community, the video showed how some expensive high-end helmets with SNELL and ECE certification performed better at impact testing as compared to cheaper PSB-approved helmet. As mentioned by a few riders, Mr Imran Ayub and Mr Sultan Shaheed, they want to be given the opportunity to provide the best safety gear for themselves and their loved ones.",15,733,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00733
2021-05-11-T-015,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),Many welcome the new legislation for PABs as yet another way to keep our roads and pedestrian walkways safe.,16,734,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00734
2021-05-11-T-015,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I would like to highlight though that, especially since the circuit breaker in 2020, more and more people depend on PABs as a means to earn their income. We just have to consider the many Foodpanda and GrabFood drivers who use PABs to do their deliveries. For such cases, how soon can they sign up and go for the test such that their income will not be inadvertently affected by this new legislation? Should they fail the first-time round, how soon can they book for a subsequent test? Are we able to conduct these PAB tests using vernacular languages for those who are not as comfortable with English as a medium of instruction?",17,735,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00735
2021-05-11-T-015,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Another consideration is the cost element of such tests. How affordable will it be for people who really depend on the PABs for their livelihood? Is there a chance that we can provide subsidies, possibly via SkillsFuture, to defray the costs of these tests? While we improve the safety of our roads and pedestrian walkways, let us not put such groups that depend on the PABs for their livelihood at a disadvantage. Let us try to make it as quick and convenient as possible for them to get their certification so that they can continue using their PABs safely for their livelihood. Mr Speaker, in Malay, please.",18,736,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00736

2021-05-11-T-015,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"However, there are also helmets that are safer and conform to international standards, such as ECE and SNELL. High-end helmets, such as Shoei and Arai, often come in limited numbers to Singapore. Given the fees and destructive testing required for PSB certification, it may not be economically practical to conduct destructive testing. As such, for these branded helmets, I hope MHA can consider other internationally accepted safety standards, especially for helmets from well-known manufacturers.",21,739,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00739

However, many people, like Foodpanda and GrabFood deliverers, rely on PABs to earn a living. Can they register immediately and undergo tests as soon as possible so that their incomes will not be affected by this new law? Can we conduct these PAB tests in the vernacular languages, such as Mandarin, Malay, Hokkien and so on, especially for those who are uncomfortable using the English language?",22,740,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00740
2021-05-11-T-015,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Another consideration for the PAB test is its affordability. Can we make the PAB test more affordable for those who rely on it to earn their living? Perhaps we can provide subsidies through SkillsFuture. In our efforts to improve safety on the roads and pedestrian footpaths, let us ensure that these PAB tests are affordable and can be taken easily so that they can continue to use PABs for their jobs as soon as possible.",23,741,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00741

It is also important to enforce basic safety standards for helmets. However, I hope that the Ministry can consider approving other internationally accepted standards like ECE and SNELL so that our riders can equip themselves with safety gears that meet the international standards. With regard to the mandatory theory test for PAB riders, we need to ensure that rolling it out does not affect the livelihood of many who are now dependent on the PAB.

2021-05-11-T-015,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"The updated penalties are significant with the first offence carrying a fine of $5,000 and 12 months' imprisonment, making the monetary impact five times higher and doubling the prison sentence. Given the uptick in illegal speed trials in recent years, as mentioned by the Minister of State, it will, hopefully, deter and prevent needless loss of precious lives and damage to property, such as the devastating Tanjong Pagar car crash that happened a few months ago.",8,750,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00750
2021-05-11-T-015,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Apart from the obvious endangerment to life, illegal speed trials create other social ills that affect even more people in Singapore and, that is, noise pollution. Similar to Members of this House who have spoken on this topic before me, my residents at Nee Soon have shared that they are often woken up by the sounds of loud revving cars and motorcycles. This is due to motorists speeding from Yishun Dam to Avenue 1 in Yishun outside their homes in the wee hours of the morning. Residents are frustrated with little recourse.",9,751,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00751

Of these, 54, or over three quarters, relate to illegal modifications and this is a very high proportion. These modifications include illegally modified engines and exhaust systems which are the source of noise pollution, causing public nuisance as well as enhancing engine power settings that increase the safety risks to the driver and other road users.",10,752,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00752
2021-05-11-T-015,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"In trying to stem illegal vehicle modification, it was discussed in this House last March and the RTA was updated in 2017 to give more teeth to enforcement efforts against errant workshops to deter them from offering such services.",11,753,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00753

For example, last week, CNA reported that a workshop was charged with three counts of illegal vehicle modifications under the RTA.",12,754,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00754
2021-05-11-T-015,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Given the above, could the Minister of State consider more effective measures to be put in place to address this through better detection instead of what seems to be mainly an enforcement approach which is a cat-and-mouse game that is resource-intensive?",13,755,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00755
2021-05-11-T-015,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"If our traffic enforcement officers are able to identify illegal vehicle modifications at roadblocks in the early hours of the day, one would expect vehicle inspection centres with specialised equipment to better detect such modifications to engine as well as exhaust systems even if they are not easily visible. Additionally, the vehicle noise test could perhaps be done under more realistic conditions where a vehicle is put under load and accelerated on a rolling stock to detect the “pop and crackle” sound. I hope more thought can be given to how we may overcome these challenges through better detection and if the Minister can provide further updates on this to better protect road users as well as our community.",14,756,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00756
2021-05-11-T-015,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"On the topic of introducing a single theory test for PABs on the roads, I believe this would be helpful in ensuring that PAB users are aware of the road traffic rules and behave in a safe manner on the roads. However, I note that the theory test is envisaged to be online and the results are valid lifelong. I raise three questions for clarification on how this would be operationalised, as I am sure the public would be very interested.",15,757,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00757
2021-05-11-T-015,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"One, if the test is to be done online, whether there will be special arrangements made for those who are not tech-savvy or not as literate, such as our elderly PAB users?",16,758,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00758
2021-05-11-T-015,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Secondly, given that the tests are valid lifelong, will there be any refresher courses required for PAB users if they are involved in a traffic offence?",17,759,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00759
2021-05-11-T-015,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Thirdly, whether the test will involve a fee and, if it does, are there ways to either subsidise or waive the fee so as not to impose a burden on residents, especially those in financial difficulties?",18,760,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00760
2021-05-11-T-015,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Before I end my speech, I wish to briefly mention about the issuance of fines for offences committed under the RTA. A number of my residents who have not been able to have their traffic fines waived because of the seriousness of their offences, such as beating a red light or speeding, have often appealed to be given the option to pay the fine in instalments. I hope the Minister will consider making instalment payments more readily available so that they can pay fines without being put in a difficult financial position, which is not the objective of the RTA.",19,761,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00761

2021-05-11-T-015,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the proposed amendments to the Act, which will create new offences to deter irresponsible behaviour on our roads and help make them safer for all users.",1,763,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00763
2021-05-11-T-015,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"One of the amendments is the introduction of a mandatory theory test regime for users of PABs. I feel that this test will be very helpful. As PABs can be used on both roads and shared paths, it is prudent and necessary to ensure that the riders are thoroughly educated on safety measures, potential risks, road etiquette and regulations. They will benefit from understanding the importance of compliance, which will enhance road safety for themselves and other road users. Would the code of conduct require riders to render assistance to the other party in the event of an unfortunate accident?",2,764,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00764
2021-05-11-T-015,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"It has been announced that the test, comprising multiple-choice questions, will be conducted online. Will the theory test be conducted in languages other than English for non-English speaking applicants? Would the Ministry consider making oral tests available as well? In addition, will the Government require riders who had been caught flouting traffic regulations to go for refresher training?",3,765,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00765
2021-05-11-T-015,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"As many PABs are used by riders on delivery platforms, there is a need for these tech companies to review their reward systems, so that the riders will not be speeding to meet clients’ expectations at the expense of public safety and their own lives. The delivery charges could be based on mileages between points at a reasonable and compliant speed limit. Otherwise, tech companies could be equally liable for offences if their systems encourage excessive risk-taking at the expense of public safety.",4,766,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00766
2021-05-11-T-015,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Companies which employ riders who use active mobility devices on public paths are required to cover them with third-party liability insurance.

2021-05-11-T-015,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Lastly, enforcement will always be needed to ensure compliance and one of the ways is to utilise technology to tag the PABs. May I ask if the authorities plan to tap upon technology to enhance safety for all road users, especially to deal with reckless hit-and-run riders? With that, I conclude with my support for the Bill.",6,768,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00768
2021-05-11-T-015,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Speaker, Sir, the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill is quite a broad one that covers various and diverse areas. I would like to focus my speech primarily on power-assisted bicycles or PABs.",1,769,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00769
2021-05-11-T-015,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"In the past year, PABs have increased in number – especially as many use it as a form of transportation on public roads. This was, no doubt, driven by the increase in the demand for food delivery services, which, in turn, led to a rise in the ownership and usage of PABs as food delivery riders saw PABs as providing a quick, convenient and fairly affordable method for them to fulfil their orders.",2,770,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00770
2021-05-11-T-015,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"With this increase in numbers of PAB riders over the years, I believe it is now useful for us to review the Road Traffic Act and introduce amendments to better safeguard the well-being of PAB riders and also other commuters and users of the road.",3,771,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00771
2021-05-11-T-015,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"At present, as Minister of State Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim mentioned, PAB riders are required to pass a theory test before they can ride on cycling paths. The amendments to the Road Traffic Act introduce the need for these riders to pass a similar test before they can ride on the road. This is a much welcome move as casual observations would tell us that many PAB riders have been riding on the roads even before the introduction of such a mandatory qualifying test.",4,772,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00772
2021-05-11-T-015,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"We have seen, over the years, many fatal and near-fatal accidents involving PABs. Implementing a qualifying test that aims to inculcate road awareness, defensive riding and road use safety would certainly help to alleviate the situation if PAB riders are now going to be more aware about riding and road use etiquette.",5,773,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00773
2021-05-11-T-015,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Yet, training PAB riders, Mr Speaker, is only one part of the solution. With more PAB riders on the road, other vehicular road users must also be more aware and mindful of their presence and learn to co-share the road with them. Would there be plans to update the existing training curriculum of motorists to inculcate greater awareness in our present road users – our motorists – about the presence of this new group of road users, such as PAB riders, and even regular cyclists, who are also increasingly making their presence felt on the roads as well?",6,774,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00774
2021-05-11-T-015,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"On to my next point, Mr Speaker, Sir, and this had been surfaced by many other Members in the Chamber. I believe that the official handbook for the PAB mandatory theory test that is available on the LTA website comes only in English. Given that not all PAB riders are comfortable in English and are Internet-savvy, would there be plans to translate the current English handbook into other languages – such as Mandarin, Malay, Tamil, perhaps – and also make the handbook accessible to PAB riders offline as well? If there are plans to translate the handbook into other languages, when would these handbooks be made available, either online and possibly offline as well, in the form of a physical handbook?",7,775,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00775
2021-05-11-T-015,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Also, will the proposed tests be as challenging as the motorists' Highway Code test, which, although I have not taken for quite a few years now, I understand does require some time and effort to study and prepare for? There are cases of people who actually fail to pass the Highway Code test.",8,776,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00776
2021-05-11-T-015,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"While these tests are currently going to be done online, would there be the option of written or even oral tests for those who might not be so comfortable with the digital testing option?",9,777,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00777
2021-05-11-T-015,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I have observed PABs travelling on the roads that seemed to be going at speeds similar to that of small motorcycles or scooters. Given that riders of these vehicles – motorcycles and scooters – need to pass practical tests before they are allowed on the road, does the Government foresee users of road-travelling PABs needing some sort of simplified or modified practical test or some basic practical training in terms of how they should manage their PAB on the road?",10,778,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00778
2021-05-11-T-015,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Riding on the road and riding on cycling paths are two very different experiences. If one of the aims of this Bill is to ensure the safety of the PAB riders, then perhaps PAB riders should be educated on how to ride on the road before actually being allowed on the road. Perhaps this education could take the form of some sort of practical experience, as onerous as that may sound.",11,779,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00779
2021-05-11-T-015,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"A final point, Mr Speaker, Sir, that I would like to raise was previously highlighted when I spoke about the Active Mobility (Amendment) Bill last year and, that is, while the implementation of a qualifying test will certainly enhance the riders' awareness of road safety, the challenge is in ensuring that all PAB riders will go through this test. How will the authorities intend to ensure that all riders are certified before they ride on the roads and how would this enforcement be done?",12,780,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00780

The designated trial zone we have will allow a gradual phasing in of AVs and for the engineers to understand how AVs can be improved. However, the AV race will become more competitive as more AV companies enter the market and make breakthroughs in AV technology. Therefore, we should extend the sandbox by another five years for the AV technology to be more mature and fully tested.",9,790,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00790

Some residents in Sembawang West have shared with me their concerns regarding their livelihoods once AVs are implemented on our roads.

2021-05-11-T-015,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Could the Ministry clarify when the requirement for the competency certificate will take place? While the theory test can be taken from 30 June onwards, I am concerned about the potential difficulties that delivery riders may face in meeting this requirement. We must not forget that a day a delivery rider does not have a competency certificate translates into a day without income. To not unduly penalise these workers, could the Ministry consider a transition period before the theory test requirement to ride on the road is effective? This will provide them with some time to comply with this new requirement.",4,800,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00800
2021-05-11-T-015,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"The Bill is clearly in the right direction in pivoting towards greater responsibility on the part of riders. However, it is not so clear with regard to the operative and substantive role played by platform companies in the safety and behaviour of their riders. Delivery riders are themselves also vulnerable road users. They have a limited time to complete their job. It is not uncommon for them to take risks to avoid being penalised. This problem is worsened when riders are unaware of the road traffic rules. These workers also do not enjoy the statutory benefits under the Work Injury Compensation Act, or WICA, in the event of an accident. These companies might purchase third-party liability insurance now. Others might offer personal insurance coverage. However, the compensation amount and protection under WICA is still superior.",5,801,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00801
2021-05-11-T-015,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"I believe that platform companies must take on greater responsibility in safeguarding the safety of both their riders and other road users. Taking responsibility over the competency of the riders is the first step. Currently, section 47 imposes liability for allowing untested riders on the roads. Can I clarify and confirm that section 47K also applies to platform companies, such as the food delivery companies, which engage and allow untested riders on the roads? I would presume that these companies have liabilities because of their direct role in causing these untested riders to be on the road.",6,802,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00802
2021-05-11-T-015,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Furthermore, if section 47K is intended to impose liability on platform companies, can the Ministry clarify whether the liability under section 47K attaches to the natural person who grants approval of the untested rider, or the company which the natural person is working for? While I do note that section 2 of the Interpretation Act defines ""person"" to include a ""company"", it would be helpful for the Ministry to clarify on whom will the liability attach on.",7,803,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00803
2021-05-11-T-015,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"The incentive schemes and penalties embedded within the structures of the payouts directly contribute to road safety. A platform company must know a route that a rider must take to deliver its assignment. It must then know the terrain and associated dangers. It must also know the number of hours that a rider has been on the job. This is clearly no different, for example, from a public transport operator knowing and being responsible for the hours worked by a bus captain. A review of the payout structures and time afforded for deliveries must be undertaken to align them with the new rules prescribed by the Ministry. In fact, I suggest that the Ministry review the payout structures and deployment mechanism from a workplace and road safety perspective.",8,804,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00804
2021-05-11-T-015,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Additionally, I would like to call on platform companies to internalise the costs of the theory tests for their delivery riders. This would form part of the company's training efforts and its larger responsibility to other road users. This should be the case whether a delivery rider can afford to pay for the test or otherwise. The underlying rationale behind this is for platform companies to be cognisant of their responsibility to these workers who are indispensable to their operations.",9,805,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00805

I propose for the Ministry to ensure that the online tests are simple and comprehensible, while retaining the requisite substantive takeaways of the road traffic rules.

2021-05-11-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The pandemic led to a boom in cycling, power-assisted bicycles (PABs) and e-scooter usage has increased. I am supportive of the combined theory test regime for the use of PABs on roads and shared paths. The theory test will raise awareness on the rules and also, hopefully, serve as a reminder to experienced riders. Can the Minister share what are the costs involved to get certified to ride on the roads? As some PAB users are riding for a livelihood, I think most of the Members have shared that the added expense could be a burden for them. Will the certifications be issued as physical cards or electronic digital certificates?",2,811,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00811
2021-05-11-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"In designing the scheme, we must be wary of possible inequalities that may occur. The Official Handbook for Mandatory Theory Test released at the end of April for PABs and PMD scooters is quite comprehensive and useful. I tried to read all the pages in the handbook. It is quite comprehensive. I hope it can be disseminated more extensively to our youths in schools as some aspects of the road traffic rules and practices are useful as well as for non-motorised bicycle users. In addition, as some Members have mentioned, a vernacular version of this handbook will be useful. May I suggest to maybe add in an audio version of it as well, such that some of these tests can be taken in audio form so that some of the PAB users can take some of the tests; other than online, they can be taken in audio as well.",3,812,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00812
2021-05-11-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I laud LTA and MHA's combined effort to cover new offences to deter irresponsible behaviour on the roads and to educate our road users via the new online combined theory tests, but it has to go hand in hand with enforcement efforts and I hope new techniques to capture offenders and manpower needs will meet these demands going forward. Can I ask if the relevant agencies' enforcement resources will be enhanced to meet the demands of these new amendments?",4,813,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00813
2021-05-11-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I now move on to security searches and checks, as mentioned in the Bill, which will be conducted on commuters as part of counter-terrorism efforts at our public transport nodes. I urge the authorities to ensure that the involved personnel are trained to conduct these searches as discreetly and as politely as possible. We want to avoid issues of perceived, for example, racial profiling by the public, that can lead to further entrenchment of stereotypes. And as we are in the midst of a pandemic and body searches often require involved parties being at close proximity to each other, how can authorities guarantee the safety of the public and of the officers conducting the searches?",5,814,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00814
2021-05-11-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Looking ahead, I am pleased to note that the research and development trials for AVs are still going strong. As we open up new towns and estates and technology improves, it is inevitable that the usage of AVs will have future applications. It is essential that safety issues are ironed out properly ahead of any mass deployment in the future. I am supportive that the AV regulatory sandboxes which are due to expire in 2022 will be extended by another five years to facilitate trials and deployments. While it is necessary to test the performance of self-driving software under real-world conditions, this should only happen after comprehensive safety testing and evaluation before we allow citizens to access the benefits of the technology.",6,815,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00815
2021-05-11-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Sir, may I ask the Minister what are the plans for larger-scale deployment of AVs in Singapore and what are the specific safety issues that will need to be addressed? Where will these trials and deployments take place and where can the public get access to regular updates?",7,816,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00816
2021-05-11-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I hope this extension and eventual deployment will allow a set of standard tests and make companies benchmark their algorithms on standard datasets before their vehicles are allowed on open roads. It may still be in early stages, but will there be a graduated approach to certification in which a self-driving system could first be evaluated in simulations, then in controlled real-world environments, pass specific benchmark tests before they can be allowed on open roads? The recent crash of a Tesla car in the United States in which two people died has reignited debate about the capabilities and safety of today's self-driving technologies. The tragic incident has raised questions over self-driving technology  how safe is it and how much attention does it require from drivers?",8,817,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00817
2021-05-11-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Finally, in relation to long-term infrastructure needs, will existing road infrastructure have to be upgraded to accommodate AVs in the future? Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.",9,818,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00818
2021-05-11-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Mr Speaker, Sir, the most hardworking food delivery riders in Singapore can make up to four to five trips in an hour which easily rises upwards of 30 to 40 trips in a day. Some riders choose to make these trips on foot, some cycle, some get on their motorbikes. However, getting around on power-assisted bicycles (PABs) are perceived by many riders as the most cost-effective and efficient way to make their deliveries.",1,819,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00819
2021-05-11-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Understandably, travelling on the roads, especially on PABs, poses its own set of dangers.

2021-05-11-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"It is commendable that the Government is taking measures to ensure the safety of PAB riders even if the first step towards securing their lives and livelihoods takes the form of mandatory theory tests. Theory tests like this, beyond educating our riders about safe practices while travelling on roads, also delineate clearly what the responsibilities of riders are so that they may not be taken advantage of in disputes that occur on the roads, knowing what practices are well within their rights.",3,821,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00821
2021-05-11-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"During the crisis, time and again, our delivery riders have proven themselves to be an essential service, bringing food to our families and keeping the food and beverage sector alive.

2021-05-11-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, we must ensure that these tests, essential as they are for awareness, education and safety, are inclusive and we cannot afford in any measure to allow these tests to become unfair barriers to the livelihood of our delivery riders in Singapore.",5,823,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00823
2021-05-11-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Mr Speaker, Sir, we firmly welcome the notion of a one-time test that can be administered online. However, considering that the test will be online, delivery riders are also looking forward to the possibility that the fees for taking the test can be defrayed. In the same vein, relating to the online nature of the tests, accessibility options must be provided for those who may find such online platforms challenging to navigate, or simply inaccessible.",6,824,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00824
2021-05-11-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"My residents often relate to me the conversations they have with other delivery riders about the best routes to take in the area, as well as the best makan spots along the way. This is the beauty of the delivery rider platform and community – that people from all walks of life can and do become delivery riders and are yet united by their shared livelihoods. To accommodate for this diversity, I think the theory test should account for literacy and language barriers. If possible, we would love to see a simply-worded test made available in multiple languages, with options, such as oral examinations, available even for those without basic literacy foundations.",7,825,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00825
2021-05-11-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Finally, our delivery riders are concerned about the turnaround time should they fail to pass the tests. While we understand that the tests may not be perpetually available for sitting to uphold the rigors of the standards, a day's delay for those who fail their test and who are unable to get on the road poses significant cost to the livelihoods of our delivery riders. The availability of these tests is also paramount to allow entry to becoming a delivery rider, as many delivery riders do this as a part-time gig, such as students on their holidays. Having potentially to wait a week or two after applying to take the tests might set these prospective riders back unnecessarily.",8,826,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00826
2021-05-11-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"All these being said, Mr Speaker, refining the administration of these theory tests is only half the story. The education of our delivery riders can only elevate their prospects of safety so much. In this field of work, delivery platforms should place priority to the health, safety and lives of their partners. It is thus commendable that while we are enforcing the mandate of theory tests for riders on food delivery platforms, it is also essential that we try to secure the lives of our delivery riders. We must also be conscious that this goes hand in hand with securing their livelihoods.",9,827,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00827
2021-05-11-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Mr Speaker, Sir, our delivery riders can virtually lose their jobs if they do not move quickly enough. Delivery riders who do not make their deliveries in a timely fashion according to the expectations of customers can accrue enough bad reviews to be penalised, if not banned.",10,828,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00828
2021-05-11-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"How can we, on one hand, prescribe safe practices and speed limits in a test handbook and on the other hand have delivery riders fearing for their job security if they do not move fast enough? Oftentimes, the delays in delivery times are not even the fault of riders but arise upstream, with the restaurants, though riders are well aware they are the ones who bear the brunt of these late deliveries, leading some to feel they have to make up for lost time and lost ground.",11,829,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00829
2021-05-11-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Surely, Mr Speaker, the rules of the game must be changed to complement the education of our delivery riders.

This is so that we can safeguard the lives and livelihoods of our delivery riders.",12,830,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00830
2021-05-11-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Finally, we must ensure that the formulation of theory tests do not produce a lock-in effect on our roads.

There are clear ambitions to grow Singapore into a connected cycling-friendly city.",13,831,2021-05-11-T-015-S-00831
2021-05-11-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Should the PAB theory test define the rules of the road for riders, we must also maintain a flexibility in the test handbook to accommodate for the ever-evolving face of road infrastructure in Singapore in a bid to promote active mobility. Do not be surprised if we see cycling lanes on our roads one day, bicycle boulevards or even smart traffic lights that respond to the volume and type of vehicles on the road. With the push towards becoming a cycling-friendly city, the rules of the road and, naturally, the theory tests for PABs must be kept on their feet to change as our city also changes.

2021-05-11-T-017,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"First, the Bill makes changes to the Road Traffic Act (RTA) to update our regulatory framework to facilitate trials of AVs. Specifically, clause 3 of the Bill extends the sandbox that permits the AV trials from 2022 to 2027. I am glad that many Members spoke up in support of this extension.",2,848,2021-05-11-T-017-S-00848
2021-05-11-T-017,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"Singapore has been facilitating AV trials on public roads since 2015. Today, a growing eco-system of leading AV firms from China, Europe and the USA, such as Motional, Continental and Desay, have been conducting research and development (R&D) trials here. Local AV enterprises, such as ST Engineering Autonomous Solutions, have deployed on-demand commercial AV services. However, fully autonomous transport remains a long-term aspiration, requiring more R&D.",3,849,2021-05-11-T-017-S-00849
2021-05-11-T-017,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"Therefore, extending the sandbox by five years until August 2027 will allow these companies to continue to develop and trial AV technology for local deployment. The sandbox will also support the large-scale pilot deployment of autonomous buses and shuttles that Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Melvin Yong asked about. As previously announced, this will take place in Punggol, Tengah and the Jurong Innovation District, under the Call-for-Collaboration launched by LTA. This large-scale deployment will help us better understand the requirements for mass deployment, such as whether infrastructure upgrades are needed. LTA will provide further updates in the lead up to deployment in the mid-2020s.",4,850,2021-05-11-T-017-S-00850
2021-05-11-T-017,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),The AV sandbox is meant to cover the trial and use of vehicles equipped with autonomous systems that enable the operation of vehicles without active physical control or monitoring by a human on public roads.,5,851,2021-05-11-T-017-S-00851
2021-05-11-T-017,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"Mr Melvin Yong asked about the use of the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, or ADAS. ADAS technology requires active monitoring by human drivers and, therefore, does not fall within the realm of AV technology. Before approving any motor vehicle for registration and use on public roads, including those fitted with ADAS, LTA checks to ensure the vehicle model’s compliance with stringent safety standards, such as those set out by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and the Vehicle Construction and Use Rules under the RTA. As ADAS technology grows more advanced, we agree with Mr Melvin Yong’s observation that it may carry new risks. We are monitoring global developments closely and will consider further regulation if necessary.",6,852,2021-05-11-T-017-S-00852
2021-05-11-T-017,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"Besides the sandbox, another move LTA made to support AV trials was to expand the AV testbed in 2019 to include 1,000 kilometres of public roads in western Singapore, covering a wide range of traffic scenarios and road conditions. This has served the needs of AV developers interested to deploy AVs in Singapore. However, there are developers who may be considering other environments for their trials beyond western Singapore, as suggested by Ms Poh Li San, and LTA is open to such considerations when assessing their trial applications on a case-by-case basis.",7,853,2021-05-11-T-017-S-00853

This is why LTA has put in place stringent safety assessments. Mr Saktiandi Supaat will be pleased to know that there are milestone tests in place today, administered in a specially-designed facility – the Centre of Excellence for Testing and Research of AVs at NTU, or CETRAN. All AVs must undergo and pass these tests prior to on-road trials. All AVs must also have a qualified safety driver onboard who can take immediate control of the vehicle during trials, should the need arise. These safety drivers are subject to the same responsibility as drivers of manned vehicles in ensuring the safe driving of the vehicle. The requirement for safety drivers will remain in place until AVs are able to operate safely without a human driver.",8,854,2021-05-11-T-017-S-00854
2021-05-11-T-017,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"We agree with Ms Poh Li San’s observation that the liability and insurance framework for AVs is just as important as the underlying technology. This is why all AV developers, as owners of the AVs, are legally required to purchase third-party liability insurance for all AV trials. In the event of an accident, the insurance will cover any losses or damages that the owner and any authorised safety driver may suffer, as a result of any injury, death and property damage caused to any third party. This is not much different from the motor insurance coverage for manned vehicles. All AVs must also carry data recorders to collect data to support investigations in case of incidents.",9,855,2021-05-11-T-017-S-00855

All vehicles used or kept in Singapore are subject to taxes upon registration. But there are exceptions. For instance, ambulances and fire engines are exempted as they provide essential public services. However, when these vehicles are no longer on a tax-exempt scheme, it is only fair to all other vehicle owners and drivers that taxes are re-imposed on these vehicles. MOH has announced enhanced regulatory standards for private ambulances and medical transporters. When these new standards take effect from 1 September this year, some vehicles might no longer be able to function as ambulances and, hence, will no longer qualify for tax exemption.",14,860,2021-05-11-T-017-S-00860

These security searches are conducted similar to those carried out at major events, such as at the National Day Parade. I would like to assure Members that authorised officers carrying out security searches would have to undergo proper training and must complete the necessary Security Workforce Skills Qualifications or WSQ courses approved by the Singapore Police Force before their deployment.

I would like to assure Members that all authorised officers have to be in uniform when conducting frisk searches. In addition, security searches will be conducted within the video surveillance coverage to provide assurance to the public that any alleged abuses will be investigated accordingly. To safeguard the modesty of a female person and to ensure frisk searches are conducted professionally, only authorised female officers can conduct frisk searches on a female person. We also have the powers to enforce against imposters, as provided for under section 11B of the LTA Act.",18,864,2021-05-11-T-017-S-00864

That said, we have stepped up enforcements island-wide. Just last week, a motor vehicle workshop was charged in Court for illegally modifying two cars’ exhaust systems. This is a very serious offence, as modifying a vehicle's exhaust system may lead to public safety concerns when the vehicle is used for racing, or result in public nuisance due to excessive noise.",24,870,2021-05-11-T-017-S-00870

To this effect, we will strengthen penalties for illegal exhaust modifications for greater deterrence. For first-time offenders, LTA currently issues a composition sum of $500. Going forward, LTA will double the composition sum to $1,000 for new offences committed from 1 July this year. We will also not hesitate to take offenders of more egregious cases to Court, even if they are first-time offenders.

This is not a licensing regime which will be more onerous for riders. Instead, it is a one-time theory test which will ensure that riders are familiar with active mobility rules, regulations and code of conduct. The amendments to the RTA today will enable us to implement a single theory test for PAB riders on roads and cycling paths.",26,872,2021-05-11-T-017-S-00872

LTA will release more details in June, but I will address some key points, such as the cost of the test and if it will be accessible to those who face difficulty taking an online test, including our seniors. We will keep test fees affordable to minimise the financial impact on riders, especially those who ride for their livelihoods. For the first three months, the test will be chargeable at $5 for two attempts. And just in case Members do not really understand what it means, let me just clarify. Five dollars for two attempts means if you try the first time, it will be $5. If you pass, we are happy for you. If you cannot pass, you can take the test again for free the second time; that is, $5 for two attempts.",30,876,2021-05-11-T-017-S-00876

Special provisions can be made on a case-by-case basis for those who are not digitally-savvy or illiterate. Upon passing, digital certificates will be issued to the rider.

While some Members have identified countries that disallow the practice, there are also countries, such as Canada, Thailand and the USA, that allow workers to be ferried in the rear deck of lorries, albeit with safety precautions and some restrictions.

The first question is I wonder if the Senior Minister of State could explain to us regarding frisk searches whether commuters can expect these searches to be targeted, that is, based on suspicion, or would they also be conducted on a random basis, as a general deterrent to would-be offenders?

The point I actually made was a bit different. I recognise that there are provisions in that regard, but my point was a bit more involved.

I would like to share with the Member that the intent of moving towards a non-mandatory regime is to balance deterrence and fairness.

This House would recall that in 2019, we amended the RTA to provide for non-mandatory forfeiture of vehicles involved in the offence of dangerous and careless driving. As another example, under the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA), if a person is convicted of any offence and if the Public Prosecutor makes an application to forfeit a vehicle, the Court shall order the vehicle to be forfeited unless the owner establishes that the vehicle was unlawfully in the possession of another person without the owner’s consent.",6,913,2021-05-11-T-017-S-00913

In other words, the owner suspected that his car could be used in an illegal speed trial, but did not ask. As I have mentioned earlier, the burden is on the owner to prove to the satisfaction of the Court that the vehicle had been used without his consent. In a case where the owner suspected that the offender used his vehicle and could have asked, but did not, it is up to the Court to decide, based on the facts of the case, whether there had been implied consent to the use of the vehicle.

As part of the investigative process, TP interviews all involved parties separately and procures other relevant evidence, such as video footage. This evidence will be submitted to the Court, for the Court to decide based on the facts of the case and the arguments from both sides. For non-genuine cases, TP will not hesitate to take action against the persons or anyone who falsely claimed that the offending driver had used the vehicle without the owner’s consent.

There are now close to 300 traffic enforcement cameras deployed to detect and deter speeding and red light running.

As part of the process to obtain a driving licence, motorcyclists will need to take two theory tests, go through a series of riding lessons, before taking their practical test. The training includes a module on how to ride safely with a pillion rider. On the other hand, PAB riders only need to go through a theory test and do not need to undergo any practical test. The motorcyclist has, therefore, undergone more training and is better able to handle a motorcycle with a pillion rider compared to the PAB rider.",11,918,2021-05-11-T-017-S-00918

The Singapore Motor Cycle Trade Association has also raised this concern. The current standards used to certify motorcycle helmets was formulated in 2014, in consultation with the industry and technical experts, including the Singapore Motor Cycle Trade Association. These are in line with the internationally recognised United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Regulation Number 22, though we have additional requirements. For example, Singapore’s previous review concluded that it is important to include additional tests, such as the penetration test, which tests how easily the helmet’s shell is penetrated when it hits a sharp object, such as a fence or a motorcycle footrest.",12,919,2021-05-11-T-017-S-00919

To clarify, our proposed amendments to section 81 are not just increasing the penalties for the existing offence of furnishing false information. We have broadened the offence to cover individuals who, alone or with others, deliberately mislead TP and prevent the identification of the correct offender driver. Thus, we have increased the fine by two times to reflect the greater seriousness.",15,922,2021-05-11-T-017-S-00922

This disqualification is on top of the penalties that the motorist may face for the underlying offence. The policy intent of this provision is to prevent motorists who have committed road rage from driving a motor vehicle again, as the behaviour might be repeated and cause harm to other motorists. The penalty of disqualification is, therefore, only applicable to motorists.",17,924,2021-05-11-T-017-S-00924

Over the years, TP has enhanced its enforcement strategy by leveraging technology to improve detection of offences.

I agree that it is important that vehicles are well maintained, to ensure the safety of not just the occupants but other road users. This is why for accidents involving mechanical failure, such as when the vehicle's brakes are faulty, TP can already take to task the person who holds the responsibility to maintain the vehicle. That said, we hear the Member's suggestion and we will work with MOT to review how we can strengthen this.",24,931,2021-05-11-T-017-S-00931

2021-05-11-T-018,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"For today, allow me to highlight three broad themes which will need further dialogue and consultation amongst the stakeholders and the Government.",3,1014,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01014
2021-05-11-T-018,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),The first broad theme is around the EV charging infrastructure. The first issue around EV charging infrastructure is the choice of standards. The choice of charging standards will have an island-wide infrastructure impact. It is good to know that the Government has already identified a TR25 Committee put together such a team to look into this.,4,1015,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01015
2021-05-11-T-018,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Of course, globally, there is a flurry of activities in the industry to come up with the technology that will become the industry standard. The jury is still out and there is also the related issue of fast charging or slow charging. The variance between fast and slow charging can range between 20 minutes and seven to eight hours, and the cost of fast charging is estimated to be 30 times the cost of a $10,000 to $12,000 slow charging station. How will Singapore decide on the standard to be used? How will Singapore manage the risks involved with this big bet depending on how battery technologies advance or if other technologies disrupt, for example, hydrogen?",5,1016,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01016
2021-05-11-T-018,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"A second issue around EV charging infrastructure is the accessibility of chargers which is a key factor affecting the rate of adoption of EVs. During the Committee of Supply, the Minister for Transport announced that, by 2030, it is planned that there will be 60,000 EV charging points available across the island. What is the planned roll-out of these charging points? Will EV charging be considered a national infrastructure or will the Government leave it to the private sector to decide based on their business models? What will be the design point for the charging network, balancing speed, cost, coverage, convenience and load on the grid? HDB carparks will be a major real estate for charging points. So, will HDB fund the roll-out of the charging infrastructure? How does LTA plan to encourage existing condominiums to put in charging stations since MCST will have to fund the capital costs?",6,1017,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01017
2021-05-11-T-018,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Industry players support a more extensive slow-charging network complemented by a fast-charging network for top-up and emergency. The slow-charging network can be shared or is specific to each EV. The shared model will require consumer acceptance of some level of inconvenience. So, imagine having to drive your EV to a HDB carpark maybe three MRT stations away and then wait for your car to get charged up and then bring it home. So, those are the inconveniences that may appear.",7,1018,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01018
2021-05-11-T-018,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"The industry is exploring an option for the installation of the slow chargers to be provided as part of the purchase of the EV, similar to how chargers come with our smartphones today. Does this mean Singapore may need to consider the approach in Japan, where one can buy a car only when one owns a parking lot? If that is so, then the EV charging station is individually owned, which also has the benefit of the charging taking place off-peak and not strain the electricity grid. Is it, however, wasteful since each EV probably only needs to be charged a couple of times a week at most? The dilemma is how best to balance cost, convenience and social acceptance when deciding between all these options.",8,1019,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01019
2021-05-11-T-018,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"A third issue around EV charging infrastructure is how to handle range anxiety. With the average driving distance being 50 kilometres a day, one charge can probably hold up for three to four days. That said, access to fast-charging is still needed in the event of ""emergencies"". In speaking with several mall developers, many are already fitting up a few EV-ready fast-charging stations. There are, however, questions around how many lots to provide optimally and the sharing of these lots by EV drivers.",9,1020,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01020
2021-05-11-T-018,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),Perhaps an intelligent app can help to alert the driver that his or her EV is fully charged and higher parking charges will kick in thereafter if the car is not moved.

2021-05-11-T-018,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"To help accelerate provision of fast-charging stations, will the Government consider EV lots to be included in URA's existing Community/Sports Facilities Scheme, or CSFS, which allows Gross Floor Area, or GFA, exemptions? Such carrots should help to make fast-charging stations more accessible at malls, office buildings and new developments. Existing petrol stations and public carparks are also, of course, potential fast-charging sites.",11,1022,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01022
2021-05-11-T-018,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"The second broad theme is around re-skilling the mechanics and technicians in the workshops. Singapore needs an EV-ready skilled workforce. It is exciting that MTI and EDB have attracted Hyundai Motors to set up their electric car manufacturing in Singapore. I am sure it will be a highly automated facility but still our Singapore workforce needs to be systematically upskilled to support electrification across all the OEM brands – from manufacturing, service, aftersales – and to ensure that our workers are future-proof. There are new opportunities for our workers in this industry as the EV works on digitalisation and there will be new digital jobs in the auto industry. We hope that the Skills and Jobs Framework in the new clean energy for the auto industry can be in place early to help current workers upskill and next-gen workers be future-ready.

2021-05-11-T-018,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"The third broad theme is around hybrid being the low hanging fruit to decarbonising on our roads. While EVs offer the largest reduction in carbon dioxide footprint, drivers could take a while to warm up making their first EV purchase. I must declare I do drive a hybrid car. Hybrid presents the lowest hanging fruit to decarbonising our transportation. Hybrid's carbon dioxide emission reduction of 25%, compared to an ICE, is considerable.",13,1024,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01024

To encourage hybrid adoption alongside EV adoption, the industry has a suggestion for LTA to review the COE Category classification for hybrid vehicles. I am told that there are best-in-class hybrid EV powertrains which use a 1.8-litre engine to achieve remarkable carbon dioxide emissions. De-carbonising should not come with a premium COE or a premium road tax.",14,1025,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01025
2021-05-11-T-018,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"One other point I would like to bring up is how used cars will be treated. As we pursue the transition to cleaner energy vehicles, with the various policies for new vehicle registration, what regulatory changes will the Government be making with regard to used cars? Will the same penalty policies for C1 and C2 banding guidelines for new cars be applied for used cars, if their emission test results at point of COE renewal fail to meet the mark?",15,1026,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01026

2021-05-11-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The city of Shenzhen in China, for instance, was early to the game in providing direct and indirect subsidies to encourage taxi drivers to go electric. This encourages network effects, where the industry becomes more willing to install charging and maintenance facilities because the city now has a minimum market of 22,000 EVs via taxis.",9,1037,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01037
2021-05-11-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Such additional incentives are not without precedent because we already are giving some support to some groups in Singapore for vehicles on the basis that they need to use their vehicles for work, such as in the case of the Disabled Persons Scheme, for example, where exemptions are provided from paying COE and Additional Registration Fee (ARF), provided the vehicle meets certain conditions.",10,1038,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01038
2021-05-11-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),Enhancing incentives for high-use drivers to switch to EVs would get us disproportionate traction in achieving our environmental outcomes while buying more time for the development of new public transport infrastructure to attract transitioning drivers of low-utilisation vehicles to switch to EVs.,11,1039,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01039
2021-05-11-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, Mdm Deputy Speaker, we should welcome the reduction in the  ARF floor and the revision in the road tax framework, which would come into effect next year for EVs. This is a good first step and will reduce the green premiums EV users have to pay. As per the latest EV incentives announced in Budget 2021, from January 2022 to December 2023, the minimum ARF of $5,000 will be lowered to zero dollars for all EVs – and EVs do not pay fuel excise duties.",12,1040,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01040
2021-05-11-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Given this, EV owners will be made to pay an additional $700 road tax from 2023 with a phase-in period from 2021. This lump sum tax negates some of the savings derived from the reduced ARF but there will probably still be net savings from these measures for EV owners.",13,1041,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01041
2021-05-11-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"However, the presence and uncertainty of fuel excise duty rebates makes this cost-benefit calculation for switching to EVs more complicated and less predictable going forward. The Workers' Party has argued for a phasing in of the fuel duty hike – and I shall not repeat the arguments here – to ensure that our incentives are having the desired effect.",14,1042,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01042
2021-05-11-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Would the Government consider setting yearly targets for and publicly keep track of EV charging infrastructure – for instance, chargers per car and chargers per region and the corresponding number of EVs on the road?",15,1043,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01043

2021-05-11-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),I would also call on the Government to develop a strategy to nudge motorcycle users towards electric motorcycles as these are also high-use vehicles in many cases as these are heavily used in delivery work.,18,1046,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01046
2021-05-11-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to talk about the e-waste that EVs will generate. EVs produce considerable e-waste with the higher battery and semiconductor content and the EPR or Extended Producer Responsibility scheme for e-waste will be in place from 1 July 2021. But EV batteries are considered ""non-consumer goods"" and all producers of batteries are only required to use a licensed waste disposer or e-waste recycling provider. There does not appear to be any clear mandate to recycle but only rules and responsible handling of end-of-life to prevent illegal dumping and so on.",19,1047,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01047
2021-05-11-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),Such EV batteries are goods that can be leased out and returned to the original producer either through car dealerships or private hire fleet or taxi fleet owners. It might be cost-effective for these organisations to reuse and recover materials from batteries rather than dispose of them. We should encourage circularity in our battery production and use.,20,1048,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01048
2021-05-11-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"My parliamentary colleague, Ms He Ting Ru, will draw attention to the importance of early forward planning and creating an eco-system for e-waste recycling for EV batteries. This can be married to the support of our locally rooted recycling and material recovery companies in Singapore since Singapore already has businesses that can do this. In fact, promoting e-waste recovery from batteries could be a competence we could nurture in Singapore so that Singapore-based companies can invest in the region to export this know-how.",21,1049,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01049
2021-05-11-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Hence, I would like to ask if there are targets to increase EV battery recycling and material recovery and is the Government looking to legislate the end-of-life management of EV batteries to mandate reuse and material recovery rather than disposal?",22,1050,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01050
2021-05-11-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, while we push for our EV transition, it is important to note that better low carbon forms of transport, such as public transport and bike riding, are still far better alternatives in terms of emissions and waste, and it behooves us to not lose sight of this fact in any discussion about promoting EVs. Now is the right time to ask if our current public transport goals are ambitious enough.",23,1051,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01051
2021-05-11-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),One of the key goals in the Land Transport Master Plan 2040 announced in 2019 was to increase the peak hour public transport mode share to 75%. We are on track to meet this target as we appear to have crossed 67% very recently. I would like to ask the Government to review this.,24,1052,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01052

We should try to frontload our cycling targets in this way, in light of the recent reports of bicycling accidents. The cycling boom during COVID-19 has created an opportunity to foster a cycling culture for health, recreation and climate benefits. We should strike while the iron is hot.",25,1053,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01053

2021-05-11-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Lastly, Mdm Deputy Speaker, we must be humble and transparent in consultation. LTA recently said that it was in the midst of an industry consultation regarding private sector participation in public charger deployment. But can it do more public consultations regarding other aspects of the EV roll-out?",28,1056,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01056
2021-05-11-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"For instance, it can do more to engage those whose COEs are near expiry. It should also engage members of the public who are about to buy their next car or about to rent a car for private hire driving.",29,1057,2021-05-11-T-018-S-01057
2021-05-11-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Can the Government also commit to publishing more of its consultations unless there are specific business sensitivity reasons not to do so?

2021-05-11-T-020,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.]  I would like to start by sharing a bit of history. About 140 years ago, the first passenger EV invented by the French inventor, Gustave Trouve, was tested on the streets of Paris. Interest and adoption of EVs grew at that time. At the peak of their popularity between 1900 and 1912, almost 40% of vehicles in the United States were EVs.",2,1067,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01067
2021-05-11-T-020,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"However, they began to lose their popularity because of their limited range, lack of electrical power in rural areas, a relatively slower speed and the discovery of large petroleum reserves that made gasoline-powered vehicles cheaper to operate over long distances.",3,1068,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01068
2021-05-11-T-020,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Today, 140 years later, even with improvements in battery and vehicle technology, some of the same concerns still weigh on consumers, such as availability of charging points. Unlike the 1900s, there are new and pressing environmental concerns that now drive the Singapore Government to encourage EV adoption. Modern urban transportation needs and the desire for sustainable transportation solutions have made EVs an important strategic solution to deal with these challenges.",4,1069,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01069

In the area of transport, the Ministry has set ambitious targets to cease registration of diesel cars and roll out EV-ready towns, with a target of 60,000 charging points nationwide by 2030. These are targets that will spur us towards a cleaner, more sustainable future and help to ensure that our infrastructure is able to meet the anticipated growth of EVs.",6,1071,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01071
2021-05-11-T-020,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"I am thus heartened that through this amendment Bill, LTA and EMA are set to collaborate on establishing the necessary policies and frameworks for the EV charging infrastructure development. I would, however, like to raise two considerations.",7,1072,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01072
2021-05-11-T-020,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Firstly, with the expected increase in the number of EVs and charging points, there may also likely be an increase in battery and charging point related incidents. A study of battery fires in EVs showed that the energy and heat released in an EV fire is much higher than petrol or gasoline-run vehicles, indicating a bigger fire hazard and requiring more stringent risk-mitigating efforts. This point has also been brought up by a fellow Member of the House earlier. We need to ensure that, in tandem with the rollout of charging infrastructure in public carparks, there would be the need for education, safety precautions and measures, should an accident or electrical mishap occur.",8,1073,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01073
2021-05-11-T-020,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"I would like to suggest that a review of the safety requirements be undertaken together with LTA, HDB and URA and other relevant agencies to ensure public awareness and establish safety protocols when using EV charging points.",9,1074,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01074
2021-05-11-T-020,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"The second is in the design consideration when implementing the charging points. A Deloitte report on EV public charging infrastructure highlighted that more than 70% of charging took place at residential locations. It is heartening to know that the Government has planned for 60% of the 60,000 charging points to be in public carparks. On average, 15% of the existing carpark lots will be converted to overnight charging points. I understand that these are slow charging points so as not to overload the existing power grid infrastructure.",10,1075,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01075
2021-05-11-T-020,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Earlier, the Minister for Transport has also mentioned that the average electric car has a range of 300 kilometres to 500 kilometres per charge and that the average user may only need to charge his car once every five days, hence, this would spread out the demand for charging points.",11,1076,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01076
2021-05-11-T-020,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"However, as mentioned by Ms Janet Ang, some studies have shown that some users not only have “range anxiety” but also an emerging phenomenon known as “charging anxiety”. Charging anxiety arises from drivers' concerns about the charging process, its ease of use and, most importantly, the time it takes to complete the charging. The duration of the charging process depends on the different charging modes and capacities. Drivers experience charging anxiety when they reach a charging station without any problem, but then face a long wait to be able to charge because there are not enough charging stations. Some drivers may also want to charge their vehicles to full capacity as often as possible. When a lot of people are trying to do this, it can create problems  too many cars, not enough chargers.",12,1077,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01077
2021-05-11-T-020,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"It would be difficult to try to explain away the driver’s concern in wanting to charge his vehicle often and this will result in possibly long queues and disputes on the use of charging points. To this, I would like to suggest that LTA study the user journey, charging behaviour and how charging will take place at carparks to optimise the infrastructure design that allows charging points to be accessible to as many parking lots and vehicles as possible and allow for quick flexible installation of additional charging points, if demand increases in a certain area.",13,1078,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01078
2021-05-11-T-020,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"LTA can also consider the feasibility for one or two separate fast charging points powered by, maybe, alternative energy like solar energy and batteries that do not depend on the power grid. This will allow users who want to charge their cars using fast chargers without impacting the existing power infrastructure. Such technology is currently available and can be considered to complement the current plans.",14,1079,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01079

2021-05-11-T-020,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"The Bill also does not prescribe the role of LTA to ensure that charging points are made available in a manner that is affordable to the public, including ensuring sufficient competition in the market to encourage fair pricing for consumers. These may be seen as operational matters. The principle of equitable access to chargers should be enshrined in law. The convenience and benefits of owning an EV must not only be reserved for residents who live in landed properties as they can easily purchase, install and access their own charging points in their own properties.",5,1086,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01086

What specific payment and funding models are being considered to ensure that the final user will be extended affordable prices? Would the Government engage residents in deciding the location of charging points and pricing and publicise the results of this engagement? What regulations can be put in place to prevent ugly behaviours, such as charger and space hogging, which deprive other users of the chance to charge their vehicles?",7,1088,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01088
2021-05-11-T-020,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),Getting out EV support infrastructure right from the very beginning is especially important as the continued growth in mobility-as-a-service means that many drivers and users of mobility devices depend on their vehicles for their livelihoods. They conduct deliveries and transport passengers and should be able to continue doing so without having to worry about finding an available charging station to spend 30 minutes or more charging up their vehicle in the middle of their workday.,8,1089,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01089

2021-05-11-T-020,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Having dedicated bike lanes on roads and pop-up bicycle lanes that are separate from both pedestrians and motor vehicles are good ways to encourage alternative means of transport, not just for leisure but also for commuting. This is especially important when you consider that cycling was estimated to emit 10 times less emissions than electric cars by a recent study. In fact, the study also found that the average person who shifted from car to bike for just one week, one day a week, cut their carbon footprint by 3.2 kilos of carbon dioxide, equivalent to the emissions from driving a car for 10 kilometres, eating a serving of red meat or chocolate or sending 800 emails.",15,1096,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01096
2021-05-11-T-020,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"With this in mind, I would like to call for the Government to allow Sengkang to lead the charge in becoming one of the first towns to fully embrace a cycling culture, with a dense network of cycling paths and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. I believe that the compact nature of our estate and the large number of residents who cycle in Sengkang, whether for leisure, commuting or as delivery riders, make it a good place to trial our move towards more active travel and mobility options. The younger population's high reliance on delivery services and proximity to bike networks, such as the Punggol Waterway Park and Sengkang Riverside Park, makes the estate an ideal candidate for a concerted push towards being a truly bike- and pedestrian-friendly town. Sengkang can and should be a model for how Singapore can move towards sustainable mobility.",16,1097,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01097
2021-05-11-T-020,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"We can even go further by considering repurposing car lanes into bike lanes. This is a tried-and-tested approach from cities, such as Taipei, Copenhagen, Amsterdam and Canberra. A more considerate road design that embraces bicycles and even PMDs can also address matters of road safety, which is the subject of some of the changes to the RTA Bill that was also debated earlier today. If we make it easier for all road users to use pathways and roads safely together, it would naturally engender safer road behaviour.",17,1098,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01098
2021-05-11-T-020,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"To address concerns raised about active mobility options in Singapore's climate, we should also ensure coordination with BCA and other authorities. While I note that BCA's Green Mark gives a point for buildings that provide sheltered bicycle lots, adequate facilities like showers and changing rooms, can we go a step further to eventually make such on-site end-of-trip features mandatory for new and renovated office spaces?",18,1099,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01099
2021-05-11-T-020,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Additionally, we could provide additional tax breaks for buildings which provide such facilities by having a green tax relief scheme. These measures would definitely further encourage active mobility commuting.",19,1100,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01100
2021-05-11-T-020,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"In conclusion, while we understand the Bill's intent, we need to ensure our EV infrastructure is developed in an equitable and sustainable way and that it is not the only focus of a sustainable transport plan. We must think ahead and also innovatively to ensure we focus our minds towards fulfilling our commitment to a green Singapore – promoting health and improving transportation.

2021-05-11-T-020,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My first point of clarification is about motorcycles. Electric motorcycles are better than petrol motorcycles in just about every important way. They emit far less air pollutants and greenhouse gases than gas-powered motorcycles. This means less environmental damage and less health problems for riders and pedestrians. They are also far quieter, something anyone who has lived remotely near a road will appreciate.",3,1105,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01105
2021-05-11-T-020,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"These benefits are not lost on our neighbours in Asia. Tokyo and Taiwan have both announced that they would ban sales of petrol motorcycles by 2035. In Indonesia, the private sector is taking the lead. Gojek will convert its massive fleet of green ""ojeks"" or motorcycle taxis into EVs by 2030. Grab is also launching smaller scale pilots.",4,1106,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01106
2021-05-11-T-020,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"By contrast, neither the private nor public sector in Singapore has shone a clear light on the future of motorcycles here.

2021-05-11-T-020,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Just as important, we must work on a vision. On electric cars, taxis and buses, we have spoken loudly; motorcycles need that same clarity. Can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary share where the Ministry sees motorcycles in 2030 or 2035? Will we aim to keep the same gas-guzzling, smog-spouting models on the road, or will we look to sunset them? A clear Government vision can steer and accelerate private initiatives.",11,1113,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01113
2021-05-11-T-020,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My second point is about charging points in condominiums. This Bill proposes that LTA and EMA’s remit include facilitating the development of accessible charging points. Can the Ministry share what plans it has to collaborate with EMA and BCA to expand the construction of charging points in condominiums?,12,1114,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01114
2021-05-11-T-020,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sixteen percent of our households live in condominiums, based on 2020 data. That is 220,000 households. A fair proportion of these people likely drive cars, can afford EVs and are more likely to be early adopters. But they simply will not buy an EV if they cannot get a charging point built where they live.",13,1115,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01115

This is a suggestion from our former colleague, Assoc Prof Walter Theseira. A firmer approach is to mandate the installation of charging points in condominiums, as Member Gan Thiam Poh recommended. An intermediate approach could be a ""Right to Charge"" law. Ontario, Canada’s largest province, introduced a regulation requiring condominium associations to install EV charging points as long as a resident makes a reasonable request.",15,1117,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01117

2021-05-11-T-020,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. Since I started my engineering career as an automotive engineer 15 years ago, I have seen many changes in the industry. Given that vehicles contribute to 50% of carbon emissions, this industry has been continuously looking for ways to make cars more fuel-efficient while also reducing greenhouse emissions. It was getting harder and more expensive to do so as we were pushing the limits of science for internal combustion engines, or ICE.",1,1121,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01121
2021-05-11-T-020,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),The industry was in a flux as it searched for the right technology platform for the future of transportation. We tried to squeeze as much energy from each drop of fuel. We ventured into biodiesel fuels from soya beans and canola which had the effect of increasing the price of this food source instead.,2,1122,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01122
2021-05-11-T-020,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The industry also explored hybrid propulsion systems and hydrogen fuel cells.

2021-05-11-T-020,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The technology for EV is already available. There are some who are of the opinion that we in Singapore are not moving fast enough to transit fully into an entirely EV population. However, to transit successfully into an entirely EV population requires more than just technological advancement. It also requires the right policies and regulations to ensure the safe use of the EVs. It also necessitates that our infrastructure is adequately prepared to support the EV population. Hence, while I am supportive of this Bill, I would like to pose a few clarifications for the Senior Parliamentary Secretary.",4,1124,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01124

2021-05-11-T-020,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"To be able to promote and regulate the safe use of EVs, we need to be able to understand these new technologies. This requires a different skillset from what we have today. Engineers in regulatory roles will need to understand EVs to ensure their safe use. There is a need to recruit or upskill/reskill talents in the automotive industry. Engineers in our LTA need to understand battery technology, safe practices for discharging of batteries and electrical infrastructure to be able to regulate the safe use of these EVs.",7,1127,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01127
2021-05-11-T-020,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"New technologies are also challenging the norms.

2021-05-11-T-020,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"EVs are also extremely quick. As they are propelled by electric motors, torque comes instantly at low rpms – and this is known as instant torque. This gives immense acceleration for an EV. An entry level Model 3 Tesla does zero to 100 kilometres per hour in five seconds. That is as fast as some high-end performance cars. Even an entry level city car like the Hyundai Ionic does zero to 100 in 7.7 seconds, which is about twice as quick in acceleration as compared to a Toyota Corolla five years ago. The Tesla Semi Truck, a semi truck that is capable of carrying heavy goods, unladen, can accelerate from zero to 100 in five seconds and the world's fastest production bike accelerates from zero to 100 in two seconds.",11,1131,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01131

2021-05-11-T-020,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"To clarify, for the purposes of this Bill, the definition of EV includes battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles but excludes other types of hybrid vehicles that cannot be recharged by plugging in to an external source of electrical power.",2,1192,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01192
2021-05-11-T-020,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"First, on electrical safety. Safety must be of priority in all aspects of EV use and charging. That is why we abide by stringent safety standards.",3,1193,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01193
2021-05-11-T-020,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"For example, LTA mandates that the electric powertrain of EVs must meet requirements in the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Regulations. I would like to assure Mr Sharael Taha that we have strict laws to enforce against illegal modifications which are detected either through on-the-road enforcement or periodic vehicle inspections.",4,1194,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01194

This ensures that TR25 supports innovation in EV charging technology, while ensuring public safety. Licensed electrical workers are required to ensure, and only install, EV chargers that are TR25 compliant. It is an offence under the Electricity Act to tamper with electrical installations, which include fixed EV chargers. Mr Saktiandi Supaat can be assured that these requirements will remain in place, regardless of the agency in charge of regulating EV chargers.",7,1197,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01197
2021-05-11-T-020,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Second, on incentives for electric motorcycles. Mr Louis Ng asked about the Ministry's plans to promote adoption of electric motorcycles. As he pointed out, there are some barriers to electric motorcycle adoption today that are beyond our control. Globally, there are not many electric motorcycle models, compared to electric cars. Many motorcycle dealers and distributors have also not adjusted to the electric motorcycle market yet. Therefore, we have not included motorcycles in our 2030 cleaner energy target on new registrations at the moment.",8,1198,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01198
2021-05-11-T-020,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"As the global market for electric motorcycle matures, we should see more offerings for consumers. We will continue to monitor such trends and consider suitable measures to encourage adoption if necessary. At the same time, we will look into providing for the charging needs of vehicles like electric motorcycles and goods vehicles, as part of our charger deployment plans. We will also not rule out battery swapping for motorcycles.",9,1199,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01199
2021-05-11-T-020,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Third, on available grid capacity to support EVs. EMA and LTA are working with local researchers to study the long-term electrical infrastructure needs for EV charging in Singapore. Preliminary findings show that we may require some upgrades at various levels, including the consumer intake substations, the distribution grid network, as well as power generation. The Minister for Transport earlier mentioned that if our light vehicles switch to EVs and most EV owners charge around the same time of the day, we may need to add one or two new 600-megawatt electricity generating units in our power generation system. This amounts to around 8% to 16% of the current overall peak electricity demand in Singapore.",10,1200,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01200
2021-05-11-T-020,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"The required upgrades will be implemented over the next two decades as we survey our grid and gather insights on charging behaviour. Agencies plan upgrades by catering for a capacity buffer to insure against unanticipated consumption growth. This will ensure that the electricity grid remains stable, as substations are unlikely to exceed capacity due to EV charging.",11,1201,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01201
2021-05-11-T-020,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Fourth, on charger deployment. We have announced our plan to roll out 40,000 charging points at our public carparks by 2030. This is a major undertaking which will necessarily involve some electrical infrastructure upgrades, and LTA has launched a Request-for-Information to consult the industry on how best to structure private sector involvement in the funding of these upgrades. Input from this exercise will also inform the design and use of carpark lots for charging, including issues that Mr Dennis Tan had mentioned.",12,1202,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01202
2021-05-11-T-020,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"As Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Ms Janet Ang pointed out, agencies will need to work closely together on the national charger deployment plan.

2021-05-11-T-020,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Another example, as mentioned by Mr Sharael Taha, is how LTA is working with HDB to incorporate EV charging demand into the upgrading of substations in older estates, under HDB's Electrical Load Upgrading Programme. Going forward, the National EV Centre under LTA will coordinate and drive close collaboration among agencies, including URA, EMA and HDB, to deploy chargers. We will also explore supporting regulations on data use, which Ms Mariam Jaafar has suggested.",14,1204,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01204
2021-05-11-T-020,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"I am glad that Mr Louis Ng and Ms Janet Ang raised the role of private development owners in the deployment of EV charging points. That includes Mr Dennis Tan as well. Indeed, we target 20,000 charging points to be deployed at private premises by 2030. To kick this off, we will launch the EV Common Charger Grant in July, to defray charger installation costs in non-landed private residences, such as condominiums. We will need to engage stakeholders, such as MCSTs, managing agents and charging operators, to see if we can do more. But more importantly, the economics must work. Users must find it more worthwhile to drive an EV compared to an internal combustion engine vehicle, so that vendors will enter the market.",15,1205,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01205
2021-05-11-T-020,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Fifth, on charger availability. Beyond charger deployment, the issue of charging anxiety raised by Ms Ng Ling Ling can be addressed by maximising access to chargers as far as possible through a mix of smart charging solutions and advance booking features. To respond to Mr Gan Thiam Poh, our charger deployment tenders will also incorporate innovations in charging technology where feasible. More importantly, as Ms Janet Ang rightly pointed out, developing good social norms is also essential to discourage behaviour like lot hogging by cars that do not need charging. As Mr Dennis Tan mentioned, there are pricing schemes to discourage such behaviour, such as time-based pricing for an EV that is already fully charged.",16,1206,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01206
2021-05-11-T-020,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,We agree with Ms Yeo Wan Ling that point-to-point transport (P2P) drivers have specific charging needs which need to be met as they transit to EVs. We are working closely with P2P transport operators to facilitate their efforts to develop charging infrastructure for their fleets. P2P drivers can also tap on the growing network of fast chargers island-wide.,17,1207,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01207
2021-05-11-T-020,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Sixth, on the disposal and recycling of used EV batteries, an issue which Mr Leon Perera raised. From July this year, the National Environment Agency, or NEA, will implement an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme to ensure the proper treatment and recycling of regulated electrical and electronic waste. This includes EV batteries. Under the scheme, producers of EV batteries are responsible for the proper treatment of the batteries when they reach end-of-life. NEA has also appointed an operator to collect consumer EV batteries on behalf of the producers. All collected EV batteries are to be sent for proper treatment with licensed e-waste recyclers.",18,1208,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01208
2021-05-11-T-020,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I am heartened that Members are enthusiastic about the benefits of EVs and greener modes of transport in general like public transport and cycling. Some of these ideas are beyond the scope of this Bill. Today's Bill to assign LTA statutory functions on EV and EV infrastructure is a strong commitment to the transition to cleaner energy vehicles, but it is only the first step. Building on this, we will introduce further legislation in due course, such as the registration of EV chargers and charger provision requirement for new buildings. Nevertheless, we will study and, where possible, incorporate the many useful ideas and also address the concerns raised by Members today.",19,1209,2021-05-11-T-020-S-01209

The Government will do this in partnership with industry and public stakeholders. In particular, echoing what Ms Janet Ang said, there is much economic value offered by the EV industry. We are working with relevant economic agencies to anchor high value R&D activities and develop related industries, such as charging systems and automotive manufacturing, to establish an EV eco-system. As highlighted by Mr Sharael Taha, our workforce, especially our technicians and mechanics, will need to be equipped with the necessary skills to transit into future job opportunities.

2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"While most construction work has resumed since August last year, the inflow of migrant workers who form the main bulk of the workforce has remained constrained due to the global impact of the pandemic.",4,1220,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01220
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"We have recently tightened our border control measures with a number of countries, including Bangladesh and India, which are our main sources of construction Work Permit holders. While this was necessary to safeguard public health, it has made the shortage of manpower in the sector even more severe.",5,1221,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01221
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Compared to pre-COVID-19 levels, the number of construction Work Permit holders has dropped by about 15%, and the number is projected to fall in the months ahead given the on-going COVID-19 situation.",6,1222,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01222
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"In tandem, construction manpower costs have been rising. Based on MOM's data on construction Work Permit holder salaries, median wages in March this year were 15% to 30% higher compared to pre-COVID-19 levels due to competition for the limited supply of workers within the sector. This has affected both new as well as on-going projects.",7,1223,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01223
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"We have also implemented various Safe Management Measures to keep workers safe and reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.

2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"For example, we had previously shared that more than eight in 10 of on-going HDB BTO projects have been delayed by about six to nine months beyond the Estimated Completion Dates originally indicated to flat owners during project launches. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, we are expecting a further delay of three months, arising from the recent border measures. We are faced with a difficult balancing act – the more we need to tighten border measures for everyone’s safety, the greater the impact will be on construction timelines, on projects and on home buyers.",9,1225,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01225
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"We had, therefore, intervened significantly since last year to assist the many stakeholders across the value chain that have been affected by rising costs and delays.

2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"For construction firms, we introduced a $1.36 billion Construction Support Package last year to help our contractors bear part of the additional costs they had to incur due to construction delays and Safe Management Measures. We had also assisted firms with Foreign Worker Levy rebates and waivers, as well as wage subsidies via the Jobs Support Scheme or JSS, to relieve some of their burden from manpower costs and help keep local jobs. Under Part 8 of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act (COTMA), we established a mechanism for firms to seek relief from additional rental costs that are incurred due to construction delays caused by COVID-19. And under Parts 8A and 8B of COTMA, we legislated a universal extension of time of four months and mandated the sharing of non-manpower prolongation costs between project parties.",11,1227,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01227
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"For developers, we had earlier provided a 12-month extension of the Project Completion Period and Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty remission timelines for completion, to account for delays due to COVID-19. Part 8C of COTMA will also allow developers whose projects face construction delays to seek relief on the date of delivery of possession.",12,1228,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01228
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"For home buyers, Part 2 of COTMA prohibits developers from withholding or forfeiting any part of the booking fee paid by home buyers under the Option to Purchase during the relief period, or terminating agreements for sale and purchase of the property because the home buyer was not able to make payment. We also capped the late payment interest and charges under agreements for sale and purchase of property, to protect home buyers. In addition, under Part 8C of COTMA, where the developer has extended the delivery date, home buyers may also seek reimbursement from the developer, up to a specified cap, if they incur certain out-of-pocket expenses due to a delay in delivery of the unit by the developer. For HDB flat buyers, HDB has been progressively updating home buyers who have been affected, on the revised completion dates. For those who are unable to make alternative housing arrangements, HDB has assisted them with Interim Rental Housing flats.",13,1229,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01229
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Now, the manpower situation will be further exacerbated by the recent tightening of our border measures with Bangladesh, India and other countries. As both Ministers Lawrence Wong and Gan Kim Yong have explained earlier today, we have to tighten our border controls to better protect Singapore from heightened COVID-19 risks. And we should expect these stringent measures to be in place for some time, given the worsening situation overseas.",14,1230,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01230

2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"First, we have granted an additional 49-day Extension of Time (EOT) for eligible public sector construction projects, on top of the 122 days or four months of EOT already provided under COTMA last year on a universal basis. This gives contractors more time to complete their projects.",16,1232,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01232
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Second, contractors working on eligible public sector projects with an awarded contract sum of up to $100 million will receive 0.1% of their awarded contract sum for every month of delay as payment for non-manpower related qualifying costs under COTMA.

2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Third, we have increased the existing Foreign Worker Levy rebates for Work Permit holders from $90 per worker per month to $250 per worker per month, for the period May to December 2021. Measures such as these will help firms to cope. But the crux of the current problem is limited inflow of workers.",18,1234,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01234
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Hence, fourth, we will temporarily allow new PRC construction Work Permit holders to enter Singapore to work first and take their skills certification tests locally, instead of in China. This will allow firms to continue bringing in workers for their projects even though some Chinese Overseas Training Centres had halted operations due to the pandemic.",19,1235,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01235
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"In addition, we have been proactively working with industry associations and firms to explore other ways to resume the inflow of construction Work Permit holders from other source countries safely. We will continue to work with them on additional measures to help alleviate the tight labour situation.",20,1236,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01236
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"In January this year, we had also set up a task force, led by BCA and comprising Government agencies, consultants, as well as trade and professional associations representing developers, contractors, quantity surveyors and architects. The task force is studying how to enhance our standard construction procurement contracts in both the public and the private sectors to mitigate the impact of the current pandemic as well as future crises. For example, we have received feedback that contractors have been buffering for risks in their current tender bids for uncertainty, which has resulted in an increase in tender prices for new contracts. This is understandable as they are worried about unanticipated cost increases due to unexpected developments, twists and turns, during the course of the pandemic.",21,1237,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01237
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),Our new construction contracts ought to enable more equitable risk and cost sharing during pandemic events and crises of this nature.

2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),The Bill seeks to facilitate sharing of the increase in foreign manpower costs between project parties.

2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"First, it will apply to contracts for construction works.

This specifies the period subject to relief, which will be from 1 October 2020 to 30 September 2021, or any extended date as may be prescribed, to tie in with the current end points of relief periods under Part 2 and Part 8B of the Act. It also makes clear that the purpose of the adjustment is to take into consideration the increasing foreign manpower costs of Work Permit holders incurred due to COVID-19 during the relief period.",31,1247,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01247

2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"This is an important point. Construction projects involve many parties, often in long interlocking contractual value chains, and if one goes down, the entire project may be put at risk. Moreover, many of the developers and contractors in the construction sector have long-term relationships. At the end of the day, all stakeholders are part of the same built environment eco-system and, on a project, all parties seek to deliver on that project. And for this eco-system to thrive and grow, stakeholders need to step up to help one another during these challenging times. We encourage all parties affected by the pandemic to negotiate with each other in good faith, before triggering the adjudicatory process set out in this Bill.",33,1249,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01249
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"We have, anecdotally, seen such ""give and take"" in the sector already. For example, some developers we know have given their contractors an extension of time beyond what had been mandated in the existing COTMA for the completion of on-going projects.

These include the recent increase in Foreign Worker Levy rebate and further extension of time for eligible public sector construction projects.",39,1255,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01255

2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"This latest disruption in inflow of migrant workers has shown how vulnerable the construction industry is, because of our over-reliance on low-cost migrant workers.

2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"For example, we will adopt a value chain approach to drive transformation through the new Growth and Transformation Scheme. The scheme recognises that the construction industry works through value chains. It will, therefore, support alliances of firms all along the value chain, from developers and consultants to builders and contractors. Each alliance will develop a business plan to achieve ambitious outcomes in productivity and digitalisation. This would be through the use of productive methods of construction, including Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DfMA), and technology, such as Integrated Digital Delivery, or IDD, as well as efforts to enhance sustainability, workforce development, including the creation of local jobs, business growth and strategic collaboration.",47,1263,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01263
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"This alliance approach seeks to uplift the entire value chain because, given the heavy interdependencies between different segments of the value chain in construction, it is difficult for any one firm to effect significant transformation entirely on its own. We plan to roll out the Growth and Transformation Scheme with a few alliances first, starting in the second half of this year.",48,1264,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01264

As previously announced, we intend to remove the Man-Year-Entitlement (MYE) framework in the near future and replace it with a system that incentivises more productive off-site work.

2021-05-11-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In addition, many public sector projects would also see a hike in construction costs arising from this Bill. In the same vein, I would like to ask the Minister what this would amount to and its impact on the Government's Budget. Separately, has the Ministry considered the impact of the Bill on Town Councils and whether it would be providing assistance to them?",6,1276,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01276
2021-05-11-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Madam, in my discussions with some Qualified Persons, or QPs, and consultants over the weekend, it was made known to me that a small number of contractors are citing problems with meeting project deadlines because of COVID-19 while, at the same time, tendering aggressively and securing contracts for new projects. Earlier this year, the Minister, at a seminar organised by BCA and REDAS, confirmed that construction contracts for the built environment sector are expected to grow to between $23 billion and $28 billion in 2021 as the sector recovers from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was up from the $21.3 billion worth of projects awarded in 2020, even as that figure fell by $10 billion owing to the pandemic.",7,1277,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01277
2021-05-11-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, it would be important to note that the sector comprises construction companies of varying sizes, from big players to small-time subcontractors who could all potentially rely on this Bill for relief. To that end, it would undermine the purpose of this legislation if some companies, particularly larger ones, cite COVID-19 as a reason for higher foreign manpower costs resulting in increased cost for contracting parties or even the public, while at the same time deploying foreign manpower to start on new projects even as their contracts that predate the 1 October 2020 are allowed to proceed slowly, when they may instead be completed forthwith.",8,1278,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01278
2021-05-11-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Madam, while it could be unrealistic to expect construction companies to throttle back on bidding for new projects in order to rely on the relief legislated by this Bill, I hope the Minister can acknowledge this point so that Assessors under clause 79(e) can carefully consider applications for relief made by companies holistically across all the projects undertaken and not just for the specific contract for which relief is sought.",9,1279,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01279
2021-05-11-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In conclusion, Mdm Deputy Speaker, undoubtedly, the construction industry has borne a significant brunt of the COVID-19 restrictions for the past year and I support measures to help them cope. However, rewriting a contract price to one that was not initially agreed to by the parties is a drastic intervention that must be exercised with utmost care.",10,1280,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01280

2021-05-11-T-021,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the measures proposed show the Government's responsiveness in addressing the challenges facing Singapore during the pandemic. The construction industry has a significant impact on our economy. I will make three points.",1,1282,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01282
2021-05-11-T-021,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"First, Mdm Deputy Speaker, we need to continue to help the industry with labour costs. I would like to ask if the current Job Support Scheme (JSS), which is an important lifeline for employers, can be enhanced to help them to tide over this period.",2,1283,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01283
2021-05-11-T-021,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"It is good to know that the rebate for each Work Permit holder in the Construction, Marine and Process sectors will go up from $90 to $250 per month. Will the Ministry consider cutting the foreign worker levy? Labour costs have doubled. For example, I am told that the cost of employing a general worker is now $150 per day and a tiler is now $250 per day. With the current labour crunch, one can foresee staff poaching between companies, which would invariably add on to the cost.",3,1284,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01284
2021-05-11-T-021,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),Can the Government consider more measures to help contractors to meet their higher overheads? Will there be a further review to assist the industry?,4,1285,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01285
2021-05-11-T-021,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Second is to give contractors more breathing space on their project completion schedule. Currently, workers are subject to many screening measures and movement restrictions. All these measures affect work planning and execution, quite apart from the impact on the workers' morale, many of whom are already stressed. Ultimately, contractors are facing a candle that is burning on both ends. While they are scrambling for workers, they are also facing the rising cost of raw materials, which are going up by 30% to 40%, as the projects drag on.",5,1286,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01286
2021-05-11-T-021,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Third, we hope that the Ministry can get the buy-in of developers and Government agencies, to understand the difficulties faced by the construction companies. Contractors are just as anxious to get their jobs completed, as are the developers and the various Government agencies overseeing public projects.",6,1287,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01287
2021-05-11-T-021,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),The closure of travel from the traditional labour markets is like denying water supply to runners taking part in an endurance race in the desert. Government agencies are using the BCA template and agencies are pressing the contractors to meet their deadlines. This is almost oblivious of the dilemma facing the construction industry.,7,1288,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01288
2021-05-11-T-021,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"There has to be a coordinated approach to this whole problem, besides just giving financial support to contractors. These agencies managing public projects must also review their contract terms.",8,1289,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01289
2021-05-11-T-021,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"In conclusion, Mdm Deputy Speaker, the measures in the Bill will help solve some of these issues facing the construction industry. But we can do more. I stand in support of the Bill.",9,1290,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01290

2021-05-11-T-021,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, this third suite of proposed amendments to the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act of 2020 is aimed at providing additional flexibility for contracts pertaining to construction works affected by cost escalations resulting from delays and restrictions imposed because of COVID-19 management measures, and allows them to be renegotiated.",1,1292,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01292
2021-05-11-T-021,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"I wish to offer just three brief points of intervention. The first two are of a more practical nature about the scope of coverage for this set of amendments and whether there are better ways to design our labour exchange. The third point is of a more fundamental nature about the productivity, or lack thereof, in our construction industry.",2,1293,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01293
2021-05-11-T-021,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"First, while I understand that the construction sector has been the most severely affected by the COVID-19 restrictions and that construction projects tend to be the sort where cost projections can be most rapidly invalidated by changing conditions, one is, nevertheless, left to wonder why other sectors with large numbers of non-traditional source (NTS) workers were not included in the scope for contract renegotiation. After all, in operating our Town Councils, we are also aware of the heavy reliance of our contractors on NTS workers in our conservancy operations. Agri-tech and certain process industries also rely relatively heavily on foreign worker inflows.",3,1294,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01294
2021-05-11-T-021,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"While I recognise that these are comparatively smaller sectors, it is unclear why these have not been considered for additional support, even if they may be similarly afflicted. It strikes me as more sensible to allow for the coverage of these amendments to apply to all firms that are able to demonstrate harm rather than by economic sector per se.",4,1295,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01295
2021-05-11-T-021,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Second, and relatedly, I am wondering about the current efforts of this Government to ease the reallocation of workers already in Singapore between firms. During the round-up speech on the previous set of amendments to the Bill, Minister of State Tan Kiat How referred to the establishment of a SCAL Construction Manpower Exchange or SCMX, meant to ease the transition of workers from one employer to the next. I fully support this idea; not least because it promotes greater efficiency, but also because it serves to further alleviate the risk of the need to constantly introduce new workers, some of whom may inadvertently harbour the virus even after serving the necessary quarantine protocols, as we have seen demonstrated in recent times.",5,1296,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01296
2021-05-11-T-021,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),I wonder if the Ministry would be willing to share an update first on the status of the SCMX thus far.,6,1297,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01297
2021-05-11-T-021,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Ultimately, my concerns are about the success of the SCMX in practice. Employers who subsequently lose contracts may see a competitive reason to send their workers back, rather than avail them to the exchange. Indeed, in the second half of 2020, we lost some 41,500 workers due to expiring permits.",7,1298,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01298
2021-05-11-T-021,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Thus, while they may well save on repatriation costs if they were to relinquish their workers, firms may feel that not releasing their NTS workers could damage their competitors' viability. And the threat of doing so may further favour their own position as incumbents since only they have a guaranteed pool of workers.",8,1299,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01299
2021-05-11-T-021,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"While workers may easily request a transfer at the moment as long as they have the employer's agreement between the 40th and 21st day prior to the expiry of their permit, some employers could simply choose to renew the permit first, then subsequently cancel the permit less than three weeks prior to the original end date.",9,1300,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01300
2021-05-11-T-021,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Anecdotally, we have received feedback that such practices are far from uncommon. I am left to wonder if the Ministry has considered how to better refine the system.",10,1301,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01301
2021-05-11-T-021,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"My Aljunied GRC colleague, Mr Gerald Giam, had previously suggested to this House that workers should be permitted to request a transfer as early as the 56th day, the same time that the employer is required to renew.",11,1302,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01302
2021-05-11-T-021,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Another suggestion that I am presenting today is to mandate the employers who wish to otherwise send their NTS workers home, to instead release them directly to the exchange. The Ministry can then play the role of match-maker, absorbing workers into a roster. The firm giving up workers will place their repatriation costs into an escrow account to be managed by the Ministry. These funds, net of costs for those workers who wish to be returned home, will be released to the firm if another company subsequently hires the workers. Hiring companies, in lieu of paying for the search, travel and quarantine costs of new workers, can instead be tasked with financing the short-term room and board for in-situ workers.",12,1303,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01303
2021-05-11-T-021,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"My third point, Mdm Deputy Speaker, concerns the construction sector in general. It is well-known that for the productivity challenges that we have faced in our economy, the construction sector has been even worse off. While some have objected to this characterisation, most observers, including reports issued by academia, policy-makers and even the industry itself, have recognised how the sector lags in terms of productivity.",13,1304,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01304
2021-05-11-T-021,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"The justifications have been varied  from purported low skills of workers, especially related to a large transient foreign worker pool, to inadequate project planning, to inadequate mechanisation.",14,1305,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01305
2021-05-11-T-021,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"One common theme runs through these many explanations. And it is simply this  with steady access to a large pool of foreign construction workers, most paid at very low wages, it is unsurprising that firms rationally choose to substitute capital with labour, and skilled workers with unskilled ones. This will go on as long as it is cheaper to bring in two or three low-cost workers to do the job of one higher skilled but undeniably more costly worker.",15,1306,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01306
2021-05-11-T-021,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"While one may simply argue that this reflects marginal cost calculations on the part of construction firms, this practice is, ultimately, to the detriment of more than just productivity per se. The challenges – and dare we say additional cost – of managing COVID-19 in the presence of a large low-cost foreign worker workforce reveal that there are additional costs external to each firm that are not fully accounted for when we rely on this labour-intensive model.",16,1307,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01307
2021-05-11-T-021,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Moreover, by keeping wages low in this sector, there is limited incentive to rapidly scale up productivity, whether in terms of attaining modern construction skills or adopting appropriate safety-related best practices or acquiring new equipment and machinery. The result could be reduced quality of our constructed buildings – a factor not well captured by the dollars and cents reflected in project costing.",17,1308,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01308
2021-05-11-T-021,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"May I suggest then, Madam, that one unexpected implication of increased cost from construction is that it could, ironically, be the catalyst toward finally weaning off our sector from its low-cost, low-skilled foreigner worker model – a move so desperately needed for raising construction productivity. If so, we would do well to carefully monitor the capital-labour deployment in the industry over the next few years and, if proven efficacious for raising productivity, consider implementing measures to support high wages in this sector.",18,1309,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01309

2021-05-11-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Madam, this pandemic has been one whiplash after another for our construction sector. The latest whiplash comes from the surge of cases in India. It has forced us to bar entry for all work pass holders from there. This means the industry’s manpower crunch will continue and even worsen.",1,1336,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01336
2021-05-11-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),This Bill allows contractors to adjust the monetary sums of contracts that have not yet been completed. This will help contractors cope with the increased manpower costs.,2,1337,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01337
2021-05-11-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"However, as raised in my previous speech on the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment No 2) Bill, it remains unclear whether yet again allowing modifications of agreed-upon contracts is a lasting solution. Ultimately, we are talking about labour supply problems that may be long run, given that the pandemic shows no signs of abating in many developing countries.",3,1338,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01338
2021-05-11-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"On that, I have three points of clarifications.",4,1339,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01339
2021-05-11-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My first point is about temporarily allowing workers to get their skills certified here in Singapore. Typically, migrant workers looking to join our construction sector must first enrol in Overseas Testing Centres (OTCs) within their home countries. At these OTCs, they must complete either the Skills Evaluation Certificate (SEC) or Skills Evaluation Certificate (Knowledge) (SEC(K)), which certify that the worker qualifies as Basic-Skilled construction workers.",5,1340,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01340
2021-05-11-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"On 5 May, BCA introduced an exemption. For six months, workers from China can obtain their skills certification in Singapore rather than in their home country. This reduces the bottleneck in China, where some OTCs remain closed, and helps alleviate our labour supply crunch.",6,1341,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01341
2021-05-11-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Can the Minister clarify what is the usual passing rate of the SEC and SEC(K) tests in each country’s OTCs? For areas where the passing rate is usually quite high, can the Government consider introducing similar temporary exemptions from other source countries? For instance, there remain OTCs that are closed in Myanmar and Thailand. This can help to temporarily alleviate the supply crunch without compromising on the skill requirements we have set.",7,1342,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01342
2021-05-11-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My second point is about expanding the list of source countries which we debated earlier. We have always restricted the list of countries from which each industry can hire Work Pass holders. For the construction sector, the list is Malaysia, China, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and South Korea.",8,1343,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01343
2021-05-11-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Can the Government explain the basis for restricting this list of source countries? Can the Government also consider expanding the list of source countries? There are likely other countries where migrant workers with basic skills can be found. Indeed, times like this highlight the risks of over-relying on a limited number of source countries.",9,1344,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01344
2021-05-11-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Let me clarify that expanding the list of source countries can align with our goal of moving the industry towards increased productivity. With a more diverse supply pool, it might become easier to find higher skilled workers. We then could move towards raising our skills requirements for what counts as Basic Skilled or Higher Skilled, as well as tapering off the number of lower skilled migrant workers in the sector.",10,1345,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01345
2021-05-11-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My third point is about the impact on Government expenses. Will this Bill result in the Government ending up spending more on construction projects than previously expected, as contract sums get adjusted upwards?",11,1346,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01346
2021-05-11-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"While I understand that the final impact will have to be quantified by Assessors, who will have to look at applications on a case-by-case basis, has the Government at least estimated the range of increased costs that it will have to bear as a result of potential contract adjustments?",12,1347,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01347
2021-05-11-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"It is likely that, at any given time, the Government is the largest spender on construction contracts in Singapore. We must help the construction sector but we must also find the balance and guard against the possibility that all of our yet-to-complete projects see ballooning costs as a result of this legislative amendment. Madam, notwithstanding my clarifications, I stand in support of this Bill.",13,1348,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01348
2021-05-11-T-021,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a broader point that goes beyond the focus on the construction industry that is covered by this Bill.",1,1349,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01349
2021-05-11-T-021,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"In confronting the new challenges facing our country with the new clusters of community cases in recent weeks, it is important that we and members of the public avoid false dichotomies. In particular, we must avoid the false dichotomy that in formulating policy, we have to choose between one of only two options  either close borders to save lives or open borders to save the economy. The presumption is that we should prioritise human well-being at some cost to the economy, so that keeping the borders open is tantamount to choosing to place the economy above human lives.",2,1350,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01350
2021-05-11-T-021,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"In reality, closing the borders also imposes costs on human well-being, a point I think that has been made by several people, but let us think about that.",3,1351,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01351
2021-05-11-T-021,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"Stricter border controls that make it more difficult to obtain the help of foreign domestic workers to take care of our elderly citizens, for example, reduce our senior citizens' well-being. Restricting the entry of foreign workers from certain countries with high incidence of COVID-19 infections would delay the completion of many construction projects, including BTO flats. This would have an impact on plans for starting a family for many people. Companies that have a high reliance on foreign workers might go out of business which would cause citizen workers their jobs as well. The loss of jobs means not only a loss of income but also imposes costs on the well-being of the retrenched workers and their family members.",4,1352,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01352
2021-05-11-T-021,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"Increasing the quarantine period from 14 days to 21 days for international travellers except for those from a few countries with lower infection rates, provides some degree of safety for our citizens. However, even then, the economy will not benefit fully from international economic integration as it did during the pre-COVID-19 days.",5,1353,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01353
2021-05-11-T-021,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"Instead of thinking about binary choices, like whether to keep borders closed or open, our policy has to adapt to unforeseen circumstances that the evolving pandemic presents to us by improving trade-offs. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented Singapore with two important trade-offs.",6,1354,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01354
2021-05-11-T-021,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"The first trade-off is between the saving of jobs and protection from the virus. The circuit breaker introduced last year shut down non-essential businesses in order to limit the spread of the virus. The adoption of measures like safe distancing and the mandatory wearing of masks helped to reduce the crucial parameter known as the reproduction rate – the parameter that gives the number of people an infectious person will infect over the whole course of their disease in a fully susceptible population. Those measures help to improve the trade-off so that, for a given level of protection of health, more business activity could resume.",7,1355,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01355
2021-05-11-T-021,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"The second trade-off is between international economic integration and national control of the pandemic.

2021-05-11-T-021,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"While testing and imposing quarantine orders on foreigners help to reduce the risk of community spread caused by imported cases, implementing travel bubbles requires both countries to have effective national control of the pandemic.",9,1357,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01357
2021-05-11-T-021,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"Restricting entry of foreign workers from countries with a high incidence of COVID-19 infections and turning to alternative sources with lower infection rates seek to undo the adverse shift in trade-off to some degree. Source countries might also impose travel restrictions on their own citizens travelling to Singapore, which require Singapore-based firms to look elsewhere for workers. So, turning to alternative sources of foreign workers has business consequences as wage costs might increase, which this Bill seeks to address.",10,1358,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01358
2021-05-11-T-021,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, we need to recognise that as an outward-oriented economy, even while there is effort suggested by Members of the House to raise the productivity of the construction sector and make it less labour-intensive, that is something that will take time. So, there are inevitable costs that will have to be borne with the spike of new cases in several parts of the world even as we seek to achieve what we regard as an optimal trade-off.",11,1359,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01359

2021-05-11-T-021,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"One, the number of construction workers in the built sector continues to shrink. Even before the recent halt to new incoming migrant workers from the Indian subcontinent, many construction companies saw their workforce reduced by 15% to 30% due to higher than usual attrition.",3,1363,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01363
2021-05-11-T-021,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Among projects, there are uneven manpower availability among different layers of contractors. Post-COVID-19 projects, given higher margin, are able to marshal more manpower resources. Pre-COVID-19 projects are languishing as everybody is worried about the viability of these projects. And because of the labour shortage, we are seeing some workers asking for daily wages of more than $250.",4,1364,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01364
2021-05-11-T-021,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"The majority in the construction industry, I must say, understand the need for the recent curbs on new inflow of migrant workers. Nevertheless, the reality is that the manpower shortage will only get worse in the coming months.",5,1365,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01365
2021-05-11-T-021,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Two, the industry is experiencing a surge in construction materials pricing. For example, the price of iron ore has shot up more than 27% since the end of last year.",6,1366,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01366
2021-05-11-T-021,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Three, construction companies are facing financing difficulties. As of now, the strongest companies – those with a good number of post-COVID-19 projects, high margins and sizeable reserves – are able to get adequate financing. However, most companies are struggling to get financing from banks. Based on industry feedback, a number of them, I was told, are resorting to tapping on financing companies and are paying financing costs of around 10%.",7,1367,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01367

2021-05-11-T-021,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"First, the sharing of the extra manpower costs from project delays as well as the manpower levy rebate of $250 are extremely helpful to the financial sustainability of the industry.",9,1369,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01369
2021-05-11-T-021,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Second, increasing the length of time for projects will help because, for some projects, they can wait out the current spike in material cost, as well as the sizeable manpower shortage.",10,1370,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01370
2021-05-11-T-021,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Three, easing of restrictions on Chinese workers is helpful. However, I do want to caution that beyond the large Chinese construction companies, many local construction companies may not have the links to recruit sufficient Chinese manpower given the current shortage of construction workers in China. And the salaries of Chinese workers in the construction sector are two to three times more expensive than those from the Indian subcontinent.",11,1371,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01371
2021-05-11-T-021,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"And it is not easy to persuade Chinese workers to do the full range of jobs, even if we can persuade them to come to Singapore.",12,1372,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01372
2021-05-11-T-021,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Beyond the measures announced today, I hope that MND can continue to pre-empt this unfolding industry crisis. We have to plan for the worst. For example, it may not be possible for us to bring in migrant workers from the Indian subcontinent for many months, or even beyond a year's time. And even if we want to diversify the source of migrant workers from the rest of developing Asia, it is also very difficult to predict whether those countries will see a surge in infection that we see in India. We must also plan the possibility of another circuit breaker, should community spread become more prevalent in Singapore.",13,1373,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01373
2021-05-11-T-021,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Over the past few weeks, I have been working with the built sector to come up with some proposals that can form our contingency plan, should the situation deteriorate significantly. Let me elaborate.",14,1374,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01374
2021-05-11-T-021,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"One, we can introduce more short-term measures to better utilise our existing workers in the sector. For example, we can temporarily increase the allowable age for migrant workers to stay in Singapore from 50 to 55 years old, and to potentially up to 60 years old with regular medical reviews. There are many different kinds of jobs, some are not as strenuous as others. Let us trust that our companies can strike the right balance, as we increase the age in the short run.",15,1375,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01375
2021-05-11-T-021,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Another possibility is to get the construction companies and safety community to explore urgent and temporary measures to increase the allowable man-hours. Based on industry feedback, the work intensity in many sites have reduced due to increased delays in material arrival and decreased subcontractor productivity. For selected work sites, can workers be given the option of working during their off-days, if it is clear that they have more rest during the normal days, due to decreased work intensity? Of course, these proposals must be carefully considered and implemented, but we are in a crisis and we need to explore all options.",16,1376,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01376
2021-05-11-T-021,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Two, we must urgently explore new sources of manpower. Many of us agree that the situation in India is extremely dire and it could take a while to sort out. But we must diversify and explore other countries, knowing fully well that we cannot predict which sources will eventually come through for us.",17,1377,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01377
2021-05-11-T-021,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"As such, could the Government consider new sources of migrant construction workers, such as Cambodia, Laos, even the Riau Islands in Indonesia?",18,1378,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01378
2021-05-11-T-021,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Beyond the new sources, we must also ensure that migrant workers are free of COVID-19 when they come to Singapore. Therefore, is it possible for the Government to work with the built sector to set up and operate processing and quarantine centres in these countries? This will ensure that testing is done by trusted vendors, perhaps even using our own test kits. The facilities and cleanliness operations are managed by our stringent standards. Workers can use dedicated transport, operated by us, to come to Singapore. And upon arrival, we can test again and vaccinate the workers immediately, while they undergo further quarantine. It will take us a while to get this going and some of these sources, even after we invest time and effort, may not work out. Therefore, I hope that our Government can actively pursue various options as quickly as possible.",19,1379,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01379
2021-05-11-T-021,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Three, should the labour shortage continue, we can consider postponing new infrastructure projects, at least the big ones, or at least the construction phase of these new projects. Of course, the planning part of the project can go through, but we must reduce construction demand when we have a vastly reduced manpower supply, or the excess demand will lead to unnecessary cost surge.",20,1380,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01380

2021-05-11-T-021,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"As such, the industry hopes that the Government can allow as much work to continue, even during a circuit breaker, by ensuring that the construction sites remain as air-tight as possible.

And he had given some examples he heard anecdotally about the agencies using a template to press contractors. I seek the Member's support to provide specific details so that we can look into these concerns that have been raised. Based on what we know so far, the only template our agencies had been circulating to contractors is one with regard to prolongation cost submissions. In fact, the agencies are pressing the contractors to submit their claims for prolongation costs, because these agencies want to lean forward to help these firms cope with the non-manpower related cost increases in these projects. So, perhaps, for us to check the facts.",3,1398,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01398
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"But I do agree with the Member that we need to adopt an even stronger collaborative posture during this crisis. As I have said during the opening speech, at this time in the sector, where there are many interlocking relationships of many stakeholders, if one goes down, the entire project is in peril, and we all have to lean forward and help one another. This applies to both Government agencies as well as private developers.",4,1399,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01399

2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To provide some context, BCA had earlier consulted the industry on possible measures to help alleviate the manpower crunch in the construction sector. SCAL, the contractors association, had suggested exercising flexibility on the skills entry requirements, in particular for PRC Work Permit holders, as they are highly skilled in key trades, such as carpentry and structural works, as compared to workers from other countries.

In addition, employers must not make their employees work for more than 12 hours a day, including overtime, with a limit of 72 hours of overtime in a month. Extending working hours beyond this could lead to fatigue and compromise workers’ safety.

And those BTOs that have already been sold are already sold. The prices will not change. Likewise, for new BTO contracts, we do not price HDB BTOs to recover construction costs or land costs. Certainly, it will cost more as a whole but this is not a factor in determining the price that we set for BTO prices.",22,1417,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01417

Because what we have seen during this crisis is that contractors are buffering up for uncertainty because they do not know what twists and turns there are in the road ahead, as many of them had found to their detriment in the last year. And, therefore, tender prices, as a whole, for both the public and private sectors, we see an increase.",23,1418,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01418

Fundamentally, as I have said repeatedly, both here in this House and also in other settings, we need to work closely with the industry to continue our multi-year effort to transform the sector to become more productive, to grow good local jobs, to reduce overall reliance on low-skilled foreign manpower, for longer term resilience and sustainability.",28,1423,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01423

2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mr Leong's point that the Government makes no effort to push productivity in the construction sector, that we do not create local jobs or create opportunities for Singaporeans, befuddles me. I was just exchanging notes with Minister of State Tan Kiat How because, during COS, that was really the gist of what we were saying. And if the Member would read and re-read Minister of State Tan Kiat How's speech, he gave example after example of Singaporeans who were describing their journey into the construction sector, seeing how the sector has evolved, how technology has created a niche for them, enabled them to build more productively. Old timers who have seen how construction has moved from 2D to 3D using automation; and young entrants, being very excited that the construction sector is becoming far more high-tech, digitalised, connected, interconnected, multi-disciplinary. All this work is happening at great speed but we are pushing hard.",33,1428,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01428

As a result of the efforts over the many years, both regulatory efforts, for example, when we pushed up the buildability score, builders have to meet with certain buildability score before they are allowed to build GLS sites with preconditions of productivity and methods of construction before you can develop the land. All these efforts, including the grants in the Construction Productivity and Capability Fund (CPCF), the new Growth and Transformation Scheme, our PIP scheme – all these are a suite of measures.

We award to Singaporeans in ITE, Polytechnic and University, scholarships for young, bright, energetic, Singaporeans who want to venture into this sector, into architecture, into building, into M&E, into the digital space for construction. We pay the bulk of the scholarship, more than 80% of their studies. The industry pays up to 20%.

But in the meantime, what is this House asked to decide at the end of this night? And that is our sector, construction firms, Singapore firms, construction firms which are faced with a severe manpower crunch, asked to deliver projects, that notwithstanding all the support the Government has given on various fronts that I have articulated, they are short of workers. What we are saying is that because the costs have increased beyond their expectation at the point in time when they bidded for these contracts, should we or should we not pass legislation to facilitate the sharing of these additional costs? A framework which nudges dialogue and discussion but, beyond which, we put in an adjudicatory framework to ensure that costs are fairly shared.",39,1434,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01434

Because I recall him saying, ""Do not bring in foreign workers. Let the contractors take this time during this crisis to learn how to live with less foreign workers."" I hope I was mistaken but perhaps the Member could confirm  does he support this Bill? Does he support the need to help the whole sector during this time? Does he support the need to alleviate the suffering and pain that the construction sector is under, which will then have knock-on effects on home buyers, property buyers and companies and businesses who are waiting for their properties?

2021-05-11-T-021,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Okay, okay. Yes, thank you. The other thing is that when we give all this assistance to the construction companies, do we actually tie the companies down for future improvements in their processes and automation, and also employing our local workers? This is the second question.",1,1455,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01455
2021-05-11-T-021,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"The third question is, if the answers to both the first and the two questions are along the line that is positive, then I would agree that I will support of the Bill and the Government can act according to its discretion to bring in the foreign workers.",2,1456,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01456

2021-05-11-T-021,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for National Development and Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I just wanted to clarify something that the hon Member said, just for my own understanding. Is the hon Member saying that all our Singaporean delivery persons should become construction workers? I was just trying to understand; is that what the Member is saying?",1,1458,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01458
2021-05-11-T-021,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Minister, yes. I think some Singaporeans – because there are like about 100,000 gig workers in Singapore – and then, there are also Singaporeans who are unemployed. Given this COVID-19 environment now, if you raise the wages high enough, there is a threshold that I think Singaporeans will come in, even as a general construction worker. That is my perception. Thank you. Please enlighten me.",1,1459,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01459
2021-05-11-T-021,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,Minister.,1,1460,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01460
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,I thank the Member for clarifying that his proposal is to replace general foreign workers – the R1 and R2 workers who do the building onsite – with Singaporeans. And he is focusing principally on those who are doing food delivery.,1,1461,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01461
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,Our approach is different. Our approach is different. Our approach is in recognition that the processes need to be significantly re-orientated. The processes need to be changed and enhanced in order to create a good job for Singaporeans – a job which commands the level of productivity and skills that warrant the kinds of pay that I think the Member is talking about.,2,1462,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01462
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"He does not have a figure but he is talking about increasing the pay until a threshold where Singaporeans come in. Whereas for him, he thinks if you increase the pay, Singaporeans, including delivery drivers and riders, will do the jobs that current workers from India, Bangladesh and other source countries are doing, as they are.",3,1463,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01463
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"But what we are saying is that, yes, we need to pay the Singaporean more, but the job has to be different and it is not just as the Member suggests – architects, engineers or consultants but even builders. Even builders. But that requires mechanisation and automation. I visited once an Integrated Construction and Prefabrication Hub (ICPH), which is a precast hub yard. They are actually building rooms, building panels for construction and Singaporeans are doing those jobs. But it is very different from the kind of job that the Member envisions Singaporeans will be doing.",4,1464,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01464
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"So, it is a different strategy. At the end of the day, even as we automate, even as we increase productivity – as both Mr Leong Mun Wai and Assoc Prof Jamus Lim say we should – there will still be a need for some foreign workers. We hope they will be more skilled. We will keep them in our sector, keep them here, to supplement the core of Singaporeans that we want to build for the sector. And I seek the Members' support for this.",5,1465,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01465

2021-05-11-T-021,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence, I would like to begin with a point of clarification. I had erroneously stated that the Member Gerald Giam had indicated earlier that he had suggested permitting worker transfers from the 56th day onwards. Gerald had shared with me that he plans to advance this proposal but has not, in fact, done so in this House. So, I wish to clarify this for the record.",1,1467,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01467
2021-05-11-T-021,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"In terms of a quick clarification question for the Minister, I thank him for his clear articulation of efforts via the ITM to transform the sector by allowing costs to rise. As he rightly pointed out, I am fully in support of this general principle. But I should also note that we spent many hours earlier debating over what seems to anyone not in the industry to be a severe reluctance to even entertain a small escalation in the transportation cost of construction workers.",2,1468,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01468
2021-05-11-T-021,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"So, my question then is whether the Minister believes that the construction ITM has truly made headway in changing mindsets and behaviours and, if not, what is the timeline for which we can expect an actual change such that we will see increases in wages?",3,1469,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01469
2021-05-11-T-021,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,Minister Desmond Lee.,1,1470,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01470
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Madam, I had said both at COS as well as just moments ago that we are looking at making significant changes to the foreign manpower strategy for the construction sector. We have steadied the sector for it. They recognise that this is going to be painful. But we will make some significant moves starting from next year, including doing away with the MYE framework, moving to one in which it biases towards more productive offsite work. And there are opportunities then for Singaporeans to come into the sector. And not just raise the wages of the foreign workers. But even those foreign workers working offsite will have to be more skilled to operate the machinery and, therefore, the wages will have to be higher – because they are more productive and more skilled.",1,1471,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01471
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"But the same time, we will also tighten on the dependency ratio ceiling. We are studying how to make those moves to push the sector to be more lean. We are pushing on multiple fronts, not just on worker numbers and quotas; not just in making it expensive to construct. But it has to be more productive and command better salaries.",2,1472,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01472
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The Member spoke earlier about a proposal that his colleague Mr Gerald Giam did not yet make to this House. So, I thank him for his clarification. It is a proposal, I presume, we will be expecting shortly. And I presume MOM will be looking forward to that.",3,1473,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01473
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"But I remember the Member saying in his speech that it is important to retain the existing foreign workers in Singapore. I am fully in agreement with him. My colleague from MOM will also agree. Given the worker shortage, I think both Assoc Prof Jamus Lim and we in the Government feel that it is important for employers to work with their existing foreign workers, look at their remuneration, look at their work conditions and, of course, find ways to encourage them to continue to stay in the sector.",4,1474,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01474
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"But I have some questions about this. The Member talked about, well, SCMX is one, which is actually SCAL's effort to help to provide a marketplace for workers within Singapore so that they move employers, rather than be sent back. But his proposal – or what he says is Mr Gerald Giam's upcoming proposal – is to, in effect, make it easier for workers to move from one employer to another.",5,1475,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01475
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"If you speak with contractors, including the small subcontractors that the Leader of the Opposition has spoken to, what they are most concerned about and unhappy about over the last few months, is precisely worker poaching. You have a worker working with you, suddenly he is gone and it is because of moves and flexibilities which now the Member would like to enhance that will probably exacerbate this worker poaching.",6,1476,2021-05-11-T-021-S-01476
2021-05-11-T-021,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"MOM and SCAL's approach is different, recognising that the rule that the Member talks about was for a different time and a different era.

2021-05-11-T-023,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The Government should provide two child car seats to every taxi and PHC currently on the road. Since it is given free, passengers should be able to use them for free, too.",17,1502,2021-05-11-T-023-S-01502

2021-05-11-T-023,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Child car seats are extremely effective at protecting children. This is an indisputable fact. The World Health Organization states that a child car seat reduces the risk of injury by up to 90%. Doctors at our own KKH found that a child not in a child car seat was 8.4 times more likely to be seriously injured in a road accident.,19,1504,2021-05-11-T-023-S-01504

2021-05-11-T-023,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Let me give an example of how my proposal would help. I spoke to Eva, a young mother. One night, having travelled out on an MRT, she decided to return home in a taxi. She normally brings child car seats, but this ride was unplanned. Instead, since it was also just a short journey, she held her daughter in her arms and sat her son next to her. This one time that she did not use child car seats was the one time that she got into an accident. A lorry crashed into their taxi. Her daughter was flung out of her arms and fell on the floor. She shared with me that she always thought she could hold on to her daughter if an accident like that happened. By a stroke of luck, the kids did not suffer serious injuries. But there was a lot of trauma. For weeks, the children faced nightmares.",25,1510,2021-05-11-T-023-S-01510

As Eva's story shows, accidents can happen to anybody and when it strikes, no parent can be 100% sure that they can hold on and protect their children.",26,1511,2021-05-11-T-023-S-01511
2021-05-11-T-023,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"For parents like Eva, my proposal means they will need to carry fewer or even no child car seats when going out. When it comes to child car seats, convenience means safety.",27,1512,2021-05-11-T-023-S-01512
2021-05-11-T-023,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The second benefit of my proposal is lower costs. As Senior Parliamentary Secretary Mr Baey points out, low costs for parents should be a priority in this pandemic economy. He pointed to existing ride options that already provide child car seats. But these recommendations are not price-competitive. A GrabFamily car costs more, sometimes much more, than a typical Grab ride and is harder to find.",28,1513,2021-05-11-T-023-S-01513
2021-05-11-T-023,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"By contrast, my proposal allows parents to use child car seats at no costs and they can shop for the cheapest taxi or PHC provider they can find.

2021-05-11-T-023,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The third benefit of my proposal is fewer driver-passenger conflicts. Ask any PHC driver and they will tell you stories about driving a long way to the pick-up point, only to find that the passenger has brought their children. These drivers have to turn the passengers away. The parents get confused; they get upset. They ask, ""How come I can bring my child in a taxi but not your car?""",30,1515,2021-05-11-T-023-S-01515
2021-05-11-T-023,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My proposal makes this a non-issue. Every taxi and PHC will have child car seats. There is no reason for any driver to turn away any parent anymore or risk breaking the law. All taxis and PHC drivers will have an increased customer base and can potentially earn more because of this. PHC drivers will also be happy to spend less time travelling to passengers they cannot pick up. Parents will be happy to avoid wasting their own time and money. Everyone is happy.

2021-05-11-T-023,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Let me also address concerns about space. Taxis and PHCs have to carry whatever barang barang commuters bring. How can they squeeze two child car seats into storage? Here, I want to emphasise one thing. Technology has evolved. Today's child car seats are not just the large clunky ones you have known for decades. You can see for yourself how small they are  this child car seat is for children aged nine months to four years old and this seat is for those aged four years old and above.

Again, taxi and PHC drivers were shocked when I show them how I take just one minute and 16 seconds to set up the two car seats, including buckling my daughters up in them. You can see the video on my social media platforms. This is faster than helping a passenger in a wheelchair to board a taxi and not much longer than helping passengers with many bags arrange them in the boot.",36,1521,2021-05-11-T-023-S-01521
2021-05-11-T-023,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The third and final concern is about costs. Rather than impose costs on parents and taxi and PHC drivers, my proposal asks that the Government steps in to provide these child car seats. So, how much will it cost to deck an island of taxis and PHCs with these child car seats?",37,1522,2021-05-11-T-023-S-01522
2021-05-11-T-023,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I checked and have a quote ready. It is $15,050,620. Here is the exact quotation I have got for MOT.

2021-05-11-T-023,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Madam, with a public tender, I am sure the final cost would be far lower. This amount is not a lot, compared to similar projects. After a boy was flung out of his school bus in a road accident in 2008, we set aside more than twice the amount – $35 million – to retrofit seat belts in small buses. More recently, we are also spending around $15 million in grants and incentives to reduce the dangers from PMDs.",39,1524,2021-05-11-T-023-S-01524
2021-05-11-T-023,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I will also add that this cost-benefit analysis needs to go beyond the cost of these seats themselves.,40,1525,2021-05-11-T-023-S-01525

2021-05-11-T-023,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The Government could tie up with taxi operators, ride-hailing companies, the National Taxi Association and the National Private Hire Vehicles Association. There could be joint marketing campaigns – from banners on our streets to notifications on apps to in-vehicle stickers for raising awareness on child car seats. As an added bonus, helping parents learn about child car seats in taxis and PHCs will also encourage them to use them in their own cars, if they eventually buy one.",47,1532,2021-05-11-T-023-S-01532

I am glad that KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) already includes a child car seat in its packing checklist for parents admitting for delivery.

2021-05-11-T-023,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"To help parents, hospitals could provide infant car seats at a low price. I understand there were previous discussions with hospitals about supplying a subsidised infant car seat costing as low as $99. In fact, there are options out in the market now costing as low as $79. These are easy to carry and can fit easily onto a stroller. Hospitals can sell these to parents who do not have infant car seats ready at the point of discharge.",50,1535,2021-05-11-T-023-S-01535
2021-05-11-T-023,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I hope the Government can facilitate a pilot like this. Again, with a public tender and buying in bulk, I am sure the price will be even cheaper. The price of these seats can also be added to the hospital bill. To help lower income families manage costs, this can then be covered by MediFund where needed. We can also consider allowing parents to use their Child Development Account to pay for this infant car seat.",51,1536,2021-05-11-T-023-S-01536
2021-05-11-T-023,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Finally, I call on the Government to study the impact of my proposals, collect additional data on car accidents involving children and study the experiences of other countries, all with an eye to reviewing whether our laws should be updated to make child car seats compulsory in taxis. In addition, jurisdictions, such as Germany, California and New South Wales, already require the use of child car seats in taxis.

The Government then replied, let us think carefully about this; after all, there has been no serious injuries for the past six years.

Using an appropriate car restraint reduces this risk several folds. They can be flung from the car seat if unrestrained and develop head injuries which can cause brain damage.

Over the years, there have been concerns about bulky child seats taking up significant boot space in taxis and the time taken to install and remove them for each trip.

For example, after the September 2015 General Election, ELD issued the press release on the inspection of the non-voter lists on 15 October 2015 and reminded non-voters to apply early to restore their names to the Registers so that they can vote at future elections. General Election (GE) 2020 took place subsequently in July 2020. Thus, non-voters at the 2015 General Election or earlier elections had more than four years to restore their names to the Registers so that they are eligible to vote at GE2020. The non-voter lists for GE2020 was issued in October last year and I strongly encourage non-voters at GE2020 to restore their names early so that they can vote at the next election.",3,1605,2021-05-11-T-029-S-01605

After GE2015, and prior to GE2020, the Registers were updated and certified three times, most recently in April 2020. During these exercises, ELD also issues press releases to inform Singaporeans that the lists of Singaporeans eligible to vote at the next election can be inspected at various touchpoints, such as the ELD website, community centres or clubs, at ELD premises, or at Singapore overseas missions which serve as overseas registration centres. Singaporeans who are non-voters are encouraged to take the necessary steps to restore their names to the Registers.",4,1606,2021-05-11-T-029-S-01606

For example, after the 2015 General Election, ELD conducted two such notification exercises in 2016 and 2019. To make it easy and convenient for non-voters to restore their names, non-voters merely have to scan a QR code in the letter to access ELD’s online services. Alternatively, non-voters can bring along the letter and apply in person at any community centre/club, at the Elections Department or at selected Singapore overseas missions.",5,1607,2021-05-11-T-029-S-01607

As voting is compulsory in Singapore, any non-voter without a valid reason for not voting will be required to pay a penalty fee of $50. However, for those with valid reasons for not voting, ELD will restore their names without any penalty. These include studying or working overseas, on overseas vacation, on medical leave, hospitalised, bedridden, mental incapacity and so on, such that they are unable to go to the polling stations to vote on Polling Day.",6,1608,2021-05-11-T-029-S-01608

The cessation is required so that ELD can finalise the Registers and proceed with downstream preparatory activities, such as the printing and mailing of the poll cards and preparing the polling station registers. Finalising the Registers and making available the finalised Registers to candidates and political parties also help to ensure the integrity of the electoral system, as it makes clear to all parties and candidates who the voters in their respective constituencies are. As I have explained, ELD reminds non-voters to restore their names to the Registers of Electors as early as a few months after the previous election. As such, non-voters have more than enough time to restore their names before the next election.",7,1609,2021-05-11-T-029-S-01609

When the Registers are prepared or revised, ELD will also remind eligible overseas Singaporeans, via press releases, to register early as overseas voters if they wish to vote at one of the 10 overseas polling stations. For those who may not have come across the news carried by the Singapore media, ELD works with MFA and the Singapore Global Network (SGN) to reach out to overseas Singaporeans on their database. ELD also emails overseas Singaporeans even if they had registered before, to inform them to register as overseas voters with each preparation or revision to the Registers of Electors. For GE2020, our 10 overseas missions, serving as overseas polling stations and registration centres, also emailed the overseas Singaporeans in their respective databases to remind them to register as overseas voters before the registration closed on the third day after the Writ was issued.

The scale and speed at which we had to do so was unprecedented. Cashflow was critical to the survival of firms and the Government responded swiftly, where, amongst various measures, the JSS was introduced and enhanced several rounds to provide wage support for firms. In particular, the Fortitude Budget introduced on 26 May 2020 provided for JSS support to be pegged at the highest tier till the dates when businesses were permitted to reopen after the Circuit Breaker ends on 2 June 2020.

2021-05-11-T-030,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Let me elaborate on the overpayment cases. These are cases which primarily involve firms supporting CMP projects but which are not CMP firms themselves. These firms were wrongly tagged with the re-opening date of the CMP projects because their company details had been included in the project resumption application, even though they were playing only a supporting role, if at all, in the projects. For example, construction projects often require the services of machinery and equipment rental firms to support various aspects of the construction project. A machinery rental firm, which is under the SSIC code of 77330, would have been permitted to operate on 2 June, together with other firms in its class. The error occurred when the 2 June re-opening date for the firm was erroneously overwritten with the later construction project approval date, say of 1 July. This led to such firms being wrongly ascribed a longer closure period and thus allocated higher JSS payouts for the affected period, in this example of between 2 June and 1 July.",8,1622,2021-05-11-T-030-S-01622

Under this concession, a Singaporean married couple is required to pay ABSD upon buying their second property, then claim a refund of the ABSD paid on their second property, provided that they sell their first property within six months1 after the purchase of a completed property or the Temporary Occupation Permit date of an uncomplete property.",3,1653,2021-05-11-T-035-S-01653

Singapore also ranked first globally for our health-adjusted life expectancy in 2019, which means that, compared to other countries, we live a longer life in good health.",3,1659,2021-05-11-T-036-S-01659
2021-05-11-T-036,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Secondly, in the short- to mid-term, the prevalence of modifiable lifestyle risk factors, such as physical inactivity, diet and smoking, are monitored. From 2010 to 2018, Singaporeans were, generally, eating healthier with more wholegrains, less saturated fat while maintaining their daily levels of energy intake. Singaporeans were also moving about more as the prevalence of sufficient Total Physical Activity (TPA), defined as at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or equivalent activities per week, has increased among adult Singaporeans aged 18 to 74 from 73.1% in 2013 to 80.1% in 2019. Smoking prevalence has also decreased from 13.9 % to 10.6% and, with the raising of the legal smoking age to 21 on 1 January 2021, we hope to push smoking rates even lower. However, there remain challenges, such as the increasing prevalence of obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol, and we will need to sustain our efforts to address these.",4,1660,2021-05-11-T-036-S-01660
2021-05-11-T-036,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Thirdly, at the short-term programmatic level, we monitor the impact of different interventions based on desired outcomes, such as improved market share of healthier food choices, improved participation rates and access to health promotion activities, or improved health behaviours. For example, efforts, such as the Healthier Choice Symbol (HCS) programme and the Healthier Dining Programme (HDP), expanded healthier food choices for Singaporeans. The market share of HCS products has risen from 25% in 2010 to 29% in 2019, and the HDP attracted more than 2,600 food and beverage operators, hawker centres and coffeeshops, across 11,500 touchpoints as of December 2020. We will also be implementing mandatory labels and advertising regulations on sugar-sweetened beverages, to further encourage healthier choices. We have programmes that encourage physical activity, such as Sundays At the Park, Sunrise In the City and the National Steps ChallengeTM (NSC). NSC had 1.7 million participants across five seasons and the participation has grown from 129,000 in 2015 to 913,000 in 2020. Regular users have also grown more active over time, recording an improvement of 35 minutes per week of physical activity from 2018 to 2020. This correlates with the earlier observations of the increase in total physical activity over the years.",5,1661,2021-05-11-T-036-S-01661
2021-05-11-T-036,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"HPB’s increased efforts targeted at various settings, such as schools, workplaces, community, have improved the population’s accessibility to the various health promoting programmes. For example, our Healthy Workplace Ecosystems increased from 16 in 2015 to 68 in 2020 to bring programmes to over 406,000 workers in 2020. Customised programmes, such as health coaching, are offered to workers in sectors with a greater proportion of older workers, including transport and logistics, security sectors and more. These programmes have also shown good improvements in the health behaviours of their participants. For example, among those who participate in our Healthy Workplace Ecosystem programmes, seven in 10 participants surveyed reported an increase in active time, and one in three reported to be consuming healthier meals. We will continue to monitor the progress of these programmes.",6,1662,2021-05-11-T-036-S-01662

2021-05-11-T-037,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"We expect that discussions in the tripartite cluster committees will reflect the views of firms and buyers on the economic conditions and whether the proposed increases are manageable. When it comes to lower wage workers, we should not be so quick to cite economic conditions as a reason to postpone wage increases. Instead, precisely because of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we must make every effort to keep up and ensure lower-wage workers emerge stronger from this crisis. The National Wages Council (NWC) also recognises this. Despite the downturn in 2020, it called for the continuation of agreed PWM wage increments. The NWC also called on employers implementing wage freeze to instead consider wage increases for lower wage workers and those implementing wage reductions to instead freeze wages of lower wage workers.",2,1666,2021-05-11-T-037-S-01666
2021-05-11-T-037,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In the security, cleaning and landscape sectors, where PWM has been implemented for several years, we have seen contract values increase, reflecting the higher wage cost. This shows that firms in the PWM sectors are able to pass on the wage cost increases to service buyers.

There are many details to be worked out, including nominating an envoy or a team of ASEAN envoys, their terms of reference, as well as working out how and when to disburse humanitarian assistance. ASEAN will also have to continue to speak collectively to urge the Myanmar military authorities to uphold the consensus – particularly to exercise maximum restraint and begin meaningful dialogue with all parties concerned.

First, we have granted an additional 49-day Extension of Time (EOT) for eligible public sector construction projects on top of the 122 days of EOT provided under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act (COTMA). This allows contractors more time to complete their projects. Second, contractors for eligible public sector projects with an awarded contract sum of up to $100 million will receive 0.1% of the awarded contract sum for every month of delay as payment for non-manpower related qualifying costs under COTMA, without the need to provide detailed substantiation for their claims.",5,1692,2021-05-11-T-041-S-01692

People hoard for a variety of reasons, which include social and mental health issues. Some may start off hoarding with the good intention of reusing and recycling, while others do it because of loneliness and the need to feel engaged by something they consider meaningful. Hoarders often lack insight into the consequences of their hoarding and may not seek help on their own.",1,1708,2021-05-11-T-044-S-01708
2021-05-11-T-044,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As the underlying motivation for hoarding and context vary from case to case, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Instead, the Municipal Services Office has worked with relevant agencies to develop the Hoarding Management Framework, which guides officers across agencies in providing coordinated support to address the hoarding issue. Much time and effort are spent on each hoarding case to diagnose the root cause, intervene, monitor and try to ensure progress. If the hoarder is assessed to have mental health issues based on a set of established criteria, the hoarder will be referred to the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) and the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for professional assessment and treatment.",2,1709,2021-05-11-T-044-S-01709

2021-05-11-T-062,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Instead, NAC will, from mid next month, organise quarterly live-streamed busking for buskers to engage audiences online. This will provide a platform for buskers to try out digital busking and also develop their skills and capabilities in this area. The livestreamed busking will allow us to accommodate larger groups of buskers. This will not only broaden the reach and diversity of performances, it will also enable buskers to delight more audiences while keeping everyone safe.",3,1800,2021-05-11-T-062-S-01800
2021-05-11-T-062,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We hope that these plans will create greater awareness of busking and widen channels for audiences to support busking, whether it is performed live or via a digital platform.",4,1801,2021-05-11-T-062-S-01801
2021-05-11-T-063,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) over the past three years, what has been the number of laser strikes on aircraft arriving at or departing from Singapore; and (b) how many of such incidents resulted in disruption to flight operations or required the pilot to seek medical attention.",1,1802,2021-05-11-T-063-S-01802
2021-05-11-T-063,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Over the past three years, CAAS has received 82 reports of laser lights being shone at aircraft landing at or taking off from our airports. Most of these appear to originate from outside Singapore. They can potentially distract or even cause injury to pilots. Fortunately, none of these incidents has resulted in disruptions to flight operations or pilots having to seek medical attention.",1,1803,2021-05-11-T-063-S-01803
2021-05-11-T-063,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"CAAS takes a serious view of such activities.

2021-05-11-T-065,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Employment Assistance Package under the Retirement and Re-employment Act can be pegged to an employee’s last drawn salary instead of the current cap of $5,500 to $13,000 regardless of last drawn salary.",1,1808,2021-05-11-T-065-S-01808
2021-05-11-T-065,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The concept of re-employment was implemented to enable Singaporeans to work for as long as they are willing and able to and to raise our senior worker employment rates to maximise the potential of our limited manpower resources. If an employer has considered all available re-employment options within the organisation and is unable to identify a suitable job for the senior worker, the firm may offer him or her an Employment Assistance Payment (EAP). The EAP is to be offered only as a last resort and is meant to help the worker tide over a period of time while he or she seeks alternative employment. With these objectives in mind, the tripartite partners agreed on three key principles for the EAP.",1,1809,2021-05-11-T-065-S-01809
2021-05-11-T-065,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"First, the EAP should be set at a reasonable number of months of last drawn salary. If the EAP is too high, it may have the unintended consequence of encouraging workers to stop work earlier. If the EAP is too low, employers may too readily offer to pay the EAP.",2,1810,2021-05-11-T-065-S-01810
2021-05-11-T-065,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Second, there should be a minimum EAP amount. This protects lower wage workers, by better ensuring that firms offer them re-employment and by providing greater support if they are not re-employed since they may have greater difficulty than other workers in seeking alternative employment.",3,1811,2021-05-11-T-065-S-01811
2021-05-11-T-065,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Third, there should be a maximum EAP amount to moderate the financial burden on employers. This is so that it does not discourage employers from considering older job applicants, who may be eligible for EAP in a few years.",4,1812,2021-05-11-T-065-S-01812
2021-05-11-T-065,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The EAP was last reviewed in 2019 by the Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers. The current position preserves these key principles, which remain relevant.",5,1813,2021-05-11-T-065-S-01813
2021-05-11-T-065,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Our re-employment framework, including the EAP, have supported raising the employment rate for senior workers. In 2018, our Average Effective Retirement Age, which provides a gauge of what age people actually stop working, was 68 and 66 years old for males and females respectively, as compared to the OECD average of 65 and 64 years old respectively1 – higher than some countries that do not have a statutory retirement age, such as Australia and the UK. To date, well over 90% of eligible workers have been offered re-employment and did not require the EAP.",6,1814,2021-05-11-T-065-S-01814
2021-05-11-T-066,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah,asked the Minister for National Development in light of the projected BTO construction delays coupled with increased prices in the property market due to the pandemic (a) whether there is now an oversubscription of HDB flats under the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme; (b) what additional measures will be taken if there is an oversubscription; and (c) whether there will be an introduction of further measures that may further help young couples who need a home to start a family in the current climate.,1,1815,2021-05-11-T-066-S-01815

2021-05-11-T-066,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In 2020, HDB offered 160 PPHS flats and received 2,350 applications, compared to the 1,370 applications received in 2019. While the number of applications has increased, not all applicants may be in urgent need of temporary housing, or some may have other options, as about 40% of successful PPHS applicants did not turn up for flat selection.",2,1817,2021-05-11-T-066-S-01817
2021-05-11-T-066,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The supply of PPHS flats is limited and depends on the availability of vacant flats, such as those in vacated blocks that are not immediately needed for redevelopment. HDB is working towards a more stable supply and more options for families who need temporary housing. Meanwhile, on a case-by-case basis, HDB may offer interim rental housing to those with no other housing options.",3,1818,2021-05-11-T-066-S-01818
2021-05-11-T-066,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Besides buying new flats from HDB, first-timer buyers with urgent housing needs may consider buying a flat on the resale market and can receive up to $160,000 in housing grants. They can choose from a wide range of resale flats, which are generally ready for immediate occupation, according to their preferences and budgets.",4,1819,2021-05-11-T-066-S-01819
2021-05-11-T-066,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The recent tightened border measures for short-term visitors and long-term pass holders (including Work Permit and S-Pass holders) with recent travel from India, have severely constricted the supply of workers needed for the construction industry and will inevitably result in a further delay for on-going BTO projects. Barring unforeseen circumstances, projects could be delayed by a further three months, on top of the six to nine months previously communicated. HDB will update affected flat buyers progressively. MND and HDB will continue to monitor the situation closely and see how best to render assistance to those affected by the delays.",5,1820,2021-05-11-T-066-S-01820
2021-05-11-T-067,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the past three years, how many people applied for HDB BTO flats under the Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS) and Multi-Generation Priority Scheme (MGPS); (b) how many are successful; (c) whether the Ministry will consider a priority scheme for parents whose children are studying in schools near the BTO project; and (d) what is the recourse for those who fail multiple ballots but have pressing reasons to apply in certain estates.",1,1821,2021-05-11-T-067-S-01821
2021-05-11-T-067,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Under the Married Child Priority Scheme, or MCPS, up to 30% of the flat supply is set aside for first-timer families, while up to 15% of the flat supply is set aside for second-timer families.",1,1822,2021-05-11-T-067-S-01822
2021-05-11-T-067,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Under the Multi-Generation Priority Scheme, or MGPS, a married couple and their parents can make a joint application for two new flats in the same BTO project and enjoy priority allocation. The parents can book a 2-room Flexi or 3-room flat, and up to 15% of these flats are set aside for MGPS parent applicants. A corresponding number of 2-room flexi or larger flats is set aside for the married couple applicants.",2,1823,2021-05-11-T-067-S-01823
2021-05-11-T-067,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For the completed BTO flat selection exercises in 2018, 2019 and in February and August 2020, HDB received about 8,900, 11,800, and 12,700 applications respectively under the MCPS. Of these applicants, 5,300, 5,400 and 4,800 were invited to book a flat. For the same period, HDB received about 400, 700 and 900 applications under the MGPS. Of these applicants, 400, 600 and 600 were invited to book a flat.",3,1824,2021-05-11-T-067-S-01824
2021-05-11-T-067,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"First-timer couples with a child aged 18 years old or younger can qualify for priority under the Parenthood Priority Scheme, while families with three or more children can qualify for priority under the Third Child Priority Scheme. Given these existing priority schemes to cater to families with children, HDB does not intend to introduce a priority scheme for parents whose children study in schools near a BTO project.",4,1825,2021-05-11-T-067-S-01825
2021-05-11-T-067,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To improve their chances of securing a flat, applicants may wish to apply for a flat in a project with a lower application rate, or in a non-mature estate. First-timer families who have not been invited to book a flat after submitting two or more BTO applications in the non-mature estates will get an additional ballot chance for each subsequent BTO application in the non-mature estates. Flat buyers who wish to live in a particular neighbourhood or secure a flat sooner may wish to consider purchasing a resale flat. With the enhancements implemented in 2019, first-timer buyers can now qualify for generous housing grants of up to $160,000 for resale flat purchases.",5,1826,2021-05-11-T-067-S-01826

2021-05-11-T-068,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In the last three years, HDB has given approval to about 4,500 households to sell their flat on the open market before meeting their MOP. The reasons for such exceptions include financial hardship, divorce or the demise of the flat owner. For comparison, over the same period, there were about 71,600 resale transactions.",2,1829,2021-05-11-T-068-S-01829
2021-05-11-T-068,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The MOP remains important to ensure that flat owners purchase HDB flats with the intent of living in the flats themselves, instead of quickly reselling the flats for profit. This safeguards HDB flats for households with genuine housing needs. It also deters the speculative purchase of HDB flats and thus helps to keep HDB flats affordable. HDB assesses all appeals for a waiver of the MOP on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the specific circumstances of the flat owners and their families.",3,1830,2021-05-11-T-068-S-01830

2021-05-11-T-070,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"MOH's primary concern is to ensure patient safety, welfare and continuity of care. As such, MOH focuses on regulating direct providers of healthcare services – which will impact patients directly. This includes the provision and advertisement of services that diagnose, assess or treat diseases or illnesses; provide nursing or rehabilitative care; or assess the health of individuals. This is a similar approach taken by regional and international healthcare service regulators.",1,1836,2021-05-11-T-070-S-01836
2021-05-11-T-070,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"As TPA services do not involve direct patient care, these companies are not regulated under the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act (PHMCA).

2021-05-11-T-070,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In addition, the Singapore Medical Council’s Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines (SMC ECEG) also provides guidance that medical practitioners contracting with TPAs should ensure they remain objective in their clinical judgement and provide the required standard of care. If TPAs are engaged, the fees charged by the medical practitioner must reflect the fair work done by TPAs in handling and processing the patients. The fees must also be transparent to the patient. The SMC ECEG specifically prohibits medical practitioners from paying TPAs, insurance entities or patient referral services (a) fees that are based primarily on the service the doctors provide or the fees doctors collect; (b) fees that are so high as to constitute ""fee splitting"" or ""fee sharing""; or (c) fees which render doctors unable to provide the required standard of care. The onus is on the medical practitioner to ensure that the fees payable to the TPAs are in compliance with the SMC ECEG. If a medical practitioner is uncertain about whether a fee payable to a TPA would be in compliance with the SMC ECEG, the medical practitioner should refrain from entering an arrangement to pay such a fee.",3,1838,2021-05-11-T-070-S-01838
2021-05-11-T-070,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In future, under the Healthcare Services Act, licensees using TPA services will be required to reflect TPA fees as a distinct category in the itemised bill given to their patients.

We will factor in various considerations in the matching of mentors and mentees, including the gender of the mentors and mentees. Mentors will also be trained to equip them with the skills to engage the youths, develop and manage the mentoring relationship, and support them in addressing the unique needs of their mentees, regardless of gender. We hope the mentors will serve as positive role models and trusted adults their mentees will feel comfortable reaching out to.

It is estimated that increased outdoor time may reduce the prevalence of myopia by 13% in children and, consequently, a potential 12% reduction in high myopia prevalence amongst future cohorts of young adults. By reducing myopia progression rate to 50%, through the combined use of pharmacological, such as atropine eye drops, and optical therapies, the prevalence of high myopia could potentially be reduced further by up to 90%.",2,1952,2021-05-11-T-091-S-01952

Based on a study conducted in 12 Primary schools, the proportion of Primary school students with myopia and high myopia has fallen from 37.7% to 29.3%, and 2.3% to 1.4% respectively from 2004 to 2017.",3,1953,2021-05-11-T-091-S-01953

While Singapore’s water is safe to drink straight from the tap, it is not free as food and beverage (F&B) establishments have to pay for the water. They also incur cost in providing table water, such as cost of washing the glasses and containers and in serving the water. There is no basis for the Singapore Food Agency to mandate that F&B establishments serve tap water free-of-charge under the Environmental Public Health Act .",1,1983,2021-05-11-T-098-S-01983

In general, MOH has assessed that the closure of pre-schools affected by HFMD has a limited effect on containing the spread of HFMD as the virus is present in the community and can be reintroduced once the pre-school reopens. Instead, early detection and isolation of cases, as well as maintenance of good personal and environmental hygiene in the pre-school, home and community, are key to minimising the risk of transmission and, hence, the risk of large HFMD outbreaks.",2,2016,2021-05-11-T-106-S-02016

These include daily health and temperature checks of children upon arrival at pre-schools, ensuring good personal hygiene practices by staff and children and maintaining good environmental hygiene, such as wiping down and disinfecting high-touch areas. Parents are strongly advised to inform the centre as soon as possible when their child is unwell, and to keep children who are unwell away from the pre-school until they have fully recovered, to mitigate the spread of HFMD.",3,2017,2021-05-11-T-106-S-02017

If warranted, pre-school closures may be mandated on a case-by-case basis and this is dependent on, but not limited to, the severity of the HFMD cases, the circulating strain of virus, and the disease transmission dynamics. In the last five years, that is, 2016 to 2020, ECDA, in consultation with MOH, has mandated the temporary closure of two pre-schools due to HFMD. Apart from temporary closures, ECDA can also take other regulatory actions, for example, financial penalties, against pre-schools that are found to have breached requirements relating to the prevention of infectious diseases, including HFMD.",4,2018,2021-05-11-T-106-S-02018

We recognise that the interviews may not allow us to uncover all the issues that the MDW may be facing, if the MDW does not wish to divulge. Nevertheless, we will endeavour to create a safe environment through conducting the interview in a private room without the employer’s presence, to ensure that MDWs can honestly share their concerns.

2021-05-11-T-113,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry will consider introducing legislation to require companies hiring workers in the gig economy to recognise them as employees so that they can enjoy all benefits and retirement protection like regular employees; (b) whether these workers can be brought under the Progressive Wage Model scheme; and (c) whether they can be covered for health and personal accident insurance by their contractors.,1,2041,2021-05-11-T-113-S-02041
2021-05-11-T-113,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"There is no internationally accepted definition of gig workers. In Singapore, the term generally refers to self-employed persons (SEPs) who source for a significant part of their work using online matching platforms. Currently, such workers constitute about 3% of our resident workforce. Most are engaged as private hire car drivers, taxi drivers and car and light goods vehicle drivers, who include delivery riders. The majority express a preference for self-employment.",1,2042,2021-05-11-T-113-S-02042
2021-05-11-T-113,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"I had shared in my Committee of Supply speech last month how we are supporting SEPs, including gig workers, who wish to switch to regular employment and how we have started to help them better meet healthcare and retirement needs. As I also mentioned, the Government will review how to bring about a fairer and more balanced relationship between gig workers and the intermediaries that deploy their services.",2,2043,2021-05-11-T-113-S-02043
2021-05-11-T-113,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"As the Member suggested, one way is to recognise them as employees. However, it is not straightforward, as we can see from the uneven experience overseas. We must assess the implications in the local context, including the impact on work opportunities available, the protections they might enjoy, as well as their obligation to make employee CPF contributions, if they are recognised as employees. Another way is to strengthen representation of SEPs, which NTUC has expressed keen interest in. The issues we will study include employee protections and benefits, as well as retirement adequacy.",3,2044,2021-05-11-T-113-S-02044
2021-05-11-T-113,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"On bringing gig workers under a Progressive Wage Model, we will work with tripartite partners to assess its feasibility.

2021-05-11-T-114,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"To help employers, MOM provides a Self-Assessment Tool (SAT) on its website to gauge the likelihood of an EP application being approved. It is not surprising then that the majority of applications submitted meet the criteria for consideration and are approved. For this reason, the application approval rate is not a meaningful indicator.",2,2048,2021-05-11-T-114-S-02048

This year, trees will be added to the forested buffer near Piccadilly Circus. Following the completion of on-going road widening works in 2022, NParks will add more trees along the TPE to provide a green barrier between the expressway and Fernvale constituency. Agencies will continue to monitor the situation and implement further measures, if necessary, to minimise the sand dust that may be blown into Fernvale constituency from the surrounding area.",1,2051,2021-05-11-T-115-S-02051

2021-05-11-T-116,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"There was a recent incident where a rental flat tenant posted on social media about the condition of the rental flat allocated to her. The incident was due to an error where an HDB staff mistakenly thought that all the sprucing works had been completed for the affected unit. Upon discovery of the mistake, HDB immediately allocated a replacement rental flat to the affected tenant and assisted her to move the next day. HDB has since tightened our processes to prevent another similar incident from happening.",4,2056,2021-05-11-T-116-S-02056
