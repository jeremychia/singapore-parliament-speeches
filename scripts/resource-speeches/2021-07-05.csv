2021-07-05-T-001,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"asked the Minister for Manpower how many nationals from China, India, USA and Australia holding Employment Passes or S Passes are currently working in companies with fewer than 10 employees.",1,2,2021-07-05-T-001-S-00002
2021-07-05-T-001,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa,"asked the Minister for Manpower for each year from 2005 to 2020, how many (i) dependant passes and (ii) Long Term Visit Passes have been issued to relatives of nationals from China, India, USA and Australia who are Employment Pass or S Pass holders respectively.",1,3,2021-07-05-T-001-S-00003

2021-07-05-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"asked the Prime Minister whether the Government will commit to setting up a Commission of Inquiry to review its response to COVID-19 and, if so, when will this inquiry take place.",1,6,2021-07-05-T-002-S-00006
2021-07-05-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security (Mr Teo Chee Hean) (for the Prime Minister),"Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Prime Minister, dealing with COVID-19 has been a major whole-of-nation exercise, for which we have mobilised all of our resources. It was an unprecedented crisis that extended beyond public health and threatened both lives and livelihoods. Countries, especially those which encountered the virus relatively early such as Singapore, had to quickly adapt our contingency plans in the midst of doing battle, to deal with the particularly severe challenges posed by this virus. Every Singaporean has had a part to play.",1,7,2021-07-05-T-002-S-00007
2021-07-05-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security (Mr Teo Chee Hean) (for the Prime Minister),"Our response has by no means been perfect. We adapted and improved along the way, sharing experiences with other countries as we collectively gained more knowledge of the virus and how to deal with it.",2,8,2021-07-05-T-002-S-00008
2021-07-05-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security (Mr Teo Chee Hean) (for the Prime Minister),"We must thoroughly analyse and learn from our experience, the entire crisis, in all its aspects, from start to finish, just as we did from SARS 17 years ago which helped us greatly in our response this time. The aim is to understand what we have done well and what we have not, so that we can do better the next time. Another novel disease that causes a global pandemic is not a matter of if, but when, and the next disease may well be even more contagious and dangerous than COVID-19. So, we will certainly undertake a comprehensive after-action review or AAR.",3,9,2021-07-05-T-002-S-00009
2021-07-05-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security (Mr Teo Chee Hean) (for the Prime Minister),"However, right now, our agencies remain in the thick of battle. Their resources are totally committed; they are stretched dealing with the pandemic, which is far from over. Even as we fight the current battle, we are constantly evaluating, learning, innovating and building new capabilities and capacities to stay ahead of this fast-moving virus. As a result, we are in a much safer position now than last year. But COVID-19 will not disappear soon and with new variants continuing to emerge, there could yet be new twists and turns, some perhaps for the worse, but others hopefully for the better.",4,10,2021-07-05-T-002-S-00010
2021-07-05-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security (Mr Teo Chee Hean) (for the Prime Minister),"We have made preparations for a long battle. But with the unprecedented speed at which effective vaccines have been developed and the pace of our vaccination programme, we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. When we have the vast majority of our population fully vaccinated, we should be able to live with the virus endemic in our population and gradually shift into a new normal, along with most of the countries in the rest of the world. There will be lessons to learn from that shift too.",5,11,2021-07-05-T-002-S-00011
2021-07-05-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security (Mr Teo Chee Hean) (for the Prime Minister),"But we are not in a new normal yet. Meanwhile, we are learning and adapting as we fight the virus, whether it is COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, management of dormitories, isolation procedures for foreign arrivals, or safe management measures. The full AAR will therefore have to wait until the situation has stabilised and we are out of the woods.",6,12,2021-07-05-T-002-S-00012
2021-07-05-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security (Mr Teo Chee Hean) (for the Prime Minister),"The purpose of the AAR is for us to learn valuable lessons to improve our response for future pandemics. We want participants in the AAR to be open and forthcoming, to be reflective and thoughtful and be candid on their experiences and decisions, to acknowledge shortcomings and where we could and should have done better, even as they analyse successes. The structure of the AAR must fit this purpose. A Commission of Inquiry, which is a quasi-judicial investigative tribunal, is not the most appropriate way to achieve this objective.",7,13,2021-07-05-T-002-S-00013

2021-07-05-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to thank the Senior Minister for his response to my Parliamentary Question (PQ) on behalf of the Prime Minister. Sir, the main impetus behind filing the question was the commitment given by the Government about 12 months ago, almost a year ago, to look back at COVID-19 and I refer to the remarks of the now Minister for Finance  ""I have no doubt that we will find many things where we could have done better and many changes we should make to be better prepared next time."" And I think this is in concert with what the Senior Minister has shared.",1,15,2021-07-05-T-002-S-00015
2021-07-05-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I also note that there are other countries, the UK, for example, and the state Legislature of Victoria which has already actually delivered a report on the government's handling of the pandemic. I would like to ask the Senior Minister what sort of form the AAR will take. I understood the Senior Minister when he said that there will be input from the public, but what sort of shape and form is the Government considering if it is not going to be a Commission of Inquiry?",2,16,2021-07-05-T-002-S-00016
2021-07-05-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Senior Minister said that there is a quasi-judicial aspect to Commissions of Inquiry. That is true. But Commissions of Inquiry also involve matters of public policy. Multi-agency issues of grave public concern have also found themselves to be subject of a Commission of Inquiry as opposed to an AAR. So, just to reiterate the question  what sort of review and how can the public play a part in the review that the Government has in mind?",3,17,2021-07-05-T-002-S-00017
2021-07-05-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Mr Speaker, Sir, we have not determined the precise form in which such a review will take. But we certainly want to learn all the lessons that we have, including those which can be submitted by members of the public who have views and informed views particularly.",1,18,2021-07-05-T-002-S-00018
2021-07-05-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"In my career in the Public Service, I have been the subject of, the convenor of, and participated in many inquiries of various kinds. It must suit the purpose for which we set up these inquiries or reviews for. In my experience, a Commission of Inquiry (COI) is probably best suited to look into a singular event that has occurred in a specific moment or instant in time, such as a building collapse and a major accident. But I do not think the pandemic fits well into such a situation. It is an ongoing and evolving event. It is not over yet. In fact, many lessons have already been learnt along the way, not necessarily though formal AARs or a COI, but because of actual ground experience in which the agencies have adapted and adjusted their response, both in order to be more effective but also in response to an evolving virus and evolving situations. As you can see, our testing, our ring-fencing, our safe management procedures, our procedures for incoming travellers – all have changed and adapted along the way. You can see this learning process continuing.",2,19,2021-07-05-T-002-S-00019
2021-07-05-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"We want to make sure that when we reach a new normal, this process is properly documented so that we are ready for the next round, just as we did not have a COI for SARS but we learnt many valuable lessons from it which allowed us to be better prepared for COVID-19.",3,20,2021-07-05-T-002-S-00020

2021-07-05-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Speaker, and I thank the Senior Minister. Like the original answer to the PQ, I take the Senior Minister's point. Section 3 of the Inquiries Act does say that ""a Commission is suitable if an inquiry is to be conducted into any matter which in the opinion of the President be in the public welfare or public interest"". I am not sure whether the AAR that the Senior Minister has in mind will be as broad-ranging as a Commission of Inquiry could potentially be but we await information from the Government in this regard.",1,22,2021-07-05-T-002-S-00022
2021-07-05-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, Senior Minister.",1,23,2021-07-05-T-002-S-00023
2021-07-05-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the AAR will probably be more broad-ranging than the COI, which by its normal construct, will usually be defined in a very specific way. The Government intends to do a very broad-ranging AAR on all aspects because there are many aspects to this particular pandemic from which we can learn good lessons for the future.",1,24,2021-07-05-T-002-S-00024
2021-07-05-T-003,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for Finance (a) how will Singapore be impacted by the landmark agreement amongst G7 nations to reform the global tax system and impose a minimum global corporate tax rate of 15%; and (b) what are the plans to mitigate adverse impact to Singapore's corporate income tax revenue.,1,25,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00025
2021-07-05-T-003,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo,asked the Minister for Finance (a) what are the implications of the G7 agreement on a global minimum corporate tax for Singapore; (b) whether Singapore’s status as a tech hub will be affected; and (c) how will the tax affect multinational corporations that currently operate in Singapore.,1,26,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00026
2021-07-05-T-003,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar,"asked the Minister for Finance (a) what is the number of MNCs that currently pay less than the global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% proposed by G7; and (b) given that MNCs receive tax incentives for undertaking activities that benefit Singapore in the long run such as developing new sectors or building capabilities, whether such special tax schemes will be permissible under the proposed changes; and (c) what other levers must the Government strengthen.",1,27,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00027
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Mr Speaker, with your permission, I would like to take Question Nos 5 to 7 together.",1,28,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00028
2021-07-05-T-003,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,29,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00029
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sir, since 2016, there have been concerted efforts to strengthen international cooperation in taxation matters, to stamp out harmful practices and to increase the taxes paid by multinational enterprises or MNEs. These efforts were first initiated by OECD to deal with the issue of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, or BEPS, by MNEs. To ensure a wider international consensus, the discussions were subsequently broadened to include more than 130 jurisdictions through a platform called the Inclusive Framework on BEPS.",1,30,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00030
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Singapore has been actively involved in these international discussions as part of the Inclusive Framework or IF. The IF has been discussing two major tax changes.,2,31,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00031
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,The first proposal concerns the reallocation of taxing rights of the largest and most profitable MNEs from where they conduct their substantial activities to where their customers are. This is known as Pillar One. The current proposal is that Pillar One will apply to MNE groups with global revenues above 20 billion euros and profitability above 10%.,3,32,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00032
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The second proposal is the introduction of an internationally agreed minimum corporate tax rate for large MNEs, wherever they operate. This is known as Pillar Two. The G7 and IF have proposed a minimum effective tax rate of at least 15% for MNE groups with global revenues above 750 million euros.",4,33,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00033
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Let me briefly explain how Pillars One and Two will likely impact Singapore.,5,34,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00034
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Pillar One was intended to adapt the international tax system to new business models where large businesses sell remotely to consumers in other jurisdictions, without physical presence. Under Pillar One, some part of the profits and hence, the taxes payable of large companies with overseas operations will be reallocated to where their customers are.",6,35,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00035
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"To illustrate, assume a Pillar One MNE group in Singapore has a profitability of 15%. Pillar One will then reallocate a portion of the profits in excess of 10%, 5% in this case, from Singapore to be taxed in the market jurisdictions. This means that hub economies with smaller markets like Singapore will stand to lose corporate income tax revenues.",7,36,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00036
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Pillar Two aims to put a floor on international corporate tax competition. Essentially, under this proposal, MNEs will be subject to the minimum effective tax rate of 15% at the MNE group level, in every jurisdiction they operate. Broadly speaking, this means that if an MNE group in Singapore is taxed at an effective rate of, say 10%, then its home jurisdiction will impose additional rules to require the group to pay an additional 5% in tax there. Pillar Two will therefore limit the effectiveness of tax incentives as a tool to encourage larger MNEs to invest in Singapore.",8,37,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00037
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Ms Mariam Jaafar asked how many MNEs in Singapore currently pay less than the global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. The current proposal, under Pillar Two, is to apply this minimum effective tax rate to MNEs that meet a certain revenue threshold, currently set at 750 million euros, as I highlighted just now. There are about 1,800 such MNE groups in Singapore that would meet this revenue criterion.",9,38,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00038
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We expect that a majority of these MNE groups will have group effective tax rates below 15% in Singapore. That is because our headline corporate tax rate is 17%, close to the proposed minimum effective tax rate of 15%. Furthermore, our tax system, like most others, provides for tax reliefs to encourage various meritorious activities like capital investment, R&D or charitable donations. And for a small number of companies, there are also tax incentives for their qualifying activities subject to economic commitments.",10,39,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00039
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"However, at this stage, it is still too early to work out the exact impact of the tax proposals. The final number of affected MNEs, as well as the extent of the impact, depends on the design of the specific rules which are still being actively discussed at the IF. As some of the tax proposals can only be effected through a multilateral instrument, there will be a need for international consensus to be fully reached before the changes can be implemented.",11,40,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00040
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, in response to the query from Ms Foo, we will only be able to determine with a high degree of confidence what the eventual impact on Singapore's fiscal position would be, once the IF has worked through and agreed on the detailed design elements of both Pillars. The eventual impact will also depend on how companies and other governments respond to these international developments.",12,41,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00041
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"What we can say for certain is that when a consensus is fully reached, Singapore will adjust our corporate tax system as needed, in consultation with the industry. Any adjustments to our tax system will be guided by three principles. First, we will abide by internationally agreed standards. Second, we will safeguard our taxing rights. Third, we will seek to minimise the compliance burden for businesses.",13,42,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00042
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Ultimately, the best response to these tax changes is to continue to strengthen our overall competitiveness. Over the decades, Singapore has built a solid reputation and track record as an attractive place for business and substantial economic activity. While a conducive tax environment has been helpful in attracting investments, it is not the decisive factor. Having quality infrastructure, good connectivity, a skilled workforce, an open and business-friendly regime founded on the rule of law, are all far more important factors. We must therefore double down on these competitive strengths. In particular, the Government has been investing and will continue to invest in enterprise capabilities, including innovation and digitalisation, and in the skills of our workforce.",14,43,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00043
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Minister for Trade and Industry will be elaborating further on how Singapore can continue to strengthen its position as a hub. MAS has also separately provided a written answer to Ms Mariam Jaafar's question on Singapore's position as an international financial centre. In short, we will continue to provide a conducive regulatory environment for businesses, especially for new and innovative activities, as well as a good ecosystem and infrastructure for such activities to scale up across the region. We will also work closely with the industry to build up capabilities and skills that will enable us to stay relevant in the face of key structural trends like digitalisation and sustainability that are transforming the financial landscape.",15,44,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00044
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, the latest proposals to change international corporate tax rules will not be the first or last challenge we face. The key is for us to stay agile and nimble, and respond innovatively to the key global trends affecting our economy. We must continually work hard to strengthen our value proposition, build new advantages and seek new opportunities. This way, we can ensure Singapore's continued economic success and ultimately a good future for our people.",16,45,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00045
2021-07-05-T-003,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Ms Foo Mee Har.,1,46,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00046
2021-07-05-T-003,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Thank you, Speaker. I thank the Minister for his response. I understand a lot of details are not out yet but, I guess, with the announcement, there has been a lot of interest in the industry. Whilst we expect the tax system to evolve, I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on, for the Minister to speak a little bit more about what specific non-tax benefit could Singapore provide or enhance, in order to compensate for the loss of tax benefits, previously enjoyed by companies, so that there is some level of certainty when companies are planning.",1,47,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00047
2021-07-05-T-003,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),Question two is about the carve-outs. I understand that financial services have been a carve-out from this global tax reform. Could the Minister comment on how the financial sector is being impacted including family offices and variable capital companies (VCCs)?,2,48,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00048
2021-07-05-T-003,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"And last but not least, on jurisdictions that have been tax havens, without the other non-tax benefits. I would like to ask the Minister, how is Singapore positioning itself to attract companies that are expected to exit tax havens and how Singapore will attract them with other non-tax related benefits.",3,49,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00049
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, with regard to the question of carve-outs, as I mentioned earlier, the current proposal on the table is for regulated financial services to be carved out from Pillar One. As for Pillar Two, as I have mentioned, it applies to the larger MNEs. So, whether or not family offices and VCCs will qualify, will really depend on the facts of the case, and ultimately, what are the final criteria that are used for the definition of large MNEs. So, we will continue to monitor this closely. And as I said earlier, we will respond accordingly once the international rules are worked out and finalised.",1,50,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00050
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,We will respond in two ways.,2,51,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00051
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Number one, we will protect our sovereign rights on taxes. And we will make sure we adjust our corporate tax system accordingly, in line with the international standards and in close consultation with businesses in Singapore, ensuring that as far as possible, we keep a low compliance burden on businesses.",3,52,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00052
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Number two, we will continue to work hard at improving and enhancing our competitiveness in other areas, especially in terms of the non-tax factors that Ms Foo highlighted.",4,53,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00053
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, to Ms Foo's question, yes, this is work in progress. We have always been looking at how we can restructure, transform our economy, invest in enterprise capabilities, as well as the capabilities of our workforce. And we will work even harder at that.",5,54,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00054
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Our objective is to continue to remain attractive and competitive; attractive to substantial investments and substantial economic activities to be based here. We are not trying to get companies to register in Singapore without a physical presence. That is not our intent. We want to anchor substantial activities here, with the aim of creating good jobs for Singaporeans. That must be the objective of our economic policy. It has always been so and we will continue to work hard on this front.",6,55,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00055
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I think we should also be mindful and clear that with these tax changes, going forward, as a small city-state with no natural resources, with limited land, it will be that much harder for Singapore to attract investments. And that means we will have to work even harder to attract and retain investments based on these non-tax competitive factors.",7,56,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00056
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Up to now EDB and our economic agencies have been very effective in bringing investments into Singapore and creating jobs for Singaporeans, but we should never take that for granted. We should never assume that these investments will just fall on our laps and they will automatically happen year after year. It will get harder, so we will need all Singaporeans to support this critical mission; and that includes everyone in this House.",8,57,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00057
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"And I am saying that with a reference to the upcoming debates on FTAs, because what we say, the tone of the debate does matter. If investors start to feel that Singapore is starting to become less hospitable to foreign investments and talent, they will surely look for other options and there are many compelling options everywhere in the world. And we will end up worse off.",9,58,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00058

2021-07-05-T-003,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Sir, my question is firstly on Pillar Two. I understand that the G7 countries had initially sought a minimum corporate tax rate of 21%, but have since agreed to lower it to 15%. I would like ask the Minister whether he sees this 15% effective tax rate as a number that Singapore can agree to. And if not, is there room for further negotiations or seeking further carve-outs? Or is it the case that Singapore, being a small country, will just be the price-taker?",1,60,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00060
2021-07-05-T-003,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"The second question is, the Minister mentioned about Pillar One, where the location of the taxing right will be given to countries where the customers are, I want to ask how significant is this reduction in the tax base and whether that will have any fiscal impact on our Budget. For example, whether the 15% tax effective rate would be enough offset for them in the short term?",2,61,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00061
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, there has been already extensive discussions at the Inclusive Forum on many of these matters. And recently, 130 jurisdictions in the Inclusive Forum, including Singapore, have reached a consensus on the key parameters of the corporate tax changes. That includes the global effective minimum tax rate of 15%. But there are still many design elements and implementation details that need to be worked out, as I mentioned earlier. For example, how would the effective tax rate be determined? There are some technical details there to be resolved. Or whether there will be sectoral carve-outs, as I have mentioned.",1,62,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00062
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For now, under Pillar Two, the one carve-out that is being proposed is for shipping. Why? Because really, shipping operates under a very special tax regime. Shipping has no, by definition, physical presence. It moves everywhere and to many different countries. And so, you have different kinds of taxes for shipping, like tonnage tax, that falls outside of the scope of corporate taxes. Therefore, the intent or at least the proposal on the table now is to carve out shipping from Pillar Two. But these things are fluid. They continue to be discussed at the Inclusive Forum. Singapore is an active participant in the forum and we will do our part to shape the consensus in line with our national interest and also to ensure a level playing field for everyone.",2,63,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00063
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the second question on Pillar One, yes, there will be a negative impact, because Pillar One means reallocating tax revenues for some of these large firms to where the markets are located. So, this will have certainly a direct impact on our revenues. Exactly how much, like I said, it is difficult to give any detailed estimates now when the detailed rules are still being finalised. And whether or not we will be able to make up with sufficient revenues elsewhere, that is something that we will have to work out.",3,64,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00064
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I should explain why we even ended up with Pillar One. And the reason is that many jurisdictions feel that in this new digital world, digitalisation has enabled large MNEs, especially the digital companies to do well, to grow dramatically and to be able to acquire more customers in jurisdictions outside of where they operate. They can acquire customers remotely. And therefore, many of these market jurisdictions have started to unilaterally impose, what they call, digital services tax on these companies.",4,65,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00065
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,It is not in our interest to have a taxation system that is fragmented and to have other jurisdictions impose unilateral taxes. That is not helpful for Singapore as a small and open economy. And that is why we feel it is better that we participate actively in the Inclusive Forum and be part of the multilateral discussion to shape a set of international tax rules that can be adapted to this new business model of the digital world.,5,66,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00066
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, indeed, that is what Pillar One is about. As and when there is an agreement on Pillar One, the agreement will provide for the coordination of this new international proposal together with the removal of all digital services tax and other similar measures that have been unilaterally imposed by certain market jurisdictions. That is why we have decided we could go along with this Pillar One consensus view, so that businesses can work with one set of rules rather than have to deal with a patchwork of fragmented rules. But as I mentioned, there are still details to be worked out even under Pillar One and these are issues which we will continue to actively discuss at the Inclusive Forum.",6,67,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00067

2021-07-05-T-003,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister for the clarifications. I have got two further clarifications. The first is, basically, in terms of the effective corporate income tax rates here in Singapore, what are they and whether the Government has conducted any scenario analysis to assess the net impact to our income tax revenues as a result of Pillars One and Two. I understand that it is still preliminary days but we already have the key parameters. OECD, for example, has already given some sense of what it expects the global overall tax revenue impact is going to be.",1,69,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00069
2021-07-05-T-003,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"The second question is in terms of the foreign MNCs who are currently paying effective tax rates of below 15%, whether the Government would consider raising the effective tax rates to be in line with this minimum of 15%. And if I look at the US IRS data, for example, based on what has been disclosed, I think the effective tax rates for these US companies do appear to be much lower than our statutory income tax rates at just about 4%, and especially given that, as the Minister said, Singapore's attractiveness is not solely based on tax incentives alone.",2,70,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00070
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, Mr Chua has, in fact, asked quite a detailed series of questions on our effective tax rates, not just for MNCs but for local enterprises, and quite a range of different breakdowns in a separate Parliamentary Question (PQ). So, we will provide the full answer there. Those are data that we will share.",1,71,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00071
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Yes, effectively, our effective corporate tax rate is low, not just for MNCs, but for all companies, especially for SMEs in Singapore. They are low. And they are low for a reason because we want to encourage business innovation, business investments and we want to make sure that businesses can create good jobs for Singaporeans. So, with Pillar Two being in place and with the consensus around Pillar Two forming at an effective rate of 15%, we will, of course, have to start thinking about what changes and adjustments are needed with regard to our corporate tax system to be in line with international standards, as I have said earlier.",2,72,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00072
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"At this stage, I would just say it is premature to speculate or to talk about what these tax adjustments will be. But as I mentioned earlier, the key principle is we will preserve our sovereign tax rights, our rights to taxation, even within the international agreement, and we will work out together with businesses what adjustments and changes might be needed in our corporate tax system. Secondly, we will also, at the same time as we adjust our corporate tax system, make sure that we work even harder on non-tax factors to make sure that Singapore remains competitive and attractive to investments. That is not something we should take lightly for the reasons I have explained earlier.",3,73,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00073

2021-07-05-T-003,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),I thank the Minister for elaborating on the impact of Pillar One and Pillar Two. I specifically have a follow-on question with regard to tech companies in relation to what the Minister said about the digital economy.,1,75,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00075
2021-07-05-T-003,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Given both Pillars One and Two, and the impact of that – although I know that there are still a lot of uncertainties – how can Singapore, specifically, for the tech hub status, how can we continue to be attractive because both Pillars One and Two, could have significant impact on Singapore's tech hub status.",2,76,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00076
2021-07-05-T-003,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"I would ask the Minister if he could elaborate on some of the key levers we would need to strengthen. I know he talked about the whole breadth of it but what would be some of the key pillars for the tech sectors specifically, given the impact of digitalisation?",3,77,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00077
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, it is a very important question and I do not want to belabour the broad points because, at this stage, I think it is a little early to dive into details. The upshot of these tax changes, as I said just now, is that it will make it harder for Singapore to attract investments; there should be no doubt. So, let us be realistic about what the impact will be. It will make it harder for us to attract investments and we have to work harder, particularly, given our size, the fact that Singapore is such a small city-state, compared to so many other locations around the world which offer equally, if not more, attractive and compelling attributes.",1,78,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00078
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, whether it is for technology, whether it is for finance, whether, it is any other major investment that will now be impacted, we just have to work that much harder. Basically, in a post-Pillar One and post-Pillar Two world, the large MNCs of the world will bear a larger tax burden. That is what it comes down to, anywhere they go. Assuming Pillars One and Two are applied evenly, uniformly, around the world, they will have to bear a larger tax burden.",2,79,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00079
2021-07-05-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, we, on our part, will therefore have to work that much harder, whether it is on upgrading of our workforce, our infrastructure, our connectivity, our overall business environment; all of these factors will, therefore, become more salient in our ability to attract and retain investments and, ultimately, with the objective of creating good jobs for Singaporeans.",3,80,2021-07-05-T-003-S-00080
2021-07-05-T-004,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry with regard to the latest G7 agreement on a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% (a) how will this potentially impact our efforts (including the use in part of corporate tax incentives) to attract MNCs; (b) what are the fiscal and foreign investment implications for Singapore; (c) which sectors of our economy will be principally affected; and (d) what strategies will the Ministry take to find new growth industries and hubs in this new global tax environment.,1,81,2021-07-05-T-004-S-00081

Details on the final parameters, design and implementation will need to be discussed in the coming months. Therefore, there remains significant uncertainty in terms of the possible impact on Singapore and the sectors which will be most affected.",1,82,2021-07-05-T-004-S-00082
2021-07-05-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"When the details have been finalised, all jurisdictions will need to adjust their tax regimes to be compliant with the new rules, or cede tax revenue to other jurisdictions.

As we adjust our tax system, we will aim to minimise the compliance burden for businesses and ensure that Singapore continues to be an attractive place for business.",2,83,2021-07-05-T-004-S-00083
2021-07-05-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"After all, Singapore’s competitiveness goes beyond our taxation rates. Key fundamentals such as our strategic location and international connectivity, excellent infrastructure, the rule of law and skilled workforce remain strong. However, we must not be complacent. We are, therefore, redoubling our efforts to enhance our competitiveness and improve our business environment, for example, through upgrading our Industry Transformation Maps, or ITMs. We are confident that investors will continue to find Singapore a compelling place to do business, and our economy can continue to thrive in the new environment.",3,84,2021-07-05-T-004-S-00084

The first is a simple question  the impact of Pillar Two. Will there be a risk of existing firms moving out? And I am referring to the US IRS filings which indicated that Singapore's share of US firms' foreign income taxed is second highest in the world at about 7.5% after Bermuda, and which indicates that US firms' here, for example, have about 165,136 people working for them, not to mention the cascading effects of some of these US firms in terms of subsidiary employment for Singaporeans. So, my first question is  will there be risk of these US firms moving out?",1,86,2021-07-05-T-004-S-00086
2021-07-05-T-004,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The second question is whether MTI is reviewing its strategies to attract MNCs in light of this change and what are those strategies? I think the Minister has mentioned briefly the non-tax factors but how much more can we improve to enhance even further those non-tax factors and to attract more firms coming in, year after year.",2,87,2021-07-05-T-004-S-00087
2021-07-05-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"I thank the Member for the two important questions. Yes, indeed, US firms play a very important role in Singapore's economy. They provide significant employment and good employment to Singaporean workers. But it is not just the US firms. I think BEPS 2.0 is going to affect all countries and, therefore, it is important for us to take a holistic approach, look at the entire business environment. We are doing quite a few things to ensure that we remain competitive.",1,88,2021-07-05-T-004-S-00088
2021-07-05-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Mr Saktiandi asked whether there is a risk of firms moving out of Singapore. The risk exists and they exist today even. Companies will do their calculations and they do that almost yearly to decide whether they are going to continue to be in Singapore, to continue to invest more in Singapore or to move somewhere else. That is why we cannot take it for granted, as I mentioned, and as the Finance Minister also underscored. We need to continue to ensure that our business environment remains effective and competitive.",2,89,2021-07-05-T-004-S-00089
2021-07-05-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"What are the things that MTI is looking at doing? First, we have to continue to invest in our infrastructure, to ensure that we provide a very efficient infrastructure to allow our companies to operate here in a very cost-effective way. Secondly, we need to extend our connectivity. I have entered into several Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and we continue to sign FTAs.

I cannot detail all of them here; I am sure Members are aware there are a lot of support schemes to encourage and support companies to become more productive. Particularly, for tech companies, we have a lot of incentives and support for investment in R&D. This will anchor a knowledge-based economy, an innovation-driven economy, in Singapore.

2021-07-05-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We encouraged this through a range of policies, including public housing policy. For instance, when HDB built new towns and estates to provide public housing for Singaporeans, we consciously allocated flats in such a way that every HDB block and precinct all over Singapore reflected the ethnic mix of the general population. These were for our new flats then. This was so that people of different races could interact and form bonds with one another.",6,145,2021-07-05-T-007-S-00145
2021-07-05-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"While we controlled the allocation of new flats quite carefully, we did not initially place similar restrictions on resale transactions, which were first allowed in 1971. Over time, as more resale transactions took place, people sold and bought and moved, ethnic concentrations started to re-emerge in particular areas. For example, by the late 1980s, we started to observe an increasing concentration of Chinese buyers in Ang Mo Kio and Malay buyers in Bedok and Tampines. We could see that, without intervention, there would, over time, once again, be ethnic enclaves which would separate us.",7,146,2021-07-05-T-007-S-00146
2021-07-05-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"That is why we introduced the EIP in 1989, for both new as well as resale flats, to ensure that public housing estates remained inclusive and diverse, even beyond initial flat allocation.",8,147,2021-07-05-T-007-S-00147
2021-07-05-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The EIP applies to all races. It caps the proportion of flats in each HDB block and neighbourhood that can be owned by households of each ethnic group. The limits are set based on the ethnic proportions in the general population, with an allowance for some local variations in each block and neighbourhood. And if you look at the EIP limits, they are actually set higher than the national demographic proportion of each ethnic group.",9,148,2021-07-05-T-007-S-00148
2021-07-05-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mr Chong Kee Hiong pointed out the changing profile of our households. He is right.

2021-07-05-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"There are many reasons for this, even beyond instinctive preferences that people may have, to live near others from the same ethnic community. For example, family members may wish to live near each other for mutual support, that is, live near family. Or residents of certain ethnic groups may prefer neighbourhoods with a higher concentration of specific amenities and services or larger flat types. Or they may find different locations more suitable for their household’s financial situation.",15,154,2021-07-05-T-007-S-00154
2021-07-05-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Individually, these are completely understandable and reasonable preferences and very personal ones. But collectively, if we are not careful, these tendencies could, inadvertently, lead to segregation among our races.",16,155,2021-07-05-T-007-S-00155
2021-07-05-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Is the EIP still relevant today? Let us look at the facts. Today, nearly one out of every three HDB blocks, and 14% of HDB neighbourhoods, have reached one or more of the EIP limits, which means they have hit that particular ethnic limit more than the national proportion. This happens across all ethnic groups – Chinese, Malays, Indians and Others – as well as in both mature estates with older Singaporeans and newer estates with younger residents, where most residents fulfilled the MOP in recent years. In some areas, like Bukit Merah, Pasir Ris and Woodlands, the limits have been reached persistently across time.",17,156,2021-07-05-T-007-S-00156
2021-07-05-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"So, just imagine how much more the different ethnic groups would concentrate in different neighbourhoods, if we did away with the EIP, and how much harder it would be then to promote mixing and understanding across ethnic groups in the home environment.",18,157,2021-07-05-T-007-S-00157
2021-07-05-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Our children could grow up in neighbourhoods where they hardly see any children or any people of other races, not even in their classrooms, since most children go to pre-schools and national schools near their homes. How much harder then would it be for them to even get acquainted with different cultures from a young age – to see festivities, celebrations and mourning in the neighbourhood – not to mention to truly understand and appreciate these cultures from a very young age? And how much harder would it be for our children to correct their conscious and unconscious racial biases and learn how to live in a multicultural society?",19,158,2021-07-05-T-007-S-00158

2021-07-05-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,Fostering real racial harmony is challenging and the EIP is one very important part of the solution because it helps to ensure inclusive and diverse neighbourhoods.,21,160,2021-07-05-T-007-S-00160
2021-07-05-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Of course, some might argue that just because we live next door to someone from a different ethnic group, culture or religion, it does not necessarily mean that we will get along with our neighbour, or learn to tolerate or understand our differences. In fact, all these incidents of friction between neighbours of different cultures have caught our attention and is part of the reason why are having this debate today. But equally, often, we do not celebrate the large number of situations when neighbours learn to live with each other, celebrate each other's festivals, mourn with each other, grieve with each other and go and learn how to live together, because they live in the same community. Others also argue that there are other ways to mix and achieve social integration – in schools, at work or during National Service.",22,161,2021-07-05-T-007-S-00161
2021-07-05-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"But the EIP remains critical because so much of our lives and our children's lives revolve around our homes and our neighbourhoods. With diversity in our estates, we get to interact with our neighbours of different races almost every day – along the corridors, the void decks, playgrounds, markets, neighbourhood centres, shops, hawker centres.",23,162,2021-07-05-T-007-S-00162
2021-07-05-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"And if we do not live with one another, it makes it much harder to empathise with other communities and understand the challenges that they face. And so much easier to stereotype or assume the worst of the other, the people we do not see or do not see so often. And this is a recipe for mutual mistrust and intolerance that we have seen in our early history but also repeated in cities and townships all around the world.",24,163,2021-07-05-T-007-S-00163
2021-07-05-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Indeed, we only need to look at other countries in the present day to see how this might happen. In major cities across Europe and the US, for example, racial segregation is common and well-advanced. Different ethnic groups live in different enclaves. The wealthier ethnicities congregate in expensive, gentrified precincts. While ethnicities which are less well-off are excluded and stigmatised. They receive fewer opportunities and these differences get entrenched across generations.",25,164,2021-07-05-T-007-S-00164
2021-07-05-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"I recently read an article on the website FiveThirtyEight analysing racial segregation in the US. It featured a tool developed by the University of Virginia which is called ""The Racial Dot Map"" – and you might want to check it up after this. The map plots one dot for each person on the maps of US cities, with different colours representing different ethnicities. The visualisation is quite stark. The map is colourful, but you can see distinct and clear patches of colour sharply separated from one another, with very little inter-mixing, a reflection of how multicultural but segregated the country is. The author also cites a study showing that three quarters of white Americans do not have any non-white friends. He writes, I quote, ""The places we live affect not only our access to resources, but also who we meet, interact with and become friends with. The nature of segregation in the US means that we only end up seeing and learning about what our own groups experience, making it hard to understand the lives of people outside of our own group.""",26,165,2021-07-05-T-007-S-00165
2021-07-05-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Similarly, after I spoke about the EIP at an overseas conference some years back, a mayor of a big city that suffered from serious racial segregation and conflict came up to me. He said he wished that his city had implemented a version of the EIP much earlier on, to foster harmony and avert the unrest that they now regularly face. But now that societal divisions have hardened along racial and ethnic lines, the EIP is not a feasible nor politically attainable option. Even talking about the idea of ensuring that different races live near one another would cause an uproar and inflame tensions even further. That is how bad the situation had become. That conversation with this mayor has stuck in my mind all these years.",27,166,2021-07-05-T-007-S-00166
2021-07-05-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In fact, in September 2016, Lord Mayor Sadiq Khan of London, said this  ""The less integrated our societies are, the greater the economic and social costs we face now and in the future. Failure to integrate feeds extremism, whether in the Muslim community or the far right. It causes anxiety and fear of crime and causes mistrust between people. A laissez-faire approach to achieving social integration just does not work. There is so much that city leaders can do to ensure people of different ethnicities, faiths, culture, age groups and incomes do not just tolerate each other, but live truly interconnected lives. We need to ensure that our housing and planning laws mean we design and build integrated communities and institutions where neighbours have real reasons to come together.""",28,167,2021-07-05-T-007-S-00167

2021-07-05-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"So, the EIP continues to serve a very important function for Singapore. We cannot leave social mixing to chance and hope that it will happen by an invisible hand. It is better to intervene upstream to pre-empt the problem and to foster mutual understanding and encourage integration from the start. If we wait until after racial tensions have started to bubble to the surface and develop and become entrenched, it will become so much harder to heal those fractures and rebuild trust among different communities.",30,169,2021-07-05-T-007-S-00169
2021-07-05-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"From our engagements and the feedback we have received, most Singaporeans understand and support the EIP and recognise its purpose. Based on a recent REACH survey, more than 60% of Singaporeans agreed that implementing racial quotas in public housing was an important way of promoting racial integration. Similar levels of support were seen across all races. About 30% were indifferent to this and less than 10% disagreed.",31,170,2021-07-05-T-007-S-00170

2021-07-05-T-007,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"And in its application on the ground, the EIP does have its rough edges and may cause difficulties for some owners looking to sell their flats.

With a smaller pool of eligible buyers, sellers may have to lower their asking price or they may take longer to market and sell their flat. This happens across all races, including Chinese sellers who are affected by the non-Chinese EIP limits. But we do see more appeals from sellers from the minority races. This is because Chinese buyers form a larger proportion of the market simply from the demographic mix of society and the impact on individual non-Chinese sellers is therefore larger when the Chinese EIP limits are reached. And this data we presented in some Parliamentary Questions (PQs) earlier.",1,173,2021-07-05-T-007-S-00173
2021-07-05-T-007,,,"In such cases, the seller’s loss may be the buyer’s gain. A buyer from an eligible race will benefit from a lower resale price and would thus be less affected if and when they sell the flat in the future.",2,174,2021-07-05-T-007-S-00174
2021-07-05-T-007,,,"But this brings little comfort to affected sellers, particularly those who had bought the flat from HDB, or on the resale market before the EIP limits were reached, and yet are now caught by the EIP limits. This is the group who can be financially disadvantaged, and I understand why they feel aggrieved. They may feel it is unfair that they are personally shouldering the costs for a policy that benefits all of us in society.",3,175,2021-07-05-T-007-S-00175
2021-07-05-T-007,,,"Over the years, Members of Parliament on both sides of this House have raised these concerns. This is why HDB has been exercising flexibility for EIP-constrained owners, on a case-by-case basis. For instance, HDB will give the household more time to sell their flat and even waive the EIP limits if there are exceptional circumstances. In fact, the percentage of successful EIP-related appeals has risen from 14% in 2018 to 21% in 2020.",4,176,2021-07-05-T-007-S-00176

My question is directed to the Minister for National Development. First and foremost, I thank the Minister for that very nuanced exposition of the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP). I think it has been the most nuanced reply that I have heard from a Government Minister on the EIP, considering on the one hand the realities of racial integration and other policies that can assist; and on the other, the fact that there are people who actually pay a price for the EIP.",1,214,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00214
2021-07-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),I have three supplementary questions.,2,215,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00215
2021-07-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The first pertains to the request for waivers. This has been on the up, from 2017 to 2019. I understand the numbers were around 1,850 for the three years  25% from the Malay community, 16% from the Chinese community and 59% from the Indian and other communities. The numbers actually cascade lower in the years before.",3,216,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00216
2021-07-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"My question is  for the EIP limit for the Indian and other communities, which was at 59%, when the EIP limit overall was actually reviewed in 2010, the EIP limit for that category was 10% and 13% at the neighbourhood and block level, and that was increased to 12% and 15% respectively. My question is  in view of the large number of EIP appeals continuing to come from this community and a suggestion made in 2010 by the then-Minister for National Development that there would be a review around 2020, has this review been undertaken and what are the new EIP limits, if any?",4,217,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00217
2021-07-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second question is a question for information. In 1989, when EIP was introduced, 28% of the neighbourhoods had already reached the established EIP guidelines on the start date of the EIP. Over the years, this has fallen but there is no real clarity about why this has fallen. I am specifically referring to the number of new neighbourhoods that have also come about. So, the percentage can be very difficult to understand. For example, in Kaki Bukit and Aljunied GRC, the neighbourhood level numbers for the Malay community are still, I believe, beyond the EIP limits. And there is nothing untoward about race relations in Kaki Bukit. And I think this will be replicated in other parts of Singapore.",5,218,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00218
2021-07-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"So, to this end, is the Government prepared to share details on the breakdown by ethnic groups in all HDB neighbourhoods, both new and old, on an annual basis from 1989?

2021-07-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Finally, in response to a Parliamentary Question (PQ) I filed in 2013, HDB shared that it had reviewed the EIP limits for rental flats; and administratively, it adds up to 10% for the block limits for HDB rental flats. Would HDB consider a similar approach for all flats and also exercise greater flexibility at the neighbourhood level as a means of loosening the EIP criteria as a compromise, or even remove precinct and block quotas in favour of a larger area of coverage?",7,220,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00220
2021-07-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"This is in view of the rising number of EIP waiver requests over the last few years, Singapore's changing demographic profile and for policy equity considerations towards communities that are adversely affected by the EIP.",8,221,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00221

2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"First, on the number of appeals from households from Indian or other ethnic origins, whether the review is ongoing, it continues to be so.

2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"In 1989 versus 2020, the second question. Here is the data. In 1989, when we introduced the EIP, 28% of neighbourhoods had reached one or more EIP limits. So, 125 neighbourhoods then; 35 neighbourhoods reached one or more limits. In June this year, out of 173 neighbourhoods – because we have been building our towns and increasing the number of neighbourhoods – 14% have breached one or more ethnic limits. That is 24 neighbourhoods. In 1989, 35 neighbourhoods out of 125 and in June 2021, 24 out of 173.",3,224,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00224

2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"That is perhaps a result of a range of factors  the EIP operating, including operating in new neighbourhoods that are launched over the years since.

2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Whether we will consider that across all housing types, as I said earlier, we are mindful of the intent of EIP as a bulwark against very strong socio-economic forces borne out of choices of individuals. The EIP, we need to adjust along the way in terms of looking at proportions, but it is a very important bulwark. And I hope the Member agrees with me.",7,228,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00228
2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Therefore, we look at individual cases in order to determine whether we should waive the limit as opposed to an inexorable increase in EIP limits for all races across the board, which for some cases would bring it close to 100% because for Chinese, the EIP limit is already 87%.",8,229,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00229

This would address the disadvantage faced by ethnic minority HDB flat resellers. Abolishing the quota will not cause racial disharmony amongst Singaporeans. After more than 50 years of nation-building, our society has evolved and achieved multi-racial integration that has gone beyond the need for mandating proportionately mixed neighbourhoods. Singaporeans should therefore be given the freedom to choose where their homes will be without taking into account race.""",11,232,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00232

2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"In 2011, that is the same position except that in addition to saying that in 2011, Singapore had reached a high level of multi-racial integration and therefore there is no longer a need for people to be mandated to live with each other across different ethnicities in our neighbourhoods, WP goes on to say that the ethnic quota system also contradicts the policy of encouraging young families to live closer to their parents and prevent young Malay and Indian families from buying homes close to their parents.

2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"So, I would like to seek some clarity. Firstly, given what I have said about the current EIP limits being strained in different locations and the experience in different cities and countries, not just in the past but in the present, what would be WP's position? Is it your position that there will not be racial concentrations if we abolish EIP? Or are you saying that we have reached a level of multi-racial integration so that it does not matter if we have entire blocks and neighbourhoods of predominantly one race; society will not change if we have ethnic concentrations?",18,239,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00239
2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"What would your position be if you know that people go to the pre-schools, they go to the schools near their homes. And if we have neighbourhoods predominantly of one ethnic group, that will of course cascade into pre-schools, into our national school system. The services in the heartlands, the shops, the markets, the hawker centre food choices, they will adjust to reflect the proportions of the clientele in the neighbourhood.",19,240,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00240

2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"If you are concerned about diversity in the workplace, in National Service, in national schools and even social mixing – I recall there was an Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) discussion about different socio-economic classes and the concern about whether they mix – then, why not at home and in our neighbourhoods where we spend a vast amount of time?",21,242,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00242
2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),I would like to seek the Member's clarification. It would help to advance our common understanding.,22,243,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00243

2021-07-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Yes, that is the Workers' Party (WP) position, as iterated by the Minister, in the manifesto. It really is undergirded by the frustration that we sense from ethnic minorities who cannot sell their flats.",2,246,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00246
2021-07-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"The question is  is the EIP the only policy, among a whole gamut of policies, that the Government has to encourage racial integration, bearing in mind that it is a pre-emptive policy introduced in 1989? And we also have a hybrid system almost, in Singapore, where we do have places like Chinatown and Little India, where there are concentrations of a particular race but it does not disturb Singaporeans. It does not bother Singaporeans.",3,247,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00247
2021-07-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"We may take a different philosophical approach as to what the end situation will be, but I cannot speculate on one or two episodes and say that because of that, we are descending in terms of our journey towards greater racial integration.",4,248,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00248
2021-07-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"My own sense on the philosophy behind the HDB EIP policy as it stands today – almost one generation since its introduction – is that it needs to be revisited. It has to be revisited in the context and not limited to  number one, a larger national conversation on race relations in the context of today and tomorrow Singapore; and, separately, what it means to be Singaporean.",5,249,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00249

2021-07-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Number four, as it is well known – this is really the heartbeat of why WP has taken the position it has since 2006. It was, I think, referred to as a ""time bomb"" by PAP even then – and that is the economic loss to minorities who have to lower the market price of their flats in the name of that policy. That is particularly painful because we hear that from many people who are in that position. I believe the Chairperson of WP in the opening of the Parliament for this session, referred to one individual who had to sell the flat at a loss of $100,000. That is shocking and that is really where we are coming from.",8,252,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00252

2021-07-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"So, the position is this. The current policy as it stands has a larger impact on minorities, penalising them in the pocket when they have to sell their flat. By minorities, I mean not just racial minorities, but those who are affected by it, including Chinese, Malays, Indians. This may perversely interact with the stated objective of the policy of racial harmony, thereby breeding resentment amongst those who are affected by the policy.",10,254,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00254
2021-07-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"For that reason, the EIP as it stands needs to be reviewed. We must always keep in focus the prospect of endeavouring towards a race-neutral society where race-based policies like the EIP are no longer needed. In its current form, as I suggested, the EIP quota should either be further loosened to ameliorate the prospects of further economic loss for sellers with HDB committed to buying back the affected flat at the valuation price, or a larger geographical area representing the anchor for the EIP rather than the precinct and block quotas.",11,255,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00255
2021-07-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"And just before I conclude, my second supplementary question was not just a general question about the percentages at a broad level. It was about specific neighbourhoods across time. Would the MND be prepared to release that information?",12,256,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00256
2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the very clear elucidation of the party's position that it objects to the EIP and would want it abolished. A couple of responses.,1,257,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00257
2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"First, he says it is a pre-emptive policy in 1989. If you look back in history and over the last few weeks and months as we continue to review our policies and preparing for today's session has been a humbling experience in learning from the wisdom of the generations. It is not a pre-emptive policy in 1989. It was a policy that was put in place because of the lessons learnt from the 1960s, paid for with blood, sweat and tears. A real pain in families grieving for lost loved ones and a country newly formed wrecked by racial riots and disharmony, distrust. The efforts of HDB are not just to build homes for people who lived in slums and villages that flooded or were easily burned, but also ensuring that we learn those lessons, and in allocating new flats, make sure that in every block, there was a racial mix. Taking people from what were ethnic enclaves, which were a legacy of the Jackson Plan and persisted through villages and enclaves of different races, pulling them up and saying, ""You move into these high-rise homes in the sky, but we will mix you. Learn to live with each other.""",2,258,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00258
2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"If you talk to the earlier generation, it was not easy. And I think today, there are still frictions along the way, but things have improved.",3,259,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00259
2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"So, it is not a pre-emptive policy. It is not something that we decided to put in because we were looking at other countries. We paid for it with the blood of our brethren and sisters.",4,260,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00260
2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Second, the Member says that he or WP would like to abolish the EIP because of its disproportionate impact on minorities. As I said earlier, the EIP has its rough edges. By its very operation, it seeks to ensure that in every estate, from BTO all the way to resale flat, there is freedom to choose where you would like to live, subject to balloting or price. But when it hits certain limits, and when the function of individual choices results in blocks exceeding significantly the demographic proportion of each ethnic group, then we have to kick in this bulwark and say, ""Well, we will have to cap it"".",5,261,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00261
2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Of course, it causes pain to minorities but also Chinese as well. The proportion, of course, will be different because there are a lot more Chinese than there are the other ethnic minorities, and that is the reality of it.",6,262,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00262
2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For BTO applications in certain popular locations, say Bishan, Ang Mo Kio, you do have cases of Chinese coming up to say, ""Look, I have been balloted. I have been asked to select, but the next day I am told sorry, EIP limit hit, and then the minority takes over my place"". There is also unhappiness. But we explain the rationale and seek their understanding, and by and large, all Singaporeans of all races have kept faith with the broader intent of this policy.",7,263,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00263
2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"But I accept the Member's point and I accept the point that was made by many Members of this House, both present and past, and looking at very thoughtful questions in speeches by both PAP Members and Members from across the aisle over the years, concerned about the impact on their constituents of all races, including minorities.",8,264,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00264
2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"And that is why we have been looking at it case-by-case, understanding the situation for each seller, looking at how long they have taken to market the flat, looking at the price if asked for, given the market conditions, and well, if today is EIP, tomorrow or next month, perhaps there might be a change of circumstances. Or after a few months, the EIP may adjust because people buy and sell and the EIP may no longer apply to your block. So, we look at it individually, bearing in mind that we have to be very judicious. Otherwise, the lessons that we have learned will all unravel.",9,265,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00265
2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The Member talked about the case that the Chairman of WP sought to help and the example was raised twice as an anecdotal, but real, example of a person who lost $100,000 through resale. I would like to clarify and we have checked all the cases that the learned Member had filed and without naming the individual family, it was not a case of them losing $100,000. Ms Sylvia Lim's appeal to us was that the resident told her that she got offers for her flat that appeared to be $100,000 less than what other people nearby were offered. That was anecdotal, it was said to her. I am not sure if the Member verified. We were not in a position to verify what the offers were for that flat.",10,266,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00266
2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"But in that case, HDB assessed the case holistically and agreed in August 2019 to waive the EIP for a period of time to allow the family to sell. Waived off EIP, looking at the circumstances of the family. But the family decided not to take this offer up for other reasons and requested HDB to acquire the flat. So, that was what happened. I think better put these cases which are raised as anecdotal examples to rest.",11,267,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00267
2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Having said that, there is impact, no doubt. There is impact. And we address that through appeals, we look at these and scrutinise very carefully to help the affected seller. And as we said, we continue to look at how we can smoothen the rough edges of EIP and ensure that a new generation of Singaporeans who have not lived through the tumultuous early days of Singapore history continue to support measures, may not be popular measures, but necessary bulwarks to ensure that our multi-racial character is in substance and not in form.",12,268,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00268
2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The Member, I am not sure whether he has addressed my question, but because of the impact on minorities, which we have said we address through appeals as well as through continuous smoothening of the rough edges, does he still take the position that we want to abolish the EIP for that reason? And if abolished, does WP believe that our estates will remain multicultural and representative? Or is it the case that you accept that given even current trends, there will be a lot of concentration, but that it is perfectly okay, there is no impact to our multi-racial character because we have multi-racialism in National Service, in our national schools and our workplaces?",13,269,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00269
2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"I have also said earlier that there will be these knock-on effects, if whole estates become concentrated, to all these places, platforms and spaces that the Member talked about. From being common, they will be ethnic focused. Does he then say, we move the EIP away from housing and put ethnic quotas in schools, in workplaces, in pre-schools, in markets, in hawker centres, in neighbourhood shops? Or you think it is fine that the schools and pre-schools, they are all ethnically focused because its proximity and it is fine. We are sufficiently multicultural – a point you have made since 2006, that Singapore has reached such a high level of multiculturalism that we no longer need to concern ourselves with mixing people.",14,270,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00270

2021-07-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I thank the Minister for National Development. I think the point really, again, is the philosophy that we want to aim towards, towards a race-neutral society and we continue working towards this assiduously and keeping in mind that you do not want the policy to become a barrier to that vision, to that journey to become a race-neutral society. That is why we took the position that we had.",1,273,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00273
2021-07-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"I do not believe the Minister has suggested what sort of policy beyond the very helpful clarification of the anecdote, I think this is how Parliament should work  if an example is brought up, the Government clarifies. Beyond these cases where HDB looks at it on a case-by-case basis, we have a regime, the rental housing regime, where HDB is prepared to administratively lift block limits. So, it is not as if the Government, the arguments that were made by the Minister for National Development are cast in stone. There is flexibility beyond looking at individual cases and moving the boundaries.",2,274,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00274

2021-07-05-T-010,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition. Those are details, important details but I think, fundamentally, it is important to understand, given the Government's position as articulated, that we continue to look at how we can smoothen the rough edges and given how over the last few years, we have started to see more appeals succeeding, do we recognise that that is on a case-by-case basis, providing a balm to a household but also not quite pushing the limits further. Does WP still want to abolish? And if it abolishes, the important questions about your belief about what society will be like, I think that is most fundamental. The other issues we can address, but we need to understand your position on multi-racialism.",1,277,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00277

You have talked about a race-blind society, a race-neutral, race-blind multicultural society. But yet over the years, we have been tracking; WP has been filing lots and lots of questions specific to individual minorities or races.

But the Workers' Party's position today, in 2021, is that we still need the EIP, we work towards a race-blind society and we endeavour to reach there and, at some point, hopefully, we may not need EIP.

The Minister referenced the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) programme that is being taught in the schools right now.

I am not just talking about, say, SAP schools or madrasahs, but even certain schools which might be devoid of particular ethnicities for a variety of reasons. And will the Ministry then perhaps adjust or tweak the CCE to cater to teaching the topics of multiculturalism and multi-racialism in these schools?",3,295,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00295
2021-07-05-T-010,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Second Minister for Education (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his question. MOE regularly reviews the CCE curriculum to ensure that our students are equipped with the necessary skills and keep up with the increasingly complex and dynamic environment. The last review, as the Member is aware, began in 2018. So, as part of the review, besides drawing from the research on Character and Citizenship Education, we interacted with experts and practitioners on current and emerging trends, engaged community partners and stakeholders, such as school leaders, educators and students across all levels. So, we continue to review CCE education, a very important part of our curriculum development for our students.",1,296,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00296
2021-07-05-T-010,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Second Minister for Education (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"The new CCE 2021 curriculum builds on the foundation that have been laid by the previous CCE curriculum and further strengthens the focus on guiding students to build character, learn values, social and emotional competencies, and develop citizenship dispositions within and beyond the classrooms. This is done through engaging pedagogies that encourage students to voice out and explore the multiple perspectives, including the national perspective, and bearing in mind the common good. So, we are using different pedagogies and not just top-down, not just telling them what it is, to allow them to use experiential learning. There is also a difference between the formal curriculum and the informal curriculum. It is not just in the classrooms but also through exposures like CCAs as well as uniformed group interactions.",2,297,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00297
2021-07-05-T-010,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Second Minister for Education (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"So, even as the Member mentioned earlier, circumstances where there are students with different kinds of profiles, CCE is not just in the classrooms. It also takes place in experiences and platforms where students interact with one another. So, for example, in CCA, in national competitions, camps, leadership camps, students are exposed to other groups of students and they are able to interact with one another.",3,298,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00298
2021-07-05-T-010,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Second Minister for Education (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"The CCE curriculum also takes the age-appropriate dimension. So, the Primary schools get a different level of content versus the Secondary schools versus the Junior Colleges. We also ensure that we train our teachers and our new teachers to be ready and prepared to implement the new curriculum. The new teachers are provided with this programme called the ""CCE in the Singapore context"" and so they are trained to deliver the content. Even existing teachers are also given opportunities to look at different pedagogies because we know that students are exposed to different content on social media and they use some of these contents using new pedagogies to excite the students and, at the same time, acknowledge the importance of engaging in discourse of this nature.",4,299,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00299

I am really glad to see that there are increasing efforts to enhance coordination between agencies, as issues, such as the potential entrenchment of community within the rental flat paradigm, are complex and really will require a more nuanced and sustained approach, as well as adequate resources to see real outcomes over the longer term. So, I have three supplementary questions.",1,301,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00301
2021-07-05-T-010,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"Firstly, are the other plans for the efforts under Project DIAN@M3 to be integrated with national efforts, such as ComLink, for example, and how would the duplication of these efforts be avoided? Second, given that home ownership is also closely related to other factors, such as employment and family structures, is there room for Project DIAN@M3 to be a sandbox for potential policy adjustments and what sort of community assets will be integrated, given that these involve multiple agencies? And finally, I am sure many of us will be interested in understanding what sort of outcomes the Government is hoping to see from this and also the timeline. So, could the Minister of State please share when will Project Dian@M3 be rolled out?",2,302,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00302

2021-07-05-T-010,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Minister of State for National Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),"In essence, we will augment the efforts of the community partners and the agencies that we have built partnership with, so that Malay/Muslim families who live in rental flats are able to take part in programmes and also receive holistic support from the programmes that we have. These include counselling programmes under MENDAKI SENSE, Bersamamu and Project ARIF undertaken via the focus areas of M3 and with the support of the volunteers.",2,304,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00304

I am happy to share that since M3 started, the number of volunteers that have come on board has also increased. For example, for M3@Towns, we have about 500 volunteers who have come on board and this is also something that we want to train them. In addition to that, we also have volunteers that come on board via other programmes, like programmes relating to how we support vulnerable individuals as well as families; as well as how we support mentoring among the youths where more than 1,000 volunteers have come on board for our youth mentoring programme. For efforts like Fitrah, we have about 460 volunteers as at June this year. Mayor Mohd Fahmi Aliman is also looking at how we can increase a lot more volunteers for efforts relating to upskilling of our people.",3,305,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00305
2021-07-05-T-010,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Minister of State for National Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),"So, essentially, we are very happy that many more volunteers are coming on board. These are Malay/Muslims who have been very successful in their own life, in their fields and they are able to contribute back to the community. We will continue to work with them, together with all the other Malay/Muslim organisations and Project DIAN@M3 will integrate these community assets that we have to help families in rental flats holistically and inspire them to be homeowners. In doing so, we hope to also cultivate values, such as independence and resilience, in these families as they journey towards home ownership.",4,306,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00306

As we journey through this process, we hope that we will be able to strengthen families, provide opportunities for the Malay/Muslim families, especially those in rental flats, and, at the same time, give them and work with the Government agencies and our partners for them to move towards home ownership in the years to come.",5,307,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00307

I would like to thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply just now. I just have a few supplementary questions on it. It is not uncommon for estates that go to intestacy to lead to familial disputes over the allocation of assets. Muslim estate planning, under the Faraidh laws, allows Muslims to plan for one-third of their assets. Yet, today, there are still many Muslims in Singapore who passed away intestate.",1,309,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00309
2021-07-05-T-010,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"Will the Ministry consider compiling data on whether there is currently still a lack of clarity on the estate planning options available to Muslims in Singapore? And would the Ministry also consider programmes for older or more mature families, not just for newly wed couples or young couples, who may be less tech-savvy and not as easily accessible for institutions, such as mosques or MENDAKI to reach out to?",2,310,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00310

Sometimes, we have to be very creative, we have to find ways to  make it attractive for them to come.",1,311,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00311
2021-07-05-T-010,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I will give one example. A group of lawyers under M3 (Lawyers at M3) came together and said they wanted to educate our community about the same issues that the Member has raised. I said, ""Go ahead, tell me what you want to do."" But they knew that if they just did it themselves, call it LPA, call it Faraidh, I do not think anyone would turn up. But what they did instead was, they brought in an ustaz, a religious teacher, they brought in a popular personality and an artiste. They put together a panel and said, ""Come and talk to us"". The programme attracted a full house; a total of about 600 people came. We had to keep putting in chairs because people were still coming in to see what this was about.",2,312,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00312
2021-07-05-T-010,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"At the same time, these lawyers also agreed to stay back after the programme, in case there were still questions that need to be answered. The session went on quite light-heartedly. Although some of the questions raised were really heart-wrenching, they were addressed in a very proper and enlightening way. At the end of the session, because the lawyers agreed to stay back to hear other issues, there were long queues because people do have issues to clarify. We do really need to do more of such programmes. I think these programmes that I have talked about have been successful. We want to replicate it to as many towns as possible in M3. We call upon our successful lawyers who have done this or have done this successfully, to come forward again. After we lift the restrictions for gatherings that we cannot now have because of COVID-19, we can have more of this.",3,313,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00313

Secondly, given the wide age range of students across the different levels in our academic institutes and the confidence these students may have in providing feedback, is there a need for the Ministry to differentiate the procedures according to the different levels of these students?",2,316,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00316

In the IHLs, including the Polytechnics and ITE, there are various channels that the students are able to access. More importantly, it is to ensure that they are able to provide the feedback in a safe environment and that they feel assured that their feedback will be taken in strict confidence.

2021-07-05-T-010,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Leader of the Opposition for making those points. Just to pick up on his last comment, to look at the outcomes and to see whether or not we can improve certain segments in society in Singapore and to look at whether the programmes help to uplift them, would he not accept that if you are looking at how to uplift certain segments by race, which we have done, then, would that not mean that the CMIO classification would not only be relevant, it would in fact be necessary to retain this distinction; at least for now, until we reach post-race-blind or race-neutral society?",1,353,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00353
2021-07-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"I think I can agree with the eventual outcome that even the Minister shares, which is to reach that race-neutral, race-blind end. To that extent, yes. I think you have to look at how the Government is performing on these indicators and eventually, with more Opposition Members in the House, looking at these numbers and figures, and asking more pointed questions and even putting up alternatives for debate and discussion, hopefully, we can reach that end state, which will be beneficial for all Singaporeans, not just this generation but those that come after us.",1,354,2021-07-05-T-010-S-00354

But we have the same philosophy that we want a multi-racial society Singapore, integrated housing, well-integrated communities and schools. We are more likely to get there with the HDB policies that we have today, with EIP, rather than what the WP is proposing.

2021-07-05-T-011,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Late last year, we had the Alpha variant, which was first detected in the United Kingdom, and which was about 50% more transmissible than the original strain detected in Wuhan. Now, we are dealing with the Delta variant. It is estimated to be 60% more transmissible than the Alpha variant. That means it is about two and a half times more contagious than the original strain.",3,375,2021-07-05-T-011-S-00375

Instead, we adopted more targeted measures calibrated based on the severity of the outbreaks. So, in early to mid-May, we saw the emergence of new clusters, most notably at Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Changi Airport, and a sustained increase in unlinked community cases, we moved into Phase Two (Heightened Alert) on 16 May to protect Singaporeans and to control the spread of the virus.",10,382,2021-07-05-T-011-S-00382

The details of the support measures have been announced previously. So, let me just provide a quick summary.",13,385,2021-07-05-T-011-S-00385
2021-07-05-T-011,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"First, we enhanced the Jobs Support Scheme, or JSS, to help enterprises retain local workers. From 16 May to 11 July, we provided different levels of JSS enhancements based on the impact of our measures on various sectors. We provided 50% JSS support for sectors which had to suspend all or most of their operations. These included F&B, gyms, fitness studios, as well as performing arts organisations and arts education centres. We also enhanced support to 30% for sectors that were not required to suspend operations but were, nonetheless, significantly impacted by the reduced footfall. These included the retail sector, cinemas, museums, art galleries, historical sites, indoor playgrounds and other family entertainment centres. To ease businesses back towards reopening, we will taper JSS support to 10% for two weeks from 12 July.",14,386,2021-07-05-T-011-S-00386
2021-07-05-T-011,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Second, we helped businesses with their cash flow by providing relief for rental costs. We provided two months of rental waiver for hawkers in Government-owned premises. To support smaller businesses, including those in the heartlands, we extended rental support for Small and Medium Enterprises, or SMEs, and eligible non-profit organisations through one month of rental waiver for tenants of Government-owned commercial properties and half a month of cash payout for those who are end-tenants and owner-occupiers of qualifying private commercial properties.",15,387,2021-07-05-T-011-S-00387
2021-07-05-T-011,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Third, we helped individuals impacted by the safe management measures. We supported taxi and private hire car drivers through the COVID-19 Driver Relief Fund. To further assist our hawkers who were impacted by the dine-in restrictions, we provided subsidies for table cleaning and centralised dishwashing services. We also introduced a COVID-19 Recovery Grant (Temporary), or CRG-T, scheme to provide short-term support to employees and self-employed persons who suffered from sudden and significant income loss during this period. The coverage for this CRG-T scheme extends to end-July.",16,388,2021-07-05-T-011-S-00388
2021-07-05-T-011,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"In coming up with this package, we consulted closely with workers, union leaders and business leaders to hear their concerns and challenges and I thank them for their understanding and close cooperation as we navigate this crisis together.",17,389,2021-07-05-T-011-S-00389
2021-07-05-T-011,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"The additional support measures for the period of Heightened Alert are expected to cost $1.2 billion. We sized the package based on what we assessed to be appropriate to meet the needs of businesses and individuals during this period. As mentioned earlier, most parts of our economy continued to operate over the past two months. It was not the same as the circuit breaker last year where many activities were curtailed and literally the whole economy was shut down. In fact, many individuals and businesses have learnt to adapt and pivot to new ways of working and doing business, allowing them to keep going in the face of tightened restrictions.",18,390,2021-07-05-T-011-S-00390
2021-07-05-T-011,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We are also building on a strong base of support measures announced earlier this year in Budget 2021 and which are still in place. For example, we have the Jobs Growth Incentive and other measures in the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package to facilitate workers moving to jobs in growth areas. We also have measures to foster innovation, help businesses adopt new technologies and build deep digital capabilities and we continue to have various assistance schemes for individuals and households, including the GST Vouchers, CDC Vouchers and the COVID-19 Recovery Grant.",19,391,2021-07-05-T-011-S-00391

Drawing on past reserves is a major move. We do so only in exceptional circumstances. That was the case last year. Our economy shrank by 5.4%, the largest fall since Independence. Our resident unemployment rate rose to nearly 5%. At the start of this financial year, because we were starting out on a new term, we had to draw on past reserves again to finance the continuing COVID-related measures in the Budget.",20,392,2021-07-05-T-011-S-00392

We will not hesitate to use the full measure of our fiscal firepower to protect the lives and livelihoods of Singaporeans. But we also need to be careful about the state of our public finances and ensure they are sustainable for the future. In many countries, COVID-19 has led to massive increases in debt levels, which have not been seen since the end of the Second World War. Not many people are paying attention to how all of this debt will be serviced. They may look affordable now, but will not be so once interest rates increase to more normal levels. The day of reckoning will come and the burden will surely fall on the young and future generations.",22,394,2021-07-05-T-011-S-00394

We are very fortunate to be where we are today, thanks to the foresight and fiscal prudence of our forefathers. When the Reserves Protection Framework was introduced in 1991, no one could have foreseen that a pandemic of this magnitude would hit us one day. But it is precisely this discipline of setting aside resources for rainy days that has put us in a strong fiscal position to respond decisively to the current crisis.",23,395,2021-07-05-T-011-S-00395

It is an amount which we are not likely to be able to put back anytime soon, if at all. Our expenditure in FY2020 was the highest ever in the history of our country; and this unprecedented fiscal response has also led to the largest Budget deficit in Singapore’s history. Now that things are better, we should refrain from drawing further on past reserves. Instead, we will fund the support measures using resources that were approved in this year’s Budget. That is the responsible way to manage our finances.",24,396,2021-07-05-T-011-S-00396

2021-07-05-T-011,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"About $0.6 billion out of the $1.2 billion will come from the capitalisation of development expenditure under the Significant Infrastructure Government Loan Act, or SINGA, in short. There are two projects that meet the criteria for financing under SINGA   the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System and the North-South Corridor. We had set aside funds for these two projects in Budget 2021, before SINGA was passed. With SINGA, we will borrow for these projects and capitalise their development expenditure from the fourth quarter of this year. The amount that was originally budgeted to finance these two projects can now be reallocated to fund this support package. This is a one-off adjustment, because SINGA was passed after we started the financial year. Going forward, the amounts that will be capitalised under SINGA will be incorporated as part of future annual Budget Estimates and, so, we will not have such reallocation space in future.",26,398,2021-07-05-T-011-S-00398
2021-07-05-T-011,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"The remaining $0.6 billion will be reallocated from underutilisation of development expenditure mainly due to delays in projects arising from COVID-19. It does not mean we are cancelling the projects. We still want to do the projects and we will have to catch up on our development schedules as the situation stabilises. So, the delayed expenditure will still need to be incurred in future financial years. But, in the meantime, there is some fiscal space for reallocation. That is why I am introducing this Supplementary Supply Bill to effect the total reallocation of $1.2 billion to fund the support package.",27,399,2021-07-05-T-011-S-00399

So, our SMEs in Singapore can continue to enjoy low taxes. Let me share some numbers.",31,403,2021-07-05-T-011-S-00403

2021-07-05-T-011,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Besides taxes, we recognise that SMEs are concerned with business costs, like rental, labour and utilities. We do not directly offset such costs in normal times but, instead, provide a wide range of schemes to help them improve productivity and build new capabilities. So, from 2015 to 2019, before COVID-19, about 70% of Government grant disbursements went to SMEs.",33,405,2021-07-05-T-011-S-00405
2021-07-05-T-011,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"During times of crises, we recognise that lower-income households and SMEs face bigger challenges. That is why we have designed our interventions to benefit them the most. In particular, our COVID-19 support packages provide more help for SMEs. For example, about two-thirds of the $26.7 billion of JSS paid out to-date went to SMEs. About 90% of the benefits from the corporate income tax rebate in the Year of Assessment 2020 went to SMEs.",34,406,2021-07-05-T-011-S-00406
2021-07-05-T-011,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"For many SMEs, access to credit is a critical lifeline to tide them through this crisis. That is why we have supported over $22 billion worth of loans to over 25,000 enterprises through Enterprise Singapore’s financing schemes since the start of 2020. Ninety-nine percent of the recipients were SMEs. While economic conditions have improved, such access to credit remains critical to our SMEs. Therefore, I will extend the Temporary Bridging Loan Programme and the Enhanced Enterprise Financing Scheme – Trade Loan for an additional six months from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022.

2021-07-05-T-011,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"When coming up with these measures, I am especially mindful of our SMEs' situation. SMEs are the backbone of our economy.

2021-07-05-T-015,Eric Chua,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Eric Chua) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"Sir, the Mental Capacity Act or MCA has been enacted for more than 10 years now. The MCA allows for Lasting Powers of Attorney or LPAs to be registered with the Public Guardian. The LPA is a legal instrument through which a person, called a ""donor"", appoints one or more persons, called ""donees"", to make decisions on the donor’s personal welfare and/or property and affairs, should the donor lose mental capacity in the future to make such decisions. The MCA also allows the Court to appoint a person, called ""deputy"", to make certain decisions on behalf of a person who lacks mental capacity but has not made an LPA. The key difference between a donee and a deputy is that a donee is appointed by the donor when he or she has mental capacity, while a deputy is appointed by the Court after the person has lost mental capacity.",2,468,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00468

We never know when events that could result in the loss of mental capacity, such as accidents and diseases, may strike. Making our LPAs early offers peace of mind for ourselves and our family. For example, Mr Low Kim Leng, a 69-year-old retiree, and his wife made their LPAs after witnessing how the LPA ensured that the affairs of their relatives with dementia were well taken care of.",3,469,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00469

To encourage more Singaporeans to sign up and pre-plan, we have waived the $75 fee for LPA Form 1 applications by Singapore Citizens until March 2023. This means Singaporeans need not pay any application fee when making their LPAs during this period. They will need to pay for the LPA Certification service, which is about $50 or less, based on rates charged by those found on a list of the top 10 most visited doctors who are serving as Certificate Issuers as at January this year.",6,472,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00472

2021-07-05-T-015,Eric Chua,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Eric Chua) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"Firstly, the Bill will make it possible to create and execute LPA instruments electronically. Clause 3 of the Bill introduces a new Part IIIA on matters pertaining to the establishment and operations of a new electronic transaction system, OPG Online or OPGO. New subsections (5) to (14) of section 11, which are inserted by clause 4 of the Bill, will allow us to recognise an electronic copy of an LPA registered prior to the launch of OPGO to be free from error and to be treated as the lasting power of attorney, if certain conditions are met. Other transactions such as the filing of a Deputy Report with the Office of the Public Guardian will be lodged via OPGO as well. This is in line with the Government’s commitment to harness technology to better serve Singaporeans and so that all donors and donees can reap the benefits of going digital. We will support those who are less tech savvy so that the gains will be enjoyed by everyone.",10,476,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00476

To this end, we can do better. For example, Dr Sin Yong, a Certificate Issuer who certifies that a donor has mental capacity to make an LPA, shared that doing away with hard copies could reduce the hassle of passing around paper forms. Indeed, by enabling LPAs to be made online, there will be greater convenience, efficiency and security for our citizens. Let me illustrate.",12,478,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00478

Donees will not need to append their wet-ink signatures before a witness or to affix physical seals on the LPAs. Instead, donees will be notified of the donor’s intention to appoint them via SMS and email. They can then log on to OPGO via Singpass to accept the appointment. This is especially beneficial if donees are overseas and unable to return to Singapore to do so.",13,479,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00479

Currently, hard copy LPAs must have wet-ink signatures appended and seals affixed by the donors to be executed as deeds. Going forward, the donor will sign the LPA using his National Digital Identity in OPGO in the presence of a Certificate Issuer, instead of appending wet-ink signatures and affixing seals. Certificate Issuers can be accredited medical practitioners, practising lawyers and registered psychiatrists. The new section 12A of the Act inserted by clause 6 of the Bill sets out the requirements for the LPA to be executed electronically as a deed.",14,480,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00480
2021-07-05-T-015,Eric Chua,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Eric Chua) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"Second, digitalisation will cut the time taken to complete and register an LPA. With built-in system checks and validations, most online LPA applications can be immediately processed upon submission. This is a substantial time saving compared to the current three weeks processing time. A handful of cases may require manual processing, that will take about eight working days. To be clear, there will still be a three-week waiting period allowing for any objection to the registration of the LPA to be raised. This three-week window starts from the date the Public Guardian notifies the donee or donees of the acceptance of the donor’s application to register the LPA. If there are no objections at the end of this three-week waiting period, the Public Guardian will register the LPA instrument. On a related note, we will also tap on Singpass to retrieve personal information via MyInfo. This auto-populates the donor’s particulars into the online LPA, thus increasing the ease of making an LPA.",15,481,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00481

In this regard, we have retained the critical requirement for the donor to execute the LPA before a Certificate Issuer. Under paragraph 2(1)(e) of the First Schedule to the Act, the Certificate Issuer will need to certify that the donor understands the purpose of the LPA and the scope of the authority conferred under it, and the donor is not under undue pressure or duress to make the LPA and that there is nothing else which would prevent the LPA from being created. The Certificate Issuer must be satisfied that these conditions are fulfilled before the Certificate Issuer may certify the LPA.",16,482,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00482

Donors and donees will be able to easily access the registered LPA in OPGO. When transacting with third parties on behalf of the donor, donees may request for the Office of the Public Guardian to send an electronic copy of the LPA to the third party. This assures third parties that the LPA is indeed the true and latest version. Additionally, individuals will be able to conduct online LPA searches and, subject to approval, request for certified true copies of the registered LPAs via OPGO.",18,484,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00484

For example, deputies can use an online finance tracker to manage the incapacitated person's income and expenses. Certain fields in the reports will also be prefilled with information from court documents, the previous year's report and the finance tracker. Deputies will not have to manually complete their reports or compile their supporting documents. Instead, they can focus on caring for their incapacitated loved ones.",19,485,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00485

In the unlikely event that there is an error in the electronic copy, the new section 16A of the Act which is inserted by clause 10 of the Bill, protects the donee if he or she had relied on the electronic copy without knowing of the error and protects any third party, if the third party had transacted in good faith and without knowledge of the error.",26,492,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00492

There had been concerns about the exploitative behaviour of donees in past discussions of the Mental Capacity Act. Such cases form a very small minority and we had amended the Mental Capacity Act in 2016 to put in place pre-emptive actions. For example, the Court may under the existing section 36A(3) of the Act, suspend the donee, or deputy's powers. If he or she has engaged in conduct affecting his or her suitability to be a donee or deputy and there is a risk of dissipation of the incapacitated persons assets. But we can do more to protect the donors proactively even before an LPA is registered.",27,493,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00493

Today, almost 90% of the donees are the donor's immediate family members, of which more than 60% are below 50 years old. This is promising as it indicates that family support is strong with many donees often helping their older relatives to fill up the hard copy LPAs. As we roll out OPGO later this year, I am confident that many Singaporeans will continue to rely on their family to assist with their LPA applications online.",32,498,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00498

2021-07-05-T-015,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"While this method might be administratively expedient and help save time, and certainly it does, given that this is such an important document, I think we should instead make it an affirmative confirmation by the donor that all details are correct; that is, to ensure that the consent is active consent. The security and sanctity of the LPA are worth the increase in administrative work, in my opinion.",22,528,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00528
2021-07-05-T-015,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Finally, I am heartened to hear that there are safeguards in place should there be reason to suspect that someone was pressured or deceived into making an LPA, especially if the donor lacks mental capacity. In such cases, the Public Guardian can disclose to the donor the number of LPAs for which their prospective donee has already been appointed to allow them to make a more informed decision.",23,529,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00529
2021-07-05-T-015,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"This safeguard, I feel, can be made stronger. We should not subject the Public Guardian to such a heavy responsibility. The Public Guardian should not really have to exercise judgement about when to step in. Instead, as long as the donee is a multiple nominee, I think this must be disclosed to the donor. With the disclosure, the donor can then decide if he or she wants to continue making the LPA with this donee.",24,530,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00530
2021-07-05-T-015,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"In the long run, as we improve access and strengthen safeguards against abuse of the process, hopefully more people will make an LPA.

2021-07-05-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, the primary purpose of this Bill is to enable the Office of the Public Guardian to establish an electronic transaction system to facilitate the execution and registration of LPAs and other documents.

2021-07-05-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The in-person appearance is important as it will enable the Certificate Issuer – whether a lawyer, a psychiatrist or a credited medical practitioner – to make some assessment as to whether the donor is making the document out of free will. In comparison, having the donor appear online may be convenient. But online certification also carries a higher risk that there are unseen persons or forces adding pressure to the donor to execute the document.",5,537,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00537

2021-07-05-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"It would be useful for the Ministry to elaborate on the scope of these exceptions. When we say a person is unable to use the system due to physical disability, are we referring to a person who cannot use his fingers to key in a digital identification or who is visually impaired? What is the scope of the wide phrase ""for any other reason""? Would this include, for instance, persons who are hospitalised or incarcerated?",11,543,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00543

The new section 31A provides that the Public Guardian may require the donor to appear before him if there is reasonable cause to suspect that fraud or undue pressure was used to induce the donor to execute the LPA or to appoint a particular donee. It is further stated that one of the grounds for such suspicion is the number of LPAs registered or pending registration with the same donee.",12,544,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00544
2021-07-05-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, this provision is well-intentioned but raises a few questions. Although it is stated that the Public Guardian can require the donor to be interviewed, it is not stated what the consequence will be if the donor does not attend. This could happen for innocent reasons like not being physically mobile. What will the Public Guardian do in that circumstance?",13,545,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00545

2021-07-05-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Third, the Bill specifically suggests that being a donee in multiple LPAs is a suspicious circumstance. How will this operate in practice? For example, if I am named a donee by three family members, will that be considered suspicious?

More Singaporeans are expected to be hit by dementia or loss of mental capacity gradually. In a 2015 study conducted by the Well Being of the Singapore Elderly or WiSE led by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), one in 10 people aged 60 and above may have dementia.

There is also an inertia to take the initiative by many to apply for an LPA.

2021-07-05-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Such a requirement would provide the OPG with more information on how powers are being exercised under the Act, which would be useful for subsequent policy reviews. Such a requirement may also make the donees take the exercise of their responsibilities a little more seriously when it comes to making very major decisions on behalf of their donors.",9,590,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00590
2021-07-05-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I would stress that I am not suggesting that donees be made to file detailed descriptions of every single decision they make on behalf of the donor, or annual reports and so on and so forth, as this is too onerous.",10,591,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00591
2021-07-05-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Lastly, Sir, for the longer-term evolution of this body of law and regulation, would the Government consider giving some thought to complementing a substitutive decision-making model for LPAs with a supported decision-making model in the future?",11,592,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00592
2021-07-05-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Currently, the Mental Capacity Act or MCA adopts what can be termed a substituted decision-making model, which differs from the supported decision-making model now encouraged by the committee for the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities or CRPD.",12,593,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00593
2021-07-05-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Substituted decision-making enables a proxy to make decisions on behalf of another person who is incapable; therefore, the concerned individual has no right to make a decision for himself or herself unless the substitutive decision-making framework is reversed or mitigated through some form of legal action.",13,594,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00594
2021-07-05-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"One counter-argument to any move towards a supported decision-making model may be that the substitutive decision-making model may not be as paternalistic as it sounds right now. In the words of Assoc Prof Chin Jing Ji in an article in the journal of the College of Family Physicians, and I quote, “section 6 of the MCA defines best interests to include reasonably ascertainable past and present wishes and feelings, beliefs and values of the person, and other factors of significance. Furthermore, the MCA insists that before an act is done, or a decision is made, due consideration must be made to achieve the intended purpose in a way that is less restrictive on the person’s rights and freedom of action.”",14,595,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00595
2021-07-05-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"But, Sir, at best, the MCA is ambiguous as to whether it wants primarily to advocate autonomy or beneficence for the person lacking mental capacity. This ambiguity could allow for some interpretation in favour of supported decision-making at the practical level, but may also make decision-making challenging for the donee, potentially leading them to err on the side of caution, meaning to err on the side of paternalism.",15,596,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00596
2021-07-05-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"It is known within the medical community that the best interests of patients can sometimes come into conflict with substitute decision-making. Clinicians may be left in a difficult position when best interest standards are in conflict with each other. Some argue that the role that the managing physician plays in consensus-building is a potential solution. This problem is further complicated by the presence of paid professionals in the LPA system. Professional donees with little knowledge, no more than the doctor, about the donor’s preferences might be more likely to employ a standardised, paternalistic approach towards decision-making on behalf of the donor.",16,597,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00597

2021-07-05-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In the supported decision-making paradigm, the individual receives support from a trusted individual, a network of individuals or entities to make personal, financial and legal decisions that must be followed by a third party such as financial institutions, business, health professionals and service providers. Depending on the needs of the individual with a disability, depending on their particular condition, the supported person will aid the individual to understand the relevant issues and information and make decisions based on her own preferences. If necessary, the person providing support interprets and communicates the individual's preferences and desires to third parties, so that they can be realised.",18,599,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00599
2021-07-05-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"As described in a paper by researchers Devi, Bickenbach and Stucki, Canada is one of the leading countries in the legal implementation of supported decision-making models, for example, the Vulnerable Persons Living with a Disability Act 1993 from the province of Manitoba. Another example is contained in the province of British Columbia's Representation Agreement Act (RAA), under which an adult can enter into a ""representation agreement"" with a trusted person or support service who is empowered to either to assist that individual in making and communicating certain decisions with which he or she needs assistance, or to make decisions for him or her. Another example of a supported decision-making model is the Swedish ""legal mentor"" who acts as the individual's agent, with the individual's consent. Sweden revoked its formal guardianship laws for adults with disabilities in 1989 and replaced it with this supported decision-making model.",19,600,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00600

We have to think, plan and eventually execute the provisions for our mortality. The amendments we debate today will enable the Office of Public Guardian to digitalise the Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) process.

2021-07-05-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),I only have one short query and this is to clarify the legislative policy concerning the role of the Public Guardian in safeguarding the donor’s wellbeing and interests even before an LPA is made by him. This arises from the proposed amendments to give the Public Guardian (PG) the power to  (a) interview the donor if there are grounds to suspect there is fraud or undue influence to induce a donor to make an LPA or to appoint a particular person to be his donee; and (b) disclose to the donor the number of LPAs for which his prospective donee has already or will be appointed as donee on the same grounds.,5,609,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00609
2021-07-05-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),A number of hon Members of Parliament who spoke before me also dealt with this provision including hon Member Ms Sylvia Lim.,6,610,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00610
2021-07-05-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Let me say that, in principle, I do not have an issue with the proposed amendments. I applaud the move to enlarge the Public Guardian’s responsibilities so as to better protect the donor’s interests at the outset before an LPA is made. I do not see this as an extension of duties; the PG taking over the responsibility of ensuring that the donee is a suitable person. That responsibility must sit squarely with the donor. However, I think it is good that the PG provides the necessary support to the donor in terms of giving relevant information and putting the donor on notice before he makes the important decision on the choice of his donee.",7,611,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00611
2021-07-05-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),My short query is in relation to why the role of the PG in safeguarding the donor’s interest before the registration of the LPA cannot be expanded beyond fraud and undue influence to also include general suitability of the proposed donee.,8,612,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00612
2021-07-05-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"For example, it may serve the donor’s interest if the PG shares with the donor information as to whether the proposed donee has any criminal convictions dealing with theft, cheating, extortion, criminal breach of trust or an offence involving fraud or dishonesty. Such information is not easily accessible by members of public, even though these are matters of public record since convictions are almost always pronounced in open Court. Currently, the Court already has the power to revoke the LPA or direct that the LPA not to be registered on this ground if the conviction post-dates his appointment as donee. The presumption here, I gather, is that the donor would know or act with reasonable diligence to establish the proposed donee’s background beforehand.",9,613,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00613
2021-07-05-T-015,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"But, in practice, this is not necessarily the case.

Each one of these instruments play an important role in estate planning and helps provide peace of mind for our loved ones should something untoward happen in our lives. While we are still fortunate to be in good health and of sound mental capacity today, an LPA arguably also provides us with the serenity of knowing full well, that there will be someone we trust to undertake key decisions for us, should we lose mental capacity one day.",1,618,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00618

Upon conducting further research, I note that up to 2020, there has only been about 100,000 LPAs registered in Singapore. Even if we exclude foreigners and base our calculations off the resident adult population of about 3.2 million people, the number of registered LPAs represent a mere 3.1% of the resident adult population.",3,620,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00620

Beyond the digitalisation of the LPAs and the waiver of the application fee for Form 1 since September 2014, what more is being done, and how much resources are being dedicated to ensuring that we raise the awareness of LPAs and, ultimately, the number of LPA registrations in Singapore?",5,622,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00622
2021-07-05-T-015,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Looking into the details of the Bill, my first clarification is on section 31A, which my colleague Ms Sylvia Lim has discussed. While the new section allows for the Public Guardian to interview donors if there is reasonable cause to suspect that fraud or undue pressure was used to induce the donor to execute the LPA or to appoint a particular donee, I wonder if a caveat mechanism can be put in place as a preventive measure to protect vulnerable persons and prevent abuse, rather than just a risk-based approach of requiring an interview when risks are identified? This could involve, for example, having a next-of-kin or appointed caregiver submitting a declaration, substantiated with medical opinion that a person already lacks mental capacity or have intellectual disabilities, and that any attempts by the person to register for an LPA would raise an immediate red flag.",6,623,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00623

I consider myself a digital native and appreciate the digitalisation of paper-based processes, especially one which would involve the use of snail mail, to a purely electronic one.

Looking through the guides provided by the OPG in its current website, I note that the LPA brochure, guides for caregivers, donees and deputies are all available in Chinese, Malay and Tamil as well.

Yet even at the CCCs, my understanding is that staff will be assisting residents with performing Government transactions online. As it is an important document to make, elderly residents who may not be comfortable with digital forms, especially one in English and may not wish to complete the LPA form all at one go. As friendly as the CCC staff may be, elderly residents may also wish to consult their children or other relatives whom they trust to get a second opinion on the LPA and a physical form would better facilitate this whole process.",11,628,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00628

2021-07-05-T-015,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Even as the majority of Singapore rides the rapid waves of change in the digital sphere and we are moving forward in this space, I wish to highlight three concerns which I hope to see addressed we embark on this set of amendments.",7,644,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00644
2021-07-05-T-015,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"First, expanding outreach and communications. My wife and I did our LPA earlier this year and I must say the process is not a simple one. You need to read the fine print and there are quite a number of signatures and quite a number of documents and forms to go through.",8,645,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00645
2021-07-05-T-015,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"My first concern is with the seniors amongst us and whether the electronic process will be a boon or a bane to them as there are many who may not be electronically savvy and comfortable with the e-processes and may result in us losing out this group which are precisely the ones who need to make their LPAs most urgently, in case they lose their mental faculties with the passing of time and age. The question we need to address is how the electronic process will help or encourage seniors to do up the LPA? Will the system be multilingual as well and void of legalese?",9,646,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00646
2021-07-05-T-015,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"I understand that the Office of Public Guardian has plans to work with the People's Association, the Infocomm Media Development Authority and other organisations to train and assist elderly persons. This is a step in the right direction to evangelise the importance of the LPA. In addition, the Office of Public Guardian can also partner with NTUC and the Labour Movement as well as our union leaders to enhance the outreach to workers and union members. For a start, perhaps a special campaign can be embarked on to get all our union leaders to do up an LPA at a subsidised rate so that they can lead the way to encourage the workers and fellow members as they interact and engage them at the workplaces and the various shop floors.",10,647,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00647
2021-07-05-T-015,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Second is extending support at the local level and the needy. Over in my Pioneer constituency, my community volunteer team and I had also organised and conducted a Facebook live webinar in October last year on ""Wills, Estate Planning and Lasting Power of Attorney"" to educate our residents on this very important topic. We collaborated with Invictus Legacy centre to extend a very economical and affordable package to all Pioneer residents when they do up both an LPA and a simple Will, to the end of this year. This was well-received by my residents and many of them shared that this was a useful and practical. As of earlier this year, I know more than 300 residents have done up their LPAs in response to this special package and service for our residents.",11,648,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00648
2021-07-05-T-015,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"I recalled also doing a similar drive during my last term in Boon Lay constituency where we also extended a special package, but this time to the many needy and low-income residents there staying in rental flats. With this, I submit and suggest that OPG can work with the community and come up with a similar support scheme to assist low-income and needy residents to do up their LPAs. Besides waiver of the registration fee, which is a good move, support can come in the form of waiving or even subsidising the certificate issuer charges. There can also be proper benchmarks as now, there is a spectrum of charges imposed by Certificate Issuers depending on whether it is done through a lawyer, doctor or psychiatrist.",12,649,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00649
2021-07-05-T-015,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Third is deputyship. I am concerned for those who do not make their LPAs before losing mental capacity and their families and loved ones must now apply for deputyship with the Courts, which is a costly, time-consuming and cumbersome process, which quite a number of Members of this House have probably highlighted. Would MSF be making any further changes to simplify the existing procedure, which would save time, costs and energy for all of us? I note that there is a simplified application process for restricted use of monies of S$60,000 and below for certain categories of applications.",13,650,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00650
2021-07-05-T-015,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Further, the amendments propose to allow the Public Guardian, in case of suspected fraud, to disclose to a donor that his prospective donee is already a donee to multiple donors. Does this disclosure obligation apply across the board? Or would there be certain exemptions, for instance, where the appointed donee is either a next-of-kin, close relative, or friend of the multiple donors? Also, if the authorities suspect that fraud has been perpetrated, what will happen to all LPAs registered after the amendments have been passed?",14,651,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00651

2021-07-05-T-015,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (East Coast),"To provide additional safeguards for donors, it was mentioned that the Public Guardian may interview the donor and disclose to the donor the number of LPAs for which his or her prospective donee had already been appointed, or intends to be appointed. Could the Ministry provide more specifics on the process and how in doing so, would prevent fraudulent nominations and avoid conflict of interest for donees with multiple appointments? Further, how would the process account for and act as a preventive measure for those who are already experiencing an early onset of dementia or individuals with special needs?",4,656,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00656

If so, what would be the service level agreement in informing both the donor and the donee. This is a critical point as outlined in subsection (3) that and I quote, ""when an error or omission has been corrected, the error or omission is treated as not having occurred"".

I think a few of my fellow colleagues have spoken about this. But I just want to emphasise on one point  with more elderly in Singapore living alone, are there any concrete plans to assist these seniors to file for LPA if they have not done so and to assign deputies earlier to them to better support them in their later years.",8,660,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00660

Because as we go electronic and in many of these documentations, sometimes inevitably, that could be errors or that could be gaps. So, if we are not going to do this, how can the public agencies or organisations in which the donee is interacting on behalf of the donor, be assured that there is a validation process in place?",10,662,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00662

With this move towards electronic LPAs, would there be any additional cost for the donor in the LPA filing as compared to the non-electronic LPA? Because in clause 9, section 15A, it mentions that if there is any error to the non-electronic LPA, rectification can actually be made on the electronic version. So, my query is  what then would become of the non-electronic LPA? Will it be superseded?

2021-07-05-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I have four points for clarification on this Bill on the transition process.,3,671,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00671
2021-07-05-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My first point is on the rectification of relevant errors.,4,672,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00672
2021-07-05-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),The new section 11(10) provides that the Public Guardian (PG) may rectify a relevant error if it is satisfied that there is a relevant error. This suggests that the PG has the discretion to rectify a relevant error but is not obligated to rectify the error. The new section 11(12)(B)(II) also addresses the situation where a PG decides not to rectify a relevant error.,5,673,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00673
2021-07-05-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Can the Parliamentary Secretary clarify under what circumstances will the PG not rectify a relevant error? In addition, can the Parliamentary Secretary confirm that for the 90-day period before the electronic copy is treated as being free from error, the non-electronic copy remains the LPA? Can the Parliamentary Secretary also then confirm that the donee and third parties are entitled to rely on the non-electronic copy in the 90-day period before the electronic copy becomes the LPA, even if there are discrepancies in the non-electronic copy, which the PG may decide not to rectify in the electronic copy?",6,674,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00674
2021-07-05-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My second point is on parties that have relied on relevant errors in carrying out transactions.,7,675,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00675
2021-07-05-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The new subsection 10D(3) provides that where an error or omission has been corrected, the error or omission is treated as not having occurred.

2021-07-05-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Where a transaction is entered based on a relevant error, which is corrected, can the Parliamentary Secretary clarify the effect of the correction on the transaction?

2021-07-05-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I ask this because, according to section 10D(3), the error is treated as not having occurred, which may mean that the basis of the transaction no longer exists and should be unwound. However, section 16A(2) provides that a person is entitled to rely on the electronic copy with the relevant error in relation to the transaction, which suggests that the transaction remains valid.",10,678,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00678

2021-07-05-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My third point is on suspected fraud or undue pressure on a donor.,12,680,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00680
2021-07-05-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Under the new section 31A(1), a donor may be interviewed if the PG has reasonable cause to suspect that fraud or undue pressure has been used to induce the donor to execute the instrument.",13,681,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00681
2021-07-05-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In addition to interviewing the donor, does the PG have the power to interview persons related to the donor or to interview the donee? In the event that the PG is of the view that there is sufficient evidence to show that fraud or undue pressure was, in fact, used to induce the donor to execute the instrument, will the PG intervene, regardless of the donor's stated wishes? What are the steps a PG will take in relation to a donee that it suspects is using fraud or undue pressure to influence multiple donors to appoint him or her as a donee?",14,682,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00682

2021-07-05-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),The new section 10(C)(1) requires a person to use the electronic transaction system if they wish to register an instrument to create an LPA. Section 10(C)(2) contemplates that there may be some circumstances where a transaction cannot be carried out using the electronic transaction system due to a person's physical disability or other circumstances.,16,684,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00684
2021-07-05-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Can the	Parliamentary Secretary elaborate on the circumstances under which a person may be exempted from using the electronic transaction system? The elderly and the vulnerable who may use and need the LPA most may also be the demographic that faces the most difficulties using this new electronic transaction system.,17,685,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00685
2021-07-05-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I am glad that the Office of Public Guardian (OPG) has already shared its many initiatives and roadshows to educate and provide assistance for using the electronic transaction system.,18,686,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00686
2021-07-05-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),The UK has also implemented an online system for LPAs.

2021-07-05-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Mr Speaker, at this juncture, I would also like to shed some light on another vulnerable slice of society and they are adults with special needs and residents with mental health impediments.",15,705,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00705
2021-07-05-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"On the extreme end, parents or relevant caregivers assume deputyship over these individuals, making decisions on their behalf in matters akin to an LPA. However, special needs and, indeed, mental incapacity, are a spectrum and we find a great diversity of conditions. Some cases are more visible than others while many other such conditions are virtually invisible to the untrained eye. Some conditions cause mental incapacities in bouts or sporadic episodes and cannot be recognised with certainty in one-off encounters.",16,706,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00706
2021-07-05-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"We recognise that online LPA services greatly add to the convenience of the process by reducing the need for physical appointments even though these physical appointments, arguably, play pivotal roles in the ascertainment of mental capacities. Given the grave implications of making an LPA, we cannot, with good faith, proceed with the issuance of LPAs should there be any shadow of a doubt whether or not an individual is under pressure or has mental health impediments. We must get it right every single time.",17,707,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00707
2021-07-05-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Sir, while I am ready to place my faith in the intentions of LPA certificate issuers – medical doctors, psychiatrists and lawyers – their ability to ascertain an individual's mental capacity at the time of issuance is, actually, paramount to safeguarding the integrity of the process.",18,708,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00708
2021-07-05-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"For example, should an individual who experiences episodes that result in delusions seek to make an LPA, how would the certificate issuer be able to ascertain that the basis on which the individual applies for an LPA is grounded in reality? Would an untrained personnel be able to make an assessment based on a one-off interaction with a special needs adult? These are situations that are not easy, even with physical interactions and online submissions make it even more tricky. Without additional safeguards or a transparent and rigorous evaluation system for mental capacity, the issuance of LPAs over an online system might become inconsistent at best, and, at worst, fail to protect the individuals it was precisely set out to protect.",19,709,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00709

His father did not execute an LPA when he was mentally capable of doing so. As such, Mr K was stuck in limbo. To obtain legal permission, he would have to apply to the Courts to be appointed as a deputy. This is both costly and time-consuming. I have proposals in three broad areas to enhance the Bill further.",2,718,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00718
2021-07-05-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"First, Mr Speaker, Sir, we should make the process even more convenient for residents. I noted that the requirement for the donor to appear before the LPA certificate issuer, or CI, is retained. While I understand the rationale, this safeguard of meeting in person still presents a challenge to donors who have mobility problems. I hope that the Government can look out for this group of donors. Perhaps the Silver Generation Office can be roped in to do house visits. They can help to make clarifications and arrange for a CI to certify the LPA in the comfort of seniors' homes. Some medical practitioners and law firms already offer house visits. OPG should consider including those who provide such options on their websites and in the directory of CIs.",3,719,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00719
2021-07-05-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"We should also consider having the process authenticated using digital fingerprints. Banks and hospitals are already doing this for their forms and transactions. This will be useful for residents who may have suffered from a stroke and have difficulty signing physical documents, or those who are illiterate among our elderly.",4,720,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00720
2021-07-05-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Next, Mr Speaker, Sir, along with increased convenience, we need to make sure that there are sufficient safeguards in place. With digitisation, a growing concern is the rising trend of data leaks. In this case, we are looking at potential leaks of highly personal information. It could leave donors vulnerable to online fraud or blackmail. How will the Government safeguard our data in the event of a cybersecurity breach? How can donors be assured that they will not be left to their own devices to navigate the associated issues?",5,721,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00721
2021-07-05-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Separately, there was public feedback for the OPG to assist healthcare professionals and providers to retrieve the LPA and donee's contact information in a timely and cost-efficient manner. Currently, healthcare practitioners may login via Singpass to the OPG's e-services portal to make a search request. The search results indicate whether the patient has made an LPA and the relevant details of the donee. As the LPA will now be digital, can an LPA be automatically updated on the National Electronic Health Record system? This is so that in the event that an LPA needs to be activated, the healthcare professional need not wait two working days and pay $20 just to know who to contact.",6,722,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00722
2021-07-05-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"I note that as part of the additional safeguards for donors, the Public Guardian may interview the donor. The Public Guardian may disclose to the donor the number of LPAs for which his or her prospective donee has already been appointed, or intends to be appointed. This is in the scenario if there is suspicion that fraud or undue pressure was used to induce a donor from making an LPA or appoint a particular person to be his or her donee.",7,723,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00723
2021-07-05-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Beyond this, another suggestion would be to make it mandatory for donees to notify the OPG of their intention to exercise their authority before doing so. This is to better protect donors from abuse. Requiring the donee to notify the OPG can act as a road bump to make some potential abusers think twice.",8,724,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00724
2021-07-05-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Checks and processes could also be added to look into cases where a Singaporean with living blood-related family members decides to appoint an unrelated person as his donee. There were 21,000 LPAs registered in 2020. Currently, 90% of donees are immediate family members. Still, that leaves 10% of them, or about 2,100 donors in 2020 alone, who have unrelated donees.",9,725,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00725
2021-07-05-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"According to the recent population census, more people are choosing to remain single. Some married couples are opting to go childless. As such, we will likely see more Singaporeans choosing unrelated donees due to the lack of younger relations to count on.",10,726,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00726
2021-07-05-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Having such checks may prevent fraud incidents like the high-profile Mdm Chung's case in 2016, who appointed an unrelated former tour guide from China as a donee. The 2020 edition of LPA Form 1 requires the donor to specify the relationship of the donee to the donor. This helps to alert the OPG should an unrelated donee be appointed. Hence, OPG should institute precautions when such unrelated donees are appointed, especially when LPA applications involve vulnerable groups.",11,727,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00727
2021-07-05-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir, we should do more with regard to awareness and outreach to make sure more residents know about this important process. Under PAP Seniors Group, we will be rolling out LPA awareness talks to the public, encouraging more people, especially younger Singaporeans, to make their own LPA.",12,728,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00728
2021-07-05-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"I wish to circle back to a point I made when I spoke on the Electronics Transaction (Amendment) Bill earlier this year. Digitisation is merely an enabler. We should review the fundamentals of the LPA application process to ensure that is user centric. Although the LPA is for adults above the age of 21, statistically, elderly Singaporeans are more vulnerable to mental incapacitation. We should, therefore, continue to focus our efforts on seniors. Advanced Care Planning, or ACP, is a critical component of ageing. The LPA may be important in ensuring that ACP is properly implemented in tandem.",13,729,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00729
2021-07-05-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Unlike the ACP, which is non-binding, an LPA is a legal document that appoints donees. Should one have already made an LPA, it would be ideal and advisable for one's donee and the nominated healthcare spokesperson to be the same person. This is to avoid possible disagreements when making healthcare decisions on one's behalf. I hope that the Government will look into incorporating ACP options into the LPA drafting process on the electronic system.",14,730,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00730
2021-07-05-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"MSF could work with MOH to encourage all general practitioners (GPs), especially those who are concurrently qualified CIs, to proactively provide packages of LPA and ACP to their patients. Both Ministries should also build an integrated process from the Social Service Agencies, or SSAs, to the healthcare institutions to encourage this effort. SSA officers should be trained to provide this service. In the hospitals and polyclinics, they should actively highlight LPA and ACP matters to their patients.",15,731,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00731
2021-07-05-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"OPG should also have a central hotline to provide support for all the GPs and SSAs. LPA consultations should be made more accessible in various languages and dialects. Likewise, the new online LPA service should be made available in four languages. Extending this further, we should take a whole-of-Government approach for outreach and awareness. Offer LPAs to everyone who is above 30 years old, like CareShield Life. We should start early because the risks of stroke and dementia are higher as we age. MSF should also work with CPF Board to see whether we can incorporate the process of reviewing one's nomination for CPF as well as LPA.",16,732,2021-07-05-T-015-S-00732
2021-07-05-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, the LPA is a critical legal document.

And because racial harmony is about people, about relationships, all of us have a part to play and we must do so with sensitivity, responsibility and in good faith. As Minister Edwin Tong said here earlier today, we need a whole-of-society approach.

2021-07-05-T-017,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"The first thrust, engagement, is about the willingness to reach out, to teach, to understand and to build understanding. Government bodies have played a big part in this regard and organisations like OnePeople.sg and the Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles (IRCCs) have done great work.

Bad actors are malicious characters who seek to sow dissent between our communities and opportunists may not be malicious but they seek to exploit certain incidents for personal gain – perhaps some attention, perhaps a few more likes or a few more clicks. While they may be hopping onto legitimate concerns, opportunists do not work towards resolution because they want to extract the maximum benefit from the situation and may therefore seek to exacerbate it and prolong it.

PA apologised quickly, as did Member Melvin Yong. Minister Edwin Tong sent his unreserved apology and expressed dismay at the standee being used as a caricature.

Former Member of Parliament Zainal Sapari said that the incident was not racist and that the PA was true to its mission of promoting racial harmony.

2021-07-05-T-017,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"Let us start with Special Assistance Plan (SAP) schools. What is it that bugs some people about the SAP schools? First, it is the impression that one of our constituent races, the Chinese, has an entire educational programme unto itself that benefits from state resources. I have seen comments online in response that, in return, minorities have madrasahs. Let me just be clear on this point, Sir, that madrasahs should not be considered the minority's equivalent of SAP schools. Madrasahs are religion-based, they are not race-based, and they exist for entirely different purposes.",20,761,2021-07-05-T-017-S-00761
2021-07-05-T-017,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"Second, Sir, there is a fear that SAP school students are an insular Chinese elite, aloof from the other races. SAP schools have origins in the Chinese-education schools of old but their contemporary purpose is to build a group of Singaporeans well versed in Chinese culture and language to engage China, the world's second superpower and second largest economy. Language and cultural competency grant us a competitive edge.",21,762,2021-07-05-T-017-S-00762
2021-07-05-T-017,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"For example, my colleague who studied Higher Chinese, is able to read, draft and negotiate contracts in Mandarin. This has enabled her to compete with Chinese lawyers in the Chinese market for legal work. As former Member of Parliament Low Thia Khiang said in this House, ""the learning of Mandarin should be part of the overall strategy of anchoring Singapore as a Global-Asian node as it will help us to connect to 1.3 billion Chinese"" and it is ""a tool of soft power"".",22,763,2021-07-05-T-017-S-00763
2021-07-05-T-017,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"There is therefore a practical and pragmatic purpose to the SAP schools. So, let us take a step back and ask ourselves whether Malay SAP schools or Tamil SAP schools would fulfill the same purposes. Will such schools give their graduates a similar edge to compete in, presumably, India or Malaysia? My view is that it would be unlikely. India and Malaysia are very different economies and societies as compared to China. For example, business is more easily conducted in English in these countries and we also have the common language of the common law.",23,764,2021-07-05-T-017-S-00764

2021-07-05-T-017,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"The pragmatic purpose of the SAP schools aside, it is, however, a legitimate and valid concern that these students may become an insular lot. My colleague, a SAP school graduand, told me that not only did she have little exposure to people of other races while schooling, but that she also did not feel any motivation to seek out, engage or befriend them outside of school as they did not feature in her own lived experience. She said that she only made friends from other races when she went to University. This SAP school experience was echoed by one Mr Lee Young Kai in a letter in The Straits Times Forum published just a few hours ago.",25,766,2021-07-05-T-017-S-00766

2021-07-05-T-017,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"Furthermore, in a multi-racial country, the perception of bias in voting along racial lines is as dangerous as the reality. It is too easy for a losing minority candidate to claim that she or he had lost due to race bias. If so much heat and noise can be generated from an incident involving a standee and, recently, in the news, about a waffle – and I say this without trivialising those incidents – just imagine how much more divisiveness will be generated from claims of racism affecting elections or the electability of a minority candidate? The GRC system removes the possibility of this being claimed post-elections. The importance of this cannot be downplayed and is a uniquely Singaporean feature of our elections.",30,771,2021-07-05-T-017-S-00771

In fact, Sir, if we look at the 2016 CNA-IPS Survey, which showed that while Singaporeans preferred a Prime Minister of the same race, the same survey also showed that Singaporeans were accepting – all above 50% – of a Prime Minister of another race. So, I would say that the results show that a minority Prime Minister could actually have a chance of leading a party to win the elections and I am encouraged by this.",36,777,2021-07-05-T-017-S-00777

2021-07-05-T-018,Cheng Hsing Yao,Mr Cheng Hsing Yao,asked the Minister for Health in view of COVID-19 becoming endemic (a) what will be the future threshold for imposing nationwide restrictions such as another Phase Two (Heightened Alert); and (b) what must Singapore do to mentally prepare for life in this new normal.,1,828,2021-07-05-T-018-S-00828
2021-07-05-T-018,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,"asked the Minister for Health (a) what changes to safe management measures can the public expect when the COVID-19 situation transitions from ""pandemic"" to ""endemic"" status, particularly in healthcare, community, business and travel sectors; and (b) what are the criteria that will indicate such a transition.",1,829,2021-07-05-T-018-S-00829
2021-07-05-T-018,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Multi-Ministry Task Force will make public the full set of metrics and circumstances that will trigger movements between each phase of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions; (b) what are the public health benchmarks for moving between the pandemic control phases; and (c) whether there will be a fixed phase system for restriction levels in the future.,1,830,2021-07-05-T-018-S-00830
2021-07-05-T-018,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,asked the 	Minister for Health how does the Government intend to follow through on its promise to wind down the TraceTogether data collection programme in light of its announcement that the COVID-19 virus is expected to become endemic.,1,831,2021-07-05-T-018-S-00831
2021-07-05-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I thank the Members for their interest in Singapore’s transition to an endemic COVID-19 state. In this pandemic, every month or week makes a big difference, so in that context we are at a very early stage of our transition. Vaccination is key to the transition, but we have to grapple with many uncertainties, from further virus mutation or sudden outbreaks, and many twists and turns along the way. So it is against this backdrop that I will try to provide answers to the questions from Members.",1,832,2021-07-05-T-018-S-00832
2021-07-05-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In the past 18 months, we have managed our approach to COVID-19 by considering factors such as the number of COVID-19 infection cases, the trajectory of the pandemic, whether the infections are linked or unlinked, our testing capacity, and more recently, the proportion of our population that has been vaccinated. Another very important factor is the psychology of our people. Along the way, our polices are continually adjusted to ensure that the number of cases do not rise exponentially, causing our healthcare system to be overwhelmed because that will cause a lot of harm to many patients.",2,833,2021-07-05-T-018-S-00833
2021-07-05-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I can understand the desire for a definitive road map, with relaxation of public health measures and travel restrictions pegged to certain transparent benchmarks. We have seen how other countries tried to do this, but they had to delay the lifting of restrictions, or reverse earlier decisions such as removal of the requirement to wear masks in public. So I think a definitive roadmap may not be a realistic approach, given the uncertainties of the pandemic and the evolution of the virus.",3,834,2021-07-05-T-018-S-00834
2021-07-05-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But the direction we are heading towards is clear, and we are determined to do our best to make the transition. A major factor determining the pace and extent of the transition is vaccination. In line with that, we have identified a couple of milestones, such as getting 50% of our population fully vaccinated sometime in the second half of July, and then two-thirds around National Day. Whether we achieve these milestones depends heavily on the willingness of our people to step forward and get vaccinated. We are planning our transition and public health measures around these milestones. If we are confident enough to be more definitive, we will, and will announce our plans publicly.",4,835,2021-07-05-T-018-S-00835
2021-07-05-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Members also asked about when specific measures will be reviewed, including the winding down of TraceTogether at some point. There are several significant transition points. When we imagine endemic COVID-19 and achieving normalcy, these significant changes may not come across our minds. For example, we need to review how we want to treat individuals who are infected with COVID-19, whether they need to be hospitalised or can recover at home. We need to review the relevance of contact tracing and quarantine, and the focus and extent of testing for COVID-19. We will have to explore opportunities to open up quarantine-free travel corridors with countries and regions that are safe. We need to review the timing for winding down TraceTogether, monitoring and reporting the number of people who falls very sick as opposed to daily infections, and reducing mask wearing requirements.",5,836,2021-07-05-T-018-S-00836
2021-07-05-T-018,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"They are all significant departures from the COVID-19 pandemic practices that we have grown accustomed too. So each change will require a psychological shift. We have to study each move closely, implement them progressively and when appropriate. At all times, the public needs to feel assured, and confident of the steps we are taking. Just like fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, the transition to endemic COVID-19 will also need to be a whole-of-society effort, of all stakeholders working together, each person doing his or her part, and trusting each other.",6,837,2021-07-05-T-018-S-00837
2021-07-05-T-019,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak,"asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the Ministry doing to speed up the COVID-19 vaccination programme; (b) whether the supply of vaccines is a limiting factor; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider prioritising just the first injection, like in the UK and Canada, to accommodate more sign-ups in an effort to reduce infection rates.",1,838,2021-07-05-T-019-S-00838
2021-07-05-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for Health (a) whether his Ministry is minded to extend the COVID-19 vaccination programme to include prison inmates under the custody of the Singapore Prison Service; and (b) if so, what are the details of this plan.",1,839,2021-07-05-T-019-S-00839
2021-07-05-T-019,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"asked the Minister for Health given that various pharmaceutical companies are actively carrying out studies on the feasibility of vaccines against COVID-19 that are suitable for children aged 12 years and below, what are the steps taken by the Multi-Ministry Taskforce to ensure that Singapore secures and administers such vaccines once made available.",1,840,2021-07-05-T-019-S-00840
2021-07-05-T-019,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"asked the Minister for Health given that there is currently no provision for children below the age of 12 to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, how is the Multi-Ministry Taskforce intending to address the B.1.617 strain of infection given some scientific suggestion that it adversely affects children more than adults.",1,841,2021-07-05-T-019-S-00841
2021-07-05-T-019,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang,asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the vaccination plan for workers who have no option to work from home such as retail and delivery staff who need to be on the shop floor or at the frontline; and (b) whether they can be prioritised for the COVID-19 vaccination regardless of their age groups.,1,842,2021-07-05-T-019-S-00842
2021-07-05-T-019,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh,asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry can provide walk-in vaccination services for delivery workers so that these personnel who have tight busy schedules can continue to make deliveries promptly and safely.,1,843,2021-07-05-T-019-S-00843
2021-07-05-T-019,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,asked the Minister for Health whether he can elaborate on the COVID-19 vaccine supply constraints that limit Singapore’s national COVID-19 vaccination rollout.,1,844,2021-07-05-T-019-S-00844
2021-07-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,My answers will also cover questions filed by Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Yip Hon Weng,1,845,2021-07-05-T-019-S-00845
2021-07-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We continue to make good progress with our national vaccination programme. As of 3 July, we have administered more than 5.7 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Around 3.5 million individuals, or about 63% of our population, have received at least the first dose of the vaccine and 2.1 million people have received their second dose.",2,846,2021-07-05-T-019-S-00846
2021-07-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Our rate of vaccination depends upon our vaccine supply. We have agreements to bring in more than enough vaccines for everyone in Singapore. We have been able to bring forward the delivery of some vaccine supplies, allowing us to accelerate our vaccination programme. Now we can administer up to 80,000 daily doses, up from around 40,000 in May 2021.",3,847,2021-07-05-T-019-S-00847
2021-07-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,More COVID-19 vaccines are undergoing clinical trials. The Health Sciences Authority is reviewing the progress and other vaccines may be available in the future.,4,848,2021-07-05-T-019-S-00848
2021-07-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"One trial in the United Kingdom is studying the combination of the AstraZeneca vaccine (an adenovirus vector vaccine) for the first dose, and an mRNA vaccine for the second dose. This is known as a heterologous prime-boost combination. We will monitor their findings to assess the suitability of using such a strategy.",5,849,2021-07-05-T-019-S-00849
2021-07-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"All Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass Holders aged 12 and above have now had the chance to register for their first doses.

2021-07-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We understand some seniors may be hesitant to take the vaccines for a variety of reasons. For example, concerns about potential side-effects, vaccine safety and efficacy, or they have difficulties with care arrangements, or do not see the need for it. We are working closely with stakeholders to encourage the take-up among seniors through outreach, education and engagement.",7,851,2021-07-05-T-019-S-00851
2021-07-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"To make it more convenient for our seniors to get vaccinated, all Vaccination Centres in the community accept walk-ins for individuals aged 60 and above, without the need to register or book an appointment in advance. Seniors who are not mobile can request to be vaccinated at their homes by home vaccination teams.",8,852,2021-07-05-T-019-S-00852
2021-07-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The vaccination programme is now open to all Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass Holders aged 12 and above, so everyone, including retail and delivery staff working at the frontlines, can book a vaccination appointment and choose from multiple time slots. Please do so as soon as possible. Singapore Prison Service have also extended the vaccination programme to prison inmates. Thus far, about 80% of eligible inmates have received at least the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.",9,853,2021-07-05-T-019-S-00853
2021-07-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the Delta variant will adversely affect children more than adults. We are actively monitoring ongoing vaccine clinical trials conducted by pharmaceutical companies on children under 12 years old.",10,854,2021-07-05-T-019-S-00854
2021-07-05-T-019,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Achieving as high a level of vaccination coverage as possible in our population will help reduce the risks of community transmission and large outbreaks. It is a vital part of our strategy to deal with COVID-19 and to protect us all. If you are eligible to be vaccinated, please book an appointment today.",11,855,2021-07-05-T-019-S-00855
2021-07-05-T-020,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David,asked the Minister for Education (a) how is the COVID-19 vaccination programme for students coming along; and (b) whether any student has suffered adverse reactions to the vaccines.,1,856,2021-07-05-T-020-S-00856
2021-07-05-T-020,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"As part of the national vaccination programme, MOE commenced its vaccination exercise for students on 1 June 2021. We have been encouraged by the good progress. As of 4 July 2021, over 313,000 eligible students (around 91%) have registered for their vaccination appointments, of which about 98% have received their first dose.",1,857,2021-07-05-T-020-S-00857
2021-07-05-T-020,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"HSA has been monitoring the adverse events (AEs) in our students, especially for the younger students. Thus far, the AEs reported are similar to those in adults and most comprise injection site pain, fatigue, headache, chills and fever, which generally resolve on their own within a few days. Likewise, the preliminary incidence rates for students appear to be fairly similar to the adult population, but it would be best to let HSA provide a detailed update to the public as part of their regular safety update on the COVID-19 vaccines.",2,858,2021-07-05-T-020-S-00858
2021-07-05-T-020,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"There are also a very small number of serious adverse events (SAEs) that have been reported. These SAE cases either did not require hospitalisation, or if they did, they have all since been discharged. HSA is reviewing the cases to assess if they are linked to vaccination. MOE, MOH and HSA will continue to monitor the AEs that occur, and take the appropriate actions to safeguard the health of our students.",3,859,2021-07-05-T-020-S-00859
2021-07-05-T-021,Cheng Hsing Yao,Mr Cheng Hsing Yao,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what are the economic opportunities for Singapore in an environment where COVID-19 is endemic.,1,860,2021-07-05-T-021-S-00860
2021-07-05-T-021,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In an endemic COVID-19 environment, the virus will survive in our community, similar to common diseases like flu and chicken pox. With effective vaccination, testing and treatment regimes in place, fewer people will need hospitalisation or medication.",1,861,2021-07-05-T-021-S-00861
2021-07-05-T-021,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Economic activity will progressively normalise as we reopen the domestic economy and our borders. But the virus may continue to mutate, periodically leading to new variants and outbreaks. We have put in place measures to respond quickly to outbreaks, if necessary.",2,862,2021-07-05-T-021-S-00862
2021-07-05-T-021,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We have been working closely with the industry to enable us to seize opportunities when economic activity resumes, building on the momentum of our Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) and recommendations from the Emerging Stronger Taskforce (EST).",3,863,2021-07-05-T-021-S-00863
2021-07-05-T-021,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"For example, we will position Singapore as a critical node in the growing digital economy, by strengthening our connectivity in the digital economy through a network of Digital Economy Agreements (DEAs), platforms like Business sans Borders, and supporting more businesses to digitalise.",4,864,2021-07-05-T-021-S-00864
2021-07-05-T-021,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"As part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, we will also help our enterprises and workforce to harness sustainability as a competitive advantage, and develop innovative solutions for the green economy. For example, we aim to grow Singapore into a carbon trading and services hub, and a green financing hub.",5,865,2021-07-05-T-021-S-00865
2021-07-05-T-021,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"COVID-19 has also surfaced new economic opportunities. For example, the increased focus on health and wellness could open up new opportunities in the biopharmaceutical sector, while the desire to build more robust supply chains could create new demand for our logistics companies. There are also new areas of opportunity in agri-tech, as we strive to strengthen our food resilience.",6,866,2021-07-05-T-021-S-00866
2021-07-05-T-021,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We can pursue these opportunities successfully only if we keep our fundamentals strong, and our economy competitive.",7,867,2021-07-05-T-021-S-00867
2021-07-05-T-021,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We must acknowledge our natural disadvantages as a small, resource-scarce economy. But our growth prospects need not be limited by our size and we can grow beyond these limitations, as evidenced by our pipeline of investments even during the pandemic. However, we cannot take our growth for granted, as other economies are fast raising their game.",8,868,2021-07-05-T-021-S-00868
2021-07-05-T-021,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,An endemic COVID-19 situation will bring fresh opportunities to rebuild our competitive strengths and to develop new strengths. We hope to partner businesses and workers over the next few years in seizing these opportunities and emerge stronger together.,9,869,2021-07-05-T-021-S-00869
2021-07-05-T-022,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for National Development given the current severe challenges faced by the construction industry (a) whether HDB will be able to build enough BTO flats to meet the demand of home buyers; and (b) whether HDB will assist first-time home buyers with affordable alternative options.,1,870,2021-07-05-T-022-S-00870
2021-07-05-T-022,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"HDB adopts a comprehensive approach in planning the BTO flat supply, taking into account factors such as the prevailing economic and housing market conditions, and long-term demographic and population trends.",1,871,2021-07-05-T-022-S-00871
2021-07-05-T-022,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Notwithstanding the current challenges that the construction industry is facing, HDB is on track to launch about 17,000 BTO flats in 2021 as planned, to meet the needs of home buyers. This is higher than the 14,600 and 16,800 flats launched in 2019 and 2020 respectively. The BTO flat supply is supplemented by balance flats which are offered via the Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercises and open booking.",2,872,2021-07-05-T-022-S-00872
2021-07-05-T-022,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Going forward, we will continue to maintain a healthy and steady supply of BTO flat annually. There are no plans to reduce the number of flats to be launched for 2022, which we will announce when ready.",3,873,2021-07-05-T-022-S-00873
2021-07-05-T-022,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Disruptions from the circuit breaker last year, coupled with strict safe management measures imposed on worksites and the tightening of border controls for workers from South Asia have affected private and public sector projects, including HDB’s BTO projects. Many will take longer to complete. HDB is working with its contractors and consultants to expedite construction work as much as possible, without compromising the project quality and safety standards.",4,874,2021-07-05-T-022-S-00874
2021-07-05-T-022,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Nevertheless, home buyers with urgent housing needs may consider buying a resale flat on the open market instead, where eligible first-timer buyers can receive up to $160,000 in housing grants. Resale flats are generally good for immediate occupation and buyers can choose from a wide range of flats, according to their preferences and budget.",5,875,2021-07-05-T-022-S-00875
2021-07-05-T-023,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong,"asked the Minister for National Development with regard to applicants who have to forgo their BTO flats due to further construction delays arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, whether the Ministry will consider providing (i) higher one-off housing grants for those who want to switch to resale flats in view of the rising prices and (ii) short-term rental financial assistance for those renting apartments especially for young couples starting their families.",1,876,2021-07-05-T-023-S-00876
2021-07-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The construction industry is one of the sectors hardest-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. The circuit breaker last year, coupled with the stringent safe management measures imposed at worksites and the tightening of border controls for workers from South Asia have led to delays for many private and public sector projects, including HDB’s BTO projects.",1,877,2021-07-05-T-023-S-00877
2021-07-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We recognise that the delays to the completion of BTO flats have caused inconvenience to flat buyers. HDB is working with its contractors and consultants to expedite construction work as much as possible, while ensuring that project quality and safety standards are not compromised.",2,878,2021-07-05-T-023-S-00878
2021-07-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Meanwhile, flat buyers are encouraged to find alternative housing arrangements with family members, relatives or on the open market. Where they are unable to do so, first-timer applicants who are waiting for their BTO flats can apply for temporary housing under the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS). Given the limited supply of PPHS flats, we are considering how to finetune allocation to give priority to families in greater need of temporary housing. We are also studying ways to increase the supply of temporary housing to better support affected flat buyers in need of housing. We will provide more details on these measures when ready.",3,879,2021-07-05-T-023-S-00879
2021-07-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For low-income households with no family support and no other housing option, HDB will consider offering Interim Rental Housing (IRH) on a case-by-case basis.",4,880,2021-07-05-T-023-S-00880
2021-07-05-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Today, flat buyers who cancel their flat booking will either have to forfeit their option fee, or 5% of the flat purchase price, and wait out a one-year period before they can apply for subsidised housing again, whether a new flat from HDB or a resale flat with grants.

It is unclear the degree to which these factors have contributed to the increase in workplace injuries. Nevertheless, regardless of COVID-19, all stakeholders, especially employers are very clear that the safety of the workers cannot be compromised.

For NSmen who are mostly below 40 years of age, the national programme has been significantly ramped up, and they would be able to complete their vaccinations within the next month or so. These high vaccination rates among all servicemen will facilitate the resumption of training within the SAF.",3,943,2021-07-05-T-032-S-00943

In recent years, MOM has made use of data analytics to identify and detect unusual patterns in hiring practices more quickly and accurately. This has helped MOM proactively detect cases of employment kickbacks, in addition to complaints and tip-offs that we received. MOM has also stepped up education and engagement efforts to educate migrant workers that their employers cannot demand or collect kickbacks from them.

MediShield Life provides basic health insurance coverage for life for all Singapore Residents, regardless of pre-existing health conditions. CareShield Life, which provides basic financial support in the event of severe disability, covers all Singapore Residents born in 1980 or later. When the scheme is launched for older cohorts, they can all join if they are not severely disabled.",1,959,2021-07-05-T-036-S-00959
2021-07-05-T-036,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Private insurers offer optional coverage on top of the national insurance schemes. Insurers apply the same underwriting approach to all customers, which does mean that they take into consideration their customers’ medical history, health condition and health risks arising from the condition. This is consistent with international practice. Insurers may accept or decline an application or adjust the premiums or coverage to appropriately reflect the customer’s health risk relative to those of others in the insurance pool. This ensures the insurance pool is sustainable, with sufficient funds to pay the anticipated claims.",2,960,2021-07-05-T-036-S-00960
2021-07-05-T-036,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),Private insurers have to base such assessments on the evidence. International research has shown that autistic persons often experience co-occurring conditions and that hospitalisation rates among them are typically higher.,3,961,2021-07-05-T-036-S-00961
2021-07-05-T-036,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"MAS, together with the MSF, is engaging insurers and other stakeholders on ways to improve autistic persons’ access to insurance coverage. We understand the motivation behind the suggestion to require insurers to apply standardised risk assessment criteria. But this could have unintended consequences. For example, restricting the ability of insurers to adjust coverage and premiums for higher-risk individuals could lead to higher premiums for policyholders who are of lower-risk.",4,962,2021-07-05-T-036-S-00962

Green bonds are a type of borrowing where proceeds will be exclusively applied to finance projects that are deemed environmentally sustainable. We announced at Budget this year that the Government has identified about $19 billion worth of projects that can be financed by green bonds, as a start. Eligible large-scale projects can be financed through sovereign green bonds under the Significant Infrastructure Government Loan Act (SINGA), while smaller scale green projects, such as Tuas Nexus, will be financed through the issuance of green bonds by the respective Statutory Boards.",1,1058,2021-07-05-T-051-S-01058

2021-07-05-T-055,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Member has asked about plans to regulate ""Alternative Legal Services Providers"" (ALSPs), which is a term generally used to refer to a wide range of non-traditional legal services providers, from small legal technology startups to large professional services firms that offer legal services as part of a broader suite of services.",1,1074,2021-07-05-T-055-S-01074
2021-07-05-T-055,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Under our current regulatory regime, entities wishing to offer legal services involving the practice of Singapore law or foreign law in Singapore must be licensed as a law practice and comply with the licensing and regulatory requirements under the Legal Profession Act. This means that the entity must be wholly or majority-owned and controlled by lawyers. Therefore, an ALSP that wishes to offer legal services as part of a broader suite of services would need to adhere to this ownership and control structure.",2,1075,2021-07-05-T-055-S-01075
2021-07-05-T-055,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"ALSPs may also offer legal support services, such as manpower outsourcing, paralegal or other support functions, which are not subject to regulation under the Legal Profession Act, but are subject to the other usual requirements applicable to businesses operating in Singapore.",3,1076,2021-07-05-T-055-S-01076
2021-07-05-T-055,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"With increasing innovation and technological advancements, the services provided by ALSPs have been evolving in response to changing market needs.

2021-07-05-T-056,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether there is a trend of increasing Cash-Over-Valuation (COV) for resale HDB flats; (b) if so, what are the reasons for the increasing trend; and (c) what has been the rate of increase in the past one year.",1,1079,2021-07-05-T-056-S-01079
2021-07-05-T-056,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"HDB resale flat transactions are conducted on a ""willing-buyer-willing-seller"" basis, with prices negotiated and mutually agreed upon between flat sellers and buyers. The transacted prices of resale flats for the last 12 months are published on the HDB InfoWEB to guide potential sellers and buyers.",1,1080,2021-07-05-T-056-S-01080
2021-07-05-T-056,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"After a resale price has been agreed upon, the flat sellers will grant an Option to Purchase (OTP) to the buyers. If the buyers wish to use their CPF savings or a housing loan to pay for the flat purchase, they will need to make a ""Request for Value"" to HDB. Cash-Over-Valuation (COV) arises when the resale price is higher than the market valuation of the flat, as the difference can only be paid by cash . Otherwise, there is no COV. Buyers can decide whether to exercise the OTP for the resale transaction depending on the valuation and any COV payable. Should they choose not to proceed with the transaction, buyers will forgo the option fee of between $1 and $1,000 paid to the seller.",2,1081,2021-07-05-T-056-S-01081
2021-07-05-T-056,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The proportion of buyers who paid a COV increased from around one in five in 2020 to around one in three in 2021. This reflects the current broad-based demand for housing, including in the private housing market, supported by the low interest rate environment. Notwithstanding this, the majority of buyers did not have to pay any COV, and the median COV each year has remained at $0.",3,1082,2021-07-05-T-056-S-01082
2021-07-05-T-056,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The current proportion of buyers who paid a COV is significantly lower compared to the period between 2010 and 2013, which was the previous period when more transactions with COV were observed. At that time, almost all resale flat buyers paid a COV. The prevailing practice then was for sellers to obtain a valuation, and negotiate a COV with the buyers which will determine the resale price. Since 2014, HDB has therefore required buyers and sellers to first agree on the resale price, with the valuation performed after that for the purpose of determining the amount of loan and CPF savings that can be used for the flat purchase.",4,1083,2021-07-05-T-056-S-01083
2021-07-05-T-056,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,We will continue to monitor economic and housing market conditions closely and ensure that Singaporeans have access to affordable public housing.,5,1084,2021-07-05-T-056-S-01084
2021-07-05-T-057,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for National Development over the past 10 years, what is the number of developments that have been stopped as a result of findings from (i) environmental impact assessments and (ii) built heritage evaluations by URA.",1,1085,2021-07-05-T-057-S-01085
2021-07-05-T-057,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Despite being a land-scarce city-state, about 3,300 hectares of our land are designated as Nature Reserves, while more than 7,000 buildings have been conserved. Where possible, we seek to retain our natural capital and built heritage in a manner that allows them to continue playing a role in meeting Singaporeans’ needs. For example, the transformation of the concrete canal at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio park to a naturalised river, where wildlife such as otters, heron and egrets can now be found, is an example of how deliberate planning can enable ecological enhancement and restoration. Similarly, the Fullerton Hotel and Capitol Singapore exemplify how conservation can bring about a new lease of life for historic buildings.",1,1086,2021-07-05-T-057-S-01086
2021-07-05-T-057,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"All development proposals are subject to a robust planning evaluation process that considers each development’s impact, for example on traffic, public health, environment, and heritage, amongst others. If the proposed development is in or near areas of significant ecological or heritage value, studies will be conducted to analyse the relative significance of the site, and possible measures or alternative methods to adopt, to mitigate any potential impact as much as possible. This allows us to weigh the trade-offs and to adjust plans as required, to sensitively integrate any new development with its surroundings. For example, after conducting an EIA and engaging nature groups, HDB redesigned the parcellation plan of its Bukit Batok Hillside Park project to preserve the catchment area surrounding a stream.",2,1087,2021-07-05-T-057-S-01087
2021-07-05-T-057,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We regularly review our plans to identify new sites of ecological and heritage significance to be safeguarded, taking into consideration our competing land-use demands. For example, Mandai Mangrove and Mudflat, which was initially planned for factory use, is now a Nature Park, in recognition of its ecological value. For Dakota Crescent, after consulting heritage groups and carefully considering the trade-offs, we kept what was most significant about the site – a cluster of six blocks around a central courtyard and playground – while allowing the rest to be redeveloped to meet housing needs.",3,1088,2021-07-05-T-057-S-01088
2021-07-05-T-057,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As needs and aspirations change over time, we will continually review our plans, consult, and gather views from different segments of society, to find the appropriate balance between conservation and development, while maintaining flexibility and agility in our land-use policies and processes.

2021-07-05-T-058,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We will continue to cater to changing lifestyles and needs both by exploring new designs and layouts of HDB flats, and by providing more shared amenities. For instance, HDB has introduced more greenery, play and fitness equipment to enhance the common space in our precincts and neighbourhoods. These extended common spaces encourage healthy lifestyles and community bonding. We have over 7,800 hectares of green spaces across Singapore and will add another 1,000 hectares over the next 10 to 15 years, weaved more intensively into our urban areas.",2,1092,2021-07-05-T-058-S-01092
2021-07-05-T-058,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The Government has also made community workspaces available within residential neighbourhoods. These include Community Living Rooms within HDB void decks, and work and study spaces within other public buildings such as community clubs and libraries. We will continue to monitor demand for these spaces, and scale them up if needed.",3,1093,2021-07-05-T-058-S-01093
2021-07-05-T-058,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The Member has also suggested that we convert some of our existing industrial and commercial land into parkland and recreational spaces. We seek to maximise the benefits and synergies that these spaces can offer to businesses and people. For example, many of JTC’s industrial estates, such as one-north and Jurong Innovation District, have food and beverage outlets, parks and recreational uses integrated in the estate, which also serve users in the community.",4,1094,2021-07-05-T-058-S-01094
2021-07-05-T-058,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"When certain industrial uses are phased out, we have comprehensively redeveloped the land for other uses, or put the buildings to adaptive re-use. Examples include the conversion of old shipyards at Tanjong Rhu into a residential area, the repurposing of two disused power station buildings in the Pasir Panjang Power District, as well as the planned rejuvenation of older estates in Sungei Kadut for new growth sectors, such as agri-food and environmental technologies.",5,1095,2021-07-05-T-058-S-01095

The sector also generates significant spinoffs to sectors such as trading and logistics.",1,1102,2021-07-05-T-060-S-01102
2021-07-05-T-060,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The global shift towards clean energy will impact the E&C sector seriously. It is clear that for the E&C sector to remain competitive and keep growing, companies will need to transform their operations to be among the best-in-class in energy and carbon efficiency globally and pivot towards producing lower carbon products such as sustainable aviation fuels and bio-based polymers. We also expect the sector to remain relevant as it produces critical inputs needed for the manufacturing of widely-used items such as cosmetics, vehicles and even surgical masks and gowns.",2,1103,2021-07-05-T-060-S-01103
2021-07-05-T-060,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Government will support the E&C sector on this transformation journey. Where warranted, this support may include the provision of land and infrastructure, largely on Jurong Island.

In the past six months, 240 camera deployments were made monthly and an average of 220 high-rise littering incidents per month were captured on our surveillance cameras. Investigations are ongoing and enforcement action will be taken against offenders where there is sufficient evidence.

2021-07-05-T-073,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"MOH conducts contact tracing for all COVID-19 cases. The process primarily involves detailed interviews with cases and their contacts to form a comprehensive activity map about the individual’s movements and which persons they had been in contact with, until their isolation.",1,1176,2021-07-05-T-073-S-01176
2021-07-05-T-073,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"TraceTogether, together with SafeEntry, makes the process much faster and more accurate. TraceTogether is especially useful for identifying unknown contacts in public places that we would not otherwise be able to identify, or contacts that interviewees were unable to recall. So for someone who has opted out of TraceTogether, the process is slower, and thus the risk of onward transmission is higher because we will take a longer time to quarantine close contacts. But we will continue to try our best.",2,1177,2021-07-05-T-073-S-01177
2021-07-05-T-073,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The TraceTogether Programme requires active participation from as many people as possible for effective contact tracing. To achieve greater coverage and participation, from 17 May 2021, persons who wish to enter a venue where SafeEntry is mandatory can only perform SafeEntry check-ins using their TraceTogether app or Token. These are venues that experience a higher throughput of visitors, such as malls, and where people are likely to be in close proximity for prolonged periods, such as restaurants and gyms. This will strengthen digital contact tracing and help us to better limit the spread of community cases.",3,1178,2021-07-05-T-073-S-01178
2021-07-05-T-074,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Transport with regard to the safety of workers being transported on lorries (a) whether the Ministry has studied the proposal to install speed limiters on such lorries; and (b) whether there are any plans to implement such speed limiters on lorries used to transport workers.,1,1179,2021-07-05-T-074-S-01179
2021-07-05-T-074,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Today, the Traffic Police already requires all heavy vehicles, including lorries with a maximum laden weight greater than 12,000 kilogrammes, to be installed with speed limiters. All such heavy vehicles are imposed with a maximum speed limit of 60 kilometres per hour as there is a greater risk of serious injuries or fatalities when such vehicles are involved in accidents. The speed limit applies to all heavy vehicles, regardless of whether they are used to ferry workers.",1,1180,2021-07-05-T-074-S-01180
2021-07-05-T-074,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Agencies are studying further measures such as requiring speed limiters for lorries with lower maximum laden weight, or other technologies that can help to deter speeding, improve driver behaviour and reduce accidents. Employers should continue to do their part to ensure the safety of their workers, and educate and remind drivers of their obligations and responsibilities to ensure safety.",2,1181,2021-07-05-T-074-S-01181
2021-07-05-T-075,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck,"asked the Prime Minister whether there is any revision to two projections contained in the Population White Paper published in January 2013, namely (i) at current birth rates and without immigration, our citizen population will shrink from 2025 onwards and (ii) the number of citizens in the working ages of 20 to 64 years will decline from 2020 due to more citizens retiring and fewer citizens entering the workforce.",1,1182,2021-07-05-T-075-S-01182

2021-07-05-T-075,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister),"(a) based on the total fertility rate (TFR) of 1.22 and without immigration, our total citizen population will shrink in the long term.",2,1184,2021-07-05-T-075-S-01184
2021-07-05-T-075,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister),"(b) even with immigration, the number of citizens aged 20 to 64 would likely peak around 2020 and decline thereafter. Without immigration, this group would have started to shrink earlier and decline at a much faster rate.",3,1185,2021-07-05-T-075-S-01185
2021-07-05-T-075,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister),"The changes to Singapore’s population set out in these scenarios remain valid. While we continue to take in a calibrated number of citizens and permanent residents to moderate the impact of ageing and low birth rates, we maintain a strong and cohesive core. In 2020, around 77% of Singapore residents (comprising Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents) were born in Singapore, while around 87% of citizens were born in Singapore3.",4,1186,2021-07-05-T-075-S-01186

However, it is not the decisive factor. A robust regulatory regime, high quality infrastructure and a skilled workforce, have been far more important.",2,1190,2021-07-05-T-076-S-01190
2021-07-05-T-076,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"When there is full international agreement on a global minimum tax rate, the expectation is that a financial institution that is subjected to the global tax rules will be taxed at the same minimum rate regardless of where its activities are located. This means that the non-tax factors that I have mentioned will play an even more significant role in ensuring our financial centre stays competitive. Let me illustrate with some examples.",3,1191,2021-07-05-T-076-S-01191
2021-07-05-T-076,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"First, providing a conducive regulatory environment for businesses to grow remains key, especially so for new and innovative activities. A good example is the Payment Services Act, which provides for payment service providers to innovate and grow in Singapore while being regulated in a risk-proportionate manner. We have seen strong interest of more than 400 licence applications since the start of the Act last year. Another example is the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) FinTech regulatory sandbox which enables financial institutions and FinTech players to experiment with innovative financial products or services in a live environment but within a well-defined space and duration.",4,1192,2021-07-05-T-076-S-01192
2021-07-05-T-076,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Second, a good infrastructure and ecosystem that enables new activities to scale. For example, in green finance, MAS is actively involved in developing an ASEAN taxonomy which will provide a common language on activities that are considered green and transition. This will catalyse more cross-border financing and investment flows to support the region's transition to a lower carbon future. In fintech, MAS has launched an API exchange platform, in partnership with the ASEAN Bankers Association and the International Financial Corporation, that has over the last three years helped more than 500 global FinTechs to connect with over 80 regional and global financial institutions through an online marketplace to co-create innovation solutions.",5,1193,2021-07-05-T-076-S-01193
2021-07-05-T-076,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Third, working closely with the industry to build up skills and capabilities has been among the more unique strengths of our financial sector. It also ensures that Singaporeans are able to benefit from the new jobs created. For example, MAS helps financial institutions build their pipeline of talent through programmes such as the Technology in Finance Immersion Programme.",6,1194,2021-07-05-T-076-S-01194
2021-07-05-T-076,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Ultimately, the continued growth of Singapore's financial centre depends on how well we connect global markets, support Asia's development, and serve Singapore's economy.

2021-07-05-T-079,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Globally, fentanyl abuse has contributed to an increasing number of opioid overdose deaths, particularly in North America.

This approach affords greater protection for minorities, by making it safe for them to speak about their experiences, and their views. Otherwise, in a situation where racially offensive speech by all is tolerated or allowed, and both majority and minority communities engage in such speech, it can be expected that more of such speech will be directed towards minority communities. And it will be the minority communities who will then bear the brunt of such offensive speech. That will ironically reduce the safe space for discussion of such issues, and increase minority community concerns for safety and security. These are not hypotheticals. This is what has happened in several other countries. We need to be careful about changing what has worked reasonably well in Singapore (though it is not perfect), and replacing it with policies which have not worked so well, in other places.",8,1267,2021-07-05-T-087-S-01267

In fact, the General Recommendation emphasises that legislation against racial discrimination is ""indispensable"" to combating hate speech effectively and that States Parties to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination must effectively sanction racist hate speech as offences.

The Reserve Price serves as an internal guide to assess if tender bids are reflective of the fair market value of the land being put up for sale.

2021-07-05-T-095,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in view of the global shortage of semiconductor chips (a) how can Singapore leverage on its current semiconductor ecosystem to seize growth opportunities, (b) how will the larger economy benefit from larger semiconductor investment; and (c) how can our workforce prepare for this growth.",1,1297,2021-07-05-T-095-S-01297
2021-07-05-T-095,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Singapore has a globally competitive semiconductor industry. Ten of the 15 largest semiconductor companies, such as GlobalFoundries, Micron and Infineon, have research and development and/or manufacturing operations in Singapore. These companies have invested here because of our skilled talent, excellent global connectivity, ease of doing business and well developed semiconductor research and manufacturing ecosystem.",1,1298,2021-07-05-T-095-S-01298
2021-07-05-T-095,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The long-term prospects of the industry are bright. Demand for Integrated Circuits (IC) is expected to remain strong as growth drivers such as the adoption of electric vehicles, 5G technology, cloud and Internet-of-Things (IOT) gain momentum. Singapore is well positioned to seize these opportunities. Our semiconductor manufacturing facilities are working at full steam to meet the strong demand and keep supply chains intact. Some are also considering expansion plans. For example, GlobalFoundries recently announced that it would be investing more than S$5 billion to build a new wafer fabrication facility here.",2,1299,2021-07-05-T-095-S-01299
2021-07-05-T-095,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Such investments create good jobs for our people, allow us to build up the capabilities of our companies, generate strong spinoffs to other sectors such as precision engineering and sustain the virtuous cycle that keeps our semiconductor sector vibrant. The semiconductor manufacturing industry employs over 33,000 people and accounted for almost 7% of our GDP last year. Over 1,600 companies, including many SMEs, are suppliers to semiconductor firms here. It is also one of the largest contributors to Business Expenditure on R&D (BERD) and our wider research ecosystem.",3,1300,2021-07-05-T-095-S-01300
2021-07-05-T-095,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"To maintain the competitiveness of our semiconductor sector, we will continue to forge strong partnerships between companies, research institutes and our universities; strengthen our capabilities in targeted specialty segments; and strive to be the location of choice for companies to establish best-in-class operations. We are investing resources into semiconductor research under RIE2025. EDB is also working closely with our Institutes of Higher Learning and the Singapore Semiconductor Industry Association to ensure we have up-to-date training programmes and that we continue to train jobseekers – including mid-careerists who may not have prior experience in the sector – to fill the new, high-quality jobs in the industry.",4,1301,2021-07-05-T-095-S-01301
2021-07-05-T-096,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in view of the lower rates of COVID-19 vaccination in most ASEAN countries (a) how will the Singapore economy be affected; and (b) how will this affect Singapore’s near to mid-term economic strategies with the ASEAN economies.,1,1302,2021-07-05-T-096-S-01302
2021-07-05-T-096,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"If the COVID-19 vaccination rates of many Southeast Asian countries remain low, they may affect Singapore in two ways.",1,1303,2021-07-05-T-096-S-01303
2021-07-05-T-096,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"First, it leaves our neighbouring countries susceptible to recurring waves of COVID-19 infections, which may require governments to implement social and mobility restrictions in order to control the public health situation. Such measures usually impede their domestic economic activity.",2,1304,2021-07-05-T-096-S-01304
2021-07-05-T-096,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Second, low vaccination rates will likely slow down the pace of border reopening and the resumption of travel, not just for business but also tourism, another important driver of economic growth for the region. Both of these will affect Singapore's economic recovery, given our economic integration with our neighbours and the importance of regional travel to our hub status.",3,1305,2021-07-05-T-096-S-01305
2021-07-05-T-096,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Nevertheless, the IMF has projected that the overall GDP growth rate of Southeast Asia in 2021 would be 4.9%, with the projected growth rates of individual countries ranging between 2.6% and 6.9%. While the projected 2021 GDP growth rates of some of our Southeast Asian neighbours had earlier been revised downwards due to their domestic COVID-19 situations, the impact on the Singapore economy is expected to be moderate. In particular, merchandise trade between Singapore and our neighbours is expected to remain healthy in tandem with the global and regional economic recoveries. Even amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, total merchandise trade between Singapore and Southeast Asian countries in 2020 was $239.6 billion, which was a slight decrease of 7.7% year-on-year. In the first quarter of 2021, total merchandise trade between Singapore and Southeast Asian countries was $69.3 billion, which was an increase of 6.3% compared to the same period last year.",4,1306,2021-07-05-T-096-S-01306
2021-07-05-T-096,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In the long term, vaccination rates will improve and COVID-19 is likely to become endemic. The region’s underlying economic fundamentals remain strong and compelling, notwithstanding the impact of the pandemic. The economic prospects of Southeast Asia remain positive. The IMF has forecast that the region’s overall GDP would grow by more than 5% year-on-year from 2022 to 20251. This is buoyed by Southeast Asia’s young and dynamic population, and growing middle class, which makes the region one of the fastest growing consumer markets in the world. Consumers are also increasingly moving online, with almost 70% of the region’s population transacting online,2 making Southeast Asia an attractive market for the digital economy. Singapore will continue to pursue closer economic integration with Southeast Asia.",5,1307,2021-07-05-T-096-S-01307
2021-07-05-T-097,Rachel Ong,Miss Rachel Ong,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the plans in place to reskill and upskill staff of small and medium sized automotive repair shops to handle and repair electric vehicles in the coming years; (b) whether the Government will provide support for the infrastructure upgrades in these shops that are needed for the repair and maintenance of electric vehicles; and (c) if so, what kind of support it will entail.",1,1308,2021-07-05-T-097-S-01308
2021-07-05-T-097,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,Our vision for all vehicles to run on cleaner energy by 2040 would require our workers in the automotive industry to pick up new skills that can be applied to hybrid or electric vehicle platforms.,1,1309,2021-07-05-T-097-S-01309
2021-07-05-T-097,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The Government will support the transition. Enterprise Singapore (ESG), Workforce Singapore and JTC Corporation supported the setting up of the Singapore Motor Workshop Association (SMWA) Training Academy in December 2020 to equip our maintenance workers with new skills to maintain electric vehicle (EV) components and charging systems.

In addition, distributors will also work with automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to train workers in aftermarket services.",2,1310,2021-07-05-T-097-S-01310
2021-07-05-T-097,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Automotive workshops can tap on existing schemes, such as the Enterprise Development Grant administered by ESG, to build new capabilities such as maintaining EV components and charging systems. Companies can also access ESG’s Enterprise Financing Scheme (Fixed Assets) to help fund the purchase of new workshop infrastructure.",3,1311,2021-07-05-T-097-S-01311
2021-07-05-T-098,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling,asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry can provide some level of income assurance should taxi or private hire vehicle drivers get infected with COVID-19 during their course of ferrying frontline workers so as to cover their loss of income during their recovery and quarantine period.,1,1312,2021-07-05-T-098-S-01312
2021-07-05-T-098,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,Taxi and private hire car (PHC) drivers are frontline workers who play an important role in ferrying essential workers and Singaporeans every day. Our first priority is to protect them in the course of duty. This is why taxi and PHC drivers who depend on driving for their livelihoods were prioritised to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.,1,1313,2021-07-05-T-098-S-01313
2021-07-05-T-098,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In addition, drivers do receive support if they are quarantined or contract COVID-19 in the course of duty. Drivers who have been served Quarantine Orders can apply for a $100 per day allowance under the Quarantine Order Allowance Scheme, which is administered by the Ministry of Health. The National Taxi Association (NTA), National Private Hire Vehicles Association (NPHVA), and the operators have also been providing additional rental waivers and allowances to their drivers who were tested positive for COVID-19. Drivers who contracted COVID-19 while serving in situations of heightened COVID-19 risk are also eligible for a one-time relief of $3,000 through The Courage Fund, which is administered by the National Council of Social Service.",2,1314,2021-07-05-T-098-S-01314
2021-07-05-T-098,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In recognition of the reduced ridership levels, the Government has been providing active taxi and PHC drivers with COVID-19 Driver Relief Fund (CDRF) payouts to sustain their livelihoods as they continue to serve commuters. This includes the recent extension of the CDRF to September 2021.",3,1315,2021-07-05-T-098-S-01315
2021-07-05-T-098,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Taxi and PHC operators have also reminded their drivers to take additional precautions to protect their health and safety. These include stepping up the cleaning and disinfection of their vehicles, not using the recirculation mode of their vehicle’s air-conditioning system and to wind down their windows after every trip to improve ventilation within their vehicles.",4,1316,2021-07-05-T-098-S-01316
2021-07-05-T-099,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the steps taken to segregate persons arriving in flights from countries with a higher risk of COVID-19 transmission; and (b) what other mitigating measures are undertaken at the airport or various points of entry to Singapore, to reduce the risk of transmission to others.",1,1317,2021-07-05-T-099-S-01317

2021-07-05-T-122,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"To support incarcerated Muslim individuals, FITRAH develops a customised religious curriculum with its religious counsellors, in consultation with psychologists from the Singapore Prison Service (SPS). The curriculum inculcates positive values and prepares the ex-offenders for life after incarceration. The curriculum is delivered by a pool of religious counsellors through counselling sessions and Friday prayer sermons. About 65% of Muslim inmates attend FITRAH’s in-care religious services on a voluntary basis.",2,1418,2021-07-05-T-122-S-01418
2021-07-05-T-122,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"FITRAH has also worked with other community partners to help families of inmates and ex-offenders access different forms of assistance. Since its establishment in 2019, FITRAH facilitated 611 such referrals for employment support, financial and social assistance, befriending services, as well as Islamic learning. This includes the referrals from the joint home visits done by FITRAH community befrienders and the Yellow Ribbon Community Project (YRCP) volunteers, where they assess the various needs of the families. The beneficiaries have been referred to the Social Service Offices, Family Service Centres, as well as the M³ agencies for further assistance.",3,1419,2021-07-05-T-122-S-01419

FITRAH will continue to work with Singapore Prisons Service and the M³@Towns to raise awareness about the community befriending programme to benefit more eligible families.",4,1420,2021-07-05-T-122-S-01420
2021-07-05-T-123,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs whether he can explain the different approach and action taken in respect of the Madrasah Irsyad employee who allegedly leaked confidential documents of the Madrasah and who has since resigned and that in respect of the senior MUIS employee who was allegedly involved in the Halal certification issue but was nonetheless retained as part of MUIS’ workforce while investigations by CPIB and CAD are ongoing.,1,1421,2021-07-05-T-123-S-01421
2021-07-05-T-123,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MUIS takes a serious view towards all allegations of wrongdoing. In such cases, MUIS will conduct investigations to determine whether there has been any wrongdoing. Where appropriate, the case will be referred to the Police or other relevant authorities.",1,1422,2021-07-05-T-123-S-01422
2021-07-05-T-123,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The circumstances of both cases are different. During the internal investigations by Madrasah Irsyad and MUIS, the staff from Madrasah Irsyad had admitted to contravening the Madrasah’s internal policy and resigned. As police investigations are ongoing, it would not be appropriate to comment on the case involving the staff from Madrasah Irsyad. As for the case regarding the Foreign Halal Certification Bodies (FHCB), an independent panel found that there was insufficient evidence to support the allegations against the MUIS officer involved. CPIB have also looked into the matter and informed that they will not take any further action in view of insufficient evidence.",2,1423,2021-07-05-T-123-S-01423
2021-07-05-T-124,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,asked the Minister for Health with regard to the deployment of an artificial intelligence system called SELENA+ in the screening of patients through eye scans (a) what has been the efficacy of the SELENA+ system in screening diabetic patients; and (b) whether the Ministry will be embarking on further initiatives for an economical and accessible diabetic screening system for the public.,1,1424,2021-07-05-T-124-S-01424
2021-07-05-T-124,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"SELENA+ is a National AI pilot project that is being implemented in a few phases. During the first phase, a total of 38,215 patient cases at six polyclinincs had their retinal photographs processed by SELENA+ and the results were compared to the current image grading performed by non-physician technician readers. Based on preliminary analysis, we found that the accuracy of SELENA+ in detecting vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma suspects and late stage age-related macular degeneration is comparable to current standard of care.",1,1425,2021-07-05-T-124-S-01425
2021-07-05-T-124,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We have commenced the second phase of SELENA+ since December 2020, with the trial extended to an additional six polyclinics. In this phase, we will study if non-physical technician readers can better detect diabetic eye complications with the AI support. SELENA+ will also be evaluated for its potential to improve efficiency and consistency by automating the current grading process and transfer of digital retina images, for mild to moderate diabetic cases.",2,1426,2021-07-05-T-124-S-01426
2021-07-05-T-124,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As diabetes may result in eye complications such as diabetic retinopathy, Singaporeans are encouraged to go for regular health checkups and follow ups. Adults above aged 40 are encouraged to go for regular screening for chronic illnesses, including diabetes. With subsidies under Screen for Life at all CHAS GPs, Singaporeans pay between $0 and $5 for each screening visit. All diabetic patients are also recommended to be screened for eye complications annually. This is why we have made eye screening a subsidised core service to be provided for diabetic patients across all polyclinics as well as at GP clinics participating in the Primary Care Networks scheme.",3,1427,2021-07-05-T-124-S-01427

2021-07-05-T-129,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The objective of MediSave is primarily to help Singaporeans with large medical bills due to hospitalisation and surgeries, after subsidies and MediShield Life.

This is in view of the recurrent nature of their treatment.",1,1450,2021-07-05-T-129-S-01450
2021-07-05-T-129,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In line with the above, A&E fees are claimable from MediSave if the patient is subsequently admitted.

2021-07-05-T-139,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there are plans to create a more robust food health rating system on a graduated scale instead of the binary Healthier Choice Symbol (HCS); (b) how is the effectiveness of the HCS at influencing food purchases being determined and what is the result so far; and (c) whether the Government has a review system in place to improve effectiveness of HCS labelling and on monitoring social marketing campaigns led by food companies on consumers’ purchasing patterns.,1,1487,2021-07-05-T-139-S-01487
2021-07-05-T-139,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The Healthier Choice Symbol (HCS) is a front-of-pack label with a simple, visual identifier to help consumers identify healthier food products and ingredients easily. Products with the HCS are lower in fat, saturated fat, sodium, sugar or higher in dietary fibre, calcium and wholegrains compared to regular products within the same food categories. Compared to a graduated scale, such labels enable consumers to process basic nutritional information more quickly. Hence, there are currently no plans to develop a food health rating system on a graduated scale.",1,1488,2021-07-05-T-139-S-01488
2021-07-05-T-139,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The HCS is widely recognised and used by Singaporeans to guide their food purchases. It has also spurred food manufacturers and suppliers to reformulate and launch healthier products, leading to an increase in market share of HCS products from 18% in 2016 to 28% in 2020. A recent study conducted by Duke-NUS found that HCS positively influences consumer demand for healthier foods.",2,1489,2021-07-05-T-139-S-01489
2021-07-05-T-139,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The Ministry of Health and HPB regularly review the HCS nutrient guidelines to stay relevant to the latest consumption trends and new scientific evidences, and to address nutritional gaps in Singaporeans’ diets. This is done through extensive review of literature, local market conditions and consultation with food industry and academic experts. For example, in response to findings from the National Nutrition Survey (NNS) 2018 on Singaporeans’ increasing sugar intake from foods such as confectionary, desserts and sauces, the HCS criteria for sugar were lowered for selected sugary foods (for example, ice-cream and yoghurt) in 30 April 2020.",3,1490,2021-07-05-T-139-S-01490
2021-07-05-T-140,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the arrival of COVID-19 vaccine supplies can be brought forward; and (b) whether there are plans to accelerate the interim-use authorisation process under Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR) for other promising vaccine candidates such as the single-dose vaccine co-developed by Arcturus and Duke-NUS.,1,1491,2021-07-05-T-140-S-01491
2021-07-05-T-140,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As announced in MOH's press release on 24 June 2021, we recently brought forward supplies and accelerated our vaccination programme. We are working with suppliers of other promising vaccine candidates, such as Novavax, to submit applications under the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR). This will provide more options for individuals. It is important to note that all vaccines can have adverse effects. We encourage eligible individuals to receive the current mRNA vaccines, which have well-documented efficacy and effects, and have proven to be safe and effective.",1,1492,2021-07-05-T-140-S-01492
2021-07-05-T-141,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha,asked the Minister for Health (a) how is the maximum MediSave700 withdrawal amount of $700 per annum determined for the 20 conditions under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP); (b) whether the maximum withdrawal amount will be reviewed for chronic conditions that may cost a patient more than $700 yearly; and (c) whether the Ministry can consider allowing family members and spouses to withdraw more than $700 in total to pay for the patient’s complex chronic outpatient treatment.,1,1493,2021-07-05-T-141-S-01493
2021-07-05-T-141,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Under the MediSave500/700 scheme, the $500 and $700 MediSave withdrawal limits are sized to be sufficient for the annual bills of the majority of subsidised patients with simple and complex chronic conditions under the Chronic Disease Management Programme respectively. Seniors aged 60 years old and above can withdraw up to an additional $300 yearly under Flexi-MediSave to offset their bills in the outpatient setting, including for the treatment of their chronic conditions. The withdrawal limits were recently revised for MediSave500/700 on 1 January 2021, and Flexi-MediSave on 1 June 2021.",1,1494,2021-07-05-T-141-S-01494

2021-07-05-T-146,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To promote and encourage the rehoming of shelter animals, NParks has been working closely with Animal Welfare Groups (AWGs) to support their adoption drives and to organise pet-related events. For instance, NParks launched the Pets’ Day Out series in August 2019 as a regular platform where the public can learn about responsible pet ownership and pet care through talks, workshops, and other activities. At such events, potential pet owners can interact with the animals put up for adoption by the AWGs. This is a common practice by the AWGs as part of the adoption process, to increase the likelihood of a match between the adopter and the animal.",1,1507,2021-07-05-T-146-S-01507

In estates where multi-storey car parks are provided, HDB has also provided loading and unloading bays along the driveway or service roads for the use of those making deliveries or performing quick loading and unloading activities. We recognise that given the limited number of diners allowed for dining-in under the current Phase Three (Heightened Alert), there is likely an increase in demand for home deliveries. To help delivery riders and drivers cope with this increased demand, we have therefore temporarily extended the grace period for parking at HDB and URA car parks to 20 minutes.",2,1515,2021-07-05-T-148-S-01515

This was also in recognition that cleaners faced additional exposure in cleaning and disinfecting potentially contaminated premises. This remuneration would be on top of the mandated Progressive Wage Model (PWM) Bonus of two weeks’ salary. Firms have heeded the call to do so.
