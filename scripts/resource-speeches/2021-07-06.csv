2021-07-06-T-001,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"asked the Minister for Manpower since the signing of the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) in 2005 (a) what are the net economic benefits for Singapore in terms of trade, value-added growth and citizen job growth; and (b) what has been the growth in foreign PMET numbers in our workforce by sector and occupation.",1,1,2021-07-06-T-001-S-00001
2021-07-06-T-001,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"asked the Minister for Manpower in each of the past five years, what is the number of complaints of nationality-based discrimination received by the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP), broken down by sector and occupation.",1,2,2021-07-06-T-001-S-00002
2021-07-06-T-001,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar,asked the Minister for Manpower what has been the effectiveness of the different capability development schemes in building a local talent pipeline.,1,3,2021-07-06-T-001-S-00003
2021-07-06-T-001,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) including the Singapore-India Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) have achieved their intended outcomes of increasing trade, growth and jobs; and (b) whether the jobs created have benefited Singaporeans.",1,4,2021-07-06-T-001-S-00004
2021-07-06-T-001,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry how do commitments in the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement such as those pertaining to entry requirements and immigration privileges compare with those in other Free Trade Agreements.,1,5,2021-07-06-T-001-S-00005
2021-07-06-T-001,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry how have Singapore's Free Trade Agreements, including the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement, impacted Singapore’s global competitiveness, foreign trade, investment and growth, and employability of Singaporeans.",1,6,2021-07-06-T-001-S-00006
2021-07-06-T-001,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to address Oral Questions Nos 1 to 6, as well as Written Question Nos 40 to 42 in today's Order Paper through the Ministerial Statements to be delivered by Minister Ong Ye Kung and myself, later today?",1,7,2021-07-06-T-001-S-00007
2021-07-06-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please proceed. Next question, Ms He Ting Ru.",1,8,2021-07-06-T-001-S-00008
2021-07-06-T-002,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru,"asked the Prime Minister (a) since the introduction of the ""make-up pay"" mechanism for political appointment holders in 1989, whether this mechanism has been used to increase the salary for any political appointment holders to make up the difference between their last drawn salary and the salary of their political office; (b) if yes, who has it been applied to; (c) what has been the increase in the quantum of the make-up pay; and (d) what is the time period and duration it is effected for.",1,9,2021-07-06-T-002-S-00009
2021-07-06-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security (Mr Teo Chee Hean) (for the Prime Minister),"Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Prime Minister, when we consider potential candidates to take up political office, the first quality that we look for is a sense of public service, those who have their heart in the right place and want to contribute to the betterment of Singapore and Singaporeans. This should always be the basic prerequisite for any political candidate.",1,10,2021-07-06-T-002-S-00010
2021-07-06-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security (Mr Teo Chee Hean) (for the Prime Minister),"However, beyond a passion for public service, our team of political appointment holders need to have the right mix of background, skills, and organisational and leadership capabilities. In particular, we need some Ministers, Ministers of State and Parliamentary Secretaries with private sector experience.",2,11,2021-07-06-T-002-S-00011
2021-07-06-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security (Mr Teo Chee Hean) (for the Prime Minister),"From the private sector, we want to be able to bring in not only people who are already well advanced in their careers and financially secure, but also younger ones whose careers are just taking off and are approaching or in their peak earning years, and who may have made financial commitments. They may take a few years to establish themselves before they can be considered for more senior political appointments. The ""make-up pay"" mechanism makes it easier for such candidates to consider taking up political office and eases the financial disruption as they make the transition.",3,12,2021-07-06-T-002-S-00012
2021-07-06-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security (Mr Teo Chee Hean) (for the Prime Minister),"Notwithstanding the ""make-up pay"", such candidates know and accept that even if they eventually prove themselves in political office, they will not earn as much as if they had remained in their private sector careers.",4,13,2021-07-06-T-002-S-00013
2021-07-06-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,The Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security (Mr Teo Chee Hean) (for the Prime Minister),"Since 1989 when the scheme was first introduced, we have brought in several candidates into the Government without using the ""make-up pay"", with a number of them accepting a substantial income loss. The scheme has been used once so far, in that case, for a transition period of two years. No political appointment holder is currently on this scheme.",5,14,2021-07-06-T-002-S-00014
2021-07-06-T-002,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"I would like to ask the Minister how long was this make-up pay scheme applied for, given that it was used once before. And also, how many candidates or potential candidates have declined to run on the Government's ticket because they said that the pay was not enough?",1,15,2021-07-06-T-002-S-00015
2021-07-06-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,I think I had already answered that question. We have had one person and that person was on the scheme for two years.,1,16,2021-07-06-T-002-S-00016
2021-07-06-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"When a person is being considered for candidacy and also potentially for political office, there are no guarantees, as each of us in this Chamber knows, and there are the political ups and downs. Pay is not usually one of the things that they will tell you upfront. But it surely is one of the considerations for a person who has got commitments, a young family and a promising career ahead of him which he is quite sure of. To come in, to take the vagaries of politics and to give that up is a big sacrifice. So, we want to reduce that and help him in the transition.",2,17,2021-07-06-T-002-S-00017
2021-07-06-T-002,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"But as I had said, we have individuals who are prepared to come in and give it up. And we have individuals who are prepared to come in and accept that they will take a lower salary in their appointment in political office, even though they have had a two-year transition period to help them over the commitments that they have.",3,18,2021-07-06-T-002-S-00018
2021-07-06-T-003,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,asked the Minister for Defence regarding the 16 People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) aircraft that flew through Singapore’s Flight Information Region (FIR) on 31 May 2021 (a) whether the RSAF tracked the flight of these aircraft; (b) whether the RSAF was successful in establishing communications with them; (c) how many of such unannounced entries into Singapore's FIR by PLAAF aircraft have taken place in the past year; and (d) what are the plans to ensure the safety of flights to and from Singapore should tensions among rival claimants of islands in the South China Sea escalate.,1,19,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00019
2021-07-06-T-003,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Defence (a) what is the Government's situational assessment regarding the flight of 16 People’s Liberation Army Air Force aircraft that passed through Singapore’s Flight Information Region on 31 May 2021 over waters which are disputed by China and Malaysia; and (b) whether plans are in place to ensure the security and safety of flights to and from Singapore should tensions among rival claimants escalate in the airspace over the South China Sea.,1,20,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00020
2021-07-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Mr Speaker, may I take the questions from Mr Gerald Giam and Mr Dennis Tan together, as they are related?",1,21,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00021
2021-07-06-T-003,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,22,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00022
2021-07-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Thank you. Mr Speaker, the two questions asked by Mr Gerald Giam and Mr Dennis Tan as listed in the Order Paper conflate a number of issues that may inadvertently give rise to misinterpretations and misunderstandings unless they are clearly distinguished.",1,23,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00023
2021-07-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"To avoid this, MINDEF’s reply will, therefore, separately address three distinct issues within their questions. It is important to emphasise even though they are somewhat related, these are three distinct issues. Let me list them  first, Singapore’s position on the rights of military aircraft to conduct passage and training under international law; second, the role and responsibilities of the authority managing a Flight Information Region (FIR); and finally, the Singapore Armed Forces’ (SAF) air defence system to protect Singapore against aerial threats.",2,24,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00024
2021-07-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"In my reply, it will also be clear that the general principles Singapore adhere to govern our practices and specific protocols in response to all countries. Let me deal with the three issues.",3,25,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00025
2021-07-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"First, Singapore respects the rights of military aircraft and ships to conduct passage and training over areas and waters in accordance with international law, and this includes the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). This is the basis upon which the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) aircraft conduct flights and training, whether it is in the South China Sea or other regions.",4,26,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00026
2021-07-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"This is also the basis for the conduct of exercises in the South China Sea, the ones that Singapore does bilaterally and in multilateral exercises. So, for example, Exercise Commando Sling which is between the SAF and the US Air Force, and the Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) Exercise between the SAF and the US Navy. Members may remember that we held a multilateral exercise in 2016 and this was involving navies of the ADMM-Plus countries, which sailed from Brunei to Singapore through the South China Sea, and exercised together en route.",5,27,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00027
2021-07-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"You may also remember that during this year's Committee of Supply, I had also informed Members of this House that the South China Sea will see an increase in military activity from other countries. Earlier this year, the French Navy deployed its ships to the South China Sea. Later this year, the UK will send the Queen Elizabeth Carrier Strike Group with its fighter aircraft F35Bs. The Germans too intend to deploy a frigate to the South China Sea, the first time in almost 20 years.",6,28,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00028
2021-07-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Apart from international law and UNCLOS, countries that conduct military activities in these areas have to act in accordance with ASEAN instruments that they have signed on to, such as the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. And I think it is instructive to quote from some of the phrases that these countries have agreed to in this treaty.",7,29,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00029
2021-07-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"This treaty calls for ""mutual respect for the independence, sovereignty, equality, territorial integrity and national identity of all nations"", as well as for signatories not to ""participate in any activity which shall constitute a threat to the political and economic stability, sovereignty or territorial integrity"" of one another.",8,30,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00030
2021-07-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,I have dealt with the first issue in terms of rights of military training; let me deal with the second issue.,9,31,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00031
2021-07-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"As distinct from military activity, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) appoints a civilian authority to manage the air space of each Flight Information Region (FIR). And this authority is designated as the Air Traffic Services (ATS) Authority. The role of the ATS Authority is to ensure safe and efficient flow of air traffic, mostly civilian, within its FIR. In this role, it does not act as a watchdog over disputed areas nor should that authority adopt a partisan role on behalf of any party or for itself.",10,32,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00032
2021-07-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Civilian aircraft must file flight plans when going through the FIR of an ATS Authority. However, state aircraft, which includes military aircraft, are not required to file flight plans under international law, and this includes the Convention on International Civil Aviation. State aircraft are also not obliged to contact the ATS Authority so long as they fly with due regard for the safety of other aircraft.",11,33,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00033
2021-07-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Nevertheless, some militaries, including the RSAF, do file flight plans and contact the ATS Authority of that FIR, even when they are not legally required to do so. The RSAF routinely adopts this practice, primarily to assist the ATS Authority in coordinating and de-conflicting RSAF flights from civilian aircraft as part of their responsibility for operating with due care.",12,34,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00034
2021-07-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"ICAO has appointed the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) as the ATS Authority for the Singapore FIR. In this capacity, CAAS has gained an international reputation for managing the Singapore FIR in a safe, orderly, impartial and expeditious manner. In the incident referred to in the Members’ questions, CAAS did not receive any flight plans from the PLAAF, nor did it communicate with the PLAAF or any of its aircraft. I have already mentioned that state aircraft are not required to do so. Nevertheless, had the PLAAF required air traffic services, it could have established communications with CAAS.",13,35,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00035
2021-07-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mr Giam’s question also confuses the role of CAAS as the ATS Authority for the Singapore FIR with the role of the SAF to defend Singapore’s own territorial airspace. We should be clear that the RSAF has no mandate nor any role in the management of the Singapore FIR, which is carried out by CAAS, a civilian authority appointed by ICAO.",14,36,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00036
2021-07-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The third issue, Singapore’s air defence. Singapore is a small country with a high population density and, therefore, more vulnerable to air threats. The SAF accordingly maintains air defence units at high alert. The RSAF conducts 24/7 surveillance of our skies through both ground-based radars and aerial reconnaissance to detect unknown or suspicious aircraft that are close enough to pose a potential threat. On average, each year, the RSAF responds to more than 350 such incidents. The specific incident referred to by the two Members in their questions was not deemed to be such a threat.",15,37,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00037
2021-07-06-T-003,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Gerald Giam.,1,38,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00038
2021-07-06-T-003,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Thank you, Sir. I thank the Minister for the reply. Since state aircraft are not required to file flight plans when entering our Flight Information Region (FIR), how does Singapore ensure that these aircraft do not have hostile intent? I understand that there is no requirement for them to file these flight plans, but do other countries, by convention, file their flight plans for their state aircraft and is this incident the only time that no flight plans were filed when entering the FIR?",1,39,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00039
2021-07-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Again, Mr Speaker, I think it is useful not to conscribe the question and direct it to any one country. It does not serve our foreign policy; it does not reflect our desire to be principled and neutral. So, again, the answer is with regard to any country and I think we must ask relevant questions. How do you determine whether a particular aircraft of any country is friend or foe? And that is the job of the RSAF. If you have mistaken a friend for a foe, there can be catastrophic consequences. And there are a number of aspects that we would detect, whether it is movement, whether, indeed, flight plans have been filed.",1,40,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00040
2021-07-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"I have mentioned 350 such incidents and let me again emphasise, these 350 incidents have got nothing to do with the questions that the two Members have asked because they have framed their questions in a way that can actually give rise to misunderstanding and misinterpretations. These 350 incidents that we have had, many of which RSAF had actually to mobilise. And as Members will remember, there are a number of incidents in previous years. One was a private aircraft that got lost. And, of course, I suppose seeing an F-16 next to you is, for some, comforting, and it was gently guided to land in a safe area. There have been other instances which RSAF must use its judgement and there are strict protocols. These relate to what we call aerial threats.",2,41,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00041
2021-07-06-T-003,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mr Giam asked whether other militaries – I presume he was asking that – file flight plans. The answer is it is not uniform and, in fact, it is not the majority. Many countries do not file flight plans or contact the ATS Authority.",3,42,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00042
2021-07-06-T-003,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Leon Perera.,1,43,2021-07-06-T-003-S-00043
2021-07-06-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there were pandemic plans at Changi Airport before May 2021; (b) whether these required passenger and staff segregations based on risk assessments of countries; (c) what were the considerations for the mingling of (i) arriving passengers from high-risk and low-risk regions before 15 May (ii) arriving and departing passengers before 13 June and (iii) staff exposed to different risks; (d) how does the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) classify countries as ""very high risk"" and ""high risk"" with arrivals from the former being separately escorted; and (e) whether an inquiry has been made for such decisions.",1,44,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00044
2021-07-06-T-004,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Transport in respect of flights from high-risk COVID-19 countries (a) whether the Government will consider setting up a separate stand-alone facility away from the airport terminal buildings for immigration and customs clearance of arriving passengers; and (b) whether transit passengers from such flights can be sent from such facility to their departing aircraft at a remote bay thus avoiding any sharing of the use of the terminal buildings with other passengers arriving from or departing for other countries.,1,45,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00045
2021-07-06-T-004,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,,2,46,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00046
2021-07-06-T-004,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the additional duties or responsibilities that airport workers have had to assume since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic that allow them to keep Singapore and Singaporeans safe for more than 16 months before the Delta variant came about and since the more transmissive Delta variant arose; and (b) how are the Government and aviation companies supporting frontline airport staff especially when these staff have had to adjust to enhanced measures at Changi Airport.,1,47,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00047
2021-07-06-T-004,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling,,2,48,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00048
2021-07-06-T-004,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) in light of the zonal segregation measures at Changi Airport, how will countries be classified based on their evolving COVID-19 situation; (b) whether the Ministry will consider dedicating one terminal away from the main arrival terminals for use by arrivals from very high-risk countries; and (c) how can the frontline aviation workers safeguard themselves and Singapore given the risk they face daily in keeping the airport open.",1,49,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00049
2021-07-06-T-004,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,,2,50,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00050
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 10 to 13 together?",1,51,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00051
2021-07-06-T-004,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Question Nos 10 to 13?,1,52,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00052

2021-07-06-T-004,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,54,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00054
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Sir, since the first overseas cases of COVID-19 were reported in December 2019, MOT and CAAS have worked closely with MOH and other Government agencies to implement measures to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission and to protect workers and members of the public at the airport. These measures are reviewed regularly to take into account public health experts’ latest understanding of the virus and the evolving COVID-19 situation around the world.",1,55,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00055
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In January 2020, when still not much was known about the virus, Changi Airport put in place temperature and enhanced health screening for arriving travellers and disallowed entry of short-term visitors from places where cases had been reported.",2,56,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00056
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In March 2020, as the pandemic surged across the world, we took the unprecedented step of closing our borders to all short-term visitors. For returning Singaporeans, Permanent Residents (PRs) and long-term pass holders, in line with MOH’s public health risk assessment, we adopted risk-based differentiated border measures based on their recent travel history. For example, the immigration clearance of passengers from the US and UK was done at dedicated gate hold rooms. They were then escorted to their assigned SHN Dedicated Facilities (SDFs) to serve their mandatory Stay-Home Notice (SHN).",3,57,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00057
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Similarly, when transfers resumed in June 2020, the transit passengers were escorted from disembarkation to dedicated transit holding areas and, subsequently, to board the connecting flight.",4,58,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00058
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In January 2021, when mandatory on-arrival COVID-19 tests were introduced, these were done at separate health screening stations for passengers from very high-risk places.",5,59,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00059
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"As observed by Ms Yeo Wan Ling in her question, these measures had helped to ensure that for more than 16 months, that is, from January 2020 to May 2021, the aviation community was able to keep our borders open while keeping Singapore and Singaporeans safe. In May 2021, however, the Delta variant, which is causing a new wave of infections across the world, breached these defences, resulting in the first airport cluster.",6,60,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00060
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In response, Jewel was immediately closed and public access to the airport terminals was restricted. Jewel re-opened on 14 June this year, but the airport terminals remain closed to members of the public.",7,61,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00061
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"MOH monitors the public health situation overseas and assesses the appropriate risk level, taking into consideration information from WHO, experts and academic networks, as well as Singapore missions overseas. Depending on how the risk profile changes, CAAS and our aviation stakeholders then promptly adjust their protocols.",8,62,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00062
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Hence, in consultation with MOH and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), we further tightened our measures based on our understanding of the Delta variant. Beyond the earlier passenger segregation measures, the airport itself is now segregated into physical zones. Disembarkation piers, toilets, arrival immigration halls and baggage claim belts are now separate for passengers from places of different risks.",9,63,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00063
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Changi Airport now processes passengers from very high-risk places at dedicated bus gates at Terminal 2, which is currently closed for renovation. These passengers are then transported directly to their SHN dedicated facilities. We do not allow transfer passengers from these very high-risk places, and Changi is also studying the option of using Terminal 4 for such passengers.",10,64,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00064
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Sir, our top priority is to keep our airport workers safe, thereby also protecting their families and the wider community. They are at the heart of Changi Airport’s operations and at the frontlines of our border defences. Hence, we have prioritised our aviation workers for vaccination. Today, 95% of frontline aviation workers are fully vaccinated.",11,65,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00065
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"From the onset of COVID-19, MOT and CAAS have worked with MOH and NCID to ensure that airport workers don the appropriate level of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and undergo regular testing based on their job function. In response to the Delta variant, we have stepped up the PPE posture for airport workers and implemented more frequent routine testing. Within the higher risk zones, workers are also cohorted and have separate toilet, dining and rest facilities.",12,66,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00066
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Collectively, these measures represent a fundamental shift in operations, imposing further adjustments and stress on our airport workers as they adjust to a very different workflow. For example, workers in the higher risk zone have to stay within that zone during their mealtimes and break times, which can be quite isolating from the social point of view. We are also working closely with union leaders and industry players to help our workers adapt to these new measures.",13,67,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00067
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"My Ministry and I are deeply appreciative of the sacrifices made by the airport community to ensure that our borders remain open for essential supplies and for Singaporeans to return home. The aviation community has set aside $15 million for airport workers’ welfare during this time. I am also very glad for the support from our corporate partners and members of the public, including some CAAS staff, who started ""Friends for Aviation"" to provide encouragement and practical support for our frontline airport workers.",14,68,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00068
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, even as we stay vigilant and adjust to protect ourselves from the evolving virus, we must do our best to safeguard Singapore’s hard-earned position as a global air hub. We must adapt to a new normal, where we keep our borders open and safe for passengers, our airport workers, their families and the community. Only then can Changi continue to thrive as a safe aviation hub, connecting Singapore to the world and the world to Singapore.",15,69,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00069

2021-07-06-T-004,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I thank the Minister for the comprehensive answer. Sir, I have three supplementary questions.",1,71,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00071
2021-07-06-T-004,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"In May, we had the unfortunate situation where an 88-year-old cleaner working in T3 caught the virus at work. What are some of the additional measures we have put in place to protect the more vulnerable workers at the airport?",2,72,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00072
2021-07-06-T-004,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Secondly, I declare that I am an adviser to the National Taxi Association (NTA) and the National Private Hire Vehicles Association (NPHVA). Taxi drivers and private hire drivers are transport partners in the larger eco-system of workers supporting airport functions. Have these safety measures put in place by the airport over the past 16 months also factored in our drivers' comfort and safety?",3,73,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00073
2021-07-06-T-004,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Finally, I am very glad to hear that 95% of our workers are vaccinated. But many of our airport frontline workers live in my constituency and they have young children and many live with their elderly parents as well. So, as our airports start to open up and should our frontliners catch the virus, will the Ministry also be coming up with more support measures to assist these families and workers, especially if livelihoods are affected?",4,74,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00074
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for her questions. The overall theme of the Member's questions, which I think are quite appropriate, is the focus on the welfare of the aviation workers, workers on the frontline and those who are supporting. As I have said in my reply earlier, this is, in fact, one of our overriding priorities because we need to ensure that these workers are protected to the best of our ability and also that, where  it is essential, we also undertake specific measures to address any concerns they have with respect to their welfare.",1,75,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00075
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, let me start by saying that, in the course of many of the transitions to the new measures that we have had to put in place, I have personally been involved, together with the CEOs of SIA, SATS and Changi Airport Group, in discussions with workers from the whole gamut of workers in our airport community. This includes not just CAG's employees, SATS or SIA employees, but also those who work in ICA, Certis Cisco and so on, in order to fully comprehend the challenges of the changes that we are imposing on them, how they are coping and how we can help them further, if that is necessary.",2,76,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00076
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"And I would like to start by sharing with Members that, actually, the morale is very strong. And that was something that gave me great heart because it means that, despite the nature and the scale of the challenges we are facing, the Changi Spirit remains strong and they remain optimistic and they understand the need for these measures and have been cooperating with the health requirements as well as some of the operational shifts that we have had to make.",3,77,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00077
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Turning to the Member's specific question on measures to protect more vulnerable workers, as I said, the starting point is to ensure that now that we have got physical segregation, the workers have to observe specific protocols, and, in particular, PPE. The PPE regime has been stepped up across the board and now they don and doff, and they are trained on this already, but we have re-emphasised this. On top of that, of course, is the vaccination programme, which is a general programme that we have undertaken. In terms of the testing regime, we have now RRT, rostered routine testing for workers. Those who are in the high-risk areas, we do seven-day PCR and ART on day three or day four. For those who are in the less risky areas, we conduct a RRT PCR test every 14 days; and on about day seven or day eight, we do the ART testing.",4,78,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00078
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"These and the protocols themselves are all designed to protect the workers to the best of our ability. The management of the companies are also committed to ensuring that if any worker finds it very difficult to continue in that particular role, then they will find a way to redeploy him elsewhere, so that he can continue to work, but in a different context.",5,79,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00079
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I agree with the Member. Taxi-drivers, limousine drivers, they are a very important part because they are the extension of the broader network, in terms of transport and connectivity. In particular, we have instituted it and, as you know, again, vaccination of drivers is a key part of this. Also, they know what are the protocols to be observed, in terms of when they are carrying passengers, the kind of Safe Management Measures (SMMs) they need to observe and so on, and there are also testing regimes in place for them.",6,80,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00080
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Livelihoods, this is key. As the Member would know, I mentioned the $15 million fund and the intent is to try and help those who might be under particular stresses because of these changes. In addition, the Member would also be aware of the COVID-19 Driver Relief Fund for those who are in the point-to-point driving services, taxi services and private hire cars. These are some of the areas we have focused on.",7,81,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00081
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I can assure the Member and Members of this House that we remain focused on this. Should new needs arise, we will certainly look at them. As the Member would be aware, even with, for example, the COVID-19 Driver Relief Fund, the Government responded very quickly. With the help and support of MOF, we were able to announce the extension of these measures quite quickly. We remain committed to continuing to help and address the welfare needs of our aviation community workers.",8,82,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00082
2021-07-06-T-004,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Leon Perera.,1,83,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00083
2021-07-06-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I thank the Minister for Transport for his detailed answer, in particular, the clarification that physical segregation was implemented after the detection of the Delta variant. I just have a few supplementary questions.",1,84,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00084
2021-07-06-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The first is to ask if inter-mingling between passengers arriving from countries with different risk levels associated with them was allowed prior to mid-May 2021? And if so, what was the thinking behind that and what were the lessons drawn from that? Now, of course, there is physical segregation but to what extent was inter-mingling within the airport permitted then? The context for that is really anecdotal feedback that there was such inter-mingling being seen. Whether this is accurate or not, I am not sure, and that is why I am asking the supplementary question.",2,85,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00085
2021-07-06-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"And with your permission, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I quote very briefly from a Straits Times Forum letter from someone in April that gained some wide circulation?",3,86,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00086
2021-07-06-T-004,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Proceed, please.",1,87,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00087
2021-07-06-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"This letter writer in April said, and I quote, ""much to my dismay, inbound passengers were allowed to roam freely upon landing. One was free to hang around in the terminal between departure gates for as long as one wanted, rather than being sent straight to swab testing. I observe similar unregulated processes at the baggage claim area long before passengers were funnelled to the stations"", and so on and so forth.",1,88,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00088
2021-07-06-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"This was in April and so now, of course, we have had that physical segregation.",2,89,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00089
2021-07-06-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"So, I just wanted to ask whether that was the case, what was the thinking behind that and what were the lessons drawn from that?",3,90,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00090
2021-07-06-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"The second supplementary question is, what are the criteria that the Government uses to classify countries into different risk levels and does that take into account the extent of vaccination?",4,91,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00091
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his questions. On the second point first, the risk assessment and categorisation are undertaken by MOH. So, I would not want to represent the overall thinking on behalf of the Ministry and its experts, but I would say that the officials, the experts take into account a gamut of factors and it is also an evolving set of factors. I think the state of vaccination is certainly one of the considerations but it is by no means the only one, as the Member would well appreciate.",1,92,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00092
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Secondly, on the point about inter-mingling and what was the thinking, and so on, as I explained in some detail in my response to the Member's question earlier, the starting point must be that we are undertaking measures based on a detailed risk assessment. And that risk assessment is informed by an as up-to-date an understanding as we have of the virus, its characteristics, its transmission nature and also how these are changing with new variants emerging.",2,93,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00093
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"And, therefore, this is a risk-adjusted approach. And it has to be so. Because as we have observed around the world, really, hardly any country so far has been spared the Delta variant, regardless of the posture they take. What we need to do is ensure that the posture we adopt and the measures we adopt respond promptly to the latest understanding and address the risks that are posed, in a dynamic situation with equally dynamic responses.",3,94,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00094
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In that context, prior to the latest set of measures and the physical segregation that I talked about, we had progressively instituted a series of measures which I have just elaborated, so I do not propose to repeat them. There may well have been some inter-mingling, but that was not something that was encouraged. It was actually generally designed for people to move from the aircraft to the immigration process, collect their baggage and exit.",4,95,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00095
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I also want to emphasise to the Member, what we have undertaken in Changi now, with physical segregation of the airport, is really turning the operating model on its head. And I hope we all appreciate that. Because civilian airports, as we might recall from a not-too-distant past, are designed for passengers to come in and to actually have an experience at the airport, what we call the Changi experience. So, when we now say passengers are completely segregated physically in different zones and their movement from aircraft to immigration to baggage collection to transportation and so on, and we add now testing, it is a completely different model.",5,96,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00096
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"And so, we must appreciate that every move like this that we make entails significant adjustments, not just from an operational point of view, but also in terms of the burden it imposes on the workers at the airport. So, I want to emphasise a point that I made earlier, but I think it bears emphasis again, which is that we want to do everything we can to ensure the safety of our passengers, our aviation workers, their families and through that, the larger community, but we also want to ensure that the measures we take reflect our best judgement of the risks based on an evolving situation. And we ensure, to the best of our ability, that we respond in a manner that addresses those risks.",6,97,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00097
2021-07-06-T-004,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Saktiandi Supaat.,1,98,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00098
2021-07-06-T-004,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Speaker, I thank the Minister for the answer earlier. First of all, I would like to thank the Minister for sharing the slew of detailed processes at the airport. I thank him because I do have a number of residents who are working as cleaners and staff at the airport.",1,99,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00099
2021-07-06-T-004,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I have two supplementary questions. First, I seek clarification from the Minister because he mentioned some segregation at Terminal 2 and the potential of Terminal 4 being used in the future. Can he share whether this would be a temporary or permanent sort of situation, so as to reassure the public, in particular as well, because Jewel is now opened to the public. So, whether he can reassure whether Jewel is safe for the public to visit, going forward.",2,100,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00100
2021-07-06-T-004,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"My second question is, as the Minister has mentioned, a risk-adjusted approach is taken. But ideally, as an air hub, it would be very difficult to maintain this at our airports as we plan to open up the economy, hopefully, sooner than later, and to reinstate activity in our airport.",3,101,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00101
2021-07-06-T-004,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Can the Minister share how we can maintain this potentially start-stop, and/or segregation processes that we have in the future, and whether there will be a need for infrastructure changes at the airport in the future, given this start-stop situation or scenario which could be a possibility?",4,102,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00102
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member, who is also the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) Chair for Transport, for his questions. First, to clarify, Jewel is already open. There was a period of closure for about a month and then we re-opened it on 14 June. The passenger terminal buildings remain restricted from public access, because there is a greater potential for interaction, for example, between workers and members of the public. So, we want to be more cautious, make sure all the measures run in well and then we will have a sense of how to move forward, and if so, when we need to do so.",1,103,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00103
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Another part of that question was about T2 and T4 and the arrangements. Just to be very clear, T2 is going through renovation works, so it is not operational. And what MOT and Changi Airport Group did was to work together and come up with the idea of remote processing, remote bays, as it were, for passengers, from very high-risk countries. They are processed in the bays in Terminal 2, for immigration, for their testing and so on, and then they are immediately taken in buses to their SHN facilities.",2,104,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00104
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"We are studying the use of T4 for this purpose because T4 would have a larger capacity and it is something that the various agencies involved are working through now. If we are able to use T4, then it enhances our ability to deal with flows from the very high-risk countries.",3,105,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00105
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Is this temporary, permanent, how long? I think it is a very good question but it is a rather difficult one to answer. Because as we have learnt from our experience over the last 18 months or so, we need to be prepared for any kind of pivot. And that, I think, is the crux of the issue because we do not know how the virus is evolving or will evolve. We also have to make a judgement call because countries, the source countries and the situation can also change quite dramatically.",4,106,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00106
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"So, therefore, the posture we adopt in terms of not just the cross-border travel, but how we deal with them at the airport, which is our point of entry into Singapore, is going to be key. What the entire team in MOT, CAAS, CAG, SIA, SATS have endeavoured to do is to adopt a protocol, which is what we have now, which gives us, perhaps, the greatest possible flexibility and adaptability to an evolving situation. That, I think, is key because without that flexibility or dexterity in our response, then there will be a lot more of the fits and starts that the Member refers to, in the way we do things. So, if we have the modalities to deal with the risk, we may not know which country, or at what point, but at least we have a way to pivot quite quickly based on the assessment.",5,107,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00107
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I would say that the mindset that we have adopted is one of ""prepare for the worst, hope for the best and be as adaptable as possible, and respond quickly to an evolving situation"". That is the way we are doing this.",6,108,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00108
2021-07-06-T-004,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The Member had the air hub question, I think his question was really pertaining to what might happen, going forward, in terms of travel and so on. I think that remains an issue. As you can see, across the world, there are quite diverse attitudes towards travel and the protocols associated with them. You would also have heard from the MTF Members on some of our thinking, going forward. I would not want to prejudge the path we take at this point but what I would say is that the overriding commitment is to ensure that we are able to facilitate safe travel so that Changi will remain a safe aviation hub for travellers from around the world and, certainly, for Singaporeans.",7,109,2021-07-06-T-004-S-00109
2021-07-06-T-005,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether travellers arriving into Singapore at all air, land and sea entry points who have yet to receive their COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test results are permitted to take modes of transport where they will be within two metres of drivers or other passengers; (b) if so, whether this practice risks community transmission of imported infections; and (c) whether these passengers can instead be provided dedicated transport to a Stay-Home Notice dedicated facility with drivers wearing appropriate personal protective equipment.",1,110,2021-07-06-T-005-S-00110

2021-07-06-T-005,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Third, strict safe distancing measures are imposed. Travellers are not allowed to sit near the driver and they only occupy the rear section of the vehicle. I have, in fact, seen this first hand, so they are all seated to the rear of the vehicle and the front half creates a buffer zone with respect to the driver. The number of travellers allowed on each bus is also limited to less than half its total capacity to ensure adequate safe distancing between travellers.",4,114,2021-07-06-T-005-S-00114

2021-07-06-T-005,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Sir, I would like to seek some clarifications from the Minister. I understand that there are private charter buses. But since the start of this year, have there been any incoming passengers who do not take these private charter buses but instead take taxis or private hire cars to their homes or SHN facilities?",1,118,2021-07-06-T-005-S-00118
2021-07-06-T-005,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),My second question is  have any taxi drivers or private hire drivers caught COVID-19 while ferrying incoming passengers from the airport to the SHN facilities or homes?,2,119,2021-07-06-T-005-S-00119
2021-07-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Speaker, can passengers take taxis or private vehicles to their homes? As I said, the protocols that we have in place are for the higher risk countries. So, those who are from, say, some of the countries deemed to be less risky, they still, on arrival, have to undertake what we call an on-arrival Polymerase Chain Reaction test, or PCR test. And then thereafter, they can take the relevant form of transport to their home and then they have to wait for the results and so on. So, there may be instances of that which the Member may be referring to.",1,120,2021-07-06-T-005-S-00120
2021-07-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But the key point I would make is that for those who are from the higher risk countries, based on the categorisation we discussed earlier, the approach is to have dedicated transport from the airport to the SHN facility, so that the mode of transport is as secure as possible from a health perspective.",2,121,2021-07-06-T-005-S-00121
2021-07-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Have taxi drivers caught COVID-19? I believe there have been some cases but is it because of the passenger they ferried or not, I do not have an answer for that. I am quite happy to have it verified if the Member wishes to file a question. But I do know that in many cases, it is more because of some other community link that they have, because of a place they went to in the community and so on, and that is how they were linked to the COVID-19 virus.",3,122,2021-07-06-T-005-S-00122

We have set up inter-agency bilateral working groups with these countries and are exchanging information on how we may mutually verify the authenticity of each other’s certificates. This includes the exchange of public keys for the verification of digital certificates and the exchange of specimen copies for the verification of physical certificates.",3,126,2021-07-06-T-006-S-00126

2021-07-06-T-006,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Thank you, Speaker. I thank the Senior Minister of State for the comprehensive reply. We understand that we are now negotiating travel corridors, rather than travel bubbles. And one of the important factors hinges on the vaccine passport. We are glad that we have started discussions. But having said that, some countries in Asia, especially one country in North Asia, had experienced a vaccination scam, even a Member of Parliament was also a victim of this vaccination scam. Different countries have different ways of identifying residents who have gone for the vaccination and what type of vaccination.",1,129,2021-07-06-T-006-S-00129
2021-07-06-T-006,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"So, my supplementary question to the Senior Minister of State is that, first, what are the type of vaccinations that we will recognise in the vaccination passport? Two, how are we going to verify that this vaccination that each of the residents in the different country get are in the appropriate manner, that they are vaccinated properly?",2,130,2021-07-06-T-006-S-00130
2021-07-06-T-006,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, I thank Mr Ang for his questions. I think we should view the IATA Travel Pass (ITP), and also other forms of such certificates, as a two-step process. The first step is how do we establish ways to verify the authenticity of these certificates? So, in other words, I need to make sure that when you say that you are tested and it is PCR negative, or when you say that you are vaccinated, I can trust that this information is accurate and there is a way to do this. So, I think that is the first step  establishing the checks to verify how authentic, how accurate is this information.",1,131,2021-07-06-T-006-S-00131
2021-07-06-T-006,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"The second step is, once you have this information, then what do you do with it. That is a separate discussion. Just because the individual comes from a particular country and has been tested negative or has been vaccinated, does not mean that we automatically do away with some of the restrictions. Because it really depends on, first of all, what is the rate of infection in that source country, how confident are we of the risk level of this individual, when he or she travels to Singapore. And that would then determine what kind of safeguards we put in place.",2,132,2021-07-06-T-006-S-00132
2021-07-06-T-006,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"So, I think to answer Mr Ang's questions, this is an on-going discussion with the countries that I mentioned earlier. But we should view this, really, as a two-stage process.",3,133,2021-07-06-T-006-S-00133
2021-07-06-T-007,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether there are any plans to provide additional financial aid to affected hawkers who have been forced to close or seen their business drop significantly due to their proximity to a COVID-19 cluster; and (b) how does the Ministry intend to help draw the crowds back to affected markets and hawker centres once the COVID-19 cluster has closed.,1,134,2021-07-06-T-007-S-00134

When no dine-in was first implemented during last year’s circuit breaker, hawkers’ business were hit. This continued even when dine-in resumed subsequently, due to the implementation of group size restrictions and default working from home arrangements. This is why the Government provided in 2020 a total of five months of rental waiver and three months of subsidies for table-cleaning and centralised dishwashing fees to help hawkers defray their operating costs.",2,136,2021-07-06-T-007-S-00136

2021-07-06-T-007,,,"Let me explain how stall rental rates are determined. When new hawkers obtain vacant stalls in NEA-managed hawker centres via monthly stall tenders, the rent that they pay is the amount they tendered. There is no minimum rental. As the media has reported from time to time, some hawkers have successfully secured hawker stalls for as low as $1 per month. There are also stalls where successful bidders have tendered high bids to secure a choice stall at their preferred locations. This open tender system ensures transparency and fair pricing, particularly for stalls in high demand such as those in locations with high footfall. These rentals are kept unchanged for the duration of the three-year tenancy period.",2,140,2021-07-06-T-007-S-00140
2021-07-06-T-007,,,"When the tenancy expires, we do not put up the occupied stalls for tender as this would be disruptive to hawkers who have built their business and customer base. Instead, rentals are adjusted based on independent professional valuation that considers factors such as the footfall of the centre, stall size and prevailing market conditions to assess the market rental.",3,141,2021-07-06-T-007-S-00141
2021-07-06-T-007,,,"The rent is then adjusted towards the assessed market rate. Stallholders who had initially tendered a bid higher than the assessed market rental, at renewal, will benefit from a downward adjustment. Similarly, stalls with rentals lower than the assessed market rate will see an upward adjustment. Stallholders can choose a tenancy of one, two or three years during their renewal.",4,142,2021-07-06-T-007-S-00142
2021-07-06-T-007,,,"Due to the impact of COVID-19, the valuation of the large majority of cooked food stalls has declined in FY2021. After the freeze in rent increases from April 2020 to March 2021, the tenancies of 341 cooked food stallholders were up for renewal between April and June 2021. Fifty-eight percent of them had their rentals revised downwards to the market rate. The decrease for this group ranged from $30 to more than $2,500. Thirty-seven percent continue to pay the same rental, same as their existing tenancy. The remaining 5%, that is, 17 of the 341 stallholders, had rental increases of between $10 and $300. For this group, after the increase, the median rental was $850 a month and even the stalls which had rental increased by $300, are still paying at or below the market valuation.",5,143,2021-07-06-T-007-S-00143
2021-07-06-T-007,,,"Most stallholders are aware that increases towards the market rental level are in fact moderated. In recent years, rental revision upwards at tenancy renewal have not exceeded $300. Today, the median monthly rent for a non-subsidised cooked food hawker stall is $1,250 and remains significantly lower than those at coffeeshops and food courts.",6,144,2021-07-06-T-007-S-00144
2021-07-06-T-007,,,"We are mindful that however small the group, any rental increase, even if it has been moderated, is always sensitive and that this is a challenging period.

2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Our policies to support our low-wage workers have made a difference in uplifting them, helping them to enjoy good wage growth over the last decade. To Miss Cheng Li Hui's question, from 2009 to 2019, the real wages at the 20th percentile of our resident workforce grew 39% cumulatively, faster than the median worker at 33%. This has allowed our low-wage workers to gain ground and progress faster than the median. That means the low-wage workers are earning closer to the median wage.",7,184,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00184
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"While we see robust real income growth for them, this is not the case for most OECD countries. For example, over the same 10-year period, workers at the 20th percentile in the UK saw no real wage growth, while those in Japan and US saw only cumulative real wage growth of 3% and 6% respectively, despite having minimum wage. Nonetheless, we should not take our progress for granted. It is not inevitable that this will always be so.",8,185,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00185
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"While COVID-19 has resulted in a fall in the earnings of low-wage workers to $2,340 a month, Government schemes such as the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) and the one-off Workfare Special Payment (WSP) in 2020 helped to mitigate this impact. After taking this into account, the incomes of the first 20% of income earners in 2020 were actually similar to wages in 2019.",9,186,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00186
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"As we helped our low-wage workers cope with COVID-19, it was also timely that we look to strengthen their prospects and progression for the long term. This is why we formed the Tripartite Workgroup on Lower-Wage Workers last year. The Workgroup will be releasing its recommendations in the coming months.",10,187,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00187
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"The Government's aspiration remains to cover all sectors with Progressive Wages. Currently, Progressive Wages benefit 85,000 workers. The Workgroup has already announced that it will introduce PWMs in three new sectors  food services, retail and waste management. It will also bring in-house cleaning, security and landscaping workers into the Progressive Wage system. These moves will significantly expand coverage to up to 218,000 workers. The Workgroup is also looking at introducing Progressive Wages to other low-wage occupations that straddle multiple sectors, as raised by Miss Rachel Ong.",11,188,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00188
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,Agreeing which sector should start the PWM is just the first step. The hard work of making sure that it achieves its objective of progress for low-wage workers and sustaining high employment is in the details. These are carefully negotiated by the tripartite partners.,12,189,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00189
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"When it was first introduced in 2012, the mindsets of employers and service buyers were different. Much effort went into getting their support and their buy-in. There were concerns whether wage increases were sustainable, whether they would lead to higher costs for essential services in our daily lives. But today, all our PWM stakeholders buy into the same vision and work together to support our low-wage workers.",13,190,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00190
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,Employers now better understand the benefits of PWM to them and to their workers. This win-win outcome is why the cleaning sector has been able to agree to a much more ambitious rate of growth in its most recently concluded run of review.,14,191,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00191
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"To Ms Hany Soh's question, cleaners' wages have risen by 26% cumulatively from 2014 to 2019 and we have seen local employment rise by 3%. Overall, while businesses have had to adjust to the wage increases, they have had been able to do so without adverse effect.",15,192,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00192
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Desmond Choo asked how they will impact wages of other low-wage workers. For related jobs, there could potentially be some positive spillover effects. Nonetheless, if we want to achieve more broad-based progress for more low-wage workers, more of them would have to be brought in directly into our Progressive Wage system. Hence, the Tripartite Workgroup's discussion to include more sectors.",16,193,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00193
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Some Members, including Mr Gan Thiam Poh, wanted more information of how future wage increases for the cleaning sector were determined.",17,194,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00194
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Speaker, the essence of the Progressive Wage Model is tripartite negotiation and consensus. Hence, the representatives from the cleaning sector are part of the Tripartite Cluster for Cleaners, or TCC, which negotiated the wage increases. The TCC, which oversees the cleaning PWM, consists of representatives from the unions, employers, service buyers, as well as the Government. The TCC consulted widely with the industry and had numerous vigorous discussions amongst its members to find common ground that benefits all stakeholders. The TCC was clear in its collective desire to raise the wages of our cleaners in a sustained manner and revalue the work of our cleaners who have been integral in our fight against COVID-19.",18,195,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00195
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,This is the uniqueness of Singapore's approach because PWM progression is brought about with tripartite consensus. Mr Edward Chia and Mr Sharael Taha asked about the lessons drawn from our experience with the cleaning PWM. A key takeaway is that the negotiated approach of the PWM helps address concerns and allows the sector to raise wages at a pace that is suitable for them.,19,196,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00196
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,The robust wage increases for the cleaning PWM are fruits of almost a decade of close tripartite collaboration and consistent efforts of the TCC.,20,197,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00197
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"The TCC has learned over time to harness the PWM design to benefit their workers and the sector. Cleaning companies recognise that Singapore's resident workforce is ageing. And that in addition to better wages, they needed to re-design the jobs to better retain and attract workers to the sector. Their support also assures us that the wage increases are sustainable. Through negotiation, the PWM allows stakeholders to take sector-specific circumstances into account.",21,198,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00198
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,One example is the six-year wage schedule as highlighted by Ms Yeo Wan Ling. The TCC did so to provide employees and service providers with clarity for long-term planning. Cleaning firms can price in the wage increases in their multi-year contracts with service buyers. There is also a midpoint review so that the TCC can ensure that the wage increases remain sustainable.,22,199,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00199
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"This pandemic has showed us how the PWM approach is superior to a blunt minimum wage. The sectoral approach has enabled us to advance PWM for cleaners as well as other sectors that are able to adjust to PWM progression in the short term. A blunt minimum wage may not have been able to achieve consensus or as ambitious a wage growth. Sectors such as tourism, aviation, hospitality and others that were severely impacted by COVID-19 would not have been able to agree to such a move. So, our targeted approach enabled the tripartite movement to advance PWM at a pace depending on how different sectors perform in the market.",23,200,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00200
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"The tripartite clusters for the new sectors such as food services and retail will similarly take into account market conditions and what each sector can manage as they recover from the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr Yip Hon Weng would be happy to know that these sectors are making good headway in developing their PWMs. Notwithstanding the challenging economic conditions, they are committed to submitting their recommendations before the end of the year.",24,201,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00201
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"The cleaning PWM is also not pursuing wage increases without considering skills, productivity and industry transformation. To Ms Yeo's question on re-skilling, the TCC has upgraded the training requirements for cleaners. This ensures that our workers continue to be upskilled and helps reduce the sector's reliance on low value-added manpower, including foreign manpower as raised by Mr Yip.",25,202,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00202
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,Members have raised questions on how businesses and consumers will handle the additional costs and also how productivity in the sector can be increased.,26,203,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00203
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Indeed, if we as a society would like to see low-wage workers make good progress sustainably, all of us have a role to play in this. Employers have to drive productivity improvements in their firms through better technology and processes as raised by Mr Don Wee. They may also have to explore new business models or services to value-add to their customers. Service buyers have to embrace outcome-based contracting and contract durations that encourage investments in new technology. These are indeed directions that the industry has articulated in the Industry Transformation Map for the environmental services sector. Consumers will also contribute by sharing the cost of wage increases and have to pay slightly more for services and products as the sector implements the PWM.",27,204,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00204
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Gerald Giam asked about how the Government will increase productivity in the cleaning sector. The Government cannot legislate productivity. Productivity growth is a result of workers and firms working together to grow the business and then fairly redistribute the fruits of growth. This is why the tripartite movement believe that the Progressive Wage Model is better than a blunt minimum wage. Each PWM implemented is agreed by a tripartite process, which gives greater confidence that such wage increases can be supported by the market, by the society and will not put employment at risk.",28,205,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00205
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Finally, Members including Mr Liang Eng Hwa have asked whether Government support for firms and workers will be provided. This is something that the Tripartite Workgroup is looking at as part of its deliberations. MOM has been reviewing and enhancing Workfare with significant improvements made recently in 2017 and 2020. At each review, the wage growth of our low-wage workers has been taken into consideration and qualifying criteria adjusted accordingly. The Government will continue to review Workfare regularly to ensure that low-wage workers remain adequately supported.",29,206,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00206
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,The Government and tripartite partners are working closely together to make progressive wages a reality for all sectors of our economy sooner rather than later.

2021-07-06-T-009,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"It is without a doubt that we must uplift our lower wage workers.

2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his question. In fact, this is a very important aspect of our PWM negotiations because one of the key considerations we also had was both the survivability of our companies, as well as, at the same time, the employment outcomes of our workers. On the one hand, you want wages to go up but you do not want workers to lose their jobs either if the company closes down or the company says, ""I cannot afford this"", and they have to let go of workers. So, two things.",1,211,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00211
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"One, over time, this is why we find it very important, and I support the NTUC's work in this too, with the Company Training Committees, because these are important aspects which we want to help companies to look at – job re-design, productivity enhancements – and how they can leverage Government schemes with Enterprise Singapore providing the Productivity Solutions Grant and other development grants that they can use. These are areas in which the Government intends to provide support. We also understand that in the current market, some sectors are a bit challenged and, therefore, these may require further support. This is where the Tripartite Workgroup will study and roll out the recommendations soon to see how can we can layer on added support to help companies transition into some of these new PWM wage structures as well as for new sectors coming into PWM.",2,212,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00212

The Labour Movement would like to extend our support for the PWM. Of course, central to the Labour Movement has always been the issue of unemployment as we raise wages. So, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State, what are the safeguards that we can put in place to make sure that as we journey to the next milestone for PWM, we do not create undue unemployment?",1,214,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00214

2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Speaker, I thank Mr Choo for his question. In fact, that is the uniqueness of Singapore's system in that our safeguard is the tripartite consensus, with the employers on board, the employees agreeing, knowing what the projections look like and what they can agree to, and what they see as the market conditions coming forward. I think that is one way in which we ensure that our workers are not left behind or disemployed, fully understanding the risk that for many of our low-wage workers, the profile of this group is really the older groups, the less skilled. We know that these are also the ones who are most at risk with disemployment effects.",1,219,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00219
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"On one hand, I think this is where tripartite consensus will have to move ahead as we embark on putting more sectors on board. And that is why we have been talking to companies, employers to see how this would impact them, and how their views are in the way forward and the years ahead, whether they can absorb some of these wage increases and how much we can pass on to consumers.",2,220,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00220
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"I also want to say that consumers, too, have their part to play, in terms of supporting these initiatives and efforts, to pay more for services and products to support our low-wage workers.",3,221,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00221

2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"I do not have the figures for productivity with me. But I think it is important to also look at productivity from the fact that we did not see disemployment in the years where PWM has been implemented. I think it is key. We have also seen how companies have transformed to put in place more mechanisation, different ways of cleaning, more clean technology being put in place, and more being explored. I know NTUC and the cleaning sector are also working to see how they can improve not just the conditions of work, but also the methods in which we re-design our cleaning sector.",1,224,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00224
2021-07-06-T-009,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"I think most importantly is this, that productivity level is not just viewed from the workers' angle. At the end of the day, there is only so much floor you can clean and so many roads you can sweep. But I think, ultimately, for many companies involved, not just the cleaning sector, but others, that you have to look at productivity at both the employee level and the enterprise level. That is why the whole enterprise transformation, job re-design becomes an important factor in this because then you can see the multiples in terms of productivity increases over time.",2,225,2021-07-06-T-009-S-00225

2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Let me first recapitulate how we got here. As I mentioned, for months now, the PSP has alleged that FTAs and CECA have led to the unfettered inflow of Indian professionals, displacing Singaporeans from their jobs and bringing about all kinds of social ills. This is a seductively simplistic argument that workers facing challenges at their workplaces can identify with and has stirred up a lot of emotions.",9,244,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00244

2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),It is sad that serious issues concerning the economic well-being of our country and workers have descended to this. That is why the Minister for Law called out such xenophobic behaviour during the May Sitting of this House and challenged the PSP to table a Motion on CECA so that the matter could receive a proper public airing.,11,246,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00246
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The PSP has since made a public statement on the matter, standing by its view on FTAs and CECA. It filed various Parliamentary Questions requesting for more data and information.",12,247,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00247
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Today, I will talk about the following  one, what is fundamental to Singapore's ability to earn a living and survive; two, why FTAs, including CECA, advance our interest and are not the cause of the challenges faced by our workers; and three, what then are the causes of Singaporeans' concerns and how do we address them?",13,248,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00248

2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"That is what we have done. By capturing the trade flows through the Straits of Malacca and Singapore, PSA became the largest container transshipment port in the world.

Before COVID-19 hit us, Changi Airport was one of the busiest airports in the world – and it shall be so again – though in aviation terms, our geographical location is not quite ideal.

They free them from being constrained by our small domestic market and give them access to global markets.

2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"It requires a country to remove or lower tariffs on substantially all trade between the FTA partners. This is of tremendous benefit to Singapore. Very good deal. Why? Because other countries customarily impose tariffs on thousands of items. We are already very open. We impose duties on only three alcoholic products  beer, stout and samsu. In all my years of negotiating FTAs, I do not know what samsu is, neither have I drunk it before. But these are our three tariff items. Hence, any FTA that substantially removes tariffs imposed by both parties is inherently beneficial to Singapore.",38,273,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00273
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),FTAs also require governments to accord protection to foreign investments and ensure that regulations are imposed fairly and equally on both local and foreign firms. They also set standards on protection of intellectual property.,39,274,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00274
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"In Singapore, we always protect foreign investments and apply our regulations fairly. This makes us attractive to foreign investors. So, it has always been in our interest to do that. Abiding to these principles and disciplines is not a problem for us at all. In fact, as more of our companies expand overseas and they create their own products, they too hope that Singapore can negotiate similar protection for them when they go overseas. The investment and intellectual property protection disciplines in FTAs are, therefore, important assurances for our companies.",40,275,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00275
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Newer FTAs also set certain environmental and labour standards.

2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Specifically, on CECA, this FTA with India benefits Singapore in many ways.

2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"CECA reduces tariff barriers, which made Singapore goods more competitive in the Indian market.

We have some eggs, we have some fish but more for a bit of source diversification. We never seek to conquer the world with our eggs and our seabass.

Still, others are concerned about the influences of foreign culture through industries, such as arts and entertainment.

It means we do not insist that companies go through onerous processes and documentation to prove that no suitable locals will take a job, before they can hire a foreigner. Companies in Singapore or any other places do not hire in this way.

2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"What does the listing then show? The listing shows the types of Indian professionals who may apply to work in Singapore. It does not mean that we must approve their application. It is just that you can apply. India, for its own reasons, requested for such a list, similar to what they have in their FTAs with Korea and Japan. In fact, even if they had not listed the professions, their PMEs could still submit work pass applications to work here. The list probably meant something to India because there may be countries that would not even let you apply. That is how protectionist some countries may become and India is trying to secure their interests there.",68,303,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00303

2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Thus, the point being made by PSP on the list of the 127 professions is a red herring. The list does not confer any free pass to any Indian national.",70,305,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00305
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The second common criticism is that intra-corporate transferees from India can also freely enter Singapore to work.

2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"In any case, the total number of intra-corporate transferees from all over the world, and not just India, that have come to Singapore to work is very small. In 2020, there were only about 500 intra-corporate transferees from India in Singapore – less than 0.3% of all Employment Pass (EP) holders.",72,307,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00307
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"So, Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope we can put a stop to all this misinformation about our FTAs in general, and CECA, in particular.",73,308,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00308
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Nevertheless, it is important that we recognise that PMEs in Singapore do face challenges. And I see at least three challenges that they are facing.",74,309,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00309
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"First, there is more competition from foreign PMEs. Indeed, the number of EP holders has increased, from 65,000 in 2005 to 177,000 in 2020, an increase over 15 years of 112,000, or an annual growth rate of just under 7%. Over this period, however, the increase in the number of local PMEs is much higher, by over 380,000. So, 380,000 for local PMEs and 112,000 for EP holders.",75,310,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00310
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"These numbers underline an important point  that competition between foreign and local PMEs is not a zero-sum game. In fact, the converse is often true. By combining and complementing local and foreign expertise, we can attract more investments and create many more good jobs and career choices for Singaporeans.",76,311,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00311
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The downside is that, with more foreign PMEs in Singapore, they can compete for jobs with locals at the company level and, at that level, there can be a zero-sum situation.",77,312,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00312
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"So, there is a trade-off at play here. If I can put it simply  (a) many jobs, strong competition; (b) few jobs, no competition. And we need to find the right balance where there are more jobs, some competition. That is the way to advance the interest of Singaporeans; not swing to any extreme position, but strike that careful balance and then adjust if we find that that balance is off. But if someone promises you many more jobs with no competition from foreigners, he is selling you snake oil. It is not possible. It cannot be on any government’s policy menu.",78,313,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00313
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"I should point out that besides complementing our local workforce to create more opportunities, foreign PMEs also help cushion the impact on the local workforce when times are bad. Because during a downturn, foreigners bear the brunt of job losses. During COVID-19, for the 12 months to April 2021, the number of Employment Pass holders dropped by about 21,600, and S Pass holders fell by about 26,800. Altogether, about 50,000 over the 12 months.",79,314,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00314
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"On the other hand, local employment has been stable. The unemployment rate for local PMEs in June 2020 was at 2.9%. This is from the labour market survey, so, it comes out only once a year during June and this is immediately after the circuit breaker. Resident unemployment rate in September 2020 was 4.8%; in May 2021, 3.8%. It came down by one percentage point. Without the foreign buffer, when our economy ran into trouble, the situation would have been much worse. Singaporeans would have lost many more jobs.",80,315,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00315
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"So, while the stock of EP and S Pass holders can fluctuate, Singaporeans enjoy greater security of employment, with help from various Government measures. The Jobs Support Scheme helped firms, helped enterprises keep their workers. We have a multi-Ministry National Jobs Council which came up with many initiatives to help place displaced Singaporeans into jobs, including the Jobs Growth Incentive, to encourage companies to hire local workers.",81,316,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00316
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"So, when Mr Leong Mun Wai said in his Facebook post that we need to recoup a few tens of thousands of jobs from foreign work pass holders, he may not know that we have already done so. This always happens in a downturn.",82,317,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00317
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The second challenge is the profile of foreign PMEs. They are concentrated in certain sectors and from certain countries of origin. Indeed, as our digital economy and our needs for tech talent grew, more PMEs from India came into Singapore through our EP framework. And when that concentration happens in areas, such as Changi Business Park, some may feel that we have lost a part of Singapore. Members of the House have raised this concern. We are taking this seriously and studying what we can do to lessen the problem.",83,318,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00318
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),I hasten to add that dealing with excessive concentration is not a straightforward matter of chopping up the operations of a company here. We do not want to unintentionally cause the whole investment to move elsewhere. This will hurt even more Singaporeans. And this is part of the careful balancing that I talked about earlier.,84,319,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00319
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Third, at the company level, there may be unfair hiring practices, with department heads preferring to hire foreign PMEs, or even foreign PMEs from certain countries. This is not right. Whatever system we set up, there will always be some abuses. We must tackle the abuses when they occur as swiftly as possible, while continuing to adopt sensible economic policies that are good for Singapore and Singaporeans.",85,320,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00320
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"MOM takes a strong stance against such discriminatory practices and, together with our tripartite partners, has been actively enforcing against errant employers.

2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"I have explained the underlying reasons for the difficulties faced by our PMEs, so that we know what it means for us in terms of public policy choices and how we can most effectively address the challenges. If we mistakenly blame FTAs and CECA for these problems, our responses would be disastrously wrong and would make our problems worse.",87,322,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00322

2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] The Government deeply understands the pressures faced by local PMEs in the workplace. These include concerns about being displaced by foreign PMEs. Some companies have employed more foreigners and this has made Singaporean employees uncomfortable.,89,324,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00324
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The Government has received feedback from many members of the public and Members of Parliament on these issues. We take these concerns seriously and have already taken action to address them. For example, we have raised the salary bar for foreign PMEs to tighten the inflow of foreigners. We have also stepped up enforcement, investigation and punishment against employers who discriminate against locals.",90,325,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00325
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"In order to prescribe the right solution, we have to first identify the root cause of the problem. However, over the past year, before identifying the truth of the matter, the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) has laid the blame squarely on the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) as the main culprit for the unfettered inflow of Indian professionals, displacing Singaporeans from their jobs. PSP also claimed that all the FTAs that we have signed have harmed Singapore's economy and the interests of Singaporeans.",91,326,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00326
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"They have unfortunately turned FTAs into political scapegoats to discredit the policies of the Government.

2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"First, what is the pillar of Singapore's economy? We are a small country lacking in natural resources. The key to our economic success lies in whether we have a global view and whether we can leverage globalisation to attract foreign investments and expand into international markets to make up for our lack of natural resources and our small size. Only by doing so can our people live in peace and happiness, and can young Singaporeans pursue their dreams.",94,329,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00329
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Second, what is the intent of signing FTAs with various countries? Through negotiations, we are able to get tariff exemptions from our partner countries. This will help promote our exports and is especially important to our SMEs because the domestic market is too small. FTAs will help our SMEs venture into international markets and grow stronger.",95,330,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00330
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"We have signed 26 FTAs with various countries in the world.

2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"FTAs also help us to attract businesses and investors. EDB often says that our FTA network is a major selling point to persuade MNCs when they decide whether to invest in Singapore. When investors come to Singapore, our FTAs can help them enter various major markets in the world. Also, under the FTA provisions, the Singapore Government has obligations to provide some protection to their investments.",97,332,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00332
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Third, why is PSP’s claim incorrect? That is because they have distorted the intent of the FTAs and our FTA negotiation team. They have wronged us. They said that CECA has allowed 127 categories of professionals from India to enter, live and work in Singapore freely. This claim is ridiculous.",98,333,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00333
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The listing of 127 professions serves as a point of reference for relevant parties. Professionals working in these categories can apply to work in Singapore but it does not mean that the applications will be automatically approved. These are two different things. Ultimately, the applicant must still meet the qualifying criteria for work passes in Singapore; only then can they get an Employment Pass to work here.",99,334,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00334
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"In all our FTAs, our immigration and foreign talent policies remain unchanged. We retain full rights to decide who can enter the country to live, work, become PRs or become citizens.",100,335,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00335
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Fourth, where do the pressures that Singaporean PMEs face come from? Simply put, globalisation brings about greater competition.

2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"However, competition between foreign and local PMEs is not a zero-sum game.

2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"As a small country that relies on the global economy, we face the following choices.

2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Another challenge that we face is that we are now growing our digital economy and our need for tech talent has grown. Today, China and India are two of the largest global suppliers of tech talent. Many Chinese talent tend to work in China because they have many unicorn enterprises and significant domestic demand. India’s talent have continued to look outwards. Therefore, there are relatively more Indian digital and tech talent in Singapore. This is a phenomenon that we have to face. The Government is working together with industry players to explore adopting offshore outsourcing solutions. However, this must be done carefully to avoid losing important foreign investments altogether.",105,340,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00340

Indeed, when a single nationality becomes too prominent and that can have a disproportionate impact on our existing culture, our beliefs, it can cause our fellow Singaporeans, ourselves included, to feel less at home in our workplaces and in our neighbourhoods. In the early 2000s, we experienced a similar situation when the share of PRCs in our foreign workforce increased significantly, before tapering as China’s growth took off.

Potentially, it could be a sign that some unfair hiring may be occurring. The purpose of this Watchlist is to have the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices, or TAFEP, actively engage these companies to review and improve, where needed, their hiring practices and their human resource capabilities. The majority of the firms are cooperative. They respond positively and they exit the Watchlist. For the small minority that are unresponsive, they can have their work pass privileges curtailed or they can be suspended for a specific time period.

2021-07-06-T-010,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Since 2011, I have been pushing for stronger enforcement against employers who discriminate against or unfairly treat Singaporean PMEs, a foreign PME dependency ratio, labour market testing which subsequently came in the form of the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF), the National Jobs Bank as well as many other policy measures, from Employment Pass qualifying salaries to regular tightening of the FCF and the prosecution of companies who are recalcitrant. We even set up the Employment Claims Tribunal, Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) as well as the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM), and issued many tripartite advisories, standards and guidelines to strengthen the Singaporean Core.",8,487,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00487
2021-07-06-T-010,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"I am heartened that in these past 10 years of lobbying and advocating for a stronger Singaporean Core, many of these measures have been put in place, as shared by Minister Tan See Leng earlier, with the support of our tripartite partners and other economic agencies, such as MAS and EDB, to better support and protect our Singaporean workforce and provide them with a fair and level playing field in the job market.",9,488,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00488
2021-07-06-T-010,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"In fact, less than a year ago, in the midst of the pandemic and worsening of the economy, the Labour Movement lobbied, and the tripartite partners created and updated the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment with key principles on fair retrenchment which provides added safeguards to preserve our Singaporean Core in our companies during retrenchment exercises.",10,489,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00489
2021-07-06-T-010,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"That said, more needs to be done to strengthen the Singaporean Core, further develop our local workforce's capabilities and protect our locals from being unfairly discriminated. It is important to recognise the role that foreign manpower plays, which is to complement and enhance the capabilities of the local workforce and not to replace or displace it. In this vein, I would like to put forth some proposals to the Minister that aim to address fairness and localisation of PME jobs.",11,490,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00490
2021-07-06-T-010,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"First, we can enhance fair hiring practices through strengthening enforcement and imposing stiffer penalties for errant companies with discriminatory hiring practices. I have previously submitted in this House on revealing or publishing the ""triple weak"" watchlist which MOM and TAFEP maintain, so that the potential reputational loss would serve as a deterrence. We should not allow the few black sheep to weaken our entire working structure. I further submit that MOM should consider giving TAFEP even more teeth and bite through expanded powers of investigation, enforcement and to even mete out punishment.",12,491,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00491
2021-07-06-T-010,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Second, we can level the playing field for local PMEs by enhancing the EP application review process to move beyond looking at the individual applicant's educational qualifications and salary, and pay close watch to sectors with a particular imbalance.",13,492,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00492
2021-07-06-T-010,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Finally, we need to ensure that locals have fair access to PME roles and progression opportunities to improve localisation of jobs in high growth sectors. As I have lobbied before in this House, it is imperative that we ensure concerted, structured, institutionalised and mandatory skills and knowledge transfer from these foreign PMEs to our local PMEs within a stipulated and agreed timeframe, as employers bring in foreign PMEs to fill skills or knowledge gaps in their current workforce. This will help to develop a pipeline of local talent. At the same time, we will also need to build our leadership bench strength to ensure that Singaporeans can benefit and take up leadership roles in multinational corporations that we bring into Singapore.",14,493,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00493
2021-07-06-T-010,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"To sum up, to say that we have found the silver bullet or antidote will not be an easy one as it is a treadmill journey. We need to constantly watch our step, keep pace and stay in touch with the pulse. Pay close watch to economic competition and competitors, keep pace with the changing demographic profile and the future of work, and stay in touch with the pulse and heartbeat of Singaporeans, their stresses, aspirations, interests and well-being because every worker matters.",15,494,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00494

The World Trade Organization (WTO) was established in 1995 as a multilateral institution that facilitated the signing of agreements in areas such as services, investment and Intellectual Property. This enabled the Singapore economy to attract MNCs to base production in Singapore, thus creating jobs and sell into the world market. With increased protectionist sentiments expressed in many advanced countries in recent years, the WTO has had difficulty in reaching new agreements.",3,498,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00498
2021-07-06-T-010,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"It has been necessary for Singapore to turn to FTAs to provide a means to enlarge markets for Singapore-based firms. By negotiating and signing FTAs that enable our firms to export to destination markets with lower or zero tariff rates, Singapore can attract foreign capital to work in Singapore to employ Singapore-based workers and pull up their wages. With Singapore's total fertility rate consistently below the replacement rate of 2.1 since the mid-1970s, the size of the citizen labour force will begin to shrink, with more people retiring than the number of new entrants into the workforce.",4,499,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00499

2021-07-06-T-010,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"Singapore's rise in living standards over the past decades has been facilitated by a steady inflow of foreign direct investments, which brought technology and good jobs. So, continuing to attract MNCs to base their production here, even as we become more service-oriented, with manufacturing hiring a smaller share of labour force, yet, doing this is likely to require a complementary set of skills that can be offered only by a combination of local and foreign workers, given the low fertility rate.",6,501,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00501
2021-07-06-T-010,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"At this stage of our development, where indigenous innovation must contribute to productivity growth, FTAs also allow new start-ups as well as both Large Local Enterprises (LLEs) and SMEs, to face lower trade barriers when selling into particular overseas markets. So, we continue to need to rely on MNCs because they are large, they pay better wages, but we are also at a stage where we need to stimulate indigenous innovation. And they will start small. Many will fail. But they need to have the capacity to be able to sell abroad. Therefore, establishing FTAs that allow the partner signatories to the agreement to lower their tariff rates enlarge the market for our new start-ups as well as SMEs and LLEs.",7,502,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00502
2021-07-06-T-010,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"To be clear, the increased international competition faced by our local firms also means there will be some job destruction because, with increased competition, some of our SMEs may fail.

Because, what is a job? A job is a combination of tasks that we create. So, the allocation of workers with the right skillset to fill these job slots with these particular set of tasks is necessary in order to maximise these Singapore-based firms' profit. Only then will the productivity of the firm be boosted and the salaries correspondingly increased.",11,506,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00506

So, from the point of view of increased human capital, as well as the investment in SkillsFuture to allow learning on the job, I think there is every reason to have confidence that our local workforce will both have a higher level of human capital as well as have the ability to acquire new skills to function in an age of digital transformation. If we succeed in doing that, then our resident workers will have the comparative advantage to fill these new job slots, the sort of thing that Mr Patrick Tay talked about.",12,507,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00507

Given our history, the ability to ultimately compete in the world market says that there is something positive of a tilting towards the direction of increased competition. But we make investment in our local workforce, starting from the Primary school level. And there is every good reason to believe that even as we transit to a phase of the country's development where you are not going to have the 5% growth per year, because that was catch-up growth, we are now at the stage where the potential for growth has to come from innovation driving productivity.",13,508,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00508

Our concern is over specific provisions in FTAs relating to the movement of natural persons. In CECA, just now Minister Ong mentioned that the listing of the 127 professions does not mean that anybody who applies under this will be approved, but it can be rejected even if they apply. Article 9.5, clause 2, under the heading of ""Professionals"", states that ""each party shall grant temporary entry and stay for up to a year"" and it goes on to list several conditions.",4,518,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00518

And I think these quotes and all these messages you receive, if you are Singaporean, especially one facing challenges at the workplace, feeling insecure, you are bound to feel upset and angry. You are bound to feel, ""I do not want to welcome foreign PMEs"". You will grow suspicious of them, even reject them.

2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"First, CECA does not allow a free flow of intra-corporate transferees to Singapore.

We must manage this.",22,543,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00543
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Second, Singaporeans want to know that they will be given fair treatment at the workplace. It is entirely justified. We have rules to achieve such fairness and we will continually review these rules and framework, and how they are implemented to ensure that fairness is assured.",23,544,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00544
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"This is what the Government, on its part, has done in the spirit of trying to achieve some common ground as we go into the debate.",24,545,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00545
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, may I ask PSP, our two hon Non-Constituency Members of Parliament from PSP, after hearing all the explanations from Dr Tan and I, will you agree to the following?",25,546,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00546
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"First, the FTAs, including CECA, are fundamental to Singapore's economic survival and our ability to earn a living and we should not shake this bedrock for political purposes.",26,547,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00547
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Second, CECA does not allow a free flow of Indian PMEs into Singapore. This is a gross misunderstanding of the agreement and FTAs in general. Nor is CECA the cause of the challenges faced by our PMEs. We must put a stop to the spreading of the falsehoods.",27,548,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00548
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"If you agree to this, I think we have a good chance to have some common ground that when we come into the House again for a debate on the Motion, we can have a meaningful and constructive debate.",28,549,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00549

I also thank Minister Ong Ye Kung and Minister Tan See Leng for their detailed explanation of the situation on foreign PMETs, foreign manpower, Free Trade Agreements and CECA.",1,552,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00552
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"As to Minister Ong Ye Kung's questions, I will leave them to the last or we will leave them to be answered in the debate that we are going to conduct later on. But there are a few things I would like to bring up here or a few questions I would like to ask to clarify the situation further.",2,553,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00553
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"One, we are not against FTAs. We know the importance of FTAs for Singapore, as an open economy and especially as a small city state. However, what we are concerned about is what price we are paying.",3,554,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00554
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The first question I would like to ask is, in the process of negotiating an FTA, what are the bargaining positions that we can give? I read things like, because we do not have many bargaining chips, the implication is that we may have to be a bit more relaxed with the movement of people. One question I want to ask is, is the movement of people or natural persons used as one of the bargaining chips when we are negotiating an FTA?",4,555,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00555
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The whole purpose of PSP – as well as Hazel and I – bringing up the issue about foreign manpower or foreign PMETS or foreign talent, whatever term is used, and the FTAs is because it is about Singaporeans' jobs and livelihoods. When PSP's Dr Tan Cheng Bock raised the issue at the August 2019 launch of PSP, it is due to the huge amount of feedback that we got from the ground. By raising the issue, we had hoped that we would get some response from the Government to explain more about FTAs, in particular, CECA.",5,556,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00556
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Indeed, you would admit that no other FTA has given and stated specifically that 127 professions can come in to work. You may say that no one has come in through the CECA route but the clause is there. It is up to the other party, whether they want to use it or not and, most importantly, up to our Government to administer our employment policies. Because our employment policies are already quite relaxed in granting work passes to foreigners, so the Indian nationals do not have to come to Singapore through the CECA route.",6,557,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00557
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"So, the first question I want to ask is whether the movement of people is used as a bargaining chip.",7,558,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00558
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The second question I want to ask is, we should not focus on the number of people that got into the job market through the FTAs or CECA. They have provided some conditions. Most importantly is how those conditions under the FTAs interplay with our domestic employment policies.",8,559,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00559
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The number to focus on is, how many of the respective FTAs' nationals – in the case of CECA, it is Indian nationals – have come to Singapore and taken up our PMET jobs? What is the share of that as a percentage of our foreign PMETs, and then, of our total PMET jobs? That is my second question.",9,560,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00560
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The next point I want to bring up or question is, the Government has admitted that something needs to be done. There are concerns by Singaporeans regarding jobs and livelihoods. This has been going on and on. Have sufficient measures been taken to address them?",10,561,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00561
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"One of the questions I want to ask is, has the Government actually tried to find out what the total number of displaced Singaporeans is?",11,562,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00562
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"I would think that you cannot deny that there are Singaporeans who are displaced. Your narrative is that it is because they do not have the skills. Let us not push the blame to the Universities and the Polytechnics so easily. It has been 20 years since we started the foreign talent policy. Within 20 years, have we still not got our act together in training our people?",12,563,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00563
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"That is my third question, what is the total number of Singaporeans that are displaced over the last 10 years? They would like to have the job that was taken by a foreigner, but were not able to. They lost their current job and when they got another job, they got a lower pay.",13,564,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00564
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"There is also a significant number of Singaporeans who are under-employed. If you look at the growth of the Grab driver population, the growth of our traineeship programme and many of our independent workers, are they voluntarily opting for the independent lifestyle or are they facing difficulty in getting a permanent job? Has MOM done a study on those? Have you got the statistics? That is the third question.",14,565,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00565
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The fourth question is, of course, we are particularly concerned about the finance and the IT sectors. Minister Tan See Leng has given some numbers. Unfortunately, we do not have enough time to digest those numbers. We will maybe discuss that in our debate in the future. But the fourth question I want to ask is, really, how many foreigners are there in the IT and finance sectors versus the number of Singaporeans and PRs? That is the fourth question. I think the Minister might have given some figures just now.",15,566,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00566
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The fifth question is, the Minister said that we are not competitive, Singaporeans are not competitive but —",16,567,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00567
2021-07-06-T-010,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Mr Leong, I would urge you to stick to the facts. I think we have all been participating in this debate and listening intently, so I do suggest that you keep to what has been said. A lot of questions have been answered as well. The idea of a debate is to debate the issues that have been raised, so please do that.",1,568,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00568
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I am raising questions, can you be more specific?",1,569,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00569
2021-07-06-T-010,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"You are free to raise questions. Some of these points have been covered. So, we are happy to take the time to debate whatever that is meaningful, but please make it meaningful.",1,570,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00570
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"I do not understand what you mean by meaningful, because I am going through those points. Okay, never mind, I will try.",1,571,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00571
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"The fifth question is, we have had this foreign talent policy for 20 years. But if you look at the way MOM has administered and regulated the flow of foreign PMETs into Singapore, you find that the policies, of course, over time, there is a bit of tightening at a time but, generally, it seems to be too little and too late.",2,572,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00572
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"For example, the foreign talent policy has started in the late 1990s or around the year 2000. But the Fair Consideration Framework was only introduced in 2014. Only in 2016, I was told that the Fair Consideration Framework watchlist was started. Do you mean there were no problems the one- and a half decade before that? And the threshold salaries that we have, just EP alone, up till 2020 last year, it was still $3,600. At the kind of threshold salary plus no CPF, do you think we are attracting the right foreign talent into Singapore? That is the fifth question.",3,573,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00573
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"My sixth question is, I totally agree with Minister Tan See Leng about what we are driving at, it is not abolishing things, it is not totally eradicating things. We are also talking about a rebalancing, but the rebalancing cannot come as a result of a natural attrition from COVID-19. There must be a policy recognition that whether our past foreign talent policy was on the right track or not. If we review the policy and we think that there are certain things that we need to change, then make it a policy point. Do not allow natural attrition to come by and say tens of thousands have left Singapore. That is not the way we conduct policy.",4,574,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00574
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"So, it is about rebalancing and when we talk about rebalancing, Minister Tan also said, one thing is to ensure that Singaporeans can compete fairly or there is no unfair competition. He explained that not having to pay CPF for the Employment Pass holders is not a disadvantage. I respect you for your experience in the private sector, Minister Tan. As an employer, is that not a wage concession? So, how can we say that Singaporeans are not being treated unfairly in the job market competition? That is my sixth question.",5,575,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00575
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"My seventh question is, Minister Tan said that there is simply not enough local talent. Again, I will raise the point which I have said just now  then what happened to our education system? What happened that after 20 years, you are still telling Singaporeans that we have not enough talent? Of course, we are not saying that we can substitute the foreign PMETs completely. But at least there can be some rebalancing, and we get back to my question just now. And if the Minister admits that there is some displacement of Singaporeans, then that rebalancing means we must slowly allow Singaporeans to be given the first opportunity to take up the jobs first.",6,576,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00576
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"My last question is, the Minister talked about diversity, but here again, is it not something that MOM should have done long ago about diversity in the workforce when we introduced our foreign talent policy? We also know, because we have worked in an international environment before, that the group dynamics at the workplace can change very fast with changes in the nationality composition in the company. So, especially when MOM is monitoring and regulating the granting of the work passes, do you mean you have not, at the beginning, taken that as an important consideration?",7,577,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00577
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"And, today, then you have to say that, ""On my watchlist, I have this number of companies that have a very large concentration of PMETs from a single nationality"". So, we really want to understand how MOM actually administers this whole foreign PMET policy.",8,578,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00578
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"After this, maybe I will add a few more points, I will ask a few more questions about the approval process, some of the experiences I had in the private sector with regard to MOM and its approval process. But my questions are these questions for now.",9,579,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00579
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,It is a long list of questions which I am not sure would help us bring the discussion forward.,1,580,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00580
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Let me take questions four to eight and then one to three. Four to eight is for MOM but I think let us not prolong this because, as Mr Speaker has noticed, many of the questions were actually addressed in our speeches. But if you do not accept what we say, there is very little room for us to further explain.",2,581,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00581
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The long and short is, we have been extremely successful, as I have explained in my Ministerial Statement, in growing the Singapore economy, creating this multitude of jobs. I gave examples of our port, airport, financial services, ICT, manufacturing, you name it, we are a hub of all hubs. All these would not have been possible if we have not ridden on the wave of globalisation, welcomed foreign talent and given our own people very good training and education to rise up and take the positions.",3,582,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00582
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I mentioned that our only problem is there is not enough of us. Investors come here, they want to hire Singaporeans. They know our education system is solid and we have such a wonderful reputation around the world, something that, as Singaporeans, we should be proud of. The education system is a bit stressful still, but we should be very proud of that. The problem is, there is still not enough of us.",4,583,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00583
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"There are some questions, and we have given figures, so I do not think I would answer those. He mentioned a whole series of procedural policy, how come the Fair Consideration Framework came in so late, why is the salary bar for entry raised only later. MOM's successive Manpower Ministers have been reviewing policies all the while. Policies are never static.",5,584,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00584
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Old policies worked for a period of time. Then, when China and India grew, you get a different influx of workers. You need to adjust your position, hence, you review. And this process will continue and we will debate in this House on the pros and cons of prevailing and new policies.",6,585,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00585
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"You cannot say because we implemented something new now to respond to the situation, therefore, we have failed. Why did you not do it five years ago? It does not work like that. That is not policy-making. That is not how this House works. If it were so, then, for every Bill that is tabled in this House, we have failed, because we should have tabled this Bill five years ago. It does not make sense.",7,586,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00586
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I will go back to the first three questions that the Member posed to me, but actually I posed to him first. [Laughter.]",8,587,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00587
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Ms Hazel Poa made a point, if I heard correctly, she said, ""We are not against FTAs, we support the FTAs"". I thought we started to have some common ground. Then, she asked me about Chapter 9. She is not a trade negotiator, so, I think those are fair questions. I have been a trade negotiator for many years, I explained how the chapter ought to be read. And when she asked that, I hope it is because she might have read the chapter wrongly to think that Singapore shall allow professionals from 127 categories to enter, no questions asked. After my explanation, I was hoping that she would come to the conclusion that they might have interpreted the chapter wrongly but after hearing Mr Leong Mun Wai speak, I think my assumptions are all wrong.",9,588,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00588
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I had two questions for the Members and was hoping to hear ""yes"" to both. But after hearing Mr Leong, although he said he is not against FTAs, but he then went on to say that, ""you use movement of natural persons as a bargaining chip and sell away our rights for immigration"". I already explained that is untrue.",10,589,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00589
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, after all the explanation and you still come to that conclusion, then I say this  number one, PSP you are against globalisation, you are against FTAs, even though I have gone to great lengths to explain that this is the bedrock of Singapore's economic survival; number two, you are really not taking back the falsehoods and the allegations. I do not think you are taking it back. You do feel that the FTA, that CECA, despite our explanation, let in Indian professionals freely into Singapore. I think those are your positions.",11,590,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00590
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Please prove me wrong, but after hearing you, I am afraid these are your positions.",12,591,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00591

2021-07-06-T-010,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Mr Speaker, I must admit that, notwithstanding the fact that this is my first Ministerial Statement, I actually struggle to follow Mr Leong's line of reasoning. I guess it is because of the fact that, for quite a number of the issues, I think he is looking at it, first and foremost, from a hindsight kind of perspective  why is it that we did not do this, why is it that we did not do that?",1,593,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00593

2021-07-06-T-010,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"I think what is important is that, if we look at the evolution of our industry, how we started in the 1970s, in the very early part of my speech, at that time, our GDP was about S$20 billion; I think we are at S$454 billion now.",3,595,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00595

2021-07-06-T-010,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"We started with a very conscious effort in the 1970s to go and build heavy industries. So, we developed Jurong Island. There were all these heavy industries that we built up. Our Pioneer founding generation leaders under former Minister Mentor Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Dr Goh Keng Swee and so on, I think at that time when we first started, we were very, very heavily invested in these heavy industries. We went on then into manufacturing. In the 1980s, we went into electronics. We did disk drives, wafer fabrication and then, eventually, in early part of 2000, we went into services, we went into bio-pharmaceutical, life sciences and so on and so forth. And now, we are into tech, we are into infocomm and we are into finance.",5,597,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00597
2021-07-06-T-010,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Every 10 to 15 years, we have seen fairly dramatic transformation. I think it is inconceivable that you would expect that policies that you enact do not get refined, do not get tweaked and do not get adjusted over time.",6,598,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00598
2021-07-06-T-010,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"So, I guess to his point about the fact that why is it that we did not do this and so on, I think in the last 15, 20 years – and he has sort of pointed out the fact that I have been from the private sector; perhaps, I have not been in the Government long enough – if anything at all, for the last 20 years, change was the constant. Change is a constant and change will be a constant. We will continually face disruption, we will face transformation.",7,599,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00599
2021-07-06-T-010,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"So, to his other point about why is it that we are not able to have all this workforce ready in spite of all of our education upgrades and so on, I think if we all had a crystal ball 20, 30 years ago and we could gaze so clearly into the future, perhaps, even for himself, as a CEO of a private equity firm, I think all the necessary investments made would have been perfect and spot on. But, perhaps, I think, hindsight, like what they always say, is perfect.",8,600,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00600
2021-07-06-T-010,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"To the other point about private sector and how we package the CPF into it, indeed, I can share with you. Perhaps my experience is very limited; I have just been in healthcare all my life. I do admit that I lobbied at that time, five, six years ago, for an increase in the number of S Passes because of the fact that I needed to deliver a certain level of nursing care. I just could not hire enough healthcare personnel, for example, nurses, to come in and help us.",9,601,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00601
2021-07-06-T-010,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"While we do not pay CPF, the overall costs of bringing them in is higher because we have to package in housing and other allowances. And, really, because the employer part of it is imputed into our cost, I can tell you with conviction, because I have done it for many, many years in my life, that that package that we pay out is higher than what we do pay to locals. The only difference of course is the overtime charges and so on. But I think that is another sort of thing altogether.",10,602,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00602

In the early 2000s, our Universities, our Institutes of Higher Learning, the number of IT students that they produced at that particular point in time, today, we are training about four times more what we used to be training before. The entry levels, in terms of the grades, the credits and so on, that are required for the students to make it to get into the Universities are also significantly higher.",11,603,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00603

2021-07-06-T-010,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Today, if you look at the absolute PME growth numbers, three quarters are our local PMEs in good jobs; one quarter are filled by foreign work pass holders. Our glass is not even half full; our glass is three-quarters full. And we are looking at it from that perspective. Are you saying that we should even adjust that? Of course, we should try to bring it up to 90% or 100% full. But let us also be mindful of the sentiment, the worries and also the hard work of the other three-quarters in that glass that is three-quarters full.",13,605,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00605

2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Two, CECA does not allow a free flow of Indian PMEs into Singapore and this is a falsehood and a gross misunderstanding of the agreement. If they agree, I think we can have a meaningful debate when they table the Motion.",3,609,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00609

As I said, the answers to the two questions actually require a bit more debate and study. But, first, I want to say that PSP and Hazel and I, we are for FTAs. Having heard that jobs and livelihoods of our people are not being used as a bargaining chip, we are very reassured that our interests, Singaporeans' interests are being taken care of.",1,611,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00611
2021-07-06-T-010,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"However, whether CECA has contributed to the overall influx of nationals from that country, I think we need to study a bit more. Because we have to go back and look at the numbers provided by the two Ministers to see what is the share of the Indian PMETs in our overall PMET workforce and to take into consideration what Minister Tan See Leng has said about how we really need them. Then we would like to know whether there are skills transfer programmes, whether our education system is catching up fast enough and also the various practices in the market, before we can make a final conclusion that CECA is really neutral to beneficial for Singapore.",2,612,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00612

2021-07-06-T-010,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"Sir, as Minister Ong Ye Kung has earlier said, we have over 26 FTAs and our network of FTAs covers about 85% of global GDP, enhancing the value proposition of countries and economies that sit at the nodes of these networks, and Singapore is one of them. So, the FTAs yield tangible value to our companies. In 2018 alone, I understand that our companies enjoyed more than $1.1 billion in tariff savings. These FTAs accord our businesses preferential market access into the markets of our major trading partners, lowering entry barriers for the export of goods and services, as well as protecting their investments in other countries. This strong FTA network can be a tool for businesses, not only in reducing their costs and time-to-market, but also in ensuring a predictable trading environment.",5,631,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00631

I would dare say that because our Singapore businesses remain very much plugged into our FTA network, we have been able to ride the storm of COVID-19 a little better than if we were disconnected. We should know first-hand what it Is like to be disconnected, considering the impact we experience in aviation and tourism because of border closures. Trade, along with foreign direct investments into Singapore, will drive our economic recovery and the resumption of business activities post-COVID-19, even as we restlessly reinvent our industries, innovate ideas, products, services and business models to emerge stronger post-pandemic.",6,632,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00632

Singapore’s Digital Economy Agreements (DEAs) with Chile, New Zealand, Australia and, potentially, the UK look to provide frameworks for regulatory cooperation in support of trade and business in a digital economy and address issues arising from these emerging technologies. As we have heard the Minister for Trade and Industry yesterday, MTI and the Government agencies have been hard at work looking into various new opportunities for us to enter into new trade agreements, including for renewable energy, green economy and so on. On that count, frankly speaking, on behalf of our business community, I would like to acknowledge the efforts of MTI, MOF and all the Government agencies in helping our businesses to be competitive.",8,634,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00634

We need to exercise humility and restlessly reinvent ourselves. Some areas of concern highlighted in the recent World Competitiveness Report, in my opinion, are rather worrisome. These include potential relocation of businesses being a threat to the Singapore economy; perception of Singapore’s changing attitude towards globalisation, which Minister Ong Ye Kung has also highlighted earlier; the availability of skilled labour, qualified engineers and competent senior managers in Singapore, regardless of nationality. So, the availability of skilled labour and competent senior managers is a concern; as well as our immigration laws preventing hiring of foreign labour. Such perceptions could erode Singapore’s attractiveness as a business capital and our businesses are concerned and, I am sure, the Government is equally concerned.

Trade is more than three times our GDP and it will continue to be so.",5,645,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00645

And I must say that people were laughing; what could two small little economies do to advance the cause of free trade? But we persisted and we got the first agreement done and, thereafter, we went on to do a number of other agreements. When I was Permanent Secretary, I was in the trenches negotiating many agreements with our ASEAN counterparts. And that is how we had the ASEAN Economic Free Trade Agreement; that was enhanced to the ASEAN Economic Community. Thereafter, it was not just ASEAN. There were two things that we did. One was Free Trade Agreements between Singapore and other countries, far bigger economies  Japan, Australia, US; and then, more recently, the European Union.",6,646,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00646

2021-07-06-T-010,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat (East Coast),"The honest answer is very little. We only have tariffs on three items  beer, stout, samsu. And what is that as a bargaining chip?

2021-07-06-T-010,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat (East Coast),"So, how did we manage to negotiate trade agreements with big economies that have a lot of concerns? For example, Japan was very concerned about agriculture. In the case of India, there was an even wider range of concerns. So, let me tell Mr Leong and his team that I spent three years of my life negotiating this agreement because although I was a Permanent Secretary – and Permanent Secretaries usually just supervise, they do not get into the trenches – the Indian side decided that it was an important agreement, they would have a permanent secretary, and Minister George Yeo said, ""Well, you have no choice"".

I went to different parts of India because there was objection from every part of India, from business groups to states.

Singapore has a population of, at that time, probably about three-odd million, and I said we will be easily swamped. So, we must have very strict agreements on this. And that was, in fact, among the last chapters. There were two chapters that were the most difficult to conclude for which I never let go and we got what we needed.",11,651,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00651

The World Bank has ranked Singapore the best in the world in educating our people. So, please do not go around thinking that we have not put in enough effort. And, in fact, we have increased cohort participation rates from 20% of cohort to now 40%, Government-funded. We now have six Universities.

Your neighbourhood shops, who is going to compete with them? Today, with e-commerce, our neighbourhood shops are under stress.

2021-07-06-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I just have two supplementary questions  one for Minister Ong and one for Minister Tan.",1,664,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00664
2021-07-06-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"For Minister Ong, in 2016, my parliamentary colleague and Workers' Party Member of Parliament Leon Perera asked the then-Minister for Manpower – and this was arising out of feedback from the ground about CECA – issues about a lot of Indian nationals working on the ground. And the question Mr Leon Perera asked was about the number of intra corporate transferees (ICTs) that were working in Singapore through CECA. At that point, the reply that came was the Ministry does not disclose the data on foreign manpower with breakdown by nationality, including data on ICTs.",2,665,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00665
2021-07-06-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In February this year, Mr Leong Mun Wai of PSP asked a question about the number of ICTs working in Singapore. This time, the Government disclosed the overall ICT numbers over Employment Pass (EP) holders. And the number was something like 5% of EP holders. Today, we have more information, that for last year at least, 500 of these ICTs originated from India.",3,666,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00666
2021-07-06-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),The point I want to make to the Minister and to the Government at large is the opportunity to quell or at least to nip some of these issues in the bud when they start moving into the realm of xenophobia and nativism. One important way to prevent that is the availability of information.,4,667,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00667
2021-07-06-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In August 2020, a Straits Times reporter mentioned that ""ICTs were a key bone of contention with respect to CECA"".",5,668,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00668
2021-07-06-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"If this information on the number of ICTs had been made known earlier, it does occur to me that a lot of the misunderstanding and the reaction we see about CECA could have been addressed and actually nipped in the bud.",6,669,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00669
2021-07-06-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I hope the Government understands that with more information, actually, we can hold the line better before these discussions move into a realm of xenophobia and so forth.",7,670,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00670
2021-07-06-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),My question to Minister Tan See Leng pertains to TAFEP and the strengthening of the enforcement arm of TAFEP. We had an exchange at the opening of Parliament about this and I would just like to confirm with Dr Tan whether raising the numbers in the enforcement arm of TAFEP is on the cards and what discussions have taken place since August last year insofar as how TAFEP will be beefed up. The Workers' Party has a position about anti-discrimination legislation. Is that something that MOM will be prepared to look into?,8,671,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00671
2021-07-06-T-010,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Pritam Singh, for his question.",1,672,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00672
2021-07-06-T-010,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"We are reviewing our existing frameworks. The suggestion that he talked about, the position he had alluded to, in terms of legislation and all that, it is not something that has just come out from the Workers' Party. If you go back in terms of the past proceedings, I believe that quite a number of the Labour Members of Parliament, including Mr Patrick Tay and even non-Labour Members of Parliament, such as Mr Louis Ng, have also raised it at different times.",2,673,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00673
2021-07-06-T-010,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"The assurance that I want to give to the House – to everyone who has raised it and who is concerned about this – is to allow myself, together with the team, together with the tripartite partners, to go deep, look at all the different implications, look at also the various options that we have to see how we can strengthen it. As I have alluded to in my speech, Mr Pritam Singh, I think you will appreciate the fact that given where we are today, it is a very tight rope that we are navigating.",3,674,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00674
2021-07-06-T-010,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"On the one hand, we want to continue to strengthen, to tighten. On the other hand, businesses have the competing interest of asking us to be a bit more lax. One of the reassurances that our Ministry wants to give to Members of the House here is our consistent focus on – and we have never diverted our attention away from it – developing the Singaporean Core. We are fully cognisant of the angst, the fears, the worries about making sure that there is fair, there is equal opportunity in terms of capability development, capability transfer, fair hiring, promotions and so on and so forth. All those things, we will be reviewing in order for us to strengthen that framework.",4,675,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00675

2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I take to heart what the Leader of the Opposition has said, that with information, we can quell such falsehoods much earlier. We work in a bureaucracy. Some data is classified secret, confidential and so on. So, we are not at liberty to always disclose them. But what you say is true. Some information, it is better for it to come out early and then we can move on. Especially, as you said, when it concerns issues like racism or xenophobia, it is much better to quell it early.",2,679,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00679
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I take comfort that based on what you have said, I think you do agree that FTAs and CECA are fundamental to our survival. I hope you heard our explanation and are convinced that CECA's Chapter 9 does not allow an unfettered inflow of Indian professionals. If you disagree and I misrepresented you, please jump up and correct me. I do not think you will.",3,680,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00680
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The Deputy Prime Minister and myself are former trade negotiators, fighting in the trenches with our fellow teammates, which is why I think we both felt compelled to say something today.",4,681,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00681
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Negotiating an FTA requires a lot of dedication and hard work. It takes a toll on the family because you are out of the country all the time. Our negotiators are up against very formidable partners sometimes. Our job is to advance Singapore's interests while protecting our areas of sensitivities. But we work hard at it, nevertheless, because we know it makes a huge difference to Singapore. It benefits industries and companies, creates jobs for our people, secures our place in the world. This is where we are coming from.",5,682,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00682
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, I felt sad, somewhat, that PSP did not withdraw their allegations.",6,683,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00683
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"When we explained how an FTA works and how Chapter 9 works, it is a statement of fact. This is how it works. It is not a matter of your opinion or your perspective. The logical thing for PSP to do, I felt, is to withdraw their allegations. Then, we can discuss employment policies, how we can better protect, educate, train our workers. These are very legitimate questions.",7,684,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00684
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But PSP did not do the logical thing. I could not hear a definitive position from Mr Leong Mun Wai or Ms Hazel Poa. They waffled a bit and then I think what I heard was they cannot conclude either way now whether CECA is better or worse for our workers. But if you cannot conclude either way, then the honourable thing is to also withdraw the allegations while you figure out which way you want to lean. But I do not think what we saw was logical or honourable.",8,685,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00685
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"A successful FTA strategy is not just about negotiating skills. Those are important but, fundamentally, it requires us to be broad-minded and able to cast our sights far and wide to the whole world and work with like-minded partners out there.",9,686,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00686
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"That is why COVID-19 is such an existential crisis for us. It has forced us to close our borders. But I am confident that once we get the great majority of our population vaccinated and control the pandemic, we can re-open the borders progressively again.",10,687,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00687
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"What I am worried about is, even when our borders are re-opened, what about our hearts and our minds? Will they be re-opened?",11,688,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00688
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"If, because of COVID-19 or during the COVID-19 pandemic, anti-foreigner sentiments and xenophobia creep into our collective psyche, then even if our borders are open, our hearts and minds are not and will remain closed. Then, we will not recover from COVID-19. Then, we will truly have long COVID-19.",12,689,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00689
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Of all times, this is the worst time – in the middle of a crippling pandemic – to talk about turning inwards, to reject FTAs and to reject globalisation. I say we should emerge from COVID-19 announcing to the world that Singapore continues to be that shining jewel in Southeast Asia  the largest transshipment port in the world; the special Changi experience; the financial services hub and IT capital; a hub for manufacturing, hospitality, meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE), and so on.",13,690,2021-07-06-T-010-S-00690
2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Here, the world converges. You can experience the richness of many cultures and also the uniquely Singapore character.

2021-07-06-T-010,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Most importantly, we will be more united. We must be more united than ever. Every one of us know that because we all did our part – whether it is getting vaccinated, undergoing regular testing, observing safe management measures, helping others in need, taking care of patients – all of us did our part.

2021-07-06-T-012,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Speaker, it is encouraging for me to note that MSF will be expecting over 40,000 applications for Lasting Power of Attorney, or LPA, by the end of 2021. Given that one in 10 Singaporeans aged 60 and above have the chance of being diagnosed with dementia, and with the numbers expected to rise to 80,000 in 2030, I believe that the LPA should be widely promoted to all Singaporeans as it allows an individual to make an early choice of a proxy decision-maker whom they can trust. This reassures donors that their interest will be taken care of should they lose their mental capacity one day. Hence, I support the Mental Capacity (Amendment) Bill to facilitate more Singaporeans to apply for an LPA.",2,703,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00703
2021-07-06-T-012,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Although I agree that LPAs be done electronically, I am concerned that the seniors who are not tech-savvy will be discouraged to submit their applications. Although there are community touch points such as the Citizen Connect Centres (CCCs) and the Integrated Public Service Centre (IPSC) at Our Tampines Hub to provide assistance to seniors who are less comfortable with the use of digital services, I am still worried that not all seniors who are not tech-savvy will go to these places for help, especially those who are immobile.",3,704,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00704
2021-07-06-T-012,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Like my colleague Member of Parliament Mr Yip Hon Weng, I would like to suggest that MSF consider mobilising Silver Generation Ambassadors (SGAs) to promote and assist in the application of LPA. SGAs can do house visits, help to guide and assist seniors who are immobile in the application of LPA. This will benefit seniors who are not tech-savvy or immobile.",4,705,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00705

2021-07-06-T-012,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Since the inception of the LPA in 2014, slightly more than half of the donors are aged 60 years old and above. The focus on my speech will be on the concerns and needs of seniors who are intending to apply for the LPA. I would like to raise three considerations related to the amendment Bill.",7,708,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00708
2021-07-06-T-012,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Firstly, I join my fellow PAP parliamentarians in sharing the concern that by fully enabling LPA to be made electronically, the seniors who are not technologically savvy may be discouraged to submit their applications. Although MSF will be leveraging community touchpoints, such as the Citizen Connect Centres and the Integrated Public Service Centre at Our Tampines Hub, to provide assistance for seniors who are less comfortable with the use of digital services, there is a need to consider also seniors who have mobility issues and are not technologically comfortable.",8,709,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00709
2021-07-06-T-012,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"I would like to suggest for MSF to consider mobilising the Silver Generation Ambassadors (SGAs) to promote and assist in the application of LPA for this group of seniors. SGAs can help to guide and assist seniors who are immobile and cannot approach the Citizen Connect Centres by themselves in the application. In addition, special considerations can be made for seniors, who are immobile, to have the LPA Certificate Issuers (CIs) visit their homes together with the SGAs, to complete the LPA application, to give them the peace of mind. This would benefit seniors with mobility issues.",9,710,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00710
2021-07-06-T-012,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Secondly, under the newly proposed Office of the Public Guardian Online or OPGO process, donors and donees are not required to meet face-to-face to obtain a signature on the LPA Form. I am concerned that this may create an opportunity for vulnerable seniors to be targets of fraud by fraudulent donees who want to take advantage of them. Without the requirement for donors and donees to meet up, seniors might be unknowingly coaxed into creating an LPA appointment by fraudulent donees. Although donors are still required to meet with the Certificate Issuers (CIs) to ensure that the donor has the mental capacity to make the LPA and understands the effect of an LPA, without a third person witnessing the donees' identity, it can become challenging for the Certificate Issuers to act as a safeguard in preventing fraud from occurring.",10,711,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00711
2021-07-06-T-012,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"I would like to propose that MSF consider requiring at least one meeting, in person or virtually, between donors, donees and the Certificate Issuers, so that all parties would be aware of each other's identity and for the Certificate Issuers to provide timely feedback to the donors if they have grounds to suspect that the donees might be using fraud or undue pressure to induce the donors to make an LPA.",11,712,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00712
2021-07-06-T-012,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Finally, I would like to raise the concern about the protection of donors and donees should cyberattacks and cybersecurity breaches compromise the integrity of the e-LPA documents. In recent times, there have been several noteworthy cybersecurity breaches on some cloud computing providers. Should a security breach result in e-LPA documents being amended without the donors' or donees' knowledge, a transaction executed in good faith based on the LPA may result in a loss for the donors and/or liability for the donees.",12,713,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00713
2021-07-06-T-012,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"How would the parties be protected, especially when the transaction relates to the donors' personal welfare, property and affairs? Should the transaction that is in progress when the breach occurred be halted to determine if there has been any adversarial impact made to the LPA?",13,714,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00714
2021-07-06-T-012,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),The Bill introduces section 16A that affords protection of donees and others if the e-LPA has a relevant error. I would like to propose that the section should also be expanded to include relevant protections from liabilities of donors and donees as a result of cyberattacks and cybersecurity breaches. This would go some way to protect the interests of all parties.,14,715,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00715
2021-07-06-T-012,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Speaker, in my interactions with residents in Jalan Kayu, many come forward seeking help because they cannot make decisions for their family members who are suffering from dementia or other forms of mental health challenges, as their loved ones did not make an LPA when they still had the mental capacity to do so. These decisions can range from making simple bank transactions to applying for an HDB flat.",15,716,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00716
2021-07-06-T-012,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Therefore, it is important to appoint a reliable and trustworthy proxy decision-maker early, so that both the donor and their family members have peace of mind, knowing that their welfare and interests will be well taken care of when they become mentally incapacitated. Notwithstanding the considerations raised, I support the Bill.",16,717,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00717

2021-07-06-T-012,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"One of the main amendments is to set up the new Office of the Public Guardian Online (OPGO) electronic system. I agree that there are many benefits to be gained from the digitalisation of the processes for the Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA). In addition to greater convenience, the new system is more efficient and precious time can be saved with faster transactional time. As the OPGO system will be housed under the Government Commercial Cloud, I am sure that the system will be secured by the same standard of cybersecurity measures as for all other data and information held by the Government.",2,720,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00720

2021-07-06-T-012,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] I would like to ask the Ministry if the planned roadshows to boost public awareness of LPAs will be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Is there any possibility of bundling workshops on LPAs with the Singapore Digital Office's courses to improve our elderly's digital literacy, thereby killing two birds with one stone? For those with mobility problems and who do not know how to go online, will the Ministry assist them by sending a roving team to their homes to help them register LPAs, much like MOH roving vaccination team?",4,722,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00722
2021-07-06-T-012,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"(In English)  Next, I would like to share my concerns about the additional safeguards for donors. I am worried that such safeguards are not sufficient. How can we ensure that elderly, in particular, those who are less educated, will not be cheated? This is particularly a concern where the donors and donees are not related. Donees have control over the financial assets of the donor. If they siphon away such resources for themselves, ultimately, the other family members or the Government will have to pick up the tab or pay for the care of the donors.",5,723,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00723

2021-07-06-T-012,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),There is certainly no lack of predatory scammers looking to gain the trust of lonely elderly persons to take advantage of them. I appeal to the Ministry to consider implementing additional measures to screen potential donees for the protection of donors. Would the Ministry share with the House if it had checked with the Singapore Police Force (SPF) on the number of cases involving the defrauding of donors to date?,7,725,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00725

Instead of asking the aged home or caregiver to make an appointment to see the regular doctor for the sake of retrieving the medical record a few months later, would it not be much faster if the information can be shared between the Government restructured hospitals, including IMH, with OPG in a secured manner? This current process is time-consuming and does no service to the patient. For the case which I had handled, I prayed that my client was able to outlive the Court order. Therefore, would the Government restructured hospitals, IMH, MSF, MOH as well as OPG work out a new framework to expedite this process?

2021-07-06-T-012,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"I know of seniors who have 10, 15, 20 appointments with doctors each year. Almost all of these are attendances in person, although tele-consults are becoming more common.

2021-07-06-T-012,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"The general point is this  while the Bill seeks to make the LPA-making process as convenient as possible, ultimately, our attitudes towards an LPA, the importance that we attach to an LPA, must really move to a higher plane. An LPA should be as important as good health, because having an LPA is part of planning well and living well. And having an LPA is part of overall good health and well-being. And so, just like good health, we need LPA adoption in Singapore to be much more widespread.",16,744,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00744
2021-07-06-T-012,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Going forward, MSF expects a transaction volume of around 30,000 LPAs to be made a year, based on pre-COVID-19 trends. I think this is far too low a level of adoption. Thus, I would like to ask how is MSF planning to encourage much wider adoption of LPAs? How can we get many more to be aware of LPA, to be aware of mental capacity issues in the first instance, and how can we get many more to then recognise its due importance and actually take action to make an LPA?",17,745,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00745

2021-07-06-T-012,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"First, I would like to suggest that MSF partners with healthcare providers to open up a whole new frontier of LPA touchpoints in the community. I believe that every patient passing through the doors of our polyclinics should be screened for LPA coverage, and for those that are not covered, the correct care planning conversations should take place in the polyclinic, there and then.",19,747,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00747
2021-07-06-T-012,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),I believe the same screening should happen in our Specialist Outpatient Clinics and even the wards in public hospitals. The screening should take place in our day care and senior activity centres across the island.,20,748,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00748
2021-07-06-T-012,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"I think we ought to incorporate LPAs as part of standard health and care protocol for our seniors, going forward.

2021-07-06-T-012,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Second, I suggest that we leverage the Silver Generation Office to promote LPAs door-to-door, engage and spread the message door-to-door, just like how we did for COVID-19 vaccination. The need for inoculation against poor planning or no planning ought to be as important as the need for inoculation against disease.",22,750,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00750

2021-07-06-T-012,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"To conclude, in fact, we need seniors to adopt not just LPA, but also Advance Care Planning (ACP), make a Will and make a CPF Nomination, as part of a comprehensive plan to live well and eventually leave well, for the benefit of themselves and their loved ones. Every senior – an LPA, an ACP, a Will, a CPF Nomination. That should be our overarching goal, to ensure that all bases are covered for our seniors.

2021-07-06-T-012,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] MSF introduced the Mental Capacity (Amendment) Bill to digitise the process of making a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA). Hence, the time taken to register an LPA will be shortened from three weeks to an average of eight working days, which is about half the current time needed, and the LPA itself will become an electronic document. At the same time, the new process will not be at the expense of donor protection. This approach is not only in line with the Government's vision of digital transformation in the public sector, but will also bring greater convenience to members of the public who are interested to be a donor or a donee.",26,754,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00754
2021-07-06-T-012,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Some people, especially the elderly, are worried that they do not know how to use computers or online platforms. I am confident that the Government has provided sufficient service centres and resources within the community to help the public in need. Notwithstanding the details of the amendment Bill, I feel that the fundamental significance of the Bill lies in wider public awareness of LPA and its importance. In this respect, we still have a lot to do because too few Singaporeans have done an LPA.",27,755,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00755
2021-07-06-T-012,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Surveys have shown that even a large proportion of healthcare workers have not prepared for death-related matters, including making an LPA.

2021-07-06-T-012,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"In other words, making an LPA is a precaution. If we lose mental capacity, the donee will become somebody we can fall back on. ""If I were to lose mental capacity"" may not be a phrase that sounds very pleasant, but it should still be addressed while we can. In fact, the probability of getting dementia is not one in 10,000 but closer to one in 10 after the age of 60. Therefore, we should all have an LPA.",29,757,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00757

In actual fact, it is equally important, if not more important, for people of lesser means in our society. Take, for example, an elderly couple who only has each other to depend on, relying only on their retirement savings and their HDB asset. What happens if the husband suddenly becomes comatose as a result of a severe stroke? Will the wife be able to sell or rent out their HDB flat in order to raise funds for payment of her husband's hefty medical expenses? Can she withdraw monies out from her husband's fixed deposit account to purchase necessary medical equipment required now by her bedridden husband?",3,765,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00765

2021-07-06-T-012,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Lastly, I wish to seek clarification on the cost of registering the LPA. Presently, the $75 application fee waiver for LPA Form 1 for Singaporeans has been extended to 31 March 2023, so as to encourage more Singaporeans to plan ahead and apply for an LPA. This is actually the fourth extension granted by the OPG since its first extension in 2016 and we would often see an influx in take-up rates when the waiver deadline draws close; this would inevitably cause the OPG backend to be stretched in terms of manpower while processing these new LPAs. In light that the LPAs will now be digitalised, would the Ministry consider removing the registration fees for LPA Form 1 entirely? I believe this would further motivate fellow Singaporeans to apply and subscribe to LPA Form 1 soon.",26,788,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00788

2021-07-06-T-012,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the plans to digitalise and simplify the procedures for the Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA). However, digital systems, records and transactions have vulnerabilities as they require electricity and Internet access. I am worried about eventualities such as power outages, system malfunctions and cyberattacks. Would the Ministry share in greater detail what measures are in place to mitigate such risks and what back-up plans are in place? Do we have foolproof back-up for all information in the databases?",1,790,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00790
2021-07-06-T-012,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"The other issue is the possibility of disputes when LPAs have been changed, particularly just before the donors lose their mental capacity. In some cases, relationships among donors, donees and family members may be complicated and even acrimonious. Is there any simplified processes in place to bring about expeditious resolution for such cases?",2,791,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00791

Can some sort of insurance be arranged to protect donors? On the other hand, donees also face risks of legal suits and, hence, can they protect themselves with a form of professional indemnity insurance? I support the Bill.",3,792,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00792
2021-07-06-T-012,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I welcome the amendments and support the Bill. An electronic transaction system will allow for faster and more secure registration for donors' benefit. This will also reduce the possibility of errors. However, I would like to introduce several proposals, to further safeguard the interests of all parties involved and, at the same time, to protect the reputation and integrity of the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) and Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) system. I am speaking from my own experiences as a pro bono lawyer helping laypersons make and file their LPAs.",1,793,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00793
2021-07-06-T-012,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Firstly, on protection for donors. Currently, donees make an online declaration not equivalent to a Statutory Declaration, before submitting information to third parties. I would like to ask whether it is necessary for the donees to produce medical reports which certify that donors have lost their mental capacities first before they can exercise powers under the LPAs? If the medical report is not mandatory, I would like to propose to make it a requirement for donees to inform OPG and produce medical reports which certify that the donors have lost their mental capacities before the donees exercise the powers under the LPAs.",2,794,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00794
2021-07-06-T-012,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Bodies like the Association of Banks Singapore and Council for Estate Agencies already require donees to first produce medical reports, which show that the donor has lost his or her mental capacity. This is a requirement before he or she can exercise the powers under the LPA. Alternatively, the donee can be required to submit a Statutory Declaration to confirm that the donor has been certified by a doctor to lack mental capacity. Perhaps, it is useful to have such a general requirement and to make it mandatory for banks and real estate firms, who handle LPA-related transactions, to keep OPG or their regulators informed once a request to exercise LPA is made by a donee.",3,795,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00795
2021-07-06-T-012,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Secondly, on protection for certificate issuers. I agree with MSF's retention of requirement for a donor to visit the LPA Certificate Issuer (CI) in person because this will ensure the donor understands the scope and purpose of the LPA. However, I think it is equally important that the CI meets the donee as well.",4,796,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00796
2021-07-06-T-012,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I would like to propose to make it a requirement for the CI to meet the donee, to ascertain if the donee himself or herself is a person who has mental capacity to carry out the said powers on behalf of the donor. Furthermore, by having the CI meet the donee, this will also help the CI to flag to OPG if the donee already is a donee on other LPAs.",5,797,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00797
2021-07-06-T-012,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I agree with and understand MSF's reasoning to protect confidentiality and only disclose the number of LPAs on which the donee has been appointed, and that the choice is, ultimately, up to the donor. However, the capability and adequacy of the donee in exercising such powers may be limited if he or she is to administer various matters on behalf of several donors who have lost their mental capacity at the same time.",6,798,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00798
2021-07-06-T-012,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Surely, there is a limit to human abilities and dedication of time. It would, thus, be useful to consider a requirement for the CI to highlight to OPG when facing donees who are multiple donees. OPG can then subsequently follow up and advise the donor that the chosen donee is a multiple donee, and if they want, they can make his or her informed choice. In this regard, perhaps, it would be useful to consider a limit on the maximum number of LPAs on which someone can be appointed as a donee.",7,799,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00799
2021-07-06-T-012,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Another aspect to look out for is the relationship between the donor and the donee or the lack of one. Having donees who are non-family members, or who are no longer directly related by virtue of a divorce or a re-marriage, may give rise to potential misunderstandings or conflicts in the future. In this regard, it would be useful to consider requiring CIs to meet potential donees in person too and not just the donors. Not only can the CIs ascertain the mental capacity of the donees but they can also raise the red flag to OPG if the donee to be appointed is a non-family member or if there is anything amiss.",8,800,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00800
2021-07-06-T-012,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"It would also be useful if OPG is updated when there has been a change in the relationship between the donor and the donee. In this regard, may I ask if there is a database or system for OPG to be updated once the donee on an LPA ceases to be a family member, by virtue of divorce or has predeceased the donor?",9,801,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00801
2021-07-06-T-012,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"In conclusion, Mdm Deputy Speaker, notwithstanding the clarifications, I support this Bill as it is a step in the right direction to greater access and protection for donors.",10,802,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00802

2021-07-06-T-012,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Madam, the LPA is an important legal instrument that safeguards the interests of those who lose their mental capacity.

2021-07-06-T-012,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"According to data from the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG), the number of LPAs registered has been on an upward trend. In 2016, there were only about 8,000 LPAs registered. But in just the first three months of 2021, we have seen over 9,000 LPAs registered and MSF expects more than 40,000 LPAs to be registered by the end of this year. The proposed amendments in the Bill are, therefore, timely as an online system will allow the Ministry to cater to a higher volume of LPA applications.",3,805,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00805
2021-07-06-T-012,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"While it is encouraging to seeing an increasing number of LPA applications in recent years, we need to be aware that those who have registered as a doner remains a very small minority in our society and more must be done to address the stigma that comes associated with conversations about LPA.",4,806,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00806
2021-07-06-T-012,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"It is common to hear our loved ones, especially our parents and grandparents, dismiss discussions about registering an LPA with words like ""touch wood"", or more colloquially, ""choy!"" and, unfortunately, the conversation does not progress past this stage. Amongst the young, many simply think that this is something for our seniors to do. Can the Ministry provide a demographic breakdown of applicants that have become donors in the past five years and share its plans to destigmatise the topic of LPA and encourage adoption especially among our seniors?",5,807,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00807
2021-07-06-T-012,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the shift to digitalise LPA applications means that we need to put in place robust safeguards to prevent fraudulent applications. Under the Bill, the electronic copy of a registered LPA will be treated as free from error if individuals do not notify the OPG of any rectification within 90 days. I am particularly concerned about this. How would someone know that someone else has impersonated them either as a donor or a donee? How will OPG know if fraud or undue pressure was used to induce a donor to make an LPA or appoint a particular person to be their donee?",6,808,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00808
2021-07-06-T-012,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),I would also like to ask if there had been instances of a donee being appointed by multiple donors and whether this would be a key factor in determining fraudulent digital LPA applications.,7,809,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00809
2021-07-06-T-012,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Lastly, I would like to echo what several Members have raised yesterday and today, about the importance of ensuring that digital LPA applications remain accessible to the less tech-savvy, particularly our seniors. While I am glad to hear that MSF plans to leverage community touchpoints like the Citizen Connect Centres at our Community Centres, to aid those who need help, I believe that more can be done to assist our seniors at the hubs that they frequent.",8,810,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00810

Let me clarify that clause 9 is intended to cover errors arising from the conversion of the hard copy LPA into the electronic LPAs, not errors within the hard copy LPAs. I note Miss Cheryl Chan and Mr Louis Ng's concern on whether transactions may rely on hard copy LPAs containing errors and would like to assure that these errors, such as repeated page numbers, are highly unlikely. OPG has checked through all scanned copies of existing registered LPAs to minimise any risk of errors.",12,825,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00825
2021-07-06-T-012,Eric Chua,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Eric Chua),"As to whether the electronic copies will supersede the hard copy LPAs, the hard copy LPA will no longer be treated by the law as the LPA after the electronic copy is treated by the operation of law as such. Therefore, while donees and third parties are not prevented from referencing the hard copy LPAs, the superseded hard copy LPA should not be relied upon for transactions. This is because any note on the occurrence of certain important events will only be attached to the electronic LPA henceforth. Such events include the donee's bankruptcy, which would revoke his power to manage the donor's financial matters. As such, I strongly encourage all parties to rely on the electronic copy when transacting.",13,826,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00826

I wish to clarify that the UK's service does not allow for the online registration of electronic LPAs. The LPA must still be printed and signed using wet ink signatures before submitting it to the UK OPG. What the UK's online service allows is the conversion of the hard copy registered LPAs into online summaries of the LPAs that can be shared with transacting parties.,26,839,2021-07-06-T-012-S-00839

With more than 95% of donees being trusted family members who are chosen by donors themselves, we agree with Ms Sylvia Lim that multiple doneeships are not uncommon. For instance, a daughter may be appointed as donee for her father, mother and husband.

The RG will exercise this power if the responsible persons for a child fail to furnish the birth particulars for birth registration, and where attempts to contact the responsible persons are futile. In registering such a birth, the RG will give the child an appropriate name.

This is important because the reporting and registration of births and deaths is not just a bureaucratic process of record-keeping. But the registration of a birth and death can have far-reaching legal and social implications for the individuals.",1,948,2021-07-06-T-013-S-00948
2021-07-06-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I have three points to make on the registration of births.,2,949,2021-07-06-T-013-S-00949
2021-07-06-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My first point is on births with insufficient particulars. Under the new section 9(2), the Registrar-General may register a child’s birth based on incomplete particulars if the birth is capable of being registered on the basis of the incomplete particulars. Under section 9(3), the Registrar-General may also register a birth without a name for the child.",3,950,2021-07-06-T-013-S-00950
2021-07-06-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In such cases, a responsible person for the child must apply to register a name of the child within seven years of the birth. However, seven years is a very long time for a child not to have a registered name. Will MHA consider shortening this timeframe?",4,951,2021-07-06-T-013-S-00951
2021-07-06-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The Registrar-General has broad powers to obtain information under the new section 42(1). While the Bill places obligations on responsible persons for the registration of births, can the Minister clarify whether the Registrar-General or ICA will take a proactive approach in following up with the responsible persons in such cases of incomplete particulars or missing names? Taking a proactive approach where the responsible persons are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations is important as proper registration may have implications on the child who does not have any power over the registration process.",5,952,2021-07-06-T-013-S-00952
2021-07-06-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My second point is on the support to children who are stateless by being born in Singapore to non-citizen parents who did not or could not obtain citizenship for their children from their home countries.,6,953,2021-07-06-T-013-S-00953
2021-07-06-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Minister Shanmugam shared in February this year that as of 30 November 2020, there were 1,109 stateless people living in Singapore. Of this number, about three-quarters are Singapore Permanent Residents, or PRs.",7,954,2021-07-06-T-013-S-00954
2021-07-06-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I understand that ICA evaluates every application for PR or citizenship on a range of criteria and the applicant's circumstances. Can the Minister share if ICA informs other Ministries, in particular, MSF, of children registered at birth as stateless to ensure that these children do not fall through the gaps in social and educational support?",8,955,2021-07-06-T-013-S-00955
2021-07-06-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I appreciate that citizenship has to be granted based on careful assessment of a range of factors. I also appreciate that some degree of social and educational support is already extended to stateless children with PR status. However, stateless children and their families have to jump through additional bureaucratic hoops in order to obtain social and educational support.",9,956,2021-07-06-T-013-S-00956
2021-07-06-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Even where citizenship cannot be immediately granted, can the ICA work together with other Ministries to make it easier for stateless children to obtain the necessary support, or even to proactively reach out to this group of who may be more vulnerable without the guarantees and protections of citizenship?",10,957,2021-07-06-T-013-S-00957
2021-07-06-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My third point is about children born to single unwed mothers. These are children who do not have a father named on their birth certificate or who have a father named on the birth certificate who is not married to the mother.,11,958,2021-07-06-T-013-S-00958
2021-07-06-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In November 2018, MSF shared that the median incomes of single unwed parents below 35 years old was in the range of $500 to $700 from the years of 2013 to 2017.",12,959,2021-07-06-T-013-S-00959
2021-07-06-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Can the Minister share whether ICA informs MSF when a birth is registered without a father or with a father who is not married to the mother, so that appropriate support, where needed, can be offered to these mothers right from the start?",13,960,2021-07-06-T-013-S-00960
2021-07-06-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"For instance, ECDA works with the Social Service Offices, Family Service Centres and hospitals to reach out to pregnant mothers and families who can benefit from KidSTART.

2021-07-06-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Can the Minister share if there is a system of informing MSF of all children who are, again, born to single unwed mothers, whether in hospitals or otherwise, so that MSF can look into extending the necessary support to these families?

2021-07-06-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the new Registration of Births and Deaths Bill is an improved framework that overhauls and streamlines the registration of the two events that bookend every human life as it were  births and deaths. It provides clear rules on who holds the responsibility to report to the Government in the event of birth or death under a wide range of foreseeable scenarios. While I support the Bill, I have a few clarifications to seek.",1,968,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00968
2021-07-06-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, in respect of birth registrations, I would like to confirm that double-barrelled surnames are allowed and provided for under the Bill and its processes. In the current Registration of Births and Deaths Act, section 10 provides guidance on how a child's surname is given although there is no explicit reference to double-barrelled surnames. Currently, parents are able to register their child with a double-barrelled surname if they choose to do so. However, under the Bill, there is no longer any reference to surname. Could the Minister give us some guidance to the kinds of surnames that would be permissible for the child?",2,969,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00969
2021-07-06-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Secondly, I would like to speak on double-barrelled race designations. With inter-ethnic marriages going up from 18.4% of all marriages in 2009 to 22.9% in 2019, it is important for children of such unions to have the opportunity to grow up with an appreciation of their mixed parentage, if their parents choose to signify that by choosing double-barrelled race classifications for their children. As a parent of children of mixed ethnicity myself, I am particularly conscious of this.",3,970,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00970
2021-07-06-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In 2011, ICA implemented the registration of double-barrelled race options for Singaporean children born to parents of different ethnic groups. By this new option, if one parent is Chinese and the other is Indian, the child's race may be recorded as Chinese, or Indian, or Chinese-Indian, or Indian-Chinese, for example.",4,971,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00971
2021-07-06-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In this respect, I wonder if the Registry of Births and Deaths is able to provide some indication of trends, in similar fashion to what is reported on marriages, on the proportion of births to parents of different ethnicities. Amongst them, what is the proportion of children who have been assigned double-barrelled race by their parents? I note that in the first two months of 2011, the parents of one in five newborn babies of mixed parentage chose the double-barrelled race option based on data that the Government released back then.",5,972,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00972
2021-07-06-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),I also wonder if the Ministry would consider streamlining the process by which parents of mixed ethnicity can apply to change the racial classification on their child's NRIC to a double-barrelled racial classification in cases where the child was registered at birth as bearing solely one ethnicity as they would have had to be prior to 2011.,6,973,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00973
2021-07-06-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Anecdotally, it would appear that both parents need to visit ICA for a physical interview in order to effect this change. Could the parents be enabled to provide their consent digitally or via a virtual meeting, for example?",7,974,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00974
2021-07-06-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Furthermore, the Chinese-Indian example given by ICA in their website falls within the Chinese, Malay, Indian and Others (CMIO) framework. Is it also possible to assign double-barrelled race classifications to a child in Singapore that is outside the CMIO framework, for example, Chinese-Burmese or Korean-Vietnamese? Like surnames, there appear to be no explicit rules in respect of designation of race of the child in the Bill.",8,975,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00975
2021-07-06-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, ICA states in their website that it currently includes the option for parents to include ethnic characters of the child's name in Chinese, Jawi or Tamil. Given the increasing ethnic diversity in our demographic make-up, will the ICA also be open to requests for other ethnic characters as well? Moreover, if the child is of mixed ethnicity, will they also be given the option to have their name spelled out in two sets of ethnic characters?",9,976,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00976
2021-07-06-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, from the subject of births, I shall now move to the subject of deaths, as, in reality, we all eventually do in life.",10,977,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00977
2021-07-06-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I understand that obtaining the death certificate is essential for identification and authentication purposes before some funeral services can be provided for the deceased. At present, the next-of-kin would have to express the preferred mode of disposal, cremation or burial when they register the death. The next-of-kin would then receive a permit to bury or cremate contained in the death certificate. Based on that, a funeral director would then be able to proceed to book slots for cremation or burial. A death certificate may also be required to engage your funeral director in order for services, such as the embalming of bodies and the use of funeral parlour compounds, to be performed.",11,978,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00978
2021-07-06-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Would the Bill possibly inadvertently bring about delays in the funeral arrangements in some cases, especially if the death occurs at home and the medical practitioner would need to return to his or her office to register the death electronically – and he or she could possibly be delayed in performing that action by the need to attend to other medical cases, for example? There is a 24-hour time restriction for medical practitioners to report a death but when making funeral arrangements, a matter of hours can cause inconvenience and emotional distress. I would like to ask the Ministry how this issue would be managed.",12,979,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00979
2021-07-06-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"On a separate but not unrelated note, I would like to ask if funeral service providers were consulted in the course of formulating this Bill.",13,980,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00980
2021-07-06-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to clarify how relatives, who are not digitally-savvy, would be able to receive the death certificate once it has issued.",14,981,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00981
2021-07-06-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Relatives need this death certificate in order to commence funeral preparations and in their state of grief, they may be anxious to obtain it as soon as possible. I understand that the new system allows for the process to be performed online and a digital notification will be sent to the relative to download the digital death certificate from the Government's online portal when it is ready.",15,982,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00982
2021-07-06-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"However, there may be cases – admittedly, perhaps, not too many – when none of the relatives of the deceased who are planning the funeral are IT literate. Would provisions be made in such cases to enable the relatives to collect a physical copy of the death certificate at a location that is nearby? Alternatively, will the relatives be able to enlist the help of a funeral director, for example, to access the digital death certificate on their behalf if they give their consent?",16,983,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00983
2021-07-06-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In conclusion, under this Bill, I also note that there is no longer a need to surrender the deceased person's identification card for invalidation. However, the Bill highlights that the family should destroy the identification card to prevent abuse.",17,984,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00984
2021-07-06-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Based from feedback from the funeral service industry, funeral directors often come to possess the NRIC of the deceased person. Some funeral service providers may accumulate many such NRICs over time. This creates the potential for criminal use to be made of these cards if they fall into the wrong hands.",18,985,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00985
2021-07-06-T-015,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In view of this, will the Government consider requiring all funeral service providers and any unrelated persons in possession of physical NRICs of deceased persons to destroy those cards?",19,986,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00986

2021-07-06-T-015,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Being born in our country does not mean that the babies will automatically acquire citizenship.

2021-07-06-T-015,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, coming on the heels of the recent publication of Census 2020, it is important for relevant Government agencies to be updated and have accurate records such as the registration of both births and deaths in Singapore. These records assist in ensuring that our population data is accurate and allows us to use this information to plan and enact policies to respond to the needs of our population.",1,993,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00993
2021-07-06-T-015,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"That said, I wish to seek some clarifications from the Minister of State for Home Affairs on certain provisions of this Bill in four areas.",2,994,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00994
2021-07-06-T-015,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"One, the present Bill seeks to streamline and digitise the death registration process. The new process requires a medical practitioner to certify and submit the death of a person online following which the death certificate is issued digitally. I also understand that the doctor or hospital can assist in printing the certificate for families who have difficulties accessing the digital certificates. Could the Minister of State clarify if this new process will result in increased fees compared to the current process since, for example, the doctor will now have to print the certificate or is it envisaged for it to be without charge?",3,995,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00995
2021-07-06-T-015,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Two, I also note that according to the Second Schedule in the current Registration of Births and Deaths Rules, there is a listing of fees such as persons are required to pay a $40 fee for certified extract of birth or death from the register in Forms L and M respectively. May I also clarify with the Minister of State if there will be similar fees if families at a later stage want to get a digital extract?",4,996,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00996
2021-07-06-T-015,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Third, the Bill also requires in some cases under clause 22(2)(d) the duty for reporting of a death to fall on persons that may not be at all related or associated to the deceased, therefore, there is this undue burden, failing which the person will be considered guilty of an offence and fined up to $1,500 and/or imprisonment of up to a month. The Minister of State had earlier mentioned about unnatural death briefly. So, for the clarity of the public, can the Minister of State clarify if, for example, a person on a morning jog finds a dead body and calls the Police, would the person still be liable to report the death to a medical practitioner under this section? Will alerting the death to the authorities suffice to discharge such a person from the duties the Bill now appears to place on that person?",5,997,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00997
2021-07-06-T-015,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"And four, I have come across a resident whose parents passed away overseas and have not been able to get the death certificate even after he claimed the relevant agencies had assisted him to contact their counterparts in the foreign country. The body was not brought back to Singapore and he, therefore, is unable to bring closure to their estate matters after many years.",6,998,2021-07-06-T-015-S-00998

This is, perhaps, due to COVID-19 restrictions and also because new flats are less sizeable and have space limitations, making it difficult for the deceased person’s family to make funeral arrangements and perform funeral prayers in their own home. Therefore, mosques have been helping to make between eight and 10 funeral arrangements daily. With Singapore’s ageing population, this may increase in the future.",5,1005,2021-07-06-T-015-S-01005

2021-07-06-T-015,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Allow me to give one example. I was informed about a case last year that happened at the Pusara Aman Mosque. In the hustle and bustle of funeral arrangements, an error occurred in one of the death registrations, where the signature and reference number columns were not filled in by the agency and the family of the deceased person. Due to that, the burial could not proceed on the same day until the certificate was corrected. The Police and family of the deceased person eventually re-registered the death and obtained a new certificate. However, by the time the process was completed, it was too late in the day and the burial could only take place the next day.",7,1007,2021-07-06-T-015-S-01007

2021-07-06-T-015,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"(In English)  Notwithstanding my support for the Bill, I would like to seek some clarifications. On the registration of deaths, I have four clarifications.",10,1010,2021-07-06-T-015-S-01010
2021-07-06-T-015,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Firstly, I share the same concerns raised by hon Member Mr Derrick Goh on costs. Would there be any safeguards against extra charges or costs to be borne since doctors are now not only certifying deaths, but they are also helping to submit the certification online?",11,1011,2021-07-06-T-015-S-01011
2021-07-06-T-015,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Secondly, on categories of responsible persons to report the death under section 22, would the definition of an occupier also extend to persons who have the power or access to such premises, for example, landlords or warehouse owners?",12,1012,2021-07-06-T-015-S-01012
2021-07-06-T-015,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Thirdly, in cases where there is more than one responsible person, section 22(4) discharges responsibility of every other responsible persons by the compliance of just one responsible person, even if there was an earlier opportunity to report by that other person. Would it be useful for ICA to still retain some powers to investigate non-reporting offences in cases where there are more than one responsible person who can report? For example, take the case if person A could have made the report earlier in time but deliberately did not do so and, subsequently, person B reported the death. By section 22(4), person A would have been absolved from liability, notwithstanding that his deliberate omission goes against the mandatory requirement of reporting ""as soon as practicable after the death"" and the intent of the Bill to promote expeditious reporting.",13,1013,2021-07-06-T-015-S-01013
2021-07-06-T-015,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"On the registration of births, I welcome the amendments to make it mandatory for all births to be reported. Currently, all hospital births, or children brought to the hospital within 24 hours of being born, are reported but it is not mandatory for births outside of hospitals to be reported to the authorities. Now, almost anyone, including parents or a proxy on behalf of the parents, can provide the child's birth particulars to ICA for registration within 42 days from the date of birth. I have two clarifications in this regard.",14,1014,2021-07-06-T-015-S-01014
2021-07-06-T-015,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Firstly, I seek the same clarifications I sought before on the categories of responsible persons to report deaths here. Similarly, for the reporting of births.",15,1015,2021-07-06-T-015-S-01015
2021-07-06-T-015,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Secondly, I have compared section 7(2)(e) on the reporting of births in any other places with section 22(2)(d) on reporting of deaths in any other places. For reporting of births in any other places, the responsibility falls squarely on the parents only. However, for reporting of deaths in any other places, the responsibility falls on, inter alia, every relative of the deceased person who knows of the death. What is MHA’s rationale for this distinction? Can MHA also consider placing the obligation of reporting of birth on a relative of the parents who knows or have knowledge of such birth? This will be useful in situations where the parents themselves breach such registration requirements and where the birth did not occur in the premises which are occupied by relatives.",16,1016,2021-07-06-T-015-S-01016
2021-07-06-T-015,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"My last clarification is a general one on ICA's own resourcing. Under the new rules, ICA officers would take over investigation of offences relating to the registration of births and deaths. Would ICA be forming a new department in this regard? If not, under which department would such investigations fall under?",17,1017,2021-07-06-T-015-S-01017
2021-07-06-T-015,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"In conclusion, Mr Speaker, I support this Bill as it provides greater ease of death registrations and it is a step in the right direction to mandate registration of births.",18,1018,2021-07-06-T-015-S-01018

The issuance of digital extracts for births, deaths and stillbirths that are registered before the new Act comes into force will be introduced in a later phase. Regardless of the format of the extract, there is still a need to recover the costs for providing this service. ICA is reviewing the fee amount.

2021-07-06-T-015,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"The situations surrounding births and deaths are different. For a newborn child, the parents are the responsible persons who will need to care for the child. Hence, they are legally required to report the birth. Under the current Act, ICA occasionally encounters birth registrations by persons other than the parents, such as a relative of the child. While ICA will continue to accept reports of births from relatives who are aware of the births, we do not want to burden the relatives with the legal obligation to report or be penalised for failing to report the birth.

For a reportable death, the jogger is obligated under section 5 of the Coroners Act to report it to a Police officer as soon as possible. As the death is not under the scope of clause 22 of the Bill, the jogger does not need to report the death to a medical practitioner.",13,1032,2021-07-06-T-015-S-01032

Under clause 22(4), as long as a responsible person reports a death, the duty of every other responsible person is discharged. This is because once a report has been made and a medical practitioner is alerted to the death, the purpose of the reporting requirement is met. However, if no responsible person reports the death, all responsible persons, who do not have a reasonable excuse, shall be guilty of the offence of failing to report the death. This provides sufficient deterrence against the failure to report a death while achieving the aim of ensuring that each death is reported by at least one responsible person.",14,1033,2021-07-06-T-015-S-01033

In the past five years, the Police received an average of about 1,700 missing persons reports per year. The next-of-kin of a missing person who wishes to have the missing person presumed by law to be dead will need to apply to the Court for the necessary order. This process is governed by the Evidence Act and will remain so. Once the next-of-kin obtains the Court order, they can inform ICA to update the person's status in its system. This information will be shared with other agencies to facilitate other post-death matters. ICA will also issue a letter of acknowledgement to the next-of-kin when they report the presumption of death to ICA.

In 2020, 72 births were not registered within 42 days. This makes up less than 0.2% of total births in Singapore. Out of these 72 births, most parents do come forward to register the births after reminders from ICA. Due to ICA's efforts to trace the parents, the number of cases of parents who fail to register their child's birth is very low.

The answer is yes. All births in Singapore have to be reported and registered, regardless of the nationalities of the child's parents. However, the policy remains that a birth that is registered in Singapore does not automatically confer Singapore Citizenship on the child. In the past three years, about 17% of total births in Singapore are those of children born to parents who are both foreigners and, therefore, do not qualify for Singapore Citizenship by birth. There is also a small number of children born to at least one Singaporean parent but are not granted Singapore Citizenship for reasons such as the parents not being legally married at the time of the child's birth. In 2020, such births make up less than 0.15% of total births in Singapore.",21,1040,2021-07-06-T-015-S-01040

2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Mr Speaker, almost every young woman I have spoken to have been a victim of sexual assault or violence at some point in their lives. Personally, I have experienced men rubbing themselves on me in public trains. Even today, as a Member of Parliament, I regularly get sent inappropriate comments, messages and even lewd photographs.",1,1065,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01065
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"From 2017 to 2019, there were 7,483 victims of sexual assault. To break it down, that is an average of six a day. Half of these victims were 20 years old or younger.",2,1066,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01066
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),These numbers should scare us as we know that the vast majority of sexual assault cases go unreported and that the trauma of sexual assault can last a person for a lifetime. Sexual assault and the sexism that enables it is an epidemic that hurts women and children more than any others.,3,1067,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01067
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"We need to stamp it out in our public spaces, our workplaces, our schools and our homes. So, what should we do? We need to start at the basics with education.",4,1068,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01068
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"While the Government has introduced stiffer penalties for sexual offenders, criminal deterrence is not a silver bullet for this issue. We must get to the root of the problem by building a strong culture of consent in our society. Without a strong consent culture, the criminal justice system alone cannot protect us – women, men and children – from sexual harassment and violence.",5,1069,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01069
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"We know that victims often do not report sexual crimes committed against them because they are afraid they will not be believed, do not wish to re-live the trauma or because they simply do not have enough evidence. Recently, an AWARE Ipsos survey conducted in November last year found that only three in 10 survivors of workplace sexual harassment made official reports about their experiences.",6,1070,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01070
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Today, I will focus on the importance of reviewing our sexuality education curriculum. But before I continue with that, I would also like to point out that consent education is equally important for the rest of us – for victims to know that what has happened to them is wrong and that they deserve justice, for bystanders to identify and intervene in risky situations, and for would-be offenders to understand that what they have done is wrong.",7,1071,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01071
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Looking at the state of sexuality education in Singapore, we need to ask two very important questions  who gets access to sexuality education and how sexuality education is taught?",8,1072,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01072
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Official statistics from 2017 to 2019 showed that 37% of sexual assault victims were underage. This number is likely to be much higher in reality as many boys and girls may not be aware that they are even victims of sexual assault, much less what they can do about it.",9,1073,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01073
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Nearly nine out of 10 sexual assault cases involving minors are committed by someone they trust. And of the tiny fraction of kids who do bravely come forward and seek help, approximately 90% of them are dismissed. Perpetrators are, at times, people they trust and incidents of sexual assault are often dismissed as accidents or even displays of affection.",10,1074,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01074
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),Who then can children turn to when they face these horrors?,11,1075,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01075
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Moreover, we know that early childhood sexual abuse makes people far more likely to be sexually victimised again and many survivors struggle with depression, anxiety and forming healthy, loving relationships later in life.",12,1076,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01076
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"For these reasons, mandatory sexuality education should be extended to young children, one of our most vulnerable groups.",13,1077,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01077
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"While our frontline care-givers must be more proactive in weeding out potential abuse, our children must be taught to recognise the wrongs being done to them. There are four things that we need to teach our children and these include  (a) body safety; (b) when a touch is good or bad; (c) what secrets should be shared with a trusted adult; and (d) how they can get help.",14,1078,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01078
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Some might feel uncomfortable when introducing the concept of sex to pre-schoolers. As a mother of young children, I share their concerns about making sure that our children are not exposed to sexualised content.",15,1079,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01079
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"But sexuality education is not just about sex. It is about teaching the concepts of normal relationships, boundaries and respect for one another's feelings and bodies. These concepts can be taught in age-appropriate ways. In fact, the Singapore Children's Society does this with their KidzLive booklet, which teaches children sexuality education with a focus on safety, facts and common sense.",16,1080,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01080
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"In Singapore, mandatory sexuality education only starts at Primary 5 with the Growing Years Programme. Whether nationally mandated sexuality education is introduced before then is unclear.",17,1081,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01081
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"In contrast, New Zealand's personal safety programmes start sexuality education for children across the nation at age five. International best practices such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) technical guidance recommends the same.",18,1082,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01082
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"It is clear that hundreds of minors are hurt by sexual abuse each year. The trauma of sexual violence finds many young victims far too early. If we wait too long to teach our young children about consent, respect and what to do if they ever face sexual assault, we are failing them as the adults they trust. Let us start to do right by our children by creating a standardised sexuality education curriculum for all pre-school operators.",19,1083,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01083
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Now, let us consider what we teach our youths and what is missing in our existing sexuality education curriculum.",20,1084,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01084
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"First, our sexuality education needs to focus on consent. Consent is key in responsible sexual behaviour. An Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) and Ngee Ann Polytechnic survey conducted last year showed that more than half of students surveyed said that they were not taught consent in schools even though all wanted to be taught.",21,1085,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01085
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),It is not enough to simply teach that sex without consent is wrong. Consent is complex and our students must know why it is important and how to navigate it respectfully.,22,1086,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01086
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"When surveyed, our youths expressed trouble identifying consent in situations involving alcohol abuse and conditional consent. Rape myths like how women who drink deserve it or silence means consent worsen this problem. Effective sexuality education must tackle these problems head on.",23,1087,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01087
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),Neither the current Growing Years' sexuality education curriculum nor the eTeens programme get to the root of the problem. Our students need to be taught why consent is key and how people cannot fully give consent in certain scenarios. It is commendable that some tertiary institutions now teach consent explicitly but this must start earlier on in life.,24,1088,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01088
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Teaching consent also means teaching the differences in power and the abuse of trust and authority. Studies show strong evidence that when sexuality emphasises critical thinking about power and gender, it results in far better outcomes such as reducing unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates.",25,1089,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01089
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"With the Internet and social media, sexual violence is amplified. If we do not educate our young early in school, where their knowledge of sex comes from a trusted and vetted resource, they will learn their lessons from the Internet, where pornography and other irresponsible or unrealistic depictions of sex are easily accessible.",26,1090,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01090
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"This puts them at risk of developing unhealthy relationships to sex. This may lead them to disregard consent and engage in unacceptable behaviours such as catcalling, harassment at work and even filming other students in toilets. These harms, which are so casually inflicted and systemic, must stop. Tech-enabled offences such as cyberbullying, sharing personal information, taking and distributing obscene photographs, and even voting in polls that sexualise women are wrong and deeply harmful.",27,1091,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01091
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Social media and the Internet have made platforms like the Nasi Lemak Telegram chat, the recent poll on our asatizahs and forums with obscene material much more accessible today. Our current sexuality education curriculum talks about the moral and legal consequences of risky sexual behaviours in a single class in Secondary 1. This is hardly enough. We need to teach our youths that their actions have far larger repercussions than just legal. We could do this by emphasising real-world conditions that encourage empathy and situational awareness.",28,1092,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01092
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"They need to learn, to understand the suffering caused to victims and also to speak out and seek help when a peer or an adult perpetuates these harms.",29,1093,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01093
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Secondly, our sexuality education needs to be more sustained and openly taught. Today, Singapore is facing a long overdue reckoning with a scale of sexual harm and trauma that happens in this country. Yet, when we break down how much classroom time is spent on sexuality education, we find that students get just 25 hours of class time on it. That is equivalent to a week of school in a total of 12 years of formal education.",30,1094,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01094
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Given the lasting harm that sexual crimes cause, we cannot rely on just the law to protect our youths. Our sexuality education needs to equip our youths with the knowledge and tools they need to respect one another, protect themselves and support the people around them, a lifelong journey where schools are key.",31,1095,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01095
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"In addition to extended classroom time, we can put up posters in schools that reinforce key messages like the importance of consent, one's rights under the law, warnings to would-be perpetrators and reminders that resources and channels for safe and medical help are always there for them.",32,1096,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01096
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Students also need dedicated spaces, channels and access to educators who support students through relationships, emotions and even abuse. These spaces should be non-judgemental and confidential so that our children and youth are willing to talk about their struggles.",33,1097,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01097
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Although there are not any systemic studies about sexuality education's effectiveness in Singapore, surveys show that some find our current sexuality education programme unrelatable.",34,1098,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01098
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Our students want teachers to facilitate questions and conversations about sex in a non-judgemental space. They need regular open discussions in which they can ask questions, explore issues, not simply in a passive environment that only happens once or twice a year. These measures will help us effectively provide sexuality education that is safe, open and consistent for every child.",35,1099,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01099
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"At this point, one might ask  who should be responsible for reforming sexuality education in Singapore and, in particular, is this the Government's responsibility? Would parents not be the best teachers of sexuality education for their own children?",36,1100,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01100
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"The reality is that parents are uncomfortable talking about sex, much less teaching important concepts relating to it to their children.",37,1101,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01101
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"A survey by AWARE last year found that only 50% of parents surveyed were comfortable talking to their children about sexuality education. Of these parents, one in four felt embarrassed or lack the confidence to do so. Thirty-five percent felt poorly equipped to begin the conversation and 26% worried that discussing sex would encourage their children to have it. Children too may feel uncomfortable learning about sex from their own parents or are unable to navigate such topics due to abusive dynamics at home.",38,1102,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01102
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Sexuality education is complex and leaving it up to parents to deliver accurate and up-to-date information about STIs, tech-enabled offences and the nuances of consent might be too much to ask. Ensuring a comprehensive sexuality education curriculum, children are receiving the best quality education available.",39,1103,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01103
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Teachers are especially important in this endeavour. Educators, especially early childhood educators, need to be more proactive in sensing and addressing sexual abuse and assault. This includes being able to spot when students may have faced sexual assault, ensure their safety, handle report sensitively and confidentially, and support students with empathy.",40,1104,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01104
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Teachers must be trained in facilitation, especially in scenario and discussion-based learning, for sexuality education to be effective.",41,1105,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01105
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"I am glad to know that the Ministry currently requires sexuality education to be taught by specially selected and trained teachers. I hope that we can take it one step further by giving all training teachers at NIE greater exposure to sexuality education training. In addition, the teachers' sexuality education training should be frequently updated and refreshed to reflect best practices.",42,1106,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01106
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Our schools need clear channels of accountability and reporting. These should be widely publicised so that students know whom to turn to for help. Schools should provide the names and contact information of key personnel and helplines, whether of general safe spaces, professional counselling services or ways to seek legal recourse.",43,1107,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01107
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Mr Speaker, when I think about the sexual violence that occurs on the daily in Singapore, I worry for the safety of our children. No child should be subject to sexual abuse and even one is one too many. We can change this, we have the power to do something that protects and equips them for life and ensures that they do not grow up in a toxic, dangerous environment.",44,1108,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01108
2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"The road to combating sexual violence requires a whole-of-Government approach and the close participation and collaboration of multiple agencies, Ministries and even stakeholders outside of the Government. My speech today may have focus on improving sexuality education, but it does not negate our responsibility as citizens to do our part and call out harmful behaviour if we witness it, and to keep an eye on those who may be victims of sexual violence.",45,1109,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01109

2021-07-06-T-017,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan,"Lastly, sexual violence is fuelled by misogyny. We all have a responsibility to call out sexism, whether at the workplace or in public transport, and respond to incidents of sexual violence, so that perpetrators are held accountable. Reforming our approach to sexual education has to be done soon and urgently to make Singapore a safe and nurturing place for all.",1,1111,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01111

2021-07-06-T-017,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Sun Xueling),"We are disturbed to read about young children who have been victims of sexual abuse, by both familiar people in their lives and strangers.

2021-07-06-T-017,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Sun Xueling),"Addressing sexual violence requires a whole-of-society approach and Body Safety Awareness programmes in our pre-schools, and Sexuality Education in our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) are all part of this effort. It is important to educate our young so that they learn how to be protected against sexual violence and also know the punishment should they become perpetrators of sexual violence themselves.",4,1116,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01116

2021-07-06-T-017,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Sun Xueling),"Sexuality Education is an important part of Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) and that is why we regularly review and refine the way we teach it. Sexuality Education aims to equip students with age-appropriate knowledge and skills to maintain safe and healthy relationships and recognise risks. It is based on values that reflect Singapore's mainstream society so that students can make informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. Our sexuality education teachers are specially selected and trained, so that they can facilitate discussions with sensitivity.",6,1118,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01118

We considered emerging trends, local and international research, input from specialists in relevant fields and our local context, and also, importantly, feedback from our youths on their concerns and how they want to be meaningfully engaged. These may sound new to those of us who did not go through this new curriculum nor experience these new teaching delivery methods, but we recognise that there are new challenges that our youths are facing and we are committed to partner them in their adulting journey.",7,1119,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01119
2021-07-06-T-017,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Sun Xueling),"From as young as Primary 1, students learn about personal safety and protection from abuse.

2021-07-06-T-017,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Sun Xueling),"In Secondary schools and at the pre-University level, students engage in conversations on the importance of respecting boundaries of self and others, and through different scenarios, learn to identify risks and stand up to peer pressure. These lessons also give them opportunities to practise negotiating boundaries for themselves and others, and the social-emotional and legal consequences if they overstep these boundaries.",10,1122,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01122
2021-07-06-T-017,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Sun Xueling),"Through authentic examples, students are guided to consider how respect looks like for both boys and girls.

2021-07-06-T-017,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Sun Xueling),"Let me give you an example. In our refreshed upper Secondary lessons, students consider how respectful and healthy relationships look like. Using a scenario of a girl's intimate photos being posted online, with boys making lewd and disrespectful remarks about the girl, students discuss what it would feel like for the girl. Through this lesson, students discuss the harm that can ensue through what may appear as harmless banter and jokes and what it feels like to be objectified in this manner.",12,1124,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01124
2021-07-06-T-017,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Sun Xueling),Topics and scenarios that are discussed in class include recognising red flags and seeking help for oneself and for friends. Teachers use video re-enactments and screenshots so that students are guided to understand what sexual grooming and sexual abuse are and how they are protected by the law. Teachers also clearly communicate the law to our students for them to understand who and what the law seeks to protect.,13,1125,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01125

At the end of the day, we hope to empower our students so that they can understand themselves better and make responsible decisions.",14,1126,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01126
2021-07-06-T-017,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Sun Xueling),"Our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) have also stepped up education and engagement efforts in recent years on important topics such as respect and appropriate behaviour. This is achieved through multiple channels, including student briefings during orientation, online modules, face-to-face workshops and awareness-building campaigns. All students are expected to abide by their institutions' Codes of Conduct, which set out the expectations for respect and appropriate behaviour.",15,1127,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01127
2021-07-06-T-017,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Sun Xueling),The Autonomous Universities (AUs) have also implemented or are in the process of implementing compulsory education modules on respect and appropriate behaviour.,16,1128,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01128
2021-07-06-T-017,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Sun Xueling),"First, students learn about the key elements of respect and appropriate behaviour. For example, in NUS' education module, students learn that consent must be actively communicated and given freely and voluntarily. For those living in hostels, these learning points are reinforced through compulsory face-to-face workshops and peer discussions.",17,1129,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01129

2021-07-06-T-017,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Sun Xueling),"Third, students are informed of the various reporting channels and support networks. They also learn how they can be an active bystander and protect themselves while doing so.",19,1131,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01131
2021-07-06-T-017,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Sun Xueling),"The IHLs constantly seek feedback from their students to review and improve these education efforts, such as through post-module surveys.",20,1132,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01132
2021-07-06-T-017,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Sun Xueling),"Mr Speaker, Sir, protection against sexual violence is not just about what we do in schools and it also goes beyond a whole-of-Government effort.

2021-07-06-T-017,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Sun Xueling),"As parents, we need to be there for our children, to provide guidance and impart values of respect and responsibility. We know that conversations with our children on sexuality matters is not easy. But, by not doing so, the Internet will fill this vacuum. MOE and our schools are committed to supporting parents to have these important conversations on sexuality.",22,1134,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01134
2021-07-06-T-017,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Sun Xueling),"We also need to work with tech companies and the media so that it is clear that our society takes a ""zero-tolerance"" stand towards toxic, violent and unhealthy relationships. The laws in Singapore have also been updated to reflect new societal issues and problems such as tech-enabled crimes.",23,1135,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01135
2021-07-06-T-017,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Sun Xueling),"With the concerted effort of parents, schools, community, tech companies and media and a legal regime that deters sexual offences, we can journey alongside our young people and support them in the best possible way.",24,1136,2021-07-06-T-017-S-01136

2021-07-06-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs with regard to online and phone scams reported in each of the past three years (a) how many were perpetrated against Singapore-based victims by persons situated overseas; (b) what is the financial loss suffered by these victims; (c) how many of these cases were prosecuted, either in Singapore or overseas; and (d) given the difficulties associated with investigating such crime, what is the Police’s strategy to protect Singapore residents from online or phone scams originating from overseas.",1,1142,2021-07-06-T-019-S-01142
2021-07-06-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The vast majority of online and phone scams were perpetrated by scammers based outside Singapore. In the past three years, out of about 31,500 scam cases reported, involving $591 million of losses, 90% were believed to have been committed by overseas scammers.",1,1143,2021-07-06-T-019-S-01143
2021-07-06-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Such cases are difficult to prosecute. These scammers are typically syndicated and run sophisticated transnational operations that are not easy to detect or dismantle.,2,1144,2021-07-06-T-019-S-01144
2021-07-06-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The only case where overseas-based suspects were successfully extradited to Singapore for prosecution was in May 2019. Two Nigerian men were arrested and sent to Singapore for prosecution, for cheating Singapore-based victims in Internet Love Scams perpetrated from Malaysia. The two accused persons have been charged in Court and Court proceedings are on-going. We do not track prosecutions in other jurisdictions of individuals who are believed to have committed scams against Singaporeans.",3,1145,2021-07-06-T-019-S-01145
2021-07-06-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,The Police adopt a multi-pronged approach to protect Singaporeans from scams.,4,1146,2021-07-06-T-019-S-01146
2021-07-06-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Police have stepped up collaboration with foreign law enforcement agencies, to share information that may lead to the arrest of scammers based abroad. Such cooperation has helped to disrupt scammers' operations in Singapore.",5,1147,2021-07-06-T-019-S-01147
2021-07-06-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"To facilitate the cooperation, the Police set up the Transnational Commercial Crime Task Force (TCTF) in October 2017. Most recently, TCTF participated in a multilateral global operation against syndicates behind China Officials Impersonation Scams, coordinated by Interpol. Code-named Operation ""First Light"", the operation lasted a year and concluded in November 2020. In all, SPF arrested 56 locally-based money mules and runners working for international scam syndicates, and seized over $2.16 million.",6,1148,2021-07-06-T-019-S-01148
2021-07-06-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Second, the Police have set up specialised units to enhance their anti-scam capabilities. In June 2019, the Police set up the Anti-Scam Centre (ASC), which acts as the nerve centre for investigations into scam-related crimes. The ASC's focus is to mitigate victims' losses, through swift interdiction of the proceeds of the crime. Since its inception, the ASC has frozen more than 16,000 bank accounts and recovered more than $120 million.",7,1149,2021-07-06-T-019-S-01149
2021-07-06-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Third, we work closely with public and private sector stakeholders. The Police regularly engage banks, remittance agencies and convenience stores to train their frontline staff to spot possible scam victims. In 2021, so far, the Police have commended 108 members of the community for preventing 91 instances of scams involving about $5 million.",8,1150,2021-07-06-T-019-S-01150
2021-07-06-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Police also work with other public sector agencies through the Inter-Ministry Committee on Scams, to coordinate a whole-of-Government effort. One such initiative is ScamShield, an iOS mobile application developed by the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) and GovTech. Apart from blocking SMS messages and calls from known scam numbers, ScamShield also has a function for users to report suspected scam calls and messages to the Police. ScamShield has been downloaded more than 185,000 times since its launch in November 2020. About 800,000 SMSes have been reported and more than 8,000 unique phone numbers believed to be used in scams have been blocked. The ScamShield team is presently working on developing an Android version of the application.",9,1151,2021-07-06-T-019-S-01151
2021-07-06-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In addition, IMDA has implemented the '+' prefix for all international calls since April 2020 to help consumers recognise calls that originate from overseas. This helps alert consumers who are not expecting any overseas calls to exercise care when answering such calls or to ignore them. This is particularly useful when we get calls from unidentified telephone numbers which start as '+65'. Chances are that this is an overseas call spoofing as a local number.",10,1152,2021-07-06-T-019-S-01152
2021-07-06-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Fourth, public education. The Police and the NCPC have disseminated advisories through various media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. In August 2020, an anti-scam public education campaign, ""Spot the Signs. Stop the Crimes."", was launched. This campaign focused on sharing real-life scam examples to educate the public on how to spot the tell-tale signs. The Police also work with grassroots organisations to spread awareness on scams to residents via community events and Community Safety & Security Programmes.",11,1153,2021-07-06-T-019-S-01153
2021-07-06-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"More recently, between May and June 2021, the seven major retail banks in Singapore partnered the NCPC to introduce an online scam quiz on their various customer touch-points across their Internet and mobile banking platforms.",12,1154,2021-07-06-T-019-S-01154
2021-07-06-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Ultimately, the best defence against scams is a discerning public. We urge members of public to stay vigilant and report possible scams promptly to the Police.",13,1155,2021-07-06-T-019-S-01155
2021-07-06-T-020,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether he can provide an update on the regulatory and enforcement framework to ensure that social media platforms respond in a timely manner and act upon reports of scammers and imposters on their sites.,1,1156,2021-07-06-T-020-S-01156
2021-07-06-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Police cooperate closely with social media platforms to tackle scams. In 2021, the Police issued about 6000 takedown requests to social media companies for accounts believed to have been used in the perpetration of scams on social media platforms.",1,1157,2021-07-06-T-020-S-01157
2021-07-06-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"When scams are reported, the Police shares the relevant information with the relevant social media platform for their assistance to take down accounts believed to be used to commit scams. After reviewing Police’s requests, the social media platforms will typically take down accounts between one and seven days of the report being lodged, depending on the facts and circumstances of the request.",2,1158,2021-07-06-T-020-S-01158
2021-07-06-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Under the Broadcasting Act, the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) has powers to direct Internet Content Providers to take down prohibited material, such as those which are objectionable on the grounds of public order or prohibited by applicable Singapore laws, such as scams, as soon as possible. IMDA can also direct Internet Service Providers to block access to websites that contain such prohibited material, including scam websites.",3,1159,2021-07-06-T-020-S-01159
2021-07-06-T-020,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"MHA and MCI are studying how to enhance our regulations to deal with online harms, including scams. We will share our findings and recommendations in due course.",4,1160,2021-07-06-T-020-S-01160
2021-07-06-T-021,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information following the spate of ransomware incidents abroad involving companies providing critical services, what steps are being taken in Singapore to guard against such incidents from occurring in Singapore.",1,1161,2021-07-06-T-021-S-01161
2021-07-06-T-021,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,asked the Minister for Communications and Information how is Singapore preparing to guard against severe ransom attacks by hackers in light of the high-profile ransom attacks in North America and other parts of the world.,1,1162,2021-07-06-T-021-S-01162
2021-07-06-T-021,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,Ransomware attacks are not new but recent developments are a cause for concern.,1,1163,2021-07-06-T-021-S-01163
2021-07-06-T-021,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In the past, attacks tended to be isolated and sporadic, typically affecting individuals, or a handful of computers in companies. However, there has clearly been a step-change in the scale of ransomware attacks. Cybercriminal gangs have refined their tactics and now encrypt or lock up hundreds, if not thousands, of computers simultaneously. They increasingly target large companies and organisations, which they believe will pay a ransom to end the pain if operations are sufficiently disrupted and enough damage is caused.",2,1164,2021-07-06-T-021-S-01164
2021-07-06-T-021,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In addition, the impact of ransomware attacks are no longer contained in the digital domain. They now spill over into the physical realm, with real-world consequences. We have seen this globally, with the recent uptick in international ransomware attacks. In early May, the Colonial Pipeline Company operating the largest fuel pipeline in the US East Coast suffered a ransomware attack. This prompted the company to shut down the pipeline’s operations for close to a week, affecting the supply of fuel to about 50 million customers. In mid-May, Ireland and New Zealand’s healthcare services suffered from separate ransomware attacks. The shutdown of affected IT systems led to surgeries being postponed and outpatient services suspended, because patient records had become inaccessible.",3,1165,2021-07-06-T-021-S-01165
2021-07-06-T-021,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"These events are stark reminders that we must all remain vigilant against ransomware attacks. This includes not just public agencies delivering essential services but private organisations as well, so long as they depend on IT systems for any part of their core business.",4,1166,2021-07-06-T-021-S-01166
2021-07-06-T-021,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,The Cyber Security Agency (CSA) has taken proactive steps to safeguard our Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) and directed the CII sectors to raise their cybersecurity posture in view of the growing ransomware threat. These include enhancing monitoring to detect anomalous activity swiftly; backing up data regularly and keeping the back-up offline; and practising incident response and business continuity plans to ensure that employees know the required responses to a ransomware attack. These are on top of existing cyber resilience measures mandated for the CII sectors under the Cybersecurity Act.,5,1167,2021-07-06-T-021-S-01167
2021-07-06-T-021,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Government agencies have also heightened their monitoring for anomalous activity in their networks and systems. Business continuity measures have been reviewed and put on standby. A whole-of-Government ICT incident management exercise involving over 30 Government agencies will be conducted in August to refresh agencies’ familiarity with procedures to handle cyber incidents, including that for ransomware. This builds on on-going measures to raise cybersecurity awareness and competency among all public officers, such as through an annual simulated phishing exercise.",6,1168,2021-07-06-T-021-S-01168
2021-07-06-T-021,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"I would like to reiterate that the ransomware threat goes beyond attacks on essential services or Government agencies. It can strike any of us or our organisations, denying us access to our data or disrupting our businesses or operations. We need to do what we can to prevent breaches, but also monitor for and detect these incidents, and recover quickly from them.",7,1169,2021-07-06-T-021-S-01169
2021-07-06-T-021,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"To this end, CSA has issued public advisories on the steps that enterprises, organisations and members of the public should take to protect themselves against the ransomware threat. Many of these are simple cyber hygiene measures, such as keeping systems and software updated and raising employees’ awareness of ransomware. Monitoring and detecting cyber intrusions swiftly and backing up data are also important to contain the impact of any ransomware attack.",8,1170,2021-07-06-T-021-S-01170
2021-07-06-T-021,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"CSA will continue to engage and advise enterprises, organisations and members of the public to adopt these measures, which can be easily found on CSA’s website.",9,1171,2021-07-06-T-021-S-01171
2021-07-06-T-021,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"I would like to stress, however, that these cannot replace the stakeholders’ sense of urgency and commitment to implement the recommended measures. It would be in their own interest to take preventive action before any ransomware attack hits them.",10,1172,2021-07-06-T-021-S-01172
2021-07-06-T-022,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Ministry will work with all hawker stalls, coffee shops and food court operators to provide incentives to consumers in the return of food trays in view of savings in table clearing costs; and (b) whether the Ministry will look into the use of recyclable trays or paper table cloths that can be used as wrappers of food waste for proper, hygienic and quick disposal by consumers into dustbins.",1,1173,2021-07-06-T-022-S-01173
2021-07-06-T-022,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"COVID-19 has underscored the need for high public hygiene and cleanliness standards. To strengthen environmental public health and keep our dining environment clean, NEA had announced that diners are required to clear their dirty trays, crockery and litter after their meals at public dining spaces from June 2021.",1,1174,2021-07-06-T-022-S-01174
2021-07-06-T-022,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We do not anticipate any reduction in cleaning costs to stallholders, as the cleaners will still be required for tasks such as sorting crockery at tray return points as well as cleaning and sanitising tables. In fact, the demands on cleaners have increased due to COVID-19. Diners returning their trays, crockery and litter will help to mitigate manpower challenges in the cleaning workforce and possible upward cost pressures over time.",2,1175,2021-07-06-T-022-S-01175
2021-07-06-T-022,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"NEA is progressively installing more tray and crockery return stations as well as providing new trays to stallholders. NEA has been engaging the cleaning companies on the revised table-cleaning workflow, for a more effective and efficient process.",3,1176,2021-07-06-T-022-S-01176
2021-07-06-T-022,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The trays in hawker centres are reusable. We do not advocate the use of single-use materials, as they are not environmentally sustainable. Diners are required to return their dirty trays and crockery and dispose of their litter, which includes used tissues, and food remnants like shells and bones. Cleaners will help to clean and sanitise the tables thereafter. Diners may use the washbasins provided to wash their hands after returning their trays and crockery to the designated return stations.",4,1177,2021-07-06-T-022-S-01177
2021-07-06-T-023,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) to date, how many summons have been issued for failure to wear face masks; and (b) what actions can be taken to encourage members of the public to wear face masks to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus.",1,1178,2021-07-06-T-023-S-01178

2021-07-06-T-023,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Wearing of masks with good filtration capability helps to reduce the expulsion and transmission of droplets, which is the predominant route of transmission of COVID-19. Everyone should put on their masks when outside their homes, except when eating, drinking or undertaking strenuous exercise. Those walking at a normal pace are required to wear a mask.",2,1180,2021-07-06-T-023-S-01180
2021-07-06-T-023,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Government agencies deploy Safe Distancing Ambassadors and Enforcement Officers daily to advise and enforce compliance with Safe Management Measures (SMMs), including wearing of masks.

2021-07-06-T-024,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many Dependant's Passes have been issued in the past year; (b) why are Dependant's Pass holders not promptly disallowed entry when there was a surge in imported COVID-19 cases; and (c) whether Work Permits and Dependant's Passes can be delinked to allow more efficient revisions to border policies in case of a rebound in COVID-19 cases.,1,1182,2021-07-06-T-024-S-01182
2021-07-06-T-024,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Travellers arriving from the same country have the same risk of incubating COVID-19, as reflected in the country’s COVID-19 situation. The granting of entry approval is, therefore, calibrated based on the risk levels of countries and regions that the applicant has travelled to.",1,1183,2021-07-06-T-024-S-01183
2021-07-06-T-024,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Dependant's Pass (DP) holders accompany the Work Pass holder, who is here to work. If the family of a Work Pass holder is not approved to enter, it is likely that the Work Pass holder will also choose not to enter. There are also DP holders who have been separated from their family members due to the border restrictions since 2020. A policy that prevents DP holders from entering Singapore until all other Work Pass holders have been able to enter, will likely lead to Work Pass holders choosing to leave Singapore in order to be reunited with their family.",2,1184,2021-07-06-T-024-S-01184
2021-07-06-T-024,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"The fact remains that our entry approval process, carried out to safeguard public health, has resulted in a sizeable backlog of existing Work Pass holders and dependants who are outside of Singapore, and who have yet to obtain approval to enter. Businesses understand the need for these measures and support them, even though it comes at considerable disruption to them. We should, therefore, not adopt approaches that cause more disruption than necessary.",3,1185,2021-07-06-T-024-S-01185
2021-07-06-T-025,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"asked the Prime Minister how does the Government intend to address the most discussed topics across the Emerging Stronger Conversations as at 31 December 2020 specifically Social Support, and National Identity and Shared Values which ranked above Jobs and the Economy, and Digitalisation and Technology.",1,1186,2021-07-06-T-025-S-01186
2021-07-06-T-025,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister),The Singapore Together Emerging Stronger Conversations were launched in June 2020 as a platform for Singaporeans to reflect on our COVID-19 experience and our aspirations for a more resilient post-COVID-19 society. These Conversations were convened in the midst of the pandemic because it was important to hear from one another on how we were affected by the crisis and how each of us could play a part to help Singapore emerge stronger.,1,1187,2021-07-06-T-025-S-01187

The average waiting time for BTO projects launched in 2020 was around four to five years.

The average monthly rent for a 1-room interim rental housing flat is $300.",3,1248,2021-07-06-T-034-S-01248
2021-07-06-T-035,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many HDB rental flats are currently not occupied; and (b) whether HDB can allow the buyers of BTO flats that were delayed to rent these flats on a temporary basis.,1,1249,2021-07-06-T-035-S-01249
2021-07-06-T-035,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Generally, flat buyers who are waiting for their new flats and require temporary housing are encouraged to find alternative housing arrangements with family members, relatives or on the open market. Where they are unable to do so, first-timer applicants who are waiting for their BTO flats can apply for temporary housing under the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS). For low-income households with no family support and no other housing option, HDB will consider offering Interim Rental Housing (IRH) on a case-by-case basis.",1,1250,2021-07-06-T-035-S-01250
2021-07-06-T-035,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In fact, we have already offered some vacant rental flats to affected flat buyers under IRH. However, we need to prioritise our rental flats for low-income and vulnerable households with no other housing option.",2,1251,2021-07-06-T-035-S-01251
2021-07-06-T-036,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will review its policy and consider allocating a bigger proportion of BTO HDB flats for first-time home buyers in light of current delays to all BTO projects and longer waiting time for prospective homeowners.,1,1252,2021-07-06-T-036-S-01252
2021-07-06-T-036,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,Helping families to secure their first home continues to be a key priority for MND and HDB. This is why we set aside most new flat supply for those applying to buy a home for the first-time,1,1253,2021-07-06-T-036-S-01253
2021-07-06-T-036,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,(a) at least 85% and 95% of the 4-room and bigger BTO flats in the non-mature estates and mature estates respectively; and,2,1254,2021-07-06-T-036-S-01254
2021-07-06-T-036,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,(b) at least 95% of the 3-room and bigger flats offered in Sale of Balance Flats exercises.,3,1255,2021-07-06-T-036-S-01255
2021-07-06-T-036,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"First-timer applicants also have a higher chance of getting shortlisted to select a BTO flat. They are given two ballot chances instead of one and first-timer families who have been unsuccessful in two attempts for BTO flats in the non-mature estates are given an additional ballot chance at their subsequent application for a BTO flat in the non-mature estates. As a result, virtually all applicants of BTO flats in non-mature estates have been successful within their first three tries. First-timer families with urgent housing needs also have the option of buying a resale flat and can receive up to $160,000 in housing grants.",4,1256,2021-07-06-T-036-S-01256
2021-07-06-T-036,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As HDB has already set aside a vast majority of its flat supply for first-timer families, there are no current plans to increase the proportions further. Nevertheless, HDB will continue to monitor the market situation closely and calibrate the supply of public housing accordingly, to ensure that the flat supply remains responsive to the housing needs of the population.",5,1257,2021-07-06-T-036-S-01257
2021-07-06-T-037,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the current number of vacant HDB rental flats available for allocation; (b) what is the number of approved HDB rental flat applicants on the waiting list pending allocation compared to past five years’ averages; and (c) what is the average waiting time from the date of registration compared to past five years’ averages.,1,1258,2021-07-06-T-037-S-01258
2021-07-06-T-037,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Currently, there are about 4,800 vacant rental flats intended for allocation to new tenants. More than half of these flats need to be spruced up before they can be let out. Due to the severe labour crunch in the construction industry, the pace of sprucing works has slowed down. This had led to longer waiting times for rental flats.",1,1259,2021-07-06-T-037-S-01259
2021-07-06-T-037,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The number of approved HDB rental flat applicants on the waiting list has increased from an average of 660 in the past five years to 1,500 now. The waiting time for successful applicants to be allocated a rental flat has also increased from an average of three months in the past five years to about six months currently. Even though the number of vacant flats exceeds the number of applicants on the waiting list at the overall level, applicants need to be matched to the flat type and location that they applied for. In addition, some flat types and application zones have higher demand and a more limited supply of flats, which results in a longer waiting time.",2,1260,2021-07-06-T-037-S-01260
2021-07-06-T-037,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"HDB is working on measures to speed up the sprucing works and to facilitate key collections as quickly as possible. For applicants with urgent housing needs, such as medical grounds or other extenuating circumstances, HDB will prioritise allocating a flat to them. In 2020, about a third of our successful rental applicants were granted priority allocation.",3,1261,2021-07-06-T-037-S-01261
2021-07-06-T-038,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what are the current upstream interventions to detect and prevent incidents of child abuse cases; (b) whether the Child Protective Service is adequately staffed to handle the surge in child abuse cases amid the COVID-19 pandemic; and (c) what are the Ministry’s plans to reverse this upward trend in child abuse cases.,1,1262,2021-07-06-T-038-S-01262
2021-07-06-T-038,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Prevention and early detection are key to protecting children from harm or further harm. Social service agencies (SSAs) such as Family Service Centres (FSCs) provide community-based services to equip families with skills needed to better manage stressors and conflicts. This may include parenting programmes to equip parents to build positive relationships with their children. When families are able to manage their stressors and conflicts well, the risk of escalation to abuse or neglect of children is lower.",1,1263,2021-07-06-T-038-S-01263
2021-07-06-T-038,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The various touch-points in the child protection eco-system work in partnership with MSF to detect child abuse and neglect, to keep children safe. SSAs, including FSCs and Child Protection Specialist Centres (CPSCs), pre-schools, schools, the Police, and medical practitioners and institutions are part of this eco-system. MSF introduced a Sector-Specific Screening Guide (SSSG) and a Child Abuse Reporting Guide (CARG) in 2015 to sharpen the ability of professionals, such as social workers, educators and healthcare professionals, to pick up safety concerns for a child and seek appropriate intervention. This includes guiding professionals on when to refer families to community agencies, such as FSCs, for early support, or to MSF’s Child Protective Service (CPS) for statutory intervention when there are more serious concerns.",2,1264,2021-07-06-T-038-S-01264
2021-07-06-T-038,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Public education efforts such as the ""Break the Silence"" campaign have increased public awareness and helped to uncover child protection concerns that might have gone undetected previously. Most recently, in February 2021, MSF set up the National Anti-Violence Hotline to make it easier for anyone to report suspected cases of abuse and neglect.",3,1265,2021-07-06-T-038-S-01265
2021-07-06-T-038,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"A steady increase in child protection cases reported since 2015 is not unexpected, given that MSF and its partners have been actively raising public awareness, building capability in professionals and providing more and multiple channels for reporting child protection concerns. We also recognise that some families may experience increased stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could account for some of the increase in cases in 2020. Working closely with the CPSCs and other SSAs, CPS has thus far been able to manage the increase in number of cases. MSF will continue to monitor the caseloads closely and adjust our resources where needed.",4,1266,2021-07-06-T-038-S-01266
2021-07-06-T-038,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In addition to MSF’s existing efforts to prevent and detect child abuse, the Taskforce on Family Violence is working on a set of recommendations which will be announced later this year. These recommendations will also go some way to further address child abuse concerns. For example, the Taskforce is looking to build on current efforts in schools, to further develop age-appropriate materials to educate children and young persons on healthy and respectful relationships, as well as protective behaviours from young.",5,1267,2021-07-06-T-038-S-01267
2021-07-06-T-038,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,It is everyone’s responsibility to keep our children safe. We urge members of the public to call the National Anti-Violence Hotline at 1800-777-0000 to report suspected cases of abuse and neglect.,6,1268,2021-07-06-T-038-S-01268
2021-07-06-T-039,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,asked the Prime Minister whether the impact and disruption of COVID-19 has required the Government to review its population strategies so as to pivot the economy in concert with the recommendations of the Emerging Stronger Taskforce report.,1,1269,2021-07-06-T-039-S-01269
2021-07-06-T-039,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister),"The Government regularly reviews our population strategies to take into account changes to demographic trends, such as our birth rates and life expectancy. During the Committee of Supply debate in February this year, I shared with the House the impact of COVID-19 on key population trends in 2020 and the population strategies that will enable us to emerge stronger in the post-COVID-19 world.",1,1270,2021-07-06-T-039-S-01270

2021-07-06-T-039,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister),"First, Singaporeans continue to be at the heart of our population policies. We must sustain a strong core of Singaporeans in our population and workforce. Marriage and parenthood is a national priority. It is the best way to grow our citizen population and derive a strong local workforce to support our social and economic needs, and sustain future generations of Singaporeans. We support Singaporeans’ aspirations to start and raise families through a comprehensive suite of support measures, including parental leave, childcare support, housing support and cash grants.",3,1272,2021-07-06-T-039-S-01272
2021-07-06-T-039,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister),"Second, we must continue to strengthen the capabilities of our local workforce, to ensure that Singaporeans have the skills to seize new economic opportunities. The EST report highlighted the acceleration of digital transformation and innovation, as well as new growth areas such as agritech and sustainability, which can provide good jobs for Singaporeans with the right skills. The Government will continue to partner businesses, trade associations and chambers, Institutes of Higher Learning, training providers and unions to help our local workforce to upskill and reskill, to take on jobs of the future and make the most of the opportunities afforded by our economic strategies.",4,1273,2021-07-06-T-039-S-01273
2021-07-06-T-039,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister),"Third, even as we strengthen capabilities of our local workforce, we must continue to tap on global skills and manpower to complement the local workforce and augment skills that are in short supply locally. Some of the opportunities being developed by the EST Alliances for Action will generate new businesses that will need new capabilities and networks that foreign professionals can bring. This in turn will create more good jobs for Singaporeans. We will continue to refine our foreign workforce policy to bring in complementary foreign manpower, while ensuring fair hiring practices, preserving a level playing field for Singaporeans and enabling skills transfer to our people.",5,1274,2021-07-06-T-039-S-01274
2021-07-06-T-039,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister),"Next, improving productivity and reducing reliance on lower skilled foreign workers will remain a key priority in our industry transformation efforts. We had made strides in raising productivity before the pandemic. From 2009 to 2019, Singapore’s overall labour productivity, as measured by real value-added per actual hour worked, grew 2.9% per annum. We must build on these efforts. The EST report has emphasised ways in which our businesses can achieve productivity-driven growth through innovation, technology and better use of data. For instance, the Alliances for Action on Digitalising the Built Environment and Robotics are designed to spur productivity in industries like construction and transport.",6,1275,2021-07-06-T-039-S-01275
2021-07-06-T-039,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister),"Finally, we will continue to explore ways to harness the productive capacity of our senior population.

This also allows workplaces to tap on the expertise and experience of our senior workers.",7,1276,2021-07-06-T-039-S-01276

This study found that mothers’ marital satisfaction fell during and after the circuit breaker last year. While the amount of household responsibilities increased for both mothers and fathers, Dr Tan noted that mothers still shouldered a larger share of the responsibilities which could be one reason for the slide in marital satisfaction.",1,1331,2021-07-06-T-046-S-01331

Hence, even before the pandemic, the Government had progressively enhanced parental leave schemes over the years to enable fathers to play a bigger role. In 2017, the Government mandated the second week of Paternity Leave and increased Shared Parental Leave from one to four weeks. Fathers have up to a year from their child’s birth to use these leave provisions. In total, fathers can now enjoy up to eight weeks of leave in their child’s first year to bond with their newborns and care for their wives. This would include six days of paid Childcare Leave and up to six days of unpaid Infant Care Leave, both of which are extended equally to working fathers and mothers.",3,1333,2021-07-06-T-046-S-01333

FFL has also organised the ongoing series of #AskFFL interviews where both moms and dads can ask FFL’s experts on a wide range of topics including infant care, home-based learning and positive parenting. These efforts promote joint parenting, which strengthens marriages as husbands and wives mutually support one another and talk through difficulties they encounter with their children or with one another.",4,1334,2021-07-06-T-046-S-01334

Our approach is to enable all Singaporean children to receive Government benefits that support their caregiving, growth and development, regardless of their parents’ marital status. For instance, since 2016, we have extended the Child Development Account benefits to Singaporean children of single unwed parents, including the $3,000 First Step Grant and matched co-savings from Government. Families can benefit from up to $6,000 and $9,000 in Government contributions to the CDA for their first and second child, and even more for subsequent children.",4,1343,2021-07-06-T-047-S-01343

2021-07-06-T-048,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah (for the Prime Minister),"We also recognise that a key concern for some couples is the affordability of fertility treatments. The ART co-funding scheme was first introduced in 2008 to help defray the costs of ART treatments at public Assisted Reproduction centres. Today, couples are eligible for co-funding of up to $7,700 per fresh ART cycle, as compared to $6,300 previously. Co-funding for Intra-Uterine Insemination (IUI) was also introduced in January 2020. Couples can also withdraw up to a lifetime limit of $15,000 from their own, or their spouse’s MediSave Account to offset the out-of-pocket payment for Assisted Conception Procedures. In the past, only couples where the women are aged below 40 were eligible for ART co-funding, for up to six cycles. Since last year, women aged 40 and above are able to receive co-funding for two of the six co-funded ART cycles, as long as they have attempted Assisted Reproduction or IUI procedures before age 40.

2021-07-06-T-050,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,asked the Minister for Transport in view of the recent all-time high COE price for motorcycles (a) whether there are plans to mitigate the situation; and (b) whether there will be any review of the current motorcycle COE system so as to better regulate the COE prices.,1,1364,2021-07-06-T-050-S-01364
2021-07-06-T-050,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,The Certificate of Entitlement (COE) is a market-based mechanism to allocate limited vehicle supply. The quota premium for COEs is thus determined by market forces of supply and demand.,1,1365,2021-07-06-T-050-S-01365
2021-07-06-T-050,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The overall supply of Category D COEs has remained stable since 2018. This is as we have ceased the contribution of Category D to Category E quota in 2017. Also, the vehicle growth rate for motorcycles, like for cars, has been 0% since 2018 in line with our car-lite policy. Therefore, at each bidding cycle, the supply of motorcycle COEs available is simply based on the number of motorcycles deregistered in the previous quarter.",2,1366,2021-07-06-T-050-S-01366
2021-07-06-T-050,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Since the resumption of COE bidding after motor showrooms and dealerships re-opened, Category D COE prices have increased, but there is so far no evidence of speculation. The vast majority of COEs at these prices have been taken up and used to register motorcycles. The number of utilised temporary COEs has been high at approximately 99%, as compared to the historical average of about 91%.",3,1367,2021-07-06-T-050-S-01367

Among residents aged 25 years and over in 2020, 48% attained diplomas, degrees and professional qualifications, up from 37% in 2010. This includes diploma and degree graduates from ITE, Polytechnics, Autonomous Universities (AUs), Private Education Institutions (PEIs) and overseas universities. Even with higher education attainment levels, graduate employment rates have, in fact, remained stable over the past few years and starting wages have risen over time. Nine in 10 graduates from our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) who entered the labour force last year found jobs or traineeships within six months of graduation. The median gross monthly salary amongst full-time permanent employed AU graduates has risen from $3,300 in 2015 to $3,700 in 2020.",1,1383,2021-07-06-T-053-S-01383

The most common reason for unsuccessful ComCare applications is that applicants were assessed to have stable income that was sufficient to meet their basic living expenses. Other reasons why applications are not approved include clients withdrawing their applications to apply for other assistance schemes, for example, the COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG), and clients not submitting supporting documents.

The mean and median monthly cash assistance amounts were around $600 and $500 per household respectively. This cash assistance is in addition to assistance for rental, utilities, and service and conservancy charges, and other forms of Government assistance and subsidies that households could be receiving, such as MediFund for medical expenses, subsidised rental housing, financial assistance for school fees, and childcare and student care subsidies.

It is typically renewed annually when the Social Service Offices conduct a well-being check with beneficiaries, to ensure that they continue to receive the range of support they require. The monthly cash assistance amount for LTA beneficiaries depends on the size of their households. About 90% of LTA beneficiaries are from one-person households and they receive $600 per month. Therefore, the mean and median monthly cash assistance is around $600. LTA beneficiaries also receive subsidised medical care at public healthcare institutions and additional assistance for specialised or one-off needs, such as medical equipment or household appliances.",5,1391,2021-07-06-T-054-S-01391

2021-07-06-T-055,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Member’s real question is whether legal aid can be expanded to go beyond 25% in respect of the categories she has highlighted. We have given answers to similar questions, previously. It is possible to expand the coverage but that has to be paid for, either by cutting back on some other service or by increasing taxes. Ultimately, there have to be judgement calls on the right level of support for private legal services, to be paid for by the general taxpayer. We have settled on 25% of resident households, and the figure has been and will be regularly reviewed.",2,1396,2021-07-06-T-055-S-01396
2021-07-06-T-055,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Member also specifically referred to divorce cases. We have introduced a number of measures to streamline divorce proceedings. These include  (a) the simplified case management track. Parties who agree on the divorce and ancillary matters prior to the filing of the action can obtain a divorce on this track without going through lengthy court proceedings. They can navigate this on their own without the need to incur legal fees. This saves parties both costs and time. The majority of divorce cases are filed on the simplified track. In 2020, 60% of cases were filed on the simplified track; (b) the use of alternative dispute resolution. For cases that do not proceed on the simplified track, many have been resolved through mediation. Mediation helps parties address the key issues without the need for lengthy or acrimonious hearings. In 2020, 90% of cases that went through mediation either reached a full or partial settlement; and (c) the use of the judge-led approach, where Judges take a more proactive role in proceedings by taking the lead and controlling the pace of the proceedings. This is a less adversarial mode of proceedings, which avoids unnecessary disputes, acrimony and protracted hearings. Nevertheless, we agree that more can be done because there continue to be cases where it is too costly and protracted, unnecessarily so. We will continue to see how these issues can be dealt with.",3,1397,2021-07-06-T-055-S-01397

The Residents’ Networks encourage residents from the HDB and private estates to mix more freely with one another and participate in community activities together. For instance, the Residents’ Networks from Zhenghua-Blossom Palmview and Toa Payoh Central Zone 6 regularly organise activities for the community, and it is not uncommon to see residents from private estates visit their Residents’ Network centres located at the HDB blocks.

In 1980, our life expectancy at age 65 was only 14.0 years. In the last decade, life expectancy at age 65 increased from 19.8 years in 2010 to 21.5 years in 2020. The average number of additional years a 65-year-old in Singapore is expected to live in good health2 has increased, from 15.8 years in 2010 to 17.1 years in 2019.

Through our security agencies’ engagement and outreach to constituencies within the Public Service and beyond, the Government will continue to raise awareness of the real risks and modus operandi of foreign actors, whether it takes the form of an online or offline influence operation aimed at shaping public opinion or policy-making, or foreign intelligence recruitment operation. Organisations and individuals who are more vulnerable to foreign interference, whether by virtue of the activities or issues they are involved in, will need to be even more aware of these risks.",4,1501,2021-07-06-T-075-S-01501

The affordances of the internet have increased the potential of online hostile information campaigns, but covert attempts to exercise control or influence over organisations and individuals are just as insidious. As the threats evolve, we need to continue to build up our capabilities to detect and disrupt such activities.

2021-07-06-T-094,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Since 2016, there have been concerted efforts to strengthen international co-operation in taxation matters, to stamp out harmful practices and to increase the taxes paid by multinational enterprises (MNEs). These efforts were first initiated by the OECD to deal with the issue of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) by MNEs. To ensure a wider international consensus, the discussions were subsequently broadened to include more than 130 jurisdictions through a platform called the Inclusive Framework (IF) on BEPS.",1,1595,2021-07-06-T-094-S-01595
2021-07-06-T-094,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Singapore has been actively involved in these international discussions as part of the IF. The IF has been discussing two major tax changes.,2,1596,2021-07-06-T-094-S-01596
2021-07-06-T-094,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,The first proposal concerns the re-allocation of taxing rights of the largest and most profitable MNEs from where they conduct their substantial activities to where their customers are. This is known as Pillar 1. The current proposal is that Pillar 1 will apply to MNE groups with global revenues above 20 billion euros and profitability above 10%.,3,1597,2021-07-06-T-094-S-01597
2021-07-06-T-094,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The second proposal is the introduction of an internationally-agreed minimum corporate tax rate for large MNEs, wherever they operate. This is known as Pillar 2. The G7 and IF have proposed a minimum effective tax rate of at least 15% for MNE groups with global revenues above 750 million euros.",4,1598,2021-07-06-T-094-S-01598
2021-07-06-T-094,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"With respect to how Singapore will be affected by these proposals, as well as our response to them, these have been addressed in my reply to similar questions in Parliament on 5 July 2021. In brief, Singapore has never relied on tax incentives alone to attract investments. We have consistently invested in our talent, infrastructure, R&D, and created a conducive business environment. These have allowed us to build a vibrant economy and create good jobs for our people.",5,1599,2021-07-06-T-094-S-01599
2021-07-06-T-094,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As for how Pillars 1 and 2 will be implemented, the members of the IF will agree on an implementation plan in the coming months. To ensure the coordinated and consistent implementation of the consensus, the IF is considering the development of multilateral instruments for both Pillars 1 and 2. Depending on its own domestic legislation, each jurisdiction may also need to translate these international tax rules into its domestic tax systems.",6,1600,2021-07-06-T-094-S-01600

2021-07-06-T-095,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what is the rationale for changing the Family Service Centre (FSC) funding system from a tiered system to one based on the exact number of cases handled by each FSC.,1,1602,2021-07-06-T-095-S-01602
2021-07-06-T-095,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Social workers in Family Service Centres (FSCs) partner individuals and families to address their social needs. In the past five years (FY2016 to FY2020), the FSCs served an average of 350 clients each per year, with an average of 22 cases per social worker. Caseloads vary across FSCs, depending on factors such as the profile of the community served and the manpower situation in each FSC.",1,1603,2021-07-06-T-095-S-01603
2021-07-06-T-095,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MSF does not have readily available data on the number of cases managed by each social worker with or without supervisory duties. The FSCs have autonomy on how they distribute cases. MSF maintains a close watch over the total caseload and overall manpower situation of the FSCs on an ongoing basis. The Ministry engages FSCs regularly to understand their situations and challenges, especially those with higher caseloads or higher staff turnover, and works with them on possible solutions such as hiring more social workers and attending to staff development.",2,1604,2021-07-06-T-095-S-01604
2021-07-06-T-095,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MSF provides funding to the FSCs based on their caseloads. Before FY2018, MSF funding was disbursed in blocks and did not take into account the risks and complexity of each case. Since FY2018, to better tailor funding to the resourcing needs of the FSCs, MSF funds FSCs based on the actual number of cases managed, with higher funding given to cases with higher risks and complexity. This revised funding approach more precisely meets the resourcing needs of the FSCs. Based on the resourcing provided, the FSCs have the flexibility to hire staff to match their case mix and client risk profile.",3,1605,2021-07-06-T-095-S-01605

2021-07-06-T-105,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many cases of breaches under the Housing and Development (Renovation Control) Rules have been reported since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic; (b) what action has HDB taken to ensure compliance with the Rules; and (c) whether HDB will set up a process to enable affected residents to lodge requests for deferment of noisy renovation works before HDB issues a renovation permit.,1,1649,2021-07-06-T-105-S-01649
2021-07-06-T-105,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Certain types of renovation work, such as the demolition of walls and hacking of flooring, require a renovation permit from HDB and must be conducted by a contractor listed in the HDB Directory of Renovation Contractors (DRC).  This is to ensure that the works will not damage the building structure or pose a safety risk to residents.",1,1650,2021-07-06-T-105-S-01650
2021-07-06-T-105,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The number of infringements committed by renovation contractors since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic has remained largely the same as before. In 2019, there were 52 cases of infringements out of the 63,642 HDB renovation permits issued. In comparison, between the start of the circuit breaker in April 2020 and May 2021, there were 53 cases of infringements out of 76,340 permits issued. The infringements included carrying out unauthorised works in the flats, or contravening HDB’s renovation guidelines.",2,1651,2021-07-06-T-105-S-01651
2021-07-06-T-105,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To facilitate compliance, HDB sends circulars to remind contractors listed in the DRC about HDB’s guidelines. In addition, HDB conducts audit inspections on flats, as well as investigations based on feedback from residents on possible infringements. Errant contractors can be penalised by HDB, for instance, by the imposition of a financial penalty and/or demerit points. HDB can also debar contractors who exceed the threshold for demerit points, or who commit serious infringements.",3,1652,2021-07-06-T-105-S-01652
2021-07-06-T-105,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"There are processes in place to help manage disamenities from renovation noise. For instance, contractors listed in the DRC are required to inform households within a radius of two flats of the unit being renovated, including the upper and lower floor neighbours, at least three days in advance of the impending renovation works. Contractors who have applied for an HDB renovation permit are also required to put up a Notice of Renovation Works outside the flat entrance during the renovation period so neighbours will know whom to contact if they face issues. To expand outreach, we have also added the notices to the OneService app. From July 2021, HDB residents will be able to receive and view notices for upcoming flat renovation works at their blocks, that have been approved by HDB, through the app. The advanced notices will allow immediate neighbours who may be affected to make alternative arrangements such as returning to office for work, if necessary, or to approach the contractors to adjust the renovation schedules for noisier works. We have seen instances where contractors or flat owners have found mutually agreeable arrangements when approached by affected residents.",4,1653,2021-07-06-T-105-S-01653

At the same time, new flat owners will need to renovate their flats, sometimes urgently, so that they can move in as soon as possible. In Singapore’s high density living environment, some amount of give-and-take will be necessary. Therefore, we seek residents’ patience and understanding as we adapt to new work-life arrangements and tackle the COVID-19 pandemic together.
