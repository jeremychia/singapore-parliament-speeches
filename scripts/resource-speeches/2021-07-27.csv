2021-07-27-T-001,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) how does the Ministry ensure safe distancing measures are being enforced onboard trains and public buses; and (b) what are the standing instructions for public transport operators for managing commuter volume during Phase Three (Heightened Alert), especially during peak hours.",1,1,2021-07-27-T-001-S-00001
2021-07-27-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng) (for the Minister for Transport),"Mr Deputy Speaker, while there are practical challenges in enforcing safe distancing on public transport, our public transport operators have put in place a comprehensive suite of measures to ensure that public transport remains safe for commuters.",1,2,2021-07-27-T-001-S-00002
2021-07-27-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng) (for the Minister for Transport),"Since the start of the circuit breaker period last year, our operators have stepped up regular cleaning of buses, trains and public transport nodes, and have applied a long-lasting microbial disinfectant coating on high contact surfaces. Commuters are also required to wear masks on public transport and to refrain from talking during their commute. An A*STAR study in 2020 concluded that these measures, together with the ventilation systems and natural fresh air intake on public transport, are effective in keeping the risk of COVID-19 transmission low.",2,3,2021-07-27-T-001-S-00003
2021-07-27-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng) (for the Minister for Transport),Our public transport operators and LTA also issue regular public reminders and deploy staff and Auxiliary Police to ensure adherence to these safe management measures.,3,4,2021-07-27-T-001-S-00004
2021-07-27-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng) (for the Minister for Transport),I seek commuters’ understanding and support to adhere to the prevailing safe management measures and urge all employers to adopt flexible working arrangements and stagger start and end times for their onsite employees. It is only with our combined efforts that we can ensure that the public transport experience remains a safe and pleasant one for all.,4,5,2021-07-27-T-001-S-00005
2021-07-27-T-001,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Mr Yip Hon Weng.,1,6,2021-07-27-T-001-S-00006
2021-07-27-T-001,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for his response. How can commuters on our buses and trains provide feedback if they experience difficulty maintaining a distance of one metre from other passengers or if passengers talk among themselves or on their phones, despite repeated reminders from the announcements? How should operators manage such feedback?",1,7,2021-07-27-T-001-S-00007
2021-07-27-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"Mr Deputy Speaker, maintaining safe distancing is not a particular measure on public transport because, as mentioned, it may not be practical. But it is important to adhere to the safe management measures, such as wearing a mask and not talking. So, for such cases when commuters observe errant fellow commuters, a sensible first step would be to gently remind them to adhere to these measures.",1,8,2021-07-27-T-001-S-00008
2021-07-27-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"There are cases of genuine mistakes, such as when a commuter forgets to bring his mask when he leaves his home. So, I would like to commend the many commuters who have taken the initiative to remind their fellow commuters and, in some instances, even offering masks to those who may have forgotten one.",2,9,2021-07-27-T-001-S-00009
2021-07-27-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"If that fails or if the commuters feel uncomfortable in engaging these errant commuters directly, they can inform the nearest public transport staff, such as our bus captains or our customer service officers at the train stations. These staff have been trained to handle such situations.",3,10,2021-07-27-T-001-S-00010
2021-07-27-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"For cases of non-compliance, our public transport operators will work through LTA to take the necessary enforcement actions, such as issuance of fines or the activation of the Police.",4,11,2021-07-27-T-001-S-00011
2021-07-27-T-001,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,Keeping our public transport safe is a joint effort. I seek commuters' understanding and cooperation again to adhere to the prevailing safe management measures so that we can all enjoy a safe commute.,5,12,2021-07-27-T-001-S-00012
2021-07-27-T-002,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,"asked the Minister for Manpower in view of the winding down of the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) in September 2021 (a) whether there will be an increase in retrenchment and unemployment, especially in the aviation, aerospace and hospitality sectors; and (b) how will the Ministry support the companies and workers in these sectors which have limited scope for recovery in the near term.",1,13,2021-07-27-T-002-S-00013
2021-07-27-T-002,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the lifting of travel restrictions in Singapore and globally is likely to be slow amidst the emergence of more transmissible strains of the COVID-19 virus. As such, the recovery of the aviation- and tourism-related sectors is expected to remain weak.",1,14,2021-07-27-T-002-S-00014
2021-07-27-T-002,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"Besides the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), the Government has been providing targeted support to these sectors that are affected very badly. MOT introduced the $870 million OneAviation Support Package in February this year to enable aviation companies to preserve core capabilities and maintain Singapore’s position as an aviation hub. STB launched a domestic tourism campaign and extended $320 million worth of SingapoRediscovers Vouchers to drive domestic tourism. WSG has rolled out various Job Redesign Reskilling Programmes to support employers in these sectors to make use of the downtime to re-design jobs and re-skill their employees to take on new job roles. For firms in these sectors that are still able to expand local hiring, they can also tap on the Jobs Growth Incentive, which provides up to $54,000 per hire.",2,15,2021-07-27-T-002-S-00015
2021-07-27-T-002,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"For affected workers who are looking to switch to new careers in other sectors, we will help them access suitable jobs and skills opportunities. Besides WSG’s Careers Connect and NTUC’s e2i career centres, WSG has set up the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Centres in all HDB towns and deployed Careers Connect On-the-Go to bring career matching services closer to jobseekers. Jobseekers can also tap on digital resources available on WSG’s MyCareersFuture portal to search for suitable job opportunities.",3,16,2021-07-27-T-002-S-00016
2021-07-27-T-002,Tan See Leng,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),The Government will continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on these sectors and are reviewing the provision of targeted support so that core capabilities can be preserved and that the sectors can emerge stronger through the eventual recovery.,4,17,2021-07-27-T-002-S-00017
2021-07-27-T-002,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Mr Desmond Choo.,1,18,2021-07-27-T-002-S-00018
2021-07-27-T-002,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister for his comprehensive answer. I have three clarifications. First, I note his point that the recovery in the aviation- and tourism-related sectors is likely to be weak. I would like to ask if he expects there to be permanent reduction in manpower requirements in these affected sectors.",1,19,2021-07-27-T-002-S-00019
2021-07-27-T-002,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"The second clarification is on students in affected sectors. There are students studying hospitality, aerospace, aviation courses. They are likely to have graduated this year, last year and in 2022. They are likely to face an uncertain future. How can we better help them to pivot or do we still continue to encourage them to enter those sectors?",2,20,2021-07-27-T-002-S-00020
2021-07-27-T-002,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"The third clarification would be on helping existing workers to transit. Would we be expected to provide grants, noting that many of these workers in these sectors tend to be older and find transition significantly more difficult because they have very limited runway left to transit to other sectors? Would there be a need for more concerted tripartite efforts to help them through their transition process?",3,21,2021-07-27-T-002-S-00021
2021-07-27-T-002,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"I thank the hon Member Desmond Choo for his very pertinent questions. In terms of the reduction in manpower requirements, EDB and the different component agencies have worked with the Emerging Stronger Task Force and also leveraging on the Singapore Together Alliances for Action (AfAs, and identified certain core sectors within the aviation industry which they think would continue to remain very much the growth sectors; the exact details I am not at liberty to talk about at this particular Sitting. But I am sure in the weeks and months ahead more of the information would come out.",1,22,2021-07-27-T-002-S-00022
2021-07-27-T-002,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"What we are trying to do is to ensure that as we come out of this particular pandemic and crisis, we want to be able to anchor our skillsets in that particular area and capture the growth that is going to come from that sector. Ostensibly, in the foreseeable five, 10 years ahead, once we clear this pandemic and go through this difficult period, we believe that the recovery will be quite strong. Given our hub status, given the credibility and also the strength of our workforce, we think it is one area we can continue to anchor on.",2,23,2021-07-27-T-002-S-00023
2021-07-27-T-002,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"With regard to the third clarification on what kind of transition support, we urge all companies, particularly companies that are doing well, to tap on the Jobs Growth Incentive (JGI) which subsidises up to $54,000 per hire, depending on which age group you are, whether you are 40 years old and above, whether you have disabilities or you are an ex-offender; and also, for the young ones, where up to 25% of the monthly salary is subsidised, capped at a certain amount.",3,24,2021-07-27-T-002-S-00024
2021-07-27-T-002,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"We urge companies in the growth sectors to continue to hire. This is a very good opportunity for companies to tap on our local Singaporeans as a workforce, the unemployed ones, the ones who are available and help them to pivot into different industries. The JGI scheme will expire in September 2021. So, please take advantage of that. In that transition, I believe that would put a lot of our fellow citizens and the companies themselves in good shape.",4,25,2021-07-27-T-002-S-00025
2021-07-27-T-002,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"With regard to the other point about students being affected, indeed, this is also one of our concerns. What we are now doing is that we are expanding the courses to ensure that the graduates coming out from the Institutes of Higher Learning, the Polytechnics, the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), can be placed in sectors which we have identified as growth sectors, for instance, in wholesale trade, healthcare, finance and infocomm.",5,26,2021-07-27-T-002-S-00026
2021-07-27-T-002,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"We also have got courses that help them to ensure that they are plugged in, that when they come on board to these companies, they are in a much better position to fit in and be able to adapt and take on whatever opportunities that may come their way.",6,27,2021-07-27-T-002-S-00027
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether he can provide an update on industry transformation plans for the marine and offshore engineering (M&OE) sector; and (b) whether the Industry Transformation Maps and related policy reviews have considered what opportunities may exist in offshore carrier transport of hydrogen.,1,28,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00028
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the Ministry has done any assessment of the low-carbon hydrogen sector; (b) if so, what is the current state of the art for hydrogen transportation by carrier; (c) at what point will carrier-transported hydrogen become commercially viable; (d) what is Singapore's potential to be a hydrogen hub; and (e) whether moving ahead of market shifts may be considered as a strategy.",1,29,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00029
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether he can provide an update on the current state of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS); (b) what are the respective conservative and optimistic assessments of potential CCUS technological advancements in the next decade; and (c) what role can incentives play to improve CCUS commercial viability for purposes of deployment in the petrochemicals sector.",1,30,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00030
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),Climate change is an existential challenge for Singapore.,1,31,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00031

2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Yes, thank you for the reminder. My humble apologies! I know this is the second time you have reminded me in two days.",1,33,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00033
2021-07-27-T-003,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Not at all. So, it is a combined response to Question Nos 3 to 5?",1,34,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00034

2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Climate change is an existential challenge for Singapore. In March 2020, Singapore submitted our enhanced 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution and Long-term Low Emissions Development Strategy, or LEDS. One of our key thrusts under LEDS is to adopt advanced low-carbon technologies, such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage, or CCUS, and low-carbon hydrogen, to decarbonise our economy.",1,37,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00037
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"For CCUS, a small number of pathways are at a technologically advanced stage, but it requires further development to be commercially viable in Singapore.",2,38,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00038
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"A key pathway is carbon capture and storage, or CCS. We are seeing more large-scale projects being developed with government support internationally. This includes Project Longship1 and PORTHOS2 in Norway and the Netherlands respectively.",3,39,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00039
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"However, Singapore faces challenges in deploying CCS domestically, including a lack of any known geological formations that are suitable for the permanent storage of carbon dioxide underground. We are, therefore, exploring partnerships with companies and other countries with suitable geological formations to enable carbon dioxide storage opportunities.",4,40,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00040
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"We are also exploring carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) pathways, where carbon dioxide is captured and converted into waste-based feedstocks or natural minerals that can be used to produce aggregates for reclamation or building materials in the form of building materials. There are a number of companies developing testbeds for use in Singapore and examples of commercial-scale operations in other countries.",5,41,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00041
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Captured carbon dioxide may also be used to manufacture synthetic fuels and chemicals, such as kerosene and methanol, which can be used as aviation and marine fuels. However, most pathways for synthesising fuels or chemicals from carbon dioxide are not mature and they are relatively nascent. Though some are at demonstration or post-demonstration stage, they can be expensive compared to conventional production, while others remain at scales that are still within the lab; so, it is still at lab-scale. Some also require significant amounts of energy in the form of low-carbon hydrogen, which will take some time to become cost-competitive with other conventional sources of energy.",6,42,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00042
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Low-carbon hydrogen is a key technology for Singapore to decarbonise. A recent feasibility study commissioned by Government agencies and published in June this year concluded that hydrogen has the potential to decarbonise maritime, electricity generation, heavy transportation and some industrial processes. However, until CCUS is commercially viable, Singapore cannot produce low-carbon hydrogen at scale. Hence, we are exploring a range of other supply pathways.",7,43,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00043
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"The key challenge with scaling up the supply of hydrogen is the very high storage and transportation costs. Hydrogen, as most of you would know, is a gas with a boiling point far lower than natural gas. It is, therefore, a significant engineering challenge to transport and to store hydrogen in a commercially viable manner. To overcome this problem, the industry is working on different hydrogen carriers, each with its advantages, but also with its challenges to overcome.",8,44,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00044
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"These transportation options include ammonia. Supply chains exist today for ammonia, but ammonia is currently not produced using low-carbon methods or shipped in quantities required of an energy carrier. Burning ammonia also releases noxious oxides. To avoid this, we need to first liberate the hydrogen in ammonia, which would require a lot of energy. So, it is, by itself, an energy-intensive process.",9,45,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00045
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Liquid Organic Hydride Carriers (LOHCs), which allow storage and transport of hydrogen at ambient conditions, are less hydrogen-dense, but this means a relatively higher cargo footprint would be needed to import the same amount of hydrogen. The process required to release hydrogen from these LOHCs can also be land- and energy-intensive.",10,46,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00046
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"The third form, liquefied hydrogen, is where hydrogen is transported in its natural form. The process to liquify hydrogen for transport is, again, very energy-intensive and the technology for the large-scale shipping of liquefied hydrogen is relatively nascent today.",11,47,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00047
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"There is currently no global consensus on which carrier form of hydrogen might dominate in the future, or when long-distance transport of hydrogen and the processes to liberate hydrogen from carriers might become viable.",12,48,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00048
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,Singapore is keen to realise the decarbonisation potential of hydrogen and to develop into a regional hydrogen hub.

2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Additionally, we will continue to collaborate with companies and the research community on Research, Development and Demonstration (RD&D) projects and testbeds for CCUS solutions as well as low-carbon hydrogen. Last year, we launched a $49-million Low Carbon Energy Research (LCER) Funding Initiative for the next five years to improve the technical and economic feasibility of low-carbon technologies.",14,50,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00050
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"At the same time, we are collaborating with international partners to further the development of low-carbon technologies, both in RD&D and the development of supply chains. We have signed an MOU with Australia on cooperation in Low Emissions Solutions and an MOU with Chile on Low-carbon Hydrogen Collaboration and we have just signed an arrangement regarding Collaboration on Low-carbon Hydrogen with New Zealand as well. We look forward to more partnerships and to leveraging them to capture new opportunities from emerging technologies.",15,51,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00051
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,Dr Tan Wu Meng also asked specifically about the Industry Transformation Map (ITM) of the marine and offshore engineering (M&OE) sector. Agencies are updating the ITM to take into account the impact of COVID-19 and the implications of a low-carbon transition and we target to launch a refreshed ITM next year. We expect offshore renewables and offshore carrier transport of hydrogen to be among the areas of opportunity in the refreshed ITM.,16,52,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00052

2021-07-27-T-003,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"I thank the Minister for his sustained exposition on the topic. And if I may sustain a couple of supplementary questions as well on this issue. Let me start, first, by declaring that I am an adviser to the Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering Employees Union. And my supplementary questions are as follows.",1,54,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00054
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"On the first point, the Minister spoke about how there are currently significant constraints regarding the deployment of clean hydrogen and its transport. Some of these constraints appear to be specific to the origin, as well as the destination – the liquefaction and then the subsequent gasification at the destination.",2,55,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00055
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"However, I would like to ask the Minister whether he sees, at some point, opportunities arising further in the transport of liquid hydrogen. I understand that there are some prototype developments from the Japanese in this sector and even as we explore opportunities for the Offshore and Marine Engineering sector, I wonder if the Ministry is looking at ways to keep our industry ready in the event that some of these new modalities and technologies start to become commercially viable.",3,56,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00056
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Secondly, I would also like to ask the Minister, in terms of the changing environment regarding sustainability practices around the world, we see a situation where sustainability is, increasingly, a criterion for access to markets. How will these developments he has outlined maintain Singapore's competitiveness and access to markets around the world?",4,57,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00057
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Sir, I thank the hon Member Dr Tan Wu Meng for his questions. With regard to the opportunities arising from the transport of hydrogen, certainly, we do not rest on our laurels. If anything, given how we have gone through the last many decades, first, as a petrochemical, oil and gas centre of excellence for the last five decades, as we pivot into sustainable fuels into a low-carbon emission strategy, we envisaged that our strategic hub status we will continue to pivot. We will continue to leverage on what we have built thus far to become the crossroads once the transportation of liquid hydrogen or, for that matter, even in the trading of electrons, electricity. We can envisage that it is one market that we think we can leverage and become the hub in this entire region. Certainly, it is one of those initiatives that we are driving and actively looking at.",1,58,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00058
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Today, a number of technologies are quite nascent, even though they hold a lot of promise. There is option value in exploring and studying which is the likely initiative that is going to give us maximum benefit and maximum economic value. So, it is one of those things where we look at the myriad of opportunities that are available, the research and development, and we are plugged into many of these research initiatives; and once we are able to land and the vision gets clearer in terms of where each one of these technologies is moving, I think we will be able to leverage and extract the synergies that can help move us ahead.",2,59,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00059
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"With regard to the changing environment and the access to markets, if you look at where we are, how we are pivoting our entire oil and gas sector, we are looking at more sustainable development in terms of the fuels that we are in. Two big companies have come and invested in our country. One of them is Neste and the other one is Arkema. We are now looking at the production of sustainable aviation fuels as well, although, again, the technology is relatively nascent. It costs a lot more to pivot from existing fuels and natural gases to go into sustainable aviation fuel, but it is one of those things that we cannot ignore as well. There are separate initiatives that drive that part of it.",3,60,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00060
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"With regard to hydrogen today, it is very difficult and it is very, very expensive and it is not very productive, not very efficient for us to produce green hydrogen, which is the cleanest form of hydrogen in Singapore, because we are geographically disadvantaged. We would need renewable energy to produce this hydrogen here, locally.",4,61,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00061
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Hence, we have decided to adopt a strategy where we look at blue hydrogen, which is a low-carbon form of hydrogen, and how we can import it and then look at liberating that hydrogen from here.",5,62,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00062

2021-07-27-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Sir. Could I just ask, with these new exciting developments in hydrogen and CCUS, if they do become feasible, whether we are also then reviewing our projections on when we can reach net zero emissions? So, if hydrogen CCUS becomes visible, maybe can we reach net zero by 2050?",1,65,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00065
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"I thank the hon Member, Mr Louis Ng, for his very thought-provoking question. Today, our plan is to halve the emission by 2050 and to reach carbon neutrality of zero sometime in the second half of this century. We have every intention of reaching the target within the second half of this century. If we are able to bring it forward, that would be really an added bonus and it is something that we always will aspire to do.",1,66,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00066

He mentioned that one of the important objectives is demonstration projects. We know that one element of demonstration projects that have been rolled out in many countries around the world is hydrogen in the form of public transportation, especially buses and taxicabs. I am keenly aware of the negative demonstration example of cases like the Hindenburg, but I wonder, especially when we are looking to transition our fleet beyond just electricity to a low carbon future, whether this will be part of the push in terms of our public transportation.",1,68,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00068
2021-07-27-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"I thank Prof Lim for his question. We are looking at a couple of projects. I think, currently, there is a Low Carbon Energy Research Funding initiative, which is a multi-agency initiative involving A*STAR, EDB, Energy Market Authority (EMA), as well as the National Climate Change Secretariat and the National Research Foundation (NRF). I mentioned this earlier in my reply to Dr Tan Wu Meng's Parliamentary Questions (PQs). It is co-driven by EDB and EMA with A*STAR as the implementing agency on behalf of the Government.",1,69,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00069

But one of the key things that we are actively pursuing is looking at imports. We are looking at imports from the ASEAN countries and where we think that the countries that have maximum geographical advantage in terms of producing renewable energy with very low carbon or zero carbon, those are the immediate short-term measures that we will be moving forward to reduce our carbon footprint.",2,70,2021-07-27-T-003-S-00070
2021-07-27-T-004,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry can quantify the current extent of Singapore’s reliance on Filipino nurses; and (b) what is the impact on the Singapore healthcare system by Philippines’ move to suspend permits for nurses to work overseas.,1,71,2021-07-27-T-004-S-00071
2021-07-27-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Health),"Sir, according to the Singapore Nursing Board’s 2019 report, about 7,600, or 18%, of our nursing workforce are Filipino.",1,72,2021-07-27-T-004-S-00072
2021-07-27-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Health),MOH is closely monitoring the impact of the Philippines’ suspension of permits. We are working with healthcare employers to ensure the adequacy and sustainability of our nursing workforce. Healthcare employers should also diversify their recruitment sources.,2,73,2021-07-27-T-004-S-00073
2021-07-27-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Health),"Meanwhile, our local supply of nurses has grown. In 2020, there were around 1,400 new registrations from locals, compared to around 1,200 in 2019. This is a result of our past efforts to grow the nursing intake in our Institutes of Higher Learning. We will continue to enhance the attractiveness of the nursing profession and I hope more Singaporeans will join this noble profession, especially those who are considering a mid-career switch.",3,74,2021-07-27-T-004-S-00074

2021-07-27-T-004,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I have two clarifications for the Senior Minister of State. First is that when COVID-19 is regarded as endemic and restrictions are eased, infections are expected to increase and more vaccinated patients – vaccinated, that is the new protocol that was mentioned – will be at the care facilities. So, I would like to ask  will this new health protocol put more demand on nurses, as we evolve our health protocol with COVID-19 being endemic? That is the first question.",1,76,2021-07-27-T-004-S-00076
2021-07-27-T-004,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"The second question is  how can Singapore ramp up our own supply of nurses to reduce our reliance on foreign nurses? I think the number that the Senior Minister of State mentioned, in terms of yearly intake, it looks like it is a small number, if you ask me. How successful has our Professional Conversion Programme been in increasing the number of local nurses and how can this programme be further enhanced to accelerate the pace? If we are producing 1,400 per year, having put in a lot of effort, how can we accelerate that?",2,77,2021-07-27-T-004-S-00077
2021-07-27-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Sir, I thank the Member Ms Foo Mee Har for raising these two clarifications. On how we would want to deploy our medical manpower should there be more cases during the endemic phase that requires community care monitoring, I think it is important to understand the differences between acute hospital care requiring more intensive nursing care and community care that does not require the intensiveness of care monitoring. We have a few options.",1,78,2021-07-27-T-004-S-00078
2021-07-27-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"One is, of course, we do have a ramped-up plan for nurses to be deployed into some of these Community Care Facilities (CCFs). We experienced that during the earlier phase of the COVID-19 crisis last year, when we had a lot more foreign workers who were being cared for in the CCFs. There, we have a complement of nurses providing more medical supervision as well as doctors, but there is also a series of other care providers, volunteers, who are trained to actually use technology, for example, automatic blood pressure reading machines and oximeters, to also help to monitor the health status of those in those community care facilities. In that way, we actually stretched the role of the nurses through partnership with other care partners.",2,79,2021-07-27-T-004-S-00079
2021-07-27-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"For the second question on how we can ramp up our local supply of nurses, Singapore's stock of registered nurses increased by about 19% from 36,000 in 2013, to more than 42,000 in 2019. This translates to almost 7.5 registered nurses per 1,000 population, which is a good number compared to many other Asian economies like Hong Kong and Taiwan.",3,80,2021-07-27-T-004-S-00080
2021-07-27-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"But as the Member said correctly, as our population ages, there will be an increased demand for healthcare services and the manpower will have to increase commensurately. Members may remember that, earlier this year, in the Budget, we announced several measures to increase attraction of our locals to join the nursing profession. One is in the salary review, which was announced in the Budget this year. Public sector healthcare nurses will have an increase of about 5% to 14% in their monthly base salaries from July this year. It just kicked in this month and this will be phased in over the next two years. For publicly-funded community care organisations which require nurses, MOH will also increase funding support for wages to ensure that salaries in the community care settings are also competitive to attract locals to join this sector.",4,81,2021-07-27-T-004-S-00081
2021-07-27-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"We also encourage more flexible work arrangements. So, all healthcare clusters now have flexible work arrangements to help their workers strike a balance between their work and personal demands. These include part-time employment, compressed work week, flexible work schedules and hours. To facilitate the scheduling of work shifts, e-rostering will be scaled across the public health clusters by the end of 2021.",5,82,2021-07-27-T-004-S-00082
2021-07-27-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"There are also efforts to enhance professional development, such as through the launch of the Skills Framework for Healthcare and the National Nursing Academy, so that nurses can continue to upskill themselves and advance in their careers.",6,83,2021-07-27-T-004-S-00083
2021-07-27-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"It is through a multi-pronged approach. First, making sure that the work environment is much more conducive, much more flexible, but also creating different skill pathways for different entrants into different care roles to progressively go up into taking more advanced nursing roles. In that way, we create a more attractive environment for different people of different capabilities to join the healthcare sector and, especially, to attract the mid-career entrants.",7,84,2021-07-27-T-004-S-00084
2021-07-27-T-005,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,asked the Minister for National Development whether the proportion of units under the Married Child Priority Scheme can be increased for HDB's BTO projects within mature estates to facilitate inter-generational familial support.,1,85,2021-07-27-T-005-S-00085
2021-07-27-T-005,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Mr Deputy Speaker, the Married Child Priority Scheme, or MCPS, gives priority to families buying new HDB flats to live with or near their parents or married children. Under the MCPS, 30% of the new flat supply in the mature estates is set aside for first-timer families. For second-timer families, it is 3%.",1,86,2021-07-27-T-005-S-00086
2021-07-27-T-005,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"We recognise the importance of supporting the needs of parents and married children who wish to live with or near each other for mutual care and support and, therefore, set aside a significant proportion of flats of up to about one-third of our new flat supply in the mature estates under the MCPS. Other than the MCPS, we also have other schemes, such as the Multi-Generation Priority Scheme and Senior Priority Scheme, as well as 3Gen flats, to facilitate mutual care and support among families.",2,87,2021-07-27-T-005-S-00087
2021-07-27-T-005,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Within our limited flat supply, we also have to meet the housing needs of other groups of Singaporeans, including first-timer families with children via the Parenthood Priority Scheme, and families with three or more children via the Third Child Priority Scheme. Therefore, we are unable to increase the proportion of flats set aside under the MCPS at this juncture.",3,88,2021-07-27-T-005-S-00088
2021-07-27-T-005,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Having said that, we recognise that many children wish to live near their parents for mutual care and support. To meet the high demand for flats in mature estates, HDB has launched more flats in mature estates in recent years. The portion of BTO projects in the mature towns and estates increased from 44% in 2017, to 55% last year.",4,89,2021-07-27-T-005-S-00089

First, I wonder if the Minister has a figure on the proportion of applicants under MCPS compared to the supply of 30%; that means, how much in excess, in terms of percentage, might there be, on average, for the BTO projects launched?",1,92,2021-07-27-T-005-S-00092
2021-07-27-T-005,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Secondly, as Singapore society continues to age and as fertility rate is also hovering, a lot of young couples have expressed that they would really love to get a flat of their own while they start their families and be near their parents for mutual support, as they look into the future. With these trends, I certainly hope that MND can continue to consider this, to increase the proportion of units under MCPS.",2,93,2021-07-27-T-005-S-00093
2021-07-27-T-005,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Related to this, maybe, could I ask the Minister to share what kind of impact might there be in the composition of the local housing estate in the immediate or the mid- to longer term, if we increase the proportion of units under MCPS?",3,94,2021-07-27-T-005-S-00094

2021-07-27-T-006,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what are the top three ways by which the Ministry is alerted to potential kickback offences; (b) what are the respective percentages of cases that are reported via each of the top three ways by which the Ministry is alerted to kickback offences; and (c) how is the Ministry strengthening efforts to get workers to report kickback offences.,1,96,2021-07-27-T-006-S-00096
2021-07-27-T-006,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister of Manpower),"Sir, between 2016 and 2020, MOM looked into an average of 960 cases per year for kickback offences. Of these, about two-thirds are complaints lodged by migrant workers, one-third are referrals from members of the public, NGOs and other public agencies, while a small number are detected through MOM’s proactive inspections based on data analytics.",1,97,2021-07-27-T-006-S-00097
2021-07-27-T-006,,,"To encourage migrant workers to come forward to report kickbacks early without fear of reprisal from their employers, MOM will facilitate a change of employment for those who wish to continue to work here in Singapore. MOM will also refer affected migrant workers to selected employment agencies, which are committed not to charge these workers any fees for the job placement.",1,98,2021-07-27-T-006-S-00098
2021-07-27-T-006,,,"MOM also educates first-time migrant workers on kickback offences and ways to seek help through the mandatory Settling-In Programme. We have stepped up our engagement and education efforts by tapping on the network of migrant worker volunteers being developed by the Assurance, Care and Engagement (ACE) group and Migrant Workers' Centre (MWC) ambassadors to disseminate key employment messages. MOM will continue to work with community partners, leverage technology, such as the FWMOMCare app, and tap on social media channels to amplify these messages and reach out to more migrant workers.",2,99,2021-07-27-T-006-S-00099

2021-07-27-T-006,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Sir. I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. I know of migrant workers who paid over $10,000 in kickbacks to come to Singapore to work. I think, no matter how good our labour laws are, this huge power imbalance and the fact that they are so heavily in debt would make our laws quite ineffective because not many would dare to speak up.",1,101,2021-07-27-T-006-S-00101
2021-07-27-T-006,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Could I ask two clarifications? One, whether we can step up the protection for whistle-blowers. I think the Senior Minister of State mentioned about helping them find employment. But I think, in Taiwan, they go a step further by even providing financial incentives for those who reported the violations. Two, these kickbacks are so widespread, I am just wondering whether MOM is doing anything else to try and curb this illegal practice.",2,102,2021-07-27-T-006-S-00102
2021-07-27-T-006,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Sir, I must first contextualise the extent of the problem because the Member believes that this is a very widespread problem. But in terms of kickback-related complaints, this forms only about 10% of all the complaints that MOM receives in a typical year. Instead of focusing on giving financial incentives for people who are, especially migrant workers who come forward and make that complaint, it is more likely important to help them understand what exactly a kickback is. The Settling-In Programme is very important in helping them be aware what constitutes a kickback and then, to explain to them that, actually, they would be protected from loss of jobs should they report the employer for collecting illegal kickbacks. I think that is something that we should work a lot to reassure our migrant workers so that they feel comfortable coming forward.",1,103,2021-07-27-T-006-S-00103
2021-07-27-T-006,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"But the other side of the equation is to impose strict penalties and make sure that we take a strong stance against employers who resort to such illegal activities, so that the deterrence should be on the side of the employers, not so much as incentivising through financial means, to induce our foreign workers to come forward. I think what they look for is more protection and job security and that is something that we want to provide.",2,104,2021-07-27-T-006-S-00104
2021-07-27-T-006,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"The financial disincentive for employers to do so is already enshrined in our Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, where if they are convicted for kickbacks, they will be liable to a maximum fine of $30,000 or imprisonment up to two years or both, per offence.",3,105,2021-07-27-T-006-S-00105

The rail network will also be complemented by a comprehensive public bus network and it will be supported by integrated transport hubs to encourage greater use of public transport. Further, JID will also be a car-lite district, with tighter vehicle parking provision norms of 50% of the usual standards. An 11-kilometre-long Sky Corridor will also seamlessly connect pedestrians and commuters from the nearby JRL stations to all other destinations in the vicinity via walking and cycling without having to interact with vehicles at ground level.",4,115,2021-07-27-T-007-S-00115
2021-07-27-T-007,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran),"Second, we will substantially reduce emissions from our vehicle population. We envisage all vehicles to run on cleaner energy by 2040. Since 2020, all new public bus purchases have been fully electric or hybrid models. Additionally, all new bus infrastructure, such as depots and interchanges, will be designed and built to support these cleaner energy buses. For private cars and motorcycles, growth rates have been capped at zero since 2018. To encourage the take-up of cleaner vehicles, we have a suite of measures to incentivise the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and we will be significantly expanding public EV charging infrastructure. JID and the Jurong industrial estate area are part of the Jurong West and Tengah towns, which are designed and designated to be EV-ready towns.

I ask this question because I have a resident who is probably one of a very few cases whereby the MDW was diagnosed with several sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and it was discovered only on her way to the airport to take a flight back home. The work permit at that point would have been terminated. Nobody knew until she detoured to see a doctor. She was sent to the hospital and was hospitalised; the bill came up to about five figures. The employer who was an elderly was expected to be responsible for the bill.",1,126,2021-07-27-T-008-S-00126

But in this case, it seemed to be an excessive burden on the employer. To be fair, MOM and the hospital did try to come in to provide assistance. But my question is, is it equitable in such instances, albeit rare, for the employer to take up such a responsibility? Should the responsibility, therefore, be shared by the MDW?",2,127,2021-07-27-T-008-S-00127

2021-07-27-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"But let me start with this. I recognise that employers generally depend on their Migrant Domestic Workers for a variety of reasons, whether it is help for cleaning, whether it is caregiving for the elders or children. When we employ a Migrant Domestic Worker, one thing we have to note is that we are not just hiring an employee. We are also having a person, a human. So, there is a benefit that we get from the work; there is also the risk of indiscretion, just like any humans, just like us.",2,129,2021-07-27-T-008-S-00129
2021-07-27-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Under the current framework, employers are liable for the Migrant Domestic Workers' medical bills as it is a more reasonable approach than to externalise such costs and impose them onto taxpayers, for example. We understand that due to the MDW's varying financial situations, we know that they are paid above several hundred dollars a month. Therefore, in terms of affordability, it is certainly very difficult. Therefore, we also have a medical insurance scheme today. This medical insurance scheme covers up to 95% of most medical bills. Of course, there are extenuating circumstances in cases like the one the Member highlighted. So, employers who face many difficulties, as the Member shared, MOM will try to help them out and there are schemes and funds.",3,130,2021-07-27-T-008-S-00130
2021-07-27-T-008,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Minister Tan See Leng shared in a Parliamentary Question (PQ) earlier this year, that hospitals administer on our behalf, to help the outlier cases, such as this. Rest assured, whether they are work-related or not work-related, we will try to help employers as much as we can. But, ultimately, it is a fine balance that we are trying to also achieve. This is where MOM comes in. Because what we are trying to do, is to make sure that the worker is not denied appropriate treatment, despite the fact that the employer may not be able to afford the full medical bill as well.",4,131,2021-07-27-T-008-S-00131

The EV Early Adoption Incentive and the enhanced Vehicular Emissions Scheme, both launched earlier this year, help to narrow the upfront cost gap between electric cars and internal combustion engine cars.

I would like to ask the Minister to clarify the rationale behind capping the voluntary savings under CPF LIFE because, even under the Enhanced Retirement Sum scheme, Singaporeans can only expect a basic level of income – I would say basic, even if it is enhanced – of about over $2,000 at 65 years old for the cohort turning 55 now. And I think the House would agree that, at the current cost of living, $2,000 is quite basic and this is at an enhanced level.",2,157,2021-07-27-T-011-S-00157

Generally, they are receptive and supportive of the course but they also shared some concerns. One of them is that the course, being a year long, they are wondering whether part of it, since there is an online element, could be done when they are studying overseas. In this way, when they come back, it cuts down the course duration and they can get into the workforce sooner.",3,187,2021-07-27-T-013-S-00187

In one instance, my elderly resident lost over a dozen gold accessories and items, which were pawned away by her domestic worker on different occasions to two pawnshop chains over a one-year period. A Police report was made but these pawnshops merely offered the family a discount on the redemption.",2,199,2021-07-27-T-014-S-00199

2021-07-27-T-014,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"I thank the Member for her question. I can empathise with the situation that the Member's resident is faced with.

2021-07-27-T-014,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"But I think the larger question that she is asking is, what are the customer due diligence checks that are in place? As I have mentioned earlier in my main reply, the Pawnbrokers Act requires pawnbrokers to take reasonable steps to ensure that the goods they deal in are not stolen or obtained through fraudulent or dishonest means. That would require the pawnbrokers to do the first step, to do the customer due diligence, through measures, such as obtaining and verifying the information and identity of the person who comes into the pawnshop, before any transaction has taken place. Some of the practices on the ground also involve the pawnbrokers asking questions about the cost, the ownership as well as specifications of the goods and even to ask for the proof of purchase and screening against the information they obtain from the Police.",2,202,2021-07-27-T-014-S-00202
2021-07-27-T-014,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Even with all these, as I can see from the Member's question, there may be instances where owners have found these belongings that have been stolen landing in the second-hand dealer shop or the pawnshop. Members of the public who find themselves in these situations can then report these to the Police or lodge complaints with the Registry of Pawnbrokers under MinLaw so that investigations can take place.",3,203,2021-07-27-T-014-S-00203

2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Over and above dealing with the problems of adolescence, they are all learning to cope with the pressures of a competitive, high-performing environment. Previous generations also faced their own considerable challenges, including poverty and war. But perhaps for our youths growing up in today’s complex and fast-paced world, their challenges are intensified by what happens online, where comparisons are incessant and unrelenting, adding yet another layer of social pressure.",27,250,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00250
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"This is why, as a society, we must continuously improve and strengthen our support system to better prepare our children to not only withstand the pressures they face but also thrive despite these pressures. We cannot shield our children from pressures entirely, any more than we can shield them from the common challenges of adolescence. But we must do all we can to help our children find themselves and find their footing in an intense environment.",28,251,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00251
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Our approach should not only be to strengthen the overall system of support, but to engender a much more caring, much more nurturing environment in our society. I will share some of our support measures from upstream prevention, to the identification of and the intervention for those at risk. I will then touch on the whole-of-society efforts we need to support our younger generation.",29,252,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00252
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, social emotional skills and resilience building form the foundation of MOE’s mental health efforts and have been part of our Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum for some time. This year, we began implementing the revised CCE curriculum, starting with lower Secondary levels. It includes enhanced features on Mental Health Education, designed to develop our students’ mental health literacy. For example, they learn to differentiate normal stress from distress and mental illness, so that they can seek help before becoming overwhelmed. These CCE lessons also teach them to break negative thinking patterns, overcome social emotional problems, seek help when they need to and manage their emotions. Students are also taught how to actively stand up against stigma around mental health issues.",30,253,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00253
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Peer support is another crucial pillar in our efforts. All our schools are putting in place a peer support system to encourage students to look out for one another. Our hope is for all students to learn to sit with a friend who is distressed, show empathy and care and encourage him or her to seek help from trusted adults like parents, teachers or counsellors.",31,254,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00254
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Every school has a support network for our students in need. Beyond equipping our students with the basic coping mechanisms, our teachers keep a watchful eye over their students and provide a listening ear. If they notice something amiss, teachers reach out and guide our students to work on their difficulties as they are trained with basic counselling skills.",32,255,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00255

2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"COVID-19 safe management measures were implemented in schools so that our children can be physically in schools with their teachers and classmates for as much as possible. At the same time, however, we have had to suspend many interactive and community activities, like Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs), National School Games, Cohort Camps and Learning Journeys. These activities are avenues for our young people to build bonds and to grow up in a balanced way, emotionally, physically and psychologically. We plan to reinstate such activities in full as soon as the COVID-19 situation allows for it.",39,262,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00262

2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"First, we will strengthen the support network in our schools. All teachers will receive enhanced professional development on mental health literacy as a baseline. This will further strengthen our ability to identify and support students in need.",42,265,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00265
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We also aim to deploy more than 1,000 teacher counsellors in the next few years. This is an increase from the over 700 teacher counsellors we have currently deployed in schools.",43,266,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00266
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"All schools now have at least one school counsellor, while some have two. Where feasible, we will recruit more school counsellors or re-role suitable educators to augment the counselling support network.",44,267,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00267
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"For our students, we will bring back CCAs for Secondary schools and pre-Universities within the next few weeks, as more students complete their vaccinations. We are currently putting our plans together on how CCAs can be conducted safely within national safe management measures.",45,268,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00268
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We will also dedicate more time and attention to checking in on the well-being of our students regularly. Schools currently have orientation programmes for new students at the start of every school year. Henceforth, teachers will devote time at the start of every school term to check in on the well-being of their students and guide them to know how, where and when to get help.",46,269,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00269
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Next, because of the disruptions to learning caused by COVID-19, we will remove the Common Last Topics (CLT) from the 2021 GCE examinations. Last month, we had announced the removal of the CLTs for the 2021 Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). The Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus has created much greater disruptions than envisaged and has affected the social and emotional well-being of our students. We are especially concerned for the graduating cohorts, so we will also remove the CLT from the 2021 GCE ""O"", ""N"" and ""A"" level examinations. While these topics would have already been taught in schools, removing them from the national examinations would help to relieve the revision load and examination stress for our students.",47,270,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00270
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Finally, for the non-graduating students, given the COVID-19 disruptions, all schools will also reduce the scope of their 2021 end-of-year examinations to alleviate their revision load.",48,271,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00271

MOH and MSF have set up a new inter-agency task force, which transited from the COVID-19 Mental Wellness Task Force. Chaired by Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary, this task force brings together the capabilities and capacities of different agencies to develop an overarching national strategy and action plan on mental health and well-being.

Since February 2020, people from all walks of life have contributed to the Youth Mental Well-being Network.

These projects include creating programmes to enhance emotional resilience, bringing inspirational stories of hope to our youth and increasing parents' emotional literacy.",53,276,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00276

2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"At the same time, I encourage all of us to look within our own social circles and start from here.

2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We can have more frank conversations with our children and families on the definition of success. As a parent myself, I have come to realise that success must be defined by helping my children to realise their own potential, develop their own strengths and, ultimately, be confident in themselves. Success cannot, should not and must not be the constant need to be compared with someone else and having to live up to somebody else's image.",57,280,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00280
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The greatest gift that we can give our children is to accept and love them unconditionally and help them be at ease with who they are.

2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me turn to the issue of school security. I have discussed this issue with school leaders and they were unanimous in their responses. School is like a second home to our children and all of us. It is a safe place where values are cultivated, lifelong relationships built and a shared identity forged. It is a warm and supportive environment that allows students with different learning needs and aspirations to discover their passions and develop their strengths. And above all, it is a trusted space.",64,287,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00287
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We have implemented various security measures in schools. For example, schools are secured with physical barriers, such as fences, roller shutters, CCTVs and alarm systems, that can trigger an alert in the event of an intrusion.

2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In our efforts to enhance security at our schools, we do not want to compromise the quality of school experience for our staff and students. I have asked myself this difficult question  what would it feel like if I must empty my pockets, be frisked and have my bag checked before stepping through my house door or school gate? Also, how would my fellow family members and students feel? How would we relate to one another in such an environment? Will it still be home? Or will it create in me a siege mentality? None of us wish to return to a home with metal scanners and bag checks.",68,291,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00291
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"But I can understand that parents are understandably worried. The security and well-being of our students and staff are critical and schools must continue to be safe places for students to learn, grow and play.",69,292,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00292
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The real key to staying safe lies not with more intrusive security measures, but in prevention and enhanced community vigilance. We all have a collective role to play in looking out for potentially deviant or worrying behaviours and report possible threats in our midst. We do not want to turn our schools into fortresses, which will create unease and stress amongst our staff and students. We also do not wish to paradoxically engender a siege mentality amongst students and staff, causing them to take extreme measures to protect themselves, at the expense of a shared sense of security.",70,293,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00293

2021-07-27-T-017,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am a father of three children, one in Primary school, one in Secondary school and one in Junior College. And I have also spent considerable time with the staff and students in River Valley High School in my last five years as the Member of Parliament for Boon Lay constituency. My heart really goes out to the affected families as well as the staff and the students. As what the Minister has mentioned earlier, the response by the River Valley High School community in the face of this adversity has been commendable. In the face of this tragic incident, teachers, school leaders, staff, including parents and alumni, deserve our full support and encouragement.",1,314,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00314
2021-07-27-T-017,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),I have a few questions for the Minister.,2,315,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00315
2021-07-27-T-017,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Firstly, whether any aspects of the incident management could have been improved upon and should we not have called for a time-out, such as in the SAF or in the workplaces, when such incidents happen.",3,316,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00316
2021-07-27-T-017,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Second, in light of this incident, whether MOE will take cognisance of students who are patients at IMH or even various public sector child guidance clinics, including those seeking psychiatric treatment, for example, at private hospitals and clinics, so that the educators will be sensitised and better prepared to support and prevent trigger events?",4,317,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00317
2021-07-27-T-017,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Thirdly, whether MOE can consider doing regular surveys with students at all levels to assess their stress levels and also the challenges they face growing up and, especially, if they are depressed?",5,318,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00318
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr Patrick Tay for his questions and also his support for the River Valley High School community. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are still conducting a review of the conduct, the way which the incident unfolded and how it was managed.",1,319,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00319
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Our preliminary sense was that the students have applied their drills as they were taught, they maintained their composure, locked themselves in their classroom and sought help immediately. That was well done. To the teachers who responded to the incident, I must say that I was very touched by how they calmly led away the 16-year-old, while protecting the rest of the children in the events that unfolded.",2,320,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00320
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"So, there are many positives that I think we can take away from this incident, despite the tragedy. I would like to thank the Police and SCDF for responding swiftly to our call for help.",3,321,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00321
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the first issue of a time-out for the school, we had considered this and discussed with our professional colleagues if this was the best way for us to manage the incident. The consensus amongst the professional colleagues was that we should try to let the school come together, take stock of the situation and support one another, rather than to let individuals grieve alone in their homes. But we also recognise that some students and staff may need additional support or may wish to have time and space to make sense of what has happened and grieve. That was why we adopted the posture to continue school on Wednesday, while allowing those who require the additional support to take leave of absence away from school.",4,322,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00322
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In the last few days, we have seen positive responses from the River Valley High School community. We were encouraged to see both students and staff progressively regaining the daily rhythm of their school life and it is a healthy sign. But having said that, we know that the implications from this particular incident may still take some time to unfold. That is why, be it in River Valley High School or beyond River Valley High School, we have asked all our staff, teachers and principals to take extra precaution to be more alert to those individuals who might be distressed and need additional help.",5,323,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00323
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the second issue, yes, MOE, to the extent possible, within the ambit of the medical-in-confidence rules, we work closely with MHA and MOH, particularly, if there is a threat that the person in distress might pose to the community.",6,324,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00324
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,But it is a fine balance. We want to respect the medical-in-confidence. We want to encourage people to come forward and seek help. We do not want people to put off seeking help because they think that they might be stigmatised or that their medical records will be shared with other agencies.,7,325,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00325
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,And this is why we will always respect the medical-in-confidence record of the students and staff unless they agree to pass it over to us.,8,326,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00326
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"But having said that, in situations – and that has happened before, including in recent weeks – where if the agencies from MHA to MOH make an assessment that a particular distressed individual might be of harm to the wider community, then we would work with the community partners to manage the situation together.",9,327,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00327
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the third question that Mr Patrick Tay asked, yes, that is why we want to institute regular check-ins with our students and staff to make sure that if and when they need help, they know where to go, they know how to manage the situation. But having said that, we are fully cognisant that for distressed individuals, coming forward to seek help may not be something that they may be comfortable with or know how to do. In fact, beyond those who come forward to seek help, we are constantly on the lookout for people who might be troubled but do not come forward to seek help, maybe because they fear being stigmatised or they fear that they will not be accepted.",10,328,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00328
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"And this is why we want to send out a message to everyone that if you need help, come forward. Let us, as a community, embrace them with care and compassion, so that they need not fear that they will be stigmatised or rejected by us. And we will continue to do that.",11,329,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00329
2021-07-27-T-017,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Ms Sylvia Lim.,1,330,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00330
2021-07-27-T-017,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have a question for the Minister on school security in general. I am aware that many schools hire an Operations Manager, who is usually someone with military or law enforcement experience. And certainly, I think we can see that this is helpful if the school has to manage any security or other incidents. So, I would like to ask the Minister whether this is a baseline requirement for all schools, that they need to have an Operations Manager with such experience.",1,331,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00331
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, all schools have an operations security personnel. As to whether it is a prerequisite for them to be trained previously in the security agencies, be it the SAF or MHA, that would be useful, but it is not a prerequisite because there are also other operational managers that bring with them security experiences, organisational experiences, beyond the SAF and MHA.",1,332,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00332
2021-07-27-T-017,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Dr Wan Rizal.,1,333,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00333
2021-07-27-T-017,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I would like to thank the Minister for the heartfelt and reassuring Statement. The incident has hit many of us hard. As a parent, I share the sadness, the fear and the disappointment. As an educator, we wear many hats. We are not just the curators of knowledge, the choreographers of behaviour. We are not just disciplinarians, we are their friend, we are their confidant. When things go south, it is very easy to pinpoint the teachers and the staff. For the past week, thoughts of doubts, what ifs, maybes, have filled many of our heads, but, fundamentally and rationally, I know that schools must remain a safe space. The security within our schools goes a long way in instilling confidence in our students, parents, teachers and staff.",1,334,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00334
2021-07-27-T-017,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"Thus, my first clarification is, while we do not want schools to be made into fortresses, what security preparedness drills and initiatives are our schools equipped with? And, fundamentally, are our teachers prepared for major incidents? How else can we strengthen our school security so that schools remain a safe space for all?",2,335,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00335
2021-07-27-T-017,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"Inevitably, mental health is the talk of the town. My worry is that this talk will equate to fear and resets our efforts in destigmatising mental health. We want our students, teachers and staff to be able to easily and readily step forward to receive support whenever they need it. Thus, my second clarification is, how would the Ministry ensure that while we relook into mental health in schools and the approaches that we are going to take, it does not increase the stigmatisation and prevent people from stepping forward and asking for help?",3,336,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00336
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for his kind words for our teachers and educators. Indeed, it is not easy to be a teacher. Today, the role of a teacher goes beyond just imparting knowledge to our younger generation. They take on many responsibilities, including the guidance of our children in their social-emotional development, in their career choices and so forth. In my short time in MOE, I have seen the determination in our teachers to want to do the best for the children under their charge, no matter how hard it might be or how tough or how varied the challenges might be.",1,337,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00337
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the drills for the students, when we did the drills with the students, the baseline scenario was in the event of a terrorist incident, an external threat. How to lock down the schools, how to keep the boundaries of the school safe, how to shutter down to have safe spaces for our students and staff such that we can buy time until reinforcement or the security forces arrive.",2,338,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00338
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Having said that, in the response to this particular incident, I think the students and teachers all showed the presence of mind to be able to apply their drills, albeit learnt for a different scenario, into this scenario to safeguard one another. So, I think we will need to continue to have a variety of scenarios to alert our security managers, students and staff to the range of threats that might happen.",3,339,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00339
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Despite that range of threats, some of the basic fundamental drills, the principles behind the drills, are applicable. And that has been demonstrated in this particular incident.",4,340,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00340
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I have discussed with my school principals as well. We would, of course, like to have more of our teachers cross-trained in security incident management. We will want to do that. And going forward, we will want to expand the group of people who are trained in such incident management so that every school can have the confidence to respond adequately should such an incident happen.",5,341,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00341
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Today, teachers and staff do get posted and rostered to different schools. At any point in time, the schools have a responsibility to make sure that they have an intact incident management team and they have sufficient trained people to execute the drills with the students. Because of the posting cycle, in the event there is a shortfall, we will quickly remedy that by making sure that the necessary people are trained to execute the actions accordingly.",6,342,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00342
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the second point, it is something that concerns us as well. We have asked ourselves, that through this incident, will our wider community, instead of embracing and helping those in distress, end up rejecting them, ostracising them or stigmatising them? That is why today, I want to make an appeal to everyone to not do this. To be able to step forward to seek help is not a sign of weakness. It takes courage to step forward and seek help. Let us help those people in distress in our own ways by, first, not stigmatising them, but by accepting them as part of our community.",7,343,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00343
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Maybe, very importantly for us to remember, is that the mental distress that some members of our community go through can happen to anyone of us. Anyone of us. And that is why we need to be conscious that this can happen to anyone and, therefore, we need to adopt a collective attitude to help one another through this. It does not mean that people who suffer from mental distress will not recover. Given the right support, the right care environment, there is every chance that we can help one another go through the dark valleys of life.",8,344,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00344
2021-07-27-T-017,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Mr Murali Pillai.,1,345,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00345
2021-07-27-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I join the hon Minister in expressing our sadness to the affected families and our wishes for them to overcome their grief, as well as our wishes to the affected students, teachers, staff and Principal of River Valley High School in overcoming the tragedy that befell them.",1,346,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00346
2021-07-27-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the hon Minister for his personal leadership in handling this tough incident. I know that I speak for a number of hon Members of Parliament as well. He can be assured that he has our full support in his endeavour to make River Valley High School emerge stronger and the rest of the school system stronger as well.,2,347,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00347
2021-07-27-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Sir, I have a question in relation to making mental resilience a desired outcome of education for all students. As the Minister mentioned, already, certain subjects or certain programmes in schools are geared towards this. He had also shared that if he were to just target those students who are susceptible to mental issues, there would be an issue of stigma, they may not come forward.",3,348,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00348
2021-07-27-T-017,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"So, why do we not put mental resilience as a strategic objective in school and ensure that our children, when they emerge from the education system, are mentally resilient to deal with the challenges of the future? This will resonate throughout because when they enter the workforce, they will be mentally resilient; when they become parents, they will be mentally resilient; and so on.",4,349,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00349
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we fully agree with Mr Murali Pillai that mental resilience is one of the outcomes we want from our education system.",1,350,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00350
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Indeed, perhaps this is even more important than ever before. I have described the kind of new challenges that our young people have to go through growing up nowadays. The world will become more uncertain, more turbulent. Success in the future will not just depend on our technical competencies. Success in the future will very much also depend on the resilience of our people as individuals and as a society. That is why we fully agree with Mr Murali Pillai.",2,351,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00351
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"This is the reason why we want to balance our curriculum. Despite COVID-19, we want to bring back CCAs for the older students as soon as possible. This is part of character development. This is part of the process for them to build social bonds and to develop their emotional and psychological resilience; and we will do this as soon as we can.",3,352,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00352
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We will find ways to do this, notwithstanding COVID-19, because the school is not just about academic pursuits. School is about the holistic development of our children. We definitely want to do more for our students in this turbulent world and we thank Mr Murali Pillai for his support.",4,353,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00353
2021-07-27-T-017,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Dr Shahira Abdullah.,1,354,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00354
2021-07-27-T-017,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I thank Minister Chan for the Statement. I would also like to express my sadness over the incident. I have a few clarifications.",1,355,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00355
2021-07-27-T-017,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),Number one  preliminary investigations revealed that the 16-year-old was already assessed at IMH before. What is MOE's strategy with suicide prevention and post-self-harm and suicide attempts for students?,2,356,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00356
2021-07-27-T-017,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),Number two  what is MOE doing to raise awareness in not just teachers but students as well? Because such a shock could easily render a student and teacher helpless and not knowing that he or she actually needs help.,3,357,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00357
2021-07-27-T-017,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"One last question  should there be students or teachers who are deeply affected by the incident but are afraid to seek the counselling services that MOE has set in place due to entrenched stigma, what are the alternative platforms they might be able to turn to and are they actually aware of these?",4,358,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00358
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to Dr Shahira's first question, this is, please excuse me, I cannot speak about this particular incident in specific, because the case is before the Courts. But I will speak in more general terms of how we deal with the medical records of people who seek help.",1,359,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00359
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I would just like to assure everyone that when someone comes forward to seek help, we respect the medical-in-confidence information. This will not be passed around to different agencies. Only in the exceptional cases where there is a real threat, the agencies might then take actions to work with other agencies to pre-empt this.",2,360,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00360
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I give an example. If somebody steps forward and seeks help, we will keep the information in confidence. But if somebody, in the process of seeking help, exhibits behaviour or expresses an intention to harm somebody else in a certain context, then the agency has a responsibility to verify and see if further actions are required to safeguard the well-being of the distressed individual and the well-being of the community.",3,361,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00361
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the second issue, indeed, that is why, today, we make a call for us to adopt a whole-of-nation approach, for all of us as Members of this House to go forth and help us spread this message, that it is okay. It is okay to seek help. It can happen to any of us. It is okay to seek help. It is okay to seek help early and there is no stigmatisation to seeking help. We should not, in our own behaviour, in any way, ostracise or stigmatise people who come forward and seek help.",4,362,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00362
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the third point, we are very aware and I am very concerned. It is not just that some young people do not know how to seek help or where to seek help. We have also come across cases whereby parents are unsure how to seek help and where to seek help. That is why it requires us as a community to reach out to students, to youths, to families in distress to encourage them to seek help. And it need not go through the school. There are community services available. There are professionals available. But the important point is to help the distressed individual or family, to point them in the right direction so that they have the confidence that they are not alone. This is an ongoing challenge that we must all undertake together as a community.",5,363,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00363
2021-07-27-T-017,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Ms Carrie Tan.,1,364,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00364
2021-07-27-T-017,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Firstly, my condolences to the family and friends of the deceased.",1,365,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00365
2021-07-27-T-017,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"I am heartened that the Minister has taken a very decisive step, amidst this tragedy, a step to decelerate the pace and to scope down on our major examinations when it is needed to prioritise the mental health of our students and teachers.",2,366,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00366
2021-07-27-T-017,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"At the same time, I would like to ask the House and our people to avoid knee-jerk reactions, but allow the death of this precious young life to be a beacon of light for us to ask the right questions and the deeper questions to seek the answers on what is needed to protect and nurture the mental health of our people.",3,367,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00367
2021-07-27-T-017,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"To that purpose, I ask the Minister how are we strengthening our mental health discovery and support measures? Does this currently involve a systematic way of tracking incidents across the system to shed light on the current condition of our youths' mental health and what may have led up to its current condition?",4,368,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00368
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Member Ms Carrie Tan has raised very important and valid points. The mental wellness of our society is something that we must take seriously, both at the individual level and at the community level.",1,369,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00369
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"At the individual level, for the children who are still in school, we have a system to watch over them, to understand their challenges and to provide them with the support. But as Ms Carrie Tan suggested, we need to do more on two fronts.",2,370,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00370
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"One, how do we systematically help a distressed individual over time? This is why, in some schools, when the distressed individual has been identified, we assign dedicated teachers to help the individual, even though the teacher may no longer be the form teacher of the class. Because one of the key things about individuals seeking help is that it requires trust for a distressed individual to open up, to share with someone they can trust. The trust required to help someone in distress requires time to build up.",3,371,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00371
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"That is why I am encouraged by the actions of many of our teachers who take it upon themselves to monitor and help students even when the students are no longer under their direct charge. It is this very intricate trust relationship that allows our students to open up with their problems. Because it is not always that our children feel comfortable opening up to even their family members. Sometimes, they need someone else and we are here to provide them with that additional channel.",4,372,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00372
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the other hand, we are also concerned with the younger people who have left the school system. They might be starting work. They might be pursuing other aspirations. They do not necessarily have the same formal structure of support that we are able to provide in the school. This is where, as a community, we must also find ways to reach out to these distressed individuals and let them know that, even beyond the school system, there is help and there are resources available in the community to help individuals and families in distress.",5,373,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00373
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"It is not easy to pick out someone who is in distress but may not be prepared to open up. It takes a certain depth of relationship to understand the individual, to know that something is wrong and then be able to gain the trust of the individual to seek help and go for professional help, if need be. So, these are things that, I think, we need to do better as a community. It goes beyond individuals, it goes beyond agencies, but it does require all of us to be extra vigilant to distressed individuals who might be among us.",6,374,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00374
2021-07-27-T-017,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,Ms He Ting Ru.,1,375,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00375
2021-07-27-T-017,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Thank you. I have some clarifications for the Minister. The first is how are we going to address the stigmatisation that may occur, that mental health issues do not equate to a propensity for violence, particularly given what has just happened? How do we make sure that these messages and these erroneous messages do not end up being propagated and what sort of attention is being paid to this?",1,376,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00376
2021-07-27-T-017,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Secondly, just now, the Minister actually mentioned that the CCE curriculum for lower Secondary has been updated. I would like to know what is actually being done at the Primary School and lower levels, for example, pre-school, and what support and resources are available to parents of younger children who are worried about the mental condition or mental health of their younger children.",2,377,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00377
2021-07-27-T-017,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Thirdly, the Minister mentioned earlier that 540 students or individuals have sought help in the wake of this incident at River Valley High School. Given that there are 98 counsellors available, would this actually lead to a waitlist? For example, I understand that there might be a couple of months of waiting list for counselling services or mental health support services at Universities like NUS. So, I just wanted to know how is the waitlist being managed?",3,378,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00378
2021-07-27-T-017,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"And then, finally, just a word on the workload of teachers. I understand that a lot of teachers are feeling very stressed out because, apart from teaching curriculum, making sure that they are giving the counselling for careers, they are now also expected to look out for their students' well-being. This is a good thing, but I just wanted to know what sort of support is going to be given and available to teachers to make sure that they themselves are not stressed by the extra workload?",4,379,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00379
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we agree with Ms He Ting Ru that we must not stigmatise people who come forward to seek help. We also agree and we hope that the House will help us spread this message  not every distressed individual is a violent individual. The distress can be expressed in various forms. It could be expressed in being withdrawn, it could be expressed in self-harm and, perhaps, in extremis, and only in extremis, it expresses itself in harming others. So, I think we all can help to spread this message.",1,380,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00380
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Second, having done the review of the CCE curriculum, for the Secondary schools – and in the process of implementing it – MOE will continue to comb through and update the rest of the CCE curriculum, including for the Primary schools.",2,381,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00381
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Third, yes, while over 500 have come forward to seek help, I want to share with Members that not all 500 require the same level of intervention. And that is why there is a protocol for us in the system to triage the needs of both the students and the staff. For example, I have explained the support structure in the school and, that is, in a sense, a way for us to triage the needs of the students.",3,382,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00382
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"At the more fundamental level, perhaps the teachers or the teacher-counsellors will be adequate. At a different level of help required, then, we have the school counsellors and the professional counsellors beyond the school system.",4,383,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00383
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,This is how we work the system to triage to make sure that the respective individuals get the appropriate level of help for them to overcome their challenges. And we will continue to do this.,5,384,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00384
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The Member brought up a valid point. That is why, in the River Valley High School incident, we are most concerned with both the mental well-being of our students and staff. In fact, many of the staff who responded to the incident, they might require some assistance. We will continue to provide the necessary assistance for them.",6,385,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00385
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"But Ms He Ting Ru also raised this point that perhaps all of us can also do our part to support our teachers. All of us, as parents, we can do our part to support our teachers. Bearing in mind, as what has been shared, that the load on today's teachers has heightened, because of the need to take care of many other matters, including the emotional well-being of our children beyond their academics. As parents, let us work together with our teachers. Find ways that we can support our teachers as well, in peacetime and in crisis.",7,386,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00386
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Let us work through the Parent Support Group, so that the Parent Support Group not only supports the school, but also supports one another and be an added avenue for parents or children who require additional help, to have an additional channel of support.",8,387,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00387

2021-07-27-T-017,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (East Coast),"Thank you, Deputy Speaker. Let me begin by expressing my sincere condolences to the family of the deceased. Sir, it seems to be that the incidence of bullying in schools is on the rise.",1,389,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00389
2021-07-27-T-017,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (East Coast),"So, I would like to ask the Minister if this particular tragedy and also those students who have come forward to seek help or counselling, could it also be related to bullying? And what is MOE doing to address these cases of bullying, as well as cyber bullying in schools?",2,390,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00390
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in this particular incident, the preliminary Police investigations suggest that the two individuals do not know each other beforehand. So, the 13-year-old and the 16-year-old did not know each other prior. It does not suggest that bullying was the cause of this particular incident.",1,391,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00391
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Having said that, we recognise that, in today's environment, be it physical bullying, or cyber bullying, it is an issue that we must grapple with.",2,392,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00392
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"MOE's stance is very clear  we do not stand for such behaviour in our schools. But we are also cognisant that, in today's society, perhaps the cyber bullying is an even greater challenge compared to the physical bullying, because this takes place away from what most of us can see around us. It takes place in the cyberspace; it takes place in the social media that our teenagers and children are exposed to.",3,393,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00393
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"And I think we need to do two things as a society to manage this challenge. On the one hand, we need to send a clear message to the perpetrators of the bullying, be it physical or cyber, that this is not what our society stands for, that bullying is actually a sign of weakness, that you are not confident of yourself, that you have to try and tear down someone. This is not what we stand for in Singapore. This is not what we will tolerate in Singapore, that all of us, as adults, have the opportunity and responsibility to amplify the positivity, both in the physical world and in the cyber domain, to be good role models to our younger generation; that be it in our choice of words or actions, that we seek to edify, we seek to build, rather than to seek to destroy.",4,394,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00394
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I am sure Members will agree with me the cyber bullying issue is causing distress, not just only to our young. Even adults, grown-ups, suffer from the consequences of such actions. It could be unkind words on the social media, it could be the incessant and unrelenting comparison to make someone feel, perhaps, less adequate. These are all actions that tear down rather than build up. We have a collective responsibility and we all have the agency to do something about this as a society.",5,395,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00395
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the other hand, we need to better equip our younger generation to deal with this, to manage this, because it may not go away anytime soon. And that is why we need to build the confidence in our people, in our young, especially, that they can be confident in themselves, that they can accept themselves as who they are. They do not need to seek affirmation from their social media feeds or feel that they must be pressurised to only show that perfect image of themselves, as if the whole world is perfect, except us. That would be a very sad state of affairs.",6,396,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00396
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In fact, I always remind the students that I meet that the only reason why those posts are on the social media feed is because they are not the norm. People post when they find something that is out of the norm. The artificial image that everything is perfect in the social media world is unreal.",7,397,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00397
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Most of us wake up every day feeling average. Most of us, definitely for me, we all look average. So, there is no need for us to feel that we must live up to somebody else's image and be held ransom by such a psychology. And this is what we need to equip our people with.",8,398,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00398
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"For the rest who have seen their friends or other people around them being cyber bullied, we all have a right, a responsibility, to stand up for one another so that we are not torn apart, one by one. This is a new challenge for a new generation. We must learn to come together, support one another, nurture one another, build up one another, not to tear down other people just to make ourselves feel relatively superior. No, that, itself, is a sign of weakness of the perpetrator, of the bully.",9,399,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00399

This pandemic has brought much stress to our students, especially those who are taking their major exams this year. It is heartening to note from the Minister's speech that to alleviate these students' stress and revision loads, the common last topics for PSLE, GCE ""N"", ""O"", ""A"" levels, will be removed.",1,401,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00401
2021-07-27-T-017,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"I also understand from what the Minister had shared earlier in relation to strengthening the social-emotional skills amongst our students, the CCE curriculum on mental health literacy has been introduced for lower Secondary levels and it is in the midst of reviewing for Primary schools. In this aspect, I wish to suggest or recommend that, perhaps, it is the right juncture to consider implementing it, for a start, for our Primary 6 students onwards and also involving their parents' participation.",2,402,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00402
2021-07-27-T-017,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"I recall during a motivational talk which I conducted last year in my capacity as a school advisory chairman – I have been doing such talks for the past few years for Primary 6 students – unlike the previous batches, this batch of students looked pretty worried. I observed that some of them were in tears and worrying that they might disappoint their parents as a result of the less desirable results that they may get from their final-year examinations.",3,403,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00403
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we will definitely take on Ms Hany Soh's suggestions for us to see how we can implement earlier the revision to the CCE curriculum for the upper Primary level first.",1,404,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00404

2021-07-27-T-017,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"Last year, the number of suicides among boys aged 10 to 19 was at a record high. I echo Mr Patrick Tay's call, which the Minister did not specifically address, and urge the Minister to consider implementing measures to regularly and systematically monitor the mental well-being of our students, like how we monitor their academic achievements and physical fitness. This can be in the form of questionnaires that measure stress level, anxiety and depression. I understand from mental health professionals that such questionnaires are already available. The outcome of these questionnaires will allow us to proactively reach out to students who need help. Without measurement, we act and react with a blindfold.",2,407,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00407
2021-07-27-T-017,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"The second question that I have is based on earlier exchanges. There is recognition that the workload on our teachers is heavy. Such being the case, why is the enrolment at NIE dropping?",3,408,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00408
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will respond to Ms Hazel Poa's two points.",1,409,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00409
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"First, yes, today, we do track our students' mental health. It may not be through the survey that she mentioned. We will certainly take a look at the kind of surveys possible. I want to highlight one point from what we understand. Surveys, questionnaires can be helpful, but beyond looking at trends, I think we need to build a relationship of trust that can allow our youths to seek help. It is not just measurement alone that we should be concerned with. What is perhaps even more important is to build that trust, that relationship, that allows, encourages and not impede our people seeking help. So, we will do both in this.",2,410,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00410
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Second, we will continue to recruit teachers based on the cohort requirement. At the same time, the way we are structuring the work in the school now is that there are teachers, there are also teacher-counsellors, there are also counsellors and there are also operational managers, admin managers, so that certain people specialise in certain functions, rather than exactly like what was suggested that, perhaps, many, many years ago, that we would put all this workload – from administration to operations to teaching to counselling – all on the shoulders of our teachers.",3,411,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00411
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The NIE numbers do not reflect the overall support structure that we are putting in place to execute the various operations in the schools, including the teaching and the social-emotional health monitoring of our students.",4,412,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00412

2021-07-27-T-017,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. In my Meet-the-People sessions (MPS), I do encounter a few cases of requests or school transfers where parents, who have children studying in the so-called more competitive schools, find their child unable to cope with the pressures or unable to fit into the school environment. So, their child's emotional well-being, the learning developments are all affected.",1,414,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00414
2021-07-27-T-017,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Can I ask the Minister if MOE can be more sympathetic to such requests to facilitate transfers? I know there will be some administrative arrangements, the matching of the request to the places in the schools and there is also a transition programme needed. But the change of environment could be what the child needs to reset and to start afresh.",2,415,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00415
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir, two responses to Mr Liang Eng Hwa's question and comment. First, I would like to reassure Mr Liang Eng Hwa that we will certainly look at all requests for transfer of school sympathetically, compassionately, especially if it helps us to improve the well-being of the child. The well-being of the child is our foremost consideration in enabling parents to help their child find a more suitable environment.",1,416,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00416
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Which then comes to the second point I want to make and this is key. I think all of us, in our MPS, would have come across parents who desire their children to go to a certain school  sometimes, a school nearby for logistic reasons; sometimes, a school that is deemed to be more popular. I always have this advice and suggestion for the parents who appeal for their children to go to some school, sometimes quite far away, but perhaps deemed to be a more popular school, and my suggestion is this  in choosing a school for our children, we must all try to start from the perspective of the child. Every child has different strengths and weaknesses. Every child has different potential. Our job as parents is to help our children realise their potential; for them to go to an environment where they can feel confident and comfortable developing their potential, finding their footing.",2,417,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00417
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"And it is always very sad, very sad, to see a child come home from school without any sparkle in the eye, that they are just being made to feel that they are living up to someone else's expectations on them and it destroys the confidence of the child.",3,418,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00418
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"So, it is important for us all to remember that the best gifts that we can give to our children is to help them understand their strengths and weaknesses, be confident, be comfortable with who they are, as they find their footing in this uncertain world. It is not to live up to the expectations of someone else or it is not to be constantly measured according to someone else's yardstick.",4,419,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00419
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We all want to nudge our children, we all want to stretch them a bit, as part of their development process and there is nothing wrong with that. But we all need to be careful that we do not inadvertently erode the confidence of the child or, worse, to destroy the sense of curiosity and desire to learn in a child because they are not in an environment that they are comfortable with. Not all children are the competitive type. Some perform well in a competitive environment, others perform well in a more nurturing environment. And it is best for us to start from the basis of our child's interest first.",5,420,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00420
2021-07-27-T-017,Deputy Speaker,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Yes, I thank the Members for their interest in this important topic. I hope to close the debate at 2.45 pm. I call for four more clarifications. Mr Gerald Giam.",1,421,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00421

2021-07-27-T-017,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Sir, it is important that mental health services are easily accessible to students. Can I ask if the school counsellor is a dedicated resource or also an educator with teaching responsibilities?",2,423,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00423
2021-07-27-T-017,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Second, can schools schedule all students to have a short meeting with the school counsellor at least once? This will dispel the mystery and stigma of seeing a counsellor and will be similar to how all students are scheduled to see the school dentist regularly.",3,424,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00424
2021-07-27-T-017,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"And, lastly, regarding school security. Can the Minister confirm that all classrooms can be locked from the inside and students, including very young Primary school students, are taught how to do so? This is so that attackers will not be able to easily enter classrooms where students are hiding.",4,425,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00425
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, the first clarification for Mr Gerald Giam, I have mentioned that we have teacher-counsellors and we have school counsellors. School counsellors are dedicated counsellors who have no teaching responsibilities. Teacher-counsellors are teachers with teaching responsibilities but we reduce the teaching load on the teachers so that we can have them take on some counselling responsibilities.",1,426,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00426
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"At this point in time, every school has at least one school counsellor; some have more because of their higher needs. In total, in the system today, we have trained more than 1,000 but we have deployed about 700 of them as teacher-counsellors because part of it is the posting cycle. We want to reach a deployment of 1,000, which means we would have to train much more than 1,000 in order to deploy 1,000 teacher-counsellors.",2,427,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00427
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the second clarification, at this point in time, we are in the process of updating the security infrastructure for all of our schools. A lot of them are done in tandem with school renovation under the PRIME programme. Today, at this point in time, not all schools have classrooms where they can lock from the inside. The newer schools, those which have undergone the upgrading programme or the renovation programme, have already done this. We will progressively do so for the remaining schools.",3,428,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00428
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"For those schools that have yet to have this type of doors installed, the teachers and the students are also taught the drill to barricade themselves, working with what they have at this point in time.",4,429,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00429

2021-07-27-T-017,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"I think the Minister's Statement was very reassuring in terms of the number of counsellors and the number of students that have come forward. I lived through a somewhat similar incident in school almost two and a half decades ago. My best friend took his own life and, until today, for all of us who were in the class, we do not know what happened. There was no counsellor. All that happened was we received a phone call that morning; we came to school; our form teacher spoke to us; we went to the wake; we went home; and that was it. Quite a number of us were affected for a long period of time.",2,432,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00432
2021-07-27-T-017,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"So, I am very heartened that the Minister has shared the numbers and the experience for this particular incident. I understand that there are currently about 700 school counsellors, teacher-counsellors and we hope to deploy 1,000 in the next few years. Could the Minister share with the House how the teachers are equipped in terms of their skillsets to identify and, perhaps, to refer students to more highly trained professionals?",3,433,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00433
2021-07-27-T-017,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"The second clarification has to do with this impression that when you talk about education in Singapore, the word ""stress"" accompanies it at all levels. In the last few weeks, parents were stressed because they were applying for school admissions. That process has evolved over the years, but as you listen to parents, you find that stress still comes up very often. When I talk to my peers as well as to residents, their comments are often also about stress in school.",4,434,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00434
2021-07-27-T-017,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"I always recall one of my earliest bosses saying that stress is good because it tells you that you are alive. But more often than not, I think we are in a society where we tend to ignore somewhat the pressures of stress and how it builds up over time. Because it is so much related to our education system, would the Minister be able to share how he thinks our education landscape should evolve over the years so that this idea of a very stressful and pressurising environment would become less so and we would have a more resilient student population and a more resilient society in the years ahead?",5,435,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00435
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me first touch on the topic of equipping our teachers. Our current system of equipping our teachers comprises the following levels.",1,436,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00436
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"First, in pre-service training at NIE, we equip all our trainee teachers with the basic modules of how to help their students by building a relationship of trust so that the students can confide in their teachers if they need help; how to look out for tell-tale signs whereby a student might be distressed, either in school or via events outside school. So, this is the baseline emotional well-being literacy that we seek to share with all our teachers, so that we have a baseline to work with.",2,437,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00437
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Once the teachers are in service, some of them will volunteer and some of them will be identified to take on additional training to become teacher-counsellors. So, if you can imagine, instead of teaching two subjects, they may reduce the load on teaching two subjects or reduce to even one subject but they take on additional responsibilities within the school to help in the counselling services provided by the school. So, that is the next level of training for our teachers, where they will have greater depth of training in how they can intervene to help students in distress. They will also be equipped to see how they can work with parents because working with parents is key to this whole journey of ours to provide the best support for them.",3,438,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00438
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Then, at the next level, there are two ways which we identify school counsellors. School counsellors, as explained, do not have teaching responsibilities. They are full-time counsellors in the school. If you like, the equivalent of this is the orientation officer in Basic Military Training (BMT) where his job is to make sure that people settle in well.",4,439,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00439
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"There are two ways which we can try to recruit full-time counsellors. One, as part of the wider community of people who are interested in full-time counselling. These could be fresh entrants, fresh graduates, or these could be mid-career people who want to do a career switch. That is what we consider from the external system to reinforce the school counselling community. There are also occasions whereby some educators, having been in the system for a while, decide to dedicate time to do full-time counselling. That is where we will re-role them into full-time school counselling duties. So, this is how we build up the community of support.",5,440,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00440
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Having said that, what we can do within the MOE system is also part of a larger whole-of-society system, where MOH and MSF also come into play, so that, together, we build a community of support with different capacities at different levels to allow us to apply the appropriate help to the individuals in distress.",6,441,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00441
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"If I may move on to the second issue of stress, yes, we agree with Mr Alex Yam that, in any system, there will be some amount of stress. Too little, it does not stretch our people sufficiently. Too much, it might break our people. Where is the optimal point is a careful calibration that we must do judiciously and study consciously in every step as we evolve our education system.",7,442,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00442
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"But how to reduce stress at the aggregate? I will be saying more of this to the school community in this year's workplan seminar, but I just want to raise two points for consideration, for all of us, so that we can perhaps think about this and, in our own way, help to carry this message.",8,443,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00443
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The first is this  the definition of success. It is already hard enough for our young people to try to excel and do better than what they had done yesterday. That constant striving for excellence, in itself, is a positive stress for them to aspire to achieve more. But we must be very careful. You must be very careful that this strife for excellence to better themselves does not turn into a situation where the definition of success is dictated in someone else's image; that it is an incessant and unrelenting comparison with somebody else. So, this is one dimension.",9,444,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00444
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The second dimension which we believe in MOE and which I hope to share from my previous experience in NTUC and MTI with the school communities, is this  remember that we have a broad definition of success. It is not just only about academics. People do well in life across many dimensions and we all do not have to go after the same yardstick. We all can strike out in our own ways, contributing in different capacities to the development of our nation.",10,445,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00445
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I would like to just share one story I learned from the Israelis. They also have a National Service system. They also very often have their people going on what they call a ""gap year"" or some ""gap months"" after their National Service for both boys and girls before they perhaps enter universities or go on to work. One Israeli told me that they have a very common question that they would ask amongst themselves  what do they do during the gap year or gap months?",11,446,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00446
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"They like to ask this question. It is not where my friends have been to and, therefore, I want to go. They ask this question  where have my friends not been to? And I will want to go and explore the place and bring back something different for my country and my society.",12,447,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00447
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"This struck me and left a deep impression on me because it tells me that this nation is not all going after the same definition of success. They all believe in that diversity of ideas that can come from all around the world, that they would travel to different parts of the world to try to learn something new, something different, something that will enrich their society, something that will allow them to distinguish themselves, something that will allow them to cross-pollinate ideas and create new ideas.",13,448,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00448
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I thought it is a powerful idea. I thought if all of us can take a leaf from this, we will be a much more resilient society with diverse capabilities and perhaps much less stress in all trying to pursue the same objective. Those are my two humble suggestions for consideration.",14,449,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00449

2021-07-27-T-017,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. As a parent of two young children – my son is 13 years old – my heart broke when I heard the news on Monday. It is still, in a way, breaking. So, my sincere condolences to the families who have been affected by this. I do not think we can say that we understand how you feel because we do not; but our prayers and thoughts are with you during this difficult moment.",1,454,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00454
2021-07-27-T-017,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"I would like to take a moment, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to also send a note of support to our educators who are also mostly affected by this incident. I have been an educator for 20 years and, very early on in my education career, one of my students passed on. When that happens to you, you have a troubled young man and his challenges, it is not something you forget very easily and, for a while, you are stuck between the two torments of ""if only"" and ""what if"".",2,455,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00455

2021-07-27-T-017,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"So, I am heartened to hear the Minister say that there is support being provided right now for our educators who are affected by this. Because, as we have heard, our educators are very much more than just imparters of knowledge. They are caregivers, they are sometimes surrogate parents, they are older brothers, they are uncles, aunts and so on and so forth. So, I would like to just tell all our educators right now, especially those who are affected by this incident, thank you for all the good work that you have done and that you, no doubt, will continue to do and we all stand in solidarity with you.",4,457,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00457
2021-07-27-T-017,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I know it is the final clarification for this afternoon, I thank you for that privilege. When this incident first happened, I think many people were asking the questions  how did it happen, how could it have happened? We heard the matter being debated and clarified quite extensively.",5,458,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00458
2021-07-27-T-017,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"My question is  the Minister had talked about a whole-of-society approach and the Minister used the phrase ""communal safety net"". I think the message the Minister was giving was that everybody has to work together collectively in this. I would like to ask the Minister if he can advise or comment if there is some way that all of us, as a community – parents, students, community leaders, policymakers – and I know this question sounds very naïve, but what can we do to ensure that something like this does not happen again? I would appreciate if the Minister could provide some guidance in that area.",6,459,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00459
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr Darryl David for his comment and question. Mr Darryl David's final question is a very important one. How do we minimise the chance of this ever happening again? And perhaps, we should start on the premise that this can happen again, but the chances of this happening again will be much diminished if we all come together to support one another. If we all can take small steps to look out for our younger ones, to give them a listening ear, to help them grow up in their own ways, find their footing; if all of us, as parents, can come together and give our children the assurance and the confidence that we believe in them, trust them and love them in spite of, so that our children will grow up confident in themselves and confident that, in any setback, they will have someone beside them.",1,460,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00460
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,We can all come together as a community to spread the message that we should not stigmatise anyone who is in distress. That it takes courage for people to come forward to seek help. That we will not ostracise them and we will still accept them as who they are.,2,461,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00461
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"It takes all of us to look out for one another to prevent this tragedy from ever happening again. At the individual level, at the school level, at the family level, at the community level. It takes all of us to build that caring and nurturing environment that seeks to build up our people rather than to tear them down. It is our responsibility as adults to lend our shoulders to the next generation to stand taller, see further and have greater confidence to pursue their dreams in their own ways.",3,462,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00462

2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I saw two things. When I first arrived in the school, Mrs Teo, the Principal, received me. I knew she was in pain. She was in pain, not just physically but emotionally. Then, I saw the teachers. They were also in pain and in shock. But none of them thought about their own pain, shock or grief. They were all busy running around, making sure that each and every child under their charge was well taken care of first. They did not even have time to think about themselves nor grieve. Such is the dedication of our educators.",5,464,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00464
2021-07-27-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"And the final incident that I would like to share with this House. I spoke with some of the students while they were waiting to be interviewed by the Police. Some of them were the classmates of the 16-year-old. Amidst their pain and their confusion as to what had happened, how it could have happened, two of them told me the same thing, separately. They just had one simple request for me. They told me, ""Minister, please help our friend, the 16-year-old. Please take care of him."" They know it is a cry for help.",6,465,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00465

The way they carried themselves, the way they responded to the incident, will be etched in my mind forever. And it is they who will inspire us to do all we can for the next generation, for the distressed members amongst us in our community, regardless of age. That we will do our utmost so that this incident will never be repeated. Let us work together on that. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. [Applause.]",7,466,2021-07-27-T-017-S-00466

Which is why the F&B operators who had hoped for more calibrated measures such as limiting dining-in to those who are fully vaccinated and backed by the rapid ring-fencing capabilities that we now have.

However, the index can serve as a guide to both policymakers and the public to understand the current risk levels and adapt accordingly. An objective, science-based COVID-19 Risk Index will help assure the public that SMMs imposed by the Government are appropriate for the given risk levels. This would secure more buy-in from the public and result in greater voluntary compliance with SMMs. Voluntary compliance is key in our battle against the virus, as demonstrated by the KTV cluster outbreak, which was most likely caused by a wilful disregard for social distancing regulations. No amount of rules and fines will stop people from engaging in risky activities behind closed doors if they are not convinced of the risks.",19,522,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00522

Thankfully, most residents assure me that they have gotten their jabs. However, I find vaccine hesitancy among a small minority of the population rather worrying.

2021-07-27-T-018,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"After months of progressively opening up in the original Phase Three, Singapore's recovery received a huge setback when community cases jumped after the virus breached our defences at Changi Airport. This resulted in an announcement on 14 May that a new phase, christened Phase Two (Heightened Alert), would come into effect two days later, meaning that all food and beverage businesses would once more be required to shut down to dine-in customers, along with restrictions being tightened for a host of other industries and that these would take effect for four weeks. Other restrictions were also brought in to restrict social gatherings and, amongst others, the retail and fitness industries took a large hit. Primary and Secondary schools also shifted to home-based learning.",4,554,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00554

By the middle of the week, the cluster had grown to 88 infections and, on 16 July, just four days after dining sizes were increased to five, a slew of dining rules and regulations that one would need an advanced degree to navigate were mandated to be implemented by restaurants on 19 July.",6,556,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00556

One can only imagine the amount of losses that this has resulted in.",7,557,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00557
2021-07-27-T-018,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"While I appreciate that our responses are, in some ways, shaped by the fast-changing nature of the pandemic, we should pause and reassess whether this approach of drip-feeding restrictions and business support measures is doing more harm than good. Many business owners, in particular SME owners, have written to me to express their anguish over cashflow difficulties. Retail, fitness, F&B and related businesses along the entire supply chain are on their knees from having endured more than 18 months of hardship arising from a reduction in footfall and various permutations of closures or restrictions. Many of them have said that they are clinging on and depend on a timely disbursement of a patchwork of business support schemes to stay afloat, even while they scramble each time to make sense of the ever-changing restrictions. Some SME owners have told us that while they can deal with tight restrictions and difficult regulations, what has been particularly difficult is the ever-changing landscape in which they are constantly spending a lot of time and energy adapting their businesses to comply with.",8,558,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00558
2021-07-27-T-018,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"While we should encourage businesses to be nimble and adapt quickly to a rapidly changing environment, I fear that the last 18 months would be a step too far for all but a lucky few. We cannot take the position that uncompetitive and inflexible businesses that are unable to pivot to deal with such times should be allowed to go under. There is also too much at stake, as many livelihoods depend on the survival of these businesses. I believe the MTF is painfully aware of this.",9,559,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00559
2021-07-27-T-018,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"However, events over the last two weeks, in particular, have proven to be very confusing and disruptive.

2021-07-27-T-018,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"While it may appear that calibrating business support schemes in accordance with the situation of the day allows for targeted support to be given, over prescribing or managing the situation may end up being self-defeating. It could result in a situation where our policies become too reactive and the confusion and uncertainty that result may end up in help not reaching those who need it the most. Attention also has to be paid to keep rules simple as much as possible, an approach in policy-making that we used to pride ourselves in.",12,562,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00562

To top it off, they are also facing problems due to the delayed or uncertain nature relating to timing and amount of disbursements that they are eligible for. If the intention is to support these businesses, we must make sure that our support is effective and is as efficient as possible. These schemes must be designed to deal with the immediate threat faced by businesses which are already on the ropes.",13,563,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00563

The question is, therefore, how can we continue to provide our businesses with support in a sustainable manner? We can keep on extending schemes at the very last minute and going through a budgeting process each time new restrictions are announced. But what we need now, more than ever, is a roadmap with support measures pegged to respective restriction levels moving forward.",14,564,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00564

2021-07-27-T-018,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Next, I also note that, apart from businesses, individuals, too, are having to adapt to our changing times. Our economy has been kept afloat by new working arrangements becoming the norm, with working from home now being the default arrangement for many.

This has been attributed to digital workloads rising due to the pandemic. We need to bear their welfare in mind when we adjust our workplaces and jobs to reflect the new normal. I also hope that the trends we see, with an increase in those pursuing non-traditional career paths, will continue and receive more attention.",17,567,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00567

The inability to work from home, shortage of manpower, coupled with the lack of travel opportunities for a break even if it is just a quick day trip across the border, means that our essential workers have been particularly hard hit.",18,568,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00568

2021-07-27-T-018,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"The pandemic has also highlighted the unsustainable nature of some of our industries and our economic model, which rely on cheap, abundant foreign labour. In particular, construction firms and the cleaning industry are facing high costs of having to quarantine migrant workers and are also struggling with a shortage of workers. Many construction projects have been delayed as a result. Perhaps, this is the push we need to fully transform this sector and raise productivity levels to solve the labour crunch. As I mentioned here in this House earlier in May, it is timely that our businesses take the first steps in transforming to move away from our addiction to cheap, abundant labour.",20,570,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00570

Yet, I note that the Finance Minister indicated that the Government was, in fact, preparing a roadmap for Singapore's transition to life with COVID-19.",21,571,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00571

Yesterday, the Health Minister updated this House that a roadmap was currently being implemented. I would, therefore, like to seek clarification from the MTF about what is the definitive plan for how we move forward. If so, will the Government, in the spirit of accountability and providing much needed stability and confidence, make these metrics and roadmaps public?

It is, therefore, important that we have clarity, such as the risk index proposed by my colleague Mr Gerald Giam, that is announced to the public.

To overcome the challenges that this pandemic brings requires all of us to do our part to keep Singapore and everyone safe. Despite the current outbreak, we have made progress and I am confident that, together, we will emerge stronger. I support the Supplementary Supply Bill.",22,606,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00606

2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Mr Deputy Speaker, it is unfortunate that while Finance Minister Lawrence Wong spoke about making plans for living with endemic COVID-19 and seeing light at the end of the tunnel, we are still grappling with lockdown measures and triple digit daily cases, with the explosion of cases first at the KTV cluster and then the Jurong Fishery Port cluster.",1,608,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00608
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),F&B is at the heart of Singaporeans’ lives and the number one feedback I have been receiving is that relating to the F&B sector. I am concerned that frequent venue closures for faults not of their own doing and changes in rules pertaining to dining-in have led to disproportionate hardship for small operators who may already be facing substantial financial pressures.,2,609,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00609
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"From the multiple permutations of what dine-in arrangements are allowed, which has spawned numerous memes and suggested PSLE questions, to a total ban on dining-in, F&B operators and consumers alike are frustrated by the capricious climate we have today. Even as the Multi-Ministry Task Force shared an optimistic roadmap to reopening, we are still told that we must be prepared that the new variants can lead to more severe outbreaks and may well force us to introduce restrictions again from time to time.",3,610,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00610
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Furthermore, all businesses need a level of visibility in order to plan ahead, including adequate lead time to purchase fresh supplies and secure any additional staffing. My colleague and Sengkang Member of Parliament Ms He Ting Ru has shared more about the importance of consistency in our restrictions. Because, to many businesses small or large, local or foreign, F&B or not, the Singapore which was known for business certainty and a stable, predictable regulatory framework is now seen to be supplanted by a capricious regulatory environment when it comes to the management of COVID-19.",4,611,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00611
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Outside of the FAQs around the F&B and business sector and more generally, to many Singaporeans who have been tirelessly trying their best to cope with the pandemic over the last one and a half years, that light at the end of the tunnel now seems like the headlights of an incoming train. Troubling as that metaphor may be, it is all the more important for us to think hard about how to better support our fellow Singaporeans at the present moment, while making fundamental changes to better prepare ourselves for the future.",5,612,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00612
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"My speech today will cover three main areas  supporting our workers, supporting our SMEs and supporting our future economy.",6,613,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00613
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Firstly, on supporting our workers. I have earlier asked in a Parliamentary Question (PQ) on whether the Government can consider a limited trial of a four-day work week in Singapore.",7,614,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00614
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"COVID-19 has pushed companies to rapidly adopt new behaviours that would stick and change the trajectory of what it means to ""work"". For instance, companies which are known to be averse to Flexible Work Arrangements (FWA) are now open to the idea of their employees working remotely. A report by McKinsey has shown that 20% to 25% of the workforce in advanced economies could work from home between three and five days a week. This represents four to five times more remote work than before the pandemic. While this study was conducted on a global level, it is evident that there has been a seismic shift in the workplace culture.",8,615,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00615
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"This brings me to my point of what it means to ""work"". Over the past year, the idea of a shorter work week has resurfaced. This is not a new concept. Prime Minister Lee had previously shared during the 2004 National Day Rally on the need for a better work-life balance. Why is this so important? I quote, ""I am not sure why, but hours have become longer, the pace is more intense. Maybe it's the Internet, maybe it's email, maybe it's globalisation, but whatever it is, you wake up at six o'clock in the morning, you check your email. Eleven o'clock at night, before you go to sleep, you check it again and next morning, you come back, somebody replied at 2.00 am. How to have children?""",9,616,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00616
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"While not the only reason for our low birth rates, the five-day work week has gone beyond its intended definition and consumed our daily lives.",10,617,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00617
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Echoing the Prime Minister's speech, the four-day work week is a pragmatic policy consideration that has been tried and tested by some companies and countries worldwide. Most of us would have heard the case of Microsoft Japan, which had experienced a 40% increase in productivity and an overall 94% employee satisfaction rate. Iceland's four-day work week trials were also deemed ""an overwhelming success"", with trials in Spain also underway.",11,618,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00618
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"That being said, I am conscious of the fact that not every employee has the privilege to complete their tasks in a four-day work week. Those who deal with external parties, especially, are subject to the whims and fancies of their clients' schedule at times.",12,619,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00619
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"To institute a shorter work week, firstly, it is essential for us, as a society, to recognise the benefits in the form of not only the elusive productivity gain we have been searching for but, more importantly, focus on allowing people to become ""fuller"" people outside of their jobs. As what Microsoft had done, they have encouraged their employees to use the free time for ""self-development and learning... for personal life and family care, social participation and community contribution"".",13,620,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00620
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"If we adopt a shorter work week with the right mindset, the benefits of better mental health, productivity and agency felt on the individual level will translate into society-wide benefits as well.",14,621,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00621
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Secondly, on supporting our SMEs. The close to 280,000 SMEs represent 99% of enterprises in Singapore and, critically, employ more than 70% of our workers and contributed to 43% of our GDP in 2020 and are critical to the health of our economy.",15,622,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00622
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I have asked a series of questions on Singapore's corporate income tax rates and the impact from global tax reforms endorsed by the G7, G20 and more than 130 countries globally, including Singapore. First of all, I am comforted to hear from Minister Lawrence Wong that Singapore will preserve our sovereign tax rights and our rights to taxation.",16,623,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00623
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"However, while Minister Lawrence Wong shared in this response that our effective corporate tax rate is low, not just for MNCs, but for all companies, especially for SMEs in Singapore, I note from the data provided for the latest year of assessment (YA) 2019, that our effective corporate income tax rates are at a mere 3%, compared to statutory tax rates of 17%. For non-SMEs, their total profits before tax were S$459 billion for YA2019, with the total corporate income tax paid of S$11.5 billion. For SMEs, however, and this includes companies with a turnover of up to S$100 million, their total profits before tax were S$44 billion for YA2019, with the total corporate income tax paid of S$4.8 billion.",17,624,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00624
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"In other words, while SMEs accounted for a mere 9% of total profits before tax in YA2019, they contributed to 29% of corporate income tax paid. Put in another way, for every $100 of profit, SMEs paid $11 to the Government in taxes versus non-SMEs who only paid $2.50 in corporate taxes.",18,625,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00625
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Could we not shift the incidence of taxation away from our local SMEs, which need all the support we can give, towards larger MNCs, which are better positioned financially and are currently paying a disproportionately lower share of corporate income taxes?",19,626,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00626
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Rather than view global tax reforms as a threat, I see a clear opportunity for Singapore, given our global competitiveness and solid non-tax factors that make Singapore attractive to global MNCs. The key here is that global MNCs are not worse off if Singapore exercises our rights to taxation vis-a-vis the global minimum tax rates, but instead, given where effective tax rates in Singapore are today, Singaporeans will be able to benefit tremendously from the sizeable additional revenue headroom that could be generated from corporate income tax revenues should these reforms be enacted globally come 2023. Perhaps by then, it would be timely for us to revisit the issue of raising GST from 7% to 9%!",20,627,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00627
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Another point on the support for SMEs relate to the Job Support Scheme, or JSS. I recognise that the extension of JSS support that MOF has provided will go some way in providing affected sectors some cost relief. After all, every dollar counts in this tight business environment. I also recognise that some sectors have been more affected by COVID-19, hence, the differentiated JSS support.",21,628,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00628
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"However, as I have said in my speech in the debate on the Ministerial Statement in October last year, it would be more effective to direct a higher proportion of JSS payouts from the scheme towards SMEs, which make up a bigger proportion of jobs saved in comparison to large MNCs, which tend to have more resources on hand to tide them through the crisis. A global fast food chain with more than $20 billion of revenues, for example, could certainly weather the crisis much better than our neighbourhood coffeeshop uncle selling wanton mee.",22,629,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00629
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Further, based on data from SingStat, we observed that employment of SMEs declined from $2.52 million in 2019, to $2.36 million in 2020, or a decline of about 160,000 in the number of workers. This is a staggering eight times more than the 20,000 year-on-year decline in employment numbers for non-SMEs. If the role of JSS is to allow companies to better retain their local employees, then the results do leave much to be desired on this front.",23,630,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00630
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),This brings me to my third point about supporting our future economy.,24,631,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00631
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"While the current relief measures are no doubt useful and could be funded via a reallocation of resources, ultimately, we may need to think of implementing automatic stabilisers instead of discretionary ad hoc schemes, as I have mentioned in my maiden speech.",25,632,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00632
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"In a policy brief published in January 2021 by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Peter Orszag, Robert Rubin and Joseph Stiglitz called for the idea of a semi-autonomous discretionary fiscal architecture based on automatic stabilisers. They proposed a new approach in which ""fiscal discretion is retained but exercised after making the budget adjust more automatically and rapidly in areas where there is broad consensus that doing so is consistent with achieving broader societal goals.""",26,633,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00633
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Using an example in the local context, direct assistance to companies, such as JSS, could arguably provide indirect support to employment. Yet, many have still lost their jobs, even as the companies they work for receive JSS subsidies. Rather than providing blanket wage subsidies across companies, it is perhaps the workers themselves who are most in need of direct support and financial buffers in the event of unemployment. The Workers’ Party has been calling for an unemployment insurance scheme for years and I am glad that others in this House, such as the hon Mr Patrick Tay, who also recognised earlier this year that it is timely for us to consider introducing some form of unemployment insurance. I look forward to hearing more about progress in that area.",27,634,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00634
2021-07-27-T-018,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"To conclude, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am heartened by Finance Minister Lawrence Wong’s assurance that the Government will not hesitate to use the full measure of our fiscal firepower to protect the lives and livelihoods of Singaporeans. I hope the Government will follow through on its assurance and give due consideration to the pointers I have brought up today, to support our workers, our companies and our future.",28,635,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00635

I am in support of the additional support measures for Phase Two and Phase Three (Heightened Alert). However, I would like to raise two clarifications  one, on the additional assistance for some affected individuals and, two, clarification on the transition roadmap.",1,637,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00637
2021-07-27-T-018,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"JSS support has been well-received across some of the affected industries. However, the reality is that the pandemic has affected different groups of people to different extents. One of the groups that has been very badly affected are our freelance team sports coaches. While there are other freelancers, such as gym instructors and tuition teachers that have pivoted effectively and gone online, the incomes of team sports coaches, such as for hockey, floorball, netball and football, have seen a drastic decline as they face an uphill struggle to move their trade online.",2,638,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00638
2021-07-27-T-018,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"One of our Pasir Ris residents, Mdm Sa’adiah Khamis, the lead coach and owner of Singapore Netball Academy, which has 12 netball coaches, has shared that during the Heightened Alert period, the income of coaches may drop by 80%! This concern was echoed by Mr Vijayan, Head Coach of Maruti Hockey Academy. Under normal circumstances, these coaches will be physically coaching for 30 to 34 hours per week but during the Heightened Alert period, they are only able to provide at most 10 hours of Zoom training sessions per week.",3,639,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00639
2021-07-27-T-018,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Similarly, the owner of Youth Floorball Academy, Mr Norani Zaini, and another Pasir Ris resident, Mr Rizal Rais who was previously the football coach at White Sands Primary, shared that their incomes had been generally reduced by more than 20% and, in the months of the Heightened Alert, it can be reduced by more than 50% to 60%.",4,640,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00640
2021-07-27-T-018,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Freelance team sports coaches are often paid an hourly rate. The nature of team sports makes it difficult for effective coaching through Zoom. Yet, despite these challenges, they have held on, persevered and, even in such adversity, continued to coach, hoping that the situation will get better soon. At times, they even do it for free! Why? Because of their passion to coach our young athletes and their desire to see the sports, such as netball, hockey, football and floorball, continue to grow despite this pandemic. This is especially pertinent with the Tokyo Olympics going on even as we speak. We should continue to support the growth and development of our coaches and sportsmen, especially at the grassroots level, where they already face considerable challenges even under normal circumstances. Can the Government consider extending more support for these affected individuals?",5,641,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00641
2021-07-27-T-018,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Another vulnerable group is our market and hawker stallholders. Our market stallholders at Pasir Ris have shared that their income loss during the Heightened Alert period stands at between 40% and 60%. Hence, I am glad to hear about the support packages for them, including rental relief, the Market and Hawker Centre Relief Fund and Food Delivery Booster Package. I would also like to inquire on the progress of the SG Together Alliance for Action (AfA) - Online Ordering for Hawkers. How can we quickly get more of them on board?",6,642,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00642
2021-07-27-T-018,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Beyond these groups of workers, many others have had their income affected, too. The situation is more strained this time as it is not just about entering into another round of Heightened Alert; it is the broader challenge of having to endure more than one and a half years of restrictions and continued disruptions to their livelihoods. Many have shared that they have exhausted their savings during this period.",7,643,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00643
2021-07-27-T-018,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Given these circumstances, under the CRG-Temporary Support Scheme, 50% loss of income may be too stringent a criterion before some support is extended to them. Can we instead consider a tiered support at different levels of income loss, for example, starting at 30%, 40% and so on?",8,644,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00644
2021-07-27-T-018,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),I am heartened to note that the Minister and fellow MTF Co-Chairs have been preparing a roadmap for Singapore to transit to a scenario where we learn to live normally with COVID-19.

2021-07-27-T-018,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Firstly, on increasing our vaccination rates. Given that our target is 80% by September and we still have many seniors who are unvaccinated, do we have sufficient teams to do the mobile vaccination? How are we increasing the capability and capacity of our healthcare system to better manage the possibility of more infections that may arise from the gradual reopening of our economy, even if they are possibly less severe? What else can we do differently to reach out and encourage more people to be vaccinated to achieve our 80% target? Have we deliberated on the risks of vaccinating children under 12 or should we extend the unvaccinated children under 12 to do home-based learning while we overcome this transition?",11,647,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00647
2021-07-27-T-018,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Secondly, the Minister had said the economy is recovering and our employment situation is improving. However, we must take into consideration that there are people currently employed in temporary COVID-19-related roles, such as swabbers, safe entry screeners, Safe Distancing Ambassadors and vaccination staff. These temporary roles may no longer be required as more and more people are vaccinated. What can we do now to avoid a situation of structural unemployment for these workers in temporary COVID-19-related roles as we prepare for the transition to normalcy?

It has not been easy for them to conduct the training online and, as such, they have seen a drastic drop in their income during Phase Two. Despite these challenges, these coaches remain positive and strong. As the Malay proverb goes, one must see through any task, regardless of how difficult it may be.

2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, COVID-19 is an unprecedented crisis. As of today, we have been battling COVID-19 for slightly over one and a half years. Apart from the significant socio-economic challenges faced, COVID-19 has taken an unprecedented toll on our mental health and will continue to do so during our transition to a new normal. In my speech today, I want to focus on the mental health of our students and supporting our arts, entertainment and recreation sectors.",1,664,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00664
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"The term ""COVID-19 fatigue"" has become part of our everyday speech. Almost everyone I speak to has experienced mental fatigue and tiredness in coping with the impact of COVID-19. As adults, we feel this acutely, be it in trying to keep businesses afloat, looking after the safety of our families, adjusting to frequent changes in restrictions or the barrage of negative news.",2,665,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00665
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"But we need to pay closer attention to our younger generation. This pandemic is happening, for them, in their formative years and will shape their perspective on life as they go on to become adults. Students are a group who may be especially vulnerable to the long-lasting mental health toll.",3,666,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00666
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"I note that the Government also acknowledges the scarring effect that school closures have on learning and that some sense of normalcy is needed for our students. As our schools remain open, I am also glad to know that there are stringent safe management measures being adopted in our schools to prevent school-based COVID-19 transmission.",4,667,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00667
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"But following these measures can take its toll on students too. Co-curricular activities have sometimes been halted, celebration and orientation activities have been scaled back. Such safe distancing has led to reduced interactions with peers that are so important for the development of social skills. I am glad to know that CCAs will resume soon.",5,668,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00668
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"While necessary, given the current situation, the schooling experience of our students today is vastly different from what it was pre-COVID-19. Coupled with a more uncertain future, these circumstances may lead to unhealthy pessimism and mental health issues taking root among our students, including recent graduates.",6,669,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00669
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Looking back at my educational journey – and, for me, it was not too long ago – I am reminded of the extremely stressful points. We were lucky then in being able to release some of the pressures through social activities, such as going to the movies with friends and meeting extended family members. With the uncertainty of the pandemic, our children have not been able to do the same. I worry about the effects that may result, given that they are already in a stressful educational environment.",7,670,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00670
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"In recent years, there has been increased awareness surrounding youth mental health, with mental health education being incorporated into the Character and Citizenship Education curriculum from this year and groups formed to raise mental health awareness and stress among youths. These are definitely important steps in the right direction. I hope we can have more conversations on mental health among students, a topic that the President recently raised following the tragic event at River Valley High School.",8,671,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00671
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Perhaps, we need to re-evaluate how we approach mental health in our educational institutions, incorporating some activities to deal with the impacts of COVID-19.",9,672,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00672
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"The Minister for Education has just shared with Members and the public the resources and capacities we have available to support our students and staff and the near-term policies MOE is implementing to address mental health issues. I hope that, in addition to those policies listed by the Minister, there can be further policy options explored to improve our mental health infrastructure.",10,673,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00673
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"I specifically call on the relevant Government agencies to look at the feasibility in two areas  firstly, establishing another tertiary psychiatric hospital; and, secondly, the implementation of a Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) for Counsellors, akin to the PCP for Social Workers and Allied Health Professionals.",11,674,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00674
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Let me also touch on our arts and recreation sectors, which share an intricate relationship with our mental health as a society. During the tough months of the circuit breaker last year and in the past one and a half years, people from all over the world have turned to various forms of entertainment to keep themselves healthy.",12,675,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00675
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),The arts and recreation sectors are crucial to our mental health wellness and it is integral we keep them alive and survive the pandemic.,13,676,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00676
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Since the pandemic started, this sector has been affected heavily and is still facing prolonged slumps. Just as these sectors were beginning to pick up this year, recent clusters have resulted in further rounds of restrictions. Those affected include performance groups, art theatres and even gyms, all of which provide Singaporeans with ways to unwind and de-stress and work on their physical health.",14,677,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00677
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),I appreciate the various grants the Government has introduced in Budgets 2020 and 2021 to support the arts and sports sectors. I would like to seek an update on how much of these grants have been disbursed thus far.,15,678,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00678
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Safe management measures have a sizeable impact on the bottom lines in these sectors, as not all of these activities can be easily moved online. The prolonged slump in the arts and recreation sectors, coupled with restrictions that continue to affect businesses and individuals, brings the long-term viability and revival of these sectors into question.",16,679,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00679
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"These challenging times may lead people to pivot out of these sectors, as they look for ways to survive economically. For example, in February this year, a Mr Chiya Amos penned his experience in TodayOnline. Mr Amos worked as a conductor in opera houses prior to the pandemic, but now works with Foodpanda making deliveries. His story is admirable, as it shows his strength and resilience, but it also compels me to think if there is more that we can do to support individuals like him.",17,680,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00680
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"There are probably many more such stories untold. It speaks to a nationwide phenomenon where many leave these industries, including recent graduates and young adults who have spent the last few years investing their education in these areas. Our arts and recreation sectors include many independent contractors and Singaporean-owned businesses.",18,681,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00681
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Uncertainty caused by the pandemic, especially that surrounding their livelihoods, will inevitably add to the toll on such business owners and potentially create long-term scarring of these sectors.",19,682,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00682
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),How does the Government plan to work with these sectors to ensure their medium- and long-term viability? Can the Government provide an update on how it is looking to partner and understand the concerns of the businesses serving the arts and recreation sectors and help them work through the issues they face?,20,683,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00683
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"I recently spoke to a resident of Compassvale who started her own business partnership before the pandemic. Her father is the owner of a gym. Both of them shared with me that before the pandemic, both businesses were doing well and that they were able to pay their workers fairly and make a profit. After the pandemic, however, they have been struggling. They have had to let staff go and are even considering closing their businesses.",21,684,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00684
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"I believe we can do more to support these enterprises. For example, as my colleague Mr Leon Perera has suggested, we can include more businesses from these sectors in the SingapoRediscovers Voucher scheme so that they can be assisted while enabling the public to benefit from the services they provide.",22,685,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00685
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the effects of COVID-19 are multi-faceted. Among these are socio-economic consequences as well as psychological ones. This is a time where we need to support one another. Part of this is to make sure that assistance is going where it is needed most.",23,686,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00686
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),Among those who need our collective backing right now are those in the arts and recreation sectors who are among the many SMEs that account for a significant proportion of Singapore’s employment.,24,687,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00687
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"More broadly, mental health issues can fester if ignored. If we are not careful, we may risk a generation of students who have to grapple with mental health issues over the longer term.",25,688,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00688
2021-07-27-T-018,Raeesah Khan,Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang),"In October last year, I spoke in this House calling for greater awareness on the importance of mental health. Awareness on the issue has since improved, with more open discussions, but more can and should be done. The mental health impact of COVID-19, which is a worldwide phenomenon, can have real implications for well-being in our society. I ask policymakers and fellow Singaporeans to continue to treat this issue with the urgency and openness it deserves.",26,689,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00689

2021-07-27-T-018,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member),"The recent return to Heightened Alert was a major blow to all of us. It was unexpected and disappointing even if we do understand the necessity of the tough action taken by the MTF.

2021-07-27-T-018,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"After all, we should recognise that the delayed $0.6 billion in development expenditure has an opportunity cost in terms of foregone benefits from these capital projects. If we truly believe that the benefits of our development expenditures have not been irrevocably altered by pandemic-related delays – and I believe they should always be the case for long-term capital projects – then we should be working hard to get these delayed projects back on track by boosting immediate spending rather than passively accepting the delay. This will also allow the revenue streams associated with projects to accrue sooner.",4,735,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00735

I have many residents whose living situations have been significantly compromised by the delay in the expected handover dates of their BTO flats. Could we not accelerate our spending, temporarily increase our inputs, so that the construction of these flats does not face an inordinate delay? To be entirely fair in our conversations with our contacts in the construction sector, they have shared that the ability to ramp up activity has been constrained not just by demand limitations, but also those of supply. Construction raw material prices, like those of all commodities, have increased sharply worldwide. This spike has been further exacerbated by US infrastructure building, Chinese restrictions on material exports and difficulties in procuring Malaysian-manufactured materials due to its shutdown.",6,737,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00737
2021-07-27-T-018,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"But activity has also been curtailed by some of our own policy decisions, which have served to dampen demand in the sector. While we have attempted to relax some of the immigration controls, they remain comparatively restrictive and our friends in the industry share that this remains their most binding constraint. Thus, while we recognise the importance of exercising caution to limit imported cases, as well as the longer-run need to transition away from low-cost labour in the construction sector, as my Aljunied colleague Mr Gerald Giam had shared, there is, in the meantime, an immediate need to relieve labour needs on this front.

Furthermore, mandatory quarantine routine testing and safe distancing measures all have added to costs, which, inevitably, renders some projects no longer economically viable. Could some of these overheads be partially offset by the Government to help the sector as it tries to get back on its feet?

Indeed, a more careful consideration of the underlying components of long-term yields reveals that since mid-May this year, the real long-term interest rate – that is, the true underlying cost of capital – began to rise. What this means, in practical terms, is that as markets normalise, surplus capital is beginning to be dissipated.

The Government commits to fund all the costs of tertiary or continuing education programmes upfront, perhaps subject to a very, very modest co-payment as collateral. As the graduate secures a job and contingent on them earning enough, the recipient would then pay off the acquired debt. To maximise repayment probabilities, we could limit, at the outset, the scheme only to courses with a clear economic need, such as information and computer science, biopharmaceutical sciences and digital and social media marketing, among others.",16,747,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00747

Importantly, such a programme in the local context will also free parents of tertiary students from the perceived need to finance their children's University education, especially when their parents' CPF funds are already stretched in terms of meeting retirement needs and, all the more, by the income shocks endured during the pandemic. The risk of repayment would be transferred to the main beneficiaries of this human capital investment, the undergraduates themselves, while being underwritten by the Government. Since human capital investments, as a whole, pay off in the long run, such an investment is eminently suitable for funding via the long-term bond issuance under the auspices of SINGA. And, most importantly, surely, nobody can credibly argue that education should not be considered infrastructure in our 21st century economy.

Dr Goh Keng Swee was upfront about the need to increase tax rates and introduce new taxes to meet the significant increase in defence expenditures, having said at the beginning of his speech that it was neither possible nor desirable to conceal increases of such magnitude.

With the benefit of hindsight, we can see how we overcame that earlier challenge of British withdrawal as well as later challenges that arrived in each decade. In the 1970s, the economy faced the challenge of stagflation, that is, stagnation combined with high inflation brought about by the oil crises; in the 1980s, around about 1984 and 1985, Singapore faced its sharpest recession; in the 1990s, Singapore faced the challenge of the Asian financial crisis; and in the ""noughties"", the economy faced the Global Financial Crisis.",10,761,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00761

When we face a supply shock to our GDP, such as the decline of the GDP last year, when the economy rebounded, it rebounded with that experience we had in the past and we shaped the trend path of the economy, that would allow us to move and continue on a higher trend growth path.",11,762,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00762

I quote  “When the British military withdrawal is completed in 1971, a new era will dawn on us. This event is likely to be no less significant than our departure in 1965 from the Federation of Malaysia. Since 1965, we have proved that as a separate economic entity, Singapore has a far greater survival potential than many people, here and elsewhere, had believed possible. After 1971, we have to go through another test, perhaps a more exacting and rigorous test, and that is our survival potential as a separate political entity in a difficult and turbulent part of the world.

The argument goes that this will keep more people from taking public transport and congregate in larger numbers in their workplaces.",4,771,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00771

As the KTV cluster unfolded, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced a two-week suspension of operations from 16 July 2021 through 30 July 2021 for all nightlife establishments that had pivoted into F&B establishments, which affected over 400 such establishments.

However, I am concerned whether the abrupt two-week suspension is fair to all affected nightlife businesses which pivoted to F&B outlets, bearing in mind that many of the 400 over establishments may not have the same kind of business or operating conditions as KTV bars with social hostesses and, hence, should not be regarded as having the same risk level as the intimate KTV bars.",16,783,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00783

2021-07-27-T-018,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),I am heartened that the Government is mandating commercial landlords to match the two-week rental support provided by the Government to tenants during the latest Phase Two (Heightened Alert) measures. It is also notable that smaller landlords who rely on rent as their main income will also be given fair consideration since they may not have the financial ability to sustain themselves.,2,804,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00804

To ensure that these measures are more timely and targeted in helping businesses cope with challenges brought on by COVID-19, I would like to put forward three recommendations  one, to add an additional criteria for rental relief; two, to consider extending moratoriums for Temporary Bridging Loans; and three, to further improve the disbursement and criteria of the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS).",4,806,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00806

However, with this current round of the Heightened Alert phase, businesses do require a much longer runway and even an additional principal payment moratorium. This is against the backdrop of suboptimal business activity for more than one and a half years. I believe it is necessary for such an extension of principal moratoriums to provide businesses with this additional runway to restore cashflow, which dovetails with the overall COVID-19 resilience safe reopening plans.",9,811,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00811
2021-07-27-T-018,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In addition to this recommendation, this is a good time to review the criteria to obtain a Temporary Bridging Loan, specifically, the need for preceding bank statements in applying for a Temporary Bridging Loan. Unlike last year in 2020, when such a criterion could have shown how well the company was in 2019, its relevance now is clearly a problem because the preceding year was the ultra-difficult 2020.

Each phase of dining-in restriction affects the confidence of event clients and leading to eventual cancellations. The continued cap on weddings guest size and suspension of social and community events have also meant lower revenue for event-related companies. While there are “pilots” for events to take place, the capacity cap makes them commercially not viable. Those who have pivoted to digital formats have found that the revenue is unable to support existing costs and borrowings incurred prior to COVID-19. With high overheads and borrowing costs, event business owners had to bear continued losses and exhaust their own savings to preserve their business to retain capabilities built over many years. Therefore, I would like to ask that we review the support mechanism for the wider events industry ecosystem to preserve capabilities that are much needed to maintain Singapore as a business hub.",16,818,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00818

Running a company or business can be very challenging, especially in the initial stages when most start-ups fail, but also when world-shaking events like COVID-19 happen. Even in the best of times, entrepreneurs have to deal with curveballs on a regular, sometimes daily basis, as they grapple with issues related to winning and keeping difficult customers, retaining employees and ensuring cash flow. As the founder of a company, I know this first hand. The dot-com bubble burst around the time my company was founded, affecting many of our clients.

Individuals who are better able to work from home have fared better, for example, as have countries with better access to vaccines. What is less often noted is that COVID-19 has also worsened the inequality among companies. Those who are better able to adapt to the digital economy and to e-commerce have fared better. Those in certain industries like biomedical, infocomm technology, food production and fast-moving consumer goods have fared, on the whole, very well during the pandemic, some seeing record profits.

Another example is from the initially complex rules issued for dining-in earlier in July. How eateries were going to enforce those rules was something they grappled with. Some food service chains simply said it would limit dining-in to two persons to avoid the risks and costs of enforcement. Let us strive towards fewer of such examples going forward.",9,831,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00831
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Before I begin, I declare my interest as the CEO of a company, a research consultancy.",10,832,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00832
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, a few narrowly scoped points on the COVID-19 support packages. Madam, one group of businesses that seems left out are wholesalers, distributors and importers who support restaurants and F&B outlets. It does not appear that such distributors qualify for JSS and I hope we can support them in some way.",11,833,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00833
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),Some such firms I am aware of have already dutifully paid their suppliers for goods they have ordered in the expectation that dining-in would be allowed and are now paying an even higher cost to keep kegs and food produce in cold storage.,12,834,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00834
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, one of my constituents also shared that his business did not qualify for JSS. The line of business, listed as a secondary business activity, would by right, entitle him to JSS. However, he was told that because it was not his primary business activity, no JSS would be paid. I would argue that some degree of JSS support should be paid, pro-rated perhaps, in cases where the company has a line of business that warrants JSS but it is not the primary line of business, provided the company can prove that they are still doing some amount of that secondary business. We should also bear in mind that the revenue split between primary and secondary business can be fairly dynamic. I hope we can take a balanced approach in administering this and other schemes.",13,835,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00835
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, we should also review the rental support given to SME tenants who rent a mixed-use property, that is, a shophouse for both retail and residential use. Due to COVID-19, there are SME tenants who have to resort to renting a mixed-use property to keep their business afloat.",14,836,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00836
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"However, doing so would seem to prevent them from obtaining the cash disbursements automatically. Some SME owners who are renting mixed-use properties find the process complicated to manage, sometimes due to language differences or unfamiliarity with Government applications. They have also raised their concerns about how costly it would be for them to get hired help just to assist them to submit their claims with supporting documents. I hope we could look into providing an automatic service for the SME tenants renting mixed-use properties, especially during this crisis, to reduce their financial burden.",15,837,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00837
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, I would like to speak on the need to keep track of our SME schemes and this really speaks to more of our medium- and longer-term considerations about our SME ecosystem. Madam, a significant amount of public money goes into SME schemes. Workers' Party Members of Parliament have filed many Parliamentary Questions over the years, keeping track of the outcomes of these schemes.",16,838,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00838
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Madam, when our economic agencies disclose data on schemes, these are usually effort indicators, such as how many companies were helped, the median quantum of support and so on. But what would be more meaningful is to analyse the outcomes of these schemes, what marginal impact the schemes made to business success. I know that this is not easy to measure; there is a problem of differentiating between correlation and causation, for example. But solutions to measurement problems can be found. Publishing such outcome measures should be done from time to time. The case in point is the Productivity and Innovation Credit scheme which was discontinued earlier. Did it really help to increase productivity?",17,839,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00839
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, we should improve the user experience for our grant applications for SMEs. In a previous speech in this House, I called for a one-stop portal for all citizens and companies to transact with the Government on assistance schemes. One such portal for SMEs now exists, businessgrants.gov.sg. However, it appears that not all the SME schemes across the whole all Government can be accessed on this portal. I recall a number of letters, also to The Straits Times Forum page, explaining issues which users faced on this portal. One such letter, dated 30 June this year, referred to an endless cycle of questions and answers because replies by email or phone call were not entertained.",18,840,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00840
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Before leaving the subject, I should note that many SMEs still feel that the process for applying for grants and support is too administratively time-consuming and difficult. According to the UOB SME Outlook 2021 survey, small SMEs wanted more assistance to apply for existing grants in schemes and placed this wish as one of their top three wishes for Budget 2021.",19,841,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00841
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, Madam, I would like to speak on the need to nurture entrepreneurship and small businesses for the long run and this starts with the very lifeblood of SMEs – people. Partly because of stubborn mindsets and partly because of competition from MNCs and the public sector, SMEs are often not sufficiently attracting, retaining, developing and investing in their talent. This is a vicious cycle that reduces their ability to offer quality goods and services as well as survive into the future. SMEs without talent do not do well and not doing well means they are discouraged from investing in their talent.",20,842,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00842
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"There are Government scholarships that allow scholars to take on roles in SMEs rather than in GLCs or other major companies. For example, some IMDA scholarships allow for this. Is this something the Government is putting effort into developing and expanding? Co-marketing these scholarships with boutique SMEs that are leaders in their own right could be a way to push students to explore the breadth and depth of our SME ecosystem.",21,843,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00843
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"It could well be that SME scholarships are not as attractive to many young Singaporeans as other types of scholarships, such as PSC or GLC scholarships. To widen the potential talent pool for such SME scholarships, can we give the option to PSC scholars to transfer the latter part of their bond to an SME? This may attract some PSC Scholars who realise they would rather develop their career in the private sector. Also, as times have changed, more young people are realising that SMEs and start-ups can offer exciting employment opportunities and this is something that can be built on. There have been hit drama series produced in Korea, America and elsewhere about the fast-paced world of start-ups. There may be fresh opportunities these days to market SME scholarships to youth, if we are bold and ingenious in designing this kind of marketing.",22,844,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00844
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, on the talent deficit that many SMEs face. Again, I would like to talk about the role of shared service providers. Many SMEs struggle to hire people to fill vacancies, especially in fields like finance, human resources, administration and accounting, as the pool of locals qualified for such work is limited and there is competition from MNCs, GLCs and big professional service firms for such talent. SMEs can outsource this work, but outsourced service providers often charge high fees. Some SMEs form relationships with individual freelancers to do such work on a part-time or flexible basis, but not all SMEs have access to such freelancers.",23,845,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00845
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I would like to suggest that the Government look into nurturing players that provide shared services, such as finance, human resources, accounting and administration, at low cost to SMEs. Such a shared service industry would potentially be a strategic industry for our SME development and having such firms providing such services at low prices on an ongoing basis would perhaps be more helpful to SMEs than many of our existing schemes which prioritise the partial funding of one-off consulting work.",24,846,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00846
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"If we have a good pool of such shared service players, SMEs can outsource much of this back-office work to these companies at reasonable costs, thus enabling entrepreneurs to focus more on their core business and core competences. Our economic agencies should treat the development of the low-cost shared service industry as an industry development priority. Technology can be leveraged to provide low-cost services.",25,847,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00847
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, Madam, I will speak on what more can be done for business succession planning, including exits via entrepreneurs selling their business. I asked a Parliamentary Question about what the Government was doing on this front in 2017.",26,848,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00848
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Madam, many small and micro-business owners may toil away for years to build a business with a significant product, customer base, employee base and brand. Yet, many struggle with business succession planning. Nowadays, it is common to hear that the children of family business owners do not want to take over the business.",27,849,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00849
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"And it is hard for family business owners to be able to find acquirers. Many such business owners may not have the skills to identify acquirers and pitch their business to those acquirers. At the same time, many would be unable to avail themselves of the services of M&A advisory firms or investment banks, as these usually handle deals above a certain size threshold and the SME’s valuation may fall below that threshold.",28,850,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00850
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"All of this means that many SME owners may be unable to ensure the continuity of their business nor be able to monetise the value that they have created. Instead, they may end up simply winding up the business – and we have seen quite a few examples of this happening during this long COVID-19 pandemic. The other group of people who would lose out from this would be the long-time employees of such firms which close down.",29,851,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00851
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Would the Government look into providing low-cost services to SMEs that cannot engage M&A advisory firms to help match them to potential acquirers? A basic form of matchmaking could be set up via an online portal which allows potential buyers and sellers of small firms to express their interest, for example.",30,852,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00852
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I would also note in passing that, in some countries with a vibrant SME landscape, institutions other than the state play the role of providing general strategic advice to SME owners on matters that include business succession planning. Such institutions include regional banks in Germany, Switzerland and Japan and the giant chaebols in Korea, some of whom take an interest in the SME suppliers within their ecosystem. But in Singapore, such traditions are, by and large, absent which explains the context for the suggestions I am making.",31,853,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00853
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, another point relates to SMEs starting up overseas. Can Enterprise SG provide small hot-desking facilities and business centres in its key overseas centres to support SMEs going abroad for the first time? Some foreign countries’ embassies and High Commissions provide such facilities for SMEs from their home countries in key global cities.",32,854,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00854
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Such facilities would enable SMEs to rent a desk or a small office for a limited time, as they explore an overseas market or start their presence. While such facilities are available commercially in most global cities, having Singapore SMEs use the same facility and having that co-located with the office of Enterprise Singapore and other Singapore Government agencies in-country would facilitate networking with Government and collaborations among Singapore firms in that overseas market. Subsidised rental rates could also be provided to ease market entry. Access to such facilities should, of course, be limited to SMEs and not extended to large firms.",33,855,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00855
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, Madam, I would like to talk about financing the growth of SMEs. Back in 2010, the Economic Strategies Committee (ESC) mooted the option of establishing an EXIM bank but the Government concluded that gaps in trade financing could be addressed by expanding the suite of trade and internationalisation finance schemes under what was then International Enterprise (IE) Singapore, without the setting up of an EXIM bank. Since then, Enterprise Singapore has launched various internationalisation finance schemes where the Government co-shares risks with participating financial institutions to support our SMEs.",34,856,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00856
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"However, I am not sure if all our SMEs feel that it is easy to secure financing, especially for overseas expansion. It should be noted that even with the Government sharing a high proportion of the risk, commercial banks may prefer other options to deploy their capital than lending to SMEs, as that still may be seen to carry some risks.",35,857,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00857
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Surveys still show that many SMEs believe that there are gaps in our financing ecosystem. For example, according to the UOB SME Outlook 2021 survey, smaller SMEs with a turnover of less than S$10 million stressed a greater need for financial support to ease short-term cash flow issues and that they desired easier access to funding and grants. Larger SMEs with a turnover of between S$10 million and S$100 million wanted easier access to funding and grants; and collateral-free loans for business transformation.",36,858,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00858
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"While existing financing schemes have certainly helped some of our SMEs, it would be worth considering if the creation of an EXIM bank for SMEs could help us to reach greater outcomes in SME growth and development.",37,859,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00859
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Having an institution that has the sole mandate to lend to and boost our SMEs, rather than relying on schemes driven by commercial banks who will, understandably, pursue primarily commercial priorities, can help us better address SMEs' financing needs. Hence, I believe the establishment of an EXIM bank for SMEs is an idea worth revisiting.",38,860,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00860
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, protecting the intellectual property of SMEs is critical to fostering innovation in the SME sector. However, anecdotally, there is still a perception in some quarters of the business community that for very IP-dependent kinds of work, such as creative and consulting work, for example, large Government agencies may take ideas contained in the proposals submitted to them by companies and either adopt those ideas internally or pass those ideas on to cheaper vendors to execute, without the permission or knowledge of the company submitting the proposal that contained those ideas.",39,861,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00861
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"It is sad to think that some companies have this perception of their own Government agencies but I have come across this perception in conversations with SME owners.

2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),I would like to ask if all Government agencies are given strict guidelines to not treat ideas contained in proposals in this manner?,41,863,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00863
2021-07-27-T-018,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In conclusion, Mdm Deputy Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity for us to leverage the burst of start-up formations that we have seen by creating an eco-system that enables these start-ups to thrive and scale-up as far as their ambitions can take them, driving job creation and creating a third engine of value creation that may be more rooted in Singapore than perhaps all MNCs are. Other successful economies around the world have thriving SME sectors, showing that these can co-exist with open economies and large global MNC sectors. Our very own equivalent of the German “Mittelstand”, or middle-sized companies sector, can form one of our pathways to the post-COVID-19 future.",42,864,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00864

I cannot emphasise enough how important this commitment is to the local and international business and investment communities who are making their long-term investment decisions into Singapore. Some have started to refer to Singapore as a ""zero COVID-19 society"", implying that we do not have the psychological resilience to transit into living with the virus. It is thus important for Singapore to signal our commitment clearly, not just to Singaporeans but also to the rest of the world our commitment.

In the face of COVID-19, rapid technological developments, climate disruptions and changes in geopolitical dynamics, our SMEs need capital to transform their businesses and become more competitive.

2021-07-27-T-018,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"I believe that the Government will, as always, help SMEs, but in the past two or three months, some areas have really experienced ""roller coaster""-like changes in regulations, proceeding then stopping, turning on and then off, and some had been unable to recover. I hope that the Government will take this opportunity to revisit some policies and to help some sectors pull through this winter in a more targeted manner.",13,888,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00888

2021-07-27-T-018,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"Yesterday, the three Ministers who co-chair the Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) explained the sequence of events that led to the tightening of posture to Phase Two (Heightened Alert). This action was all the more stark because of planned relaxation of numerous Safe Management Measures (SMMs) barely three weeks ago. One thing was very clear from their statements, which is the intent to move carefully and safely to reopen Singapore's economy and relax social restrictions. That intent remains unaltered despite this big bump on the road towards that destination.",2,891,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00891

2021-07-27-T-018,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"First, we now recognise that so long as our population is not sufficiently vaccinated, we will find it hard to accept COVID-19 big flare-ups. Yet, this is precisely what has happened to us over the last three weeks. So, it can happen and it has happened and we have to find ways to de-risk quickly. To de-risk as quickly as possible, we have to increase our vaccination rate as quickly as possible. We have to shorten the ""night"". In Chinese, there is a saying 夜长梦多, in other words, ""when the night is long, there are many dreams"", many things can happen if the period gets longer. So, we have to keep it as short as possible.",4,893,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00893

2021-07-27-T-018,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"First, that our most vulnerable group, namely our seniors, have the lowest vaccination rate relative to other age groups in our population. Therefore, it is obvious, and I think we all agree, that we must do our best and our utmost to vaccinate them soonest to protect them.",6,895,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00895
2021-07-27-T-018,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"Second, that children below the age of 12 are not being vaccinated. Because that segment of our population is not receiving vaccination, we have to ""compensate"" for that fact by pushing up the vaccination rates of the other age segments so as to attain population herd immunity.",7,896,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00896
2021-07-27-T-018,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"Third, that as we take steps to reopen our borders, the people entering Singapore may not be vaccinated and may bring the virus into Singapore. If these inflow numbers are large, their vaccination status may impact on our effective ""onshore population"" vaccination rate. Therefore, we have to take that into account in safeguarding our herd immunity threshold. This again argues for vaccinating as high a proportion of our local population as possible to ensure that we have sufficient ballast.",8,897,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00897
2021-07-27-T-018,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"For these reasons, I am strongly in favour of Government measures to incentivise rapid vaccination, including differentiating arrangements between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. We have no choice but to push hard and with great urgency.",9,898,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00898
2021-07-27-T-018,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"And because we have to compensate for our unvaccinated young in order to achieve total population herd immunity, I am, therefore, also strongly in favour of maximum effort by tripartite partners to drive workforce vaccination, the working-age population. This Phase Two (Heightened Alert) experience over these last three weeks should convince everyone that vaccination is good both for workers' health as well as for companies' business continuity.",10,899,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00899
2021-07-27-T-018,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"Second, we must keep our eye on getting ready to seize the upturn. It is true that the ups and downs in our prolonged war against COVID-19 have led to a certain listlessness and fatigue in our businesses and our people. But we must not let that take hold. Instead, we must do more to direct the attention and energies of businesses and the population to the gradually brightening global prospects. There is real hope and opportunity to be seized, provided we are ready.",11,900,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00900

This will not happen automatically. This result can only be achieved through solid tripartite partnership at industry and firm levels.",12,901,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00901

2021-07-27-T-018,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"One, skills upgrading to meet new requirements. The requirements are constantly changing and changing quickly. We must upskill our workforce quickly enough. NTUC will scale our Company Training Committee (CTC) network and Ops-Tech roadmapping to help companies quicken their pace of adjustment and transformation.",14,903,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00903
2021-07-27-T-018,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"Second, flexible work organisation. COVID-19 has forced companies to work much more flexibly and unconventionally in terms of how they arrange the manpower to get the work done. Many companies learnt that they can better tap and keep talent and good workers, both female and male, when they are willing and able to adapt their manpower models. This is a lesson learnt, it has delivered results in selected occupation types within companies in all industries and we must not let that go to waste. Learn the lesson and keep it for gain.",15,904,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00904
2021-07-27-T-018,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"Third, fairness. A company's chances of success go up when it has a capable, engaged, cohesive workforce with high morale. Achieving this in the context of an increasingly diverse Singapore workforce, diverse in race, nationality, age, comprising both genders with equal ability to contribute at work and so on, means that the different segments must feel that they are treated fairly and have a joint stake in the company's success.",16,905,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00905
2021-07-27-T-018,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"Fairness is multi-faceted. For example, given rapid changes in skills requirements, it will be almost impossible to protect specific jobs from change. We should rightly, therefore, move from trying to protect jobs to protecting workers through improving their employability. In the context of mature workers, a topic very close to my heart, I say this  whether the companies give their mature workers fair consideration and opportunity to train and upgrade their skills to stay employable will be key to whether their mature workers feel fairly treated relative to younger cohorts and whether they feel happy to stay and contribute, or otherwise feel discriminated, disengaged and dispirited.",17,906,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00906
2021-07-27-T-018,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"On this, I am glad that MOM has decided to set up a tripartite committee to consider how best to enhance effective protection against discrimination of various kinds in the workplace, in order to unlock performance and potential. Done right, this will improve not only the optics of Fairness at Work but will actually hone it into a competitive advantage for Singapore businesses and workers.

2021-07-27-T-018,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the support measures and the Budget do not of themselves or are not just designed to be cushioned against the latest setback caused by a spike in COVID-19 cases. They buy us precious time to retool for a shot at better lives and livelihoods ahead. On this, I was greatly encouraged when I heard the speech by Prof Hoon Hian Teck just now, when he recounted, even as we look back, how we do not just look at the ""now"" even though we have to solve the problems of the ""now"", but, at the same time, we must look at structural adjustments – how do we strengthen our core, our ability, our capabilities to create and fight for that better future – quoting then Deputy Prime Minister Goh Keng Swee. I thought that is exactly right and that we are on the same page. We must not squander this chance. Mdm Deputy Speaker, on this note, I support the Budget and the support measures.",19,908,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00908
2021-07-27-T-018,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman (Marine Parade),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, as we look to celebrate Singapore's 56th National Day, it is also timely that we take stock of what we have achieved while looking to the future to see how we can move towards the new normal.",1,909,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00909

Many have felt the tangible repercussions of this period, be it via the loss of income or the many changes that we have had to make to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe. But COVID-19 has also brought about many intangible changes. Many of us must deal with new and challenging circumstances that cause ""pandemic fatigue"" and mental health is on the decline for many.",2,910,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00910

While we have all been affected by this pandemic, a particular group of workers who we must continue to support is our lower-wage workers. We have seen that in the past decade or so, from 2009 to 2019, the real wages of our resident lower-wage workers who are at the 20th percentile have grown by 39%, compared to the median of 33%. This is no small feat and is, no doubt, aided by our policies, such as the Progressive Wage Model (PWM), to uplift these workers and the efforts of our tripartite partners.",5,913,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00913

2021-07-27-T-018,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman (Marine Parade),"I am aware of concerns on the ground regarding a potential increase in manpower costs and how this could impact customers and firms alike. As I had mentioned in my previous speech, everyone has a part to play in creating a more caring and inclusive society. This, admittedly, may mean paying more but we are mindful of and share our partners' concerns to ensure that manpower costs remain sustainable for all to create better jobs with good working environment and increases in productivity.",8,916,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00916
2021-07-27-T-018,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman (Marine Parade),"In addition to ensuring sustainable wage increases, policies like the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme continue to be an important tool in uplifting our lower-wage workers and significant improvements to the scheme have been made during the reviews in 2017 and 2020. I am assured that the Government will continue to review WIS at regular junctures and would like to reiterate my call to expand coverage of WIS by lowering the age eligibility of the scheme to 30 as well as increase the WIS payout for essential service workers.",9,917,2021-07-27-T-018-S-00917

This complements the call made by the Labour Movement and our partners to provide our essential service workers with a more dignified and comfortable working environment, such as access to proper and reasonable rest areas.

There has been an increase in training allowance to support self-employed persons. Unions have been pushing for employers to send workers for training before resorting to cost-cutting measures. Union members can also embark on their own training by utilising their Union Training Assistance Programme (UTAP) benefit.,7,947,2021-07-27-T-020-S-00947

2021-07-27-T-020,Abdul Samad,Mr Abdul Samad (Nominated Member),One union leader shared from his personal observation and experience on the disparity in employment contracts between locals and foreigners. He had a disappointing experience of seeing the contracts of his local colleagues not being renewed but foreigners on contracts being offered permanent roles. Another union leader shared the pain in seeing groups of foreign talents that were hired with capabilities equivalent to our locals. He observed that the HR manager came from the same country as well.,13,953,2021-07-27-T-020-S-00953

There has been such feedback raised and we need more affected parties to come forward to report such incidents or observations. While the Fair Consideration Framework is a means for locals to be given fair consideration based on merit, more should be done to respond to such hiring practices that favour foreign talents over our local workforce. I hope that the Government can consider further penalties beyond just suspension of work pass privileges for companies that have been found to have repeatedly chosen not to adhere to fair hiring practices.

2021-07-27-T-020,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Madam, our workers are dying, literally. The first half of 2021 saw 22 workplace fatalities, with 11 deaths recorded in the month of February alone. More recently, three workers died within a period of five days in separate incidents in June. According to MOM, the workplace fatalities involved safety lapses, which mean that the accidents could have and should have been prevented.",5,969,2021-07-27-T-020-S-00969
2021-07-27-T-020,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"The increase in workplace fatalities comes as we reopen our economy, with various tough safe management measures imposed at our worksites to curb the spread of COVID-19. Examples include cohorting of workers, establishing split teams and making sure workers do not cross zones within the worksite and even within the dormitory. While these measures have worked well in curbing the spread of the virus among our migrant workforce, have they inadvertently caused the rise in workplace accidents? Some workers that I have spoken to tell me that they used to be able to spontaneously assist each other in high-risk tasks at the worksite, such as during heavy-lifting works. But they cannot do so now, which means there are fewer eyes and hands to do the same dangerous work.",6,970,2021-07-27-T-020-S-00970
2021-07-27-T-020,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Or perhaps the issue is fatigue caused by an acute shortage of manpower in the high-risk sectors. According to MND, about 1,900 migrant workers decide to leave Singapore each month since the circuit breaker was imposed last year. Industry associations tell me that the reasons for their departure vary. Some because they were homesick; others because they were terribly worried about their family members back home. Companies have found it difficult to find replacement workers. So, more responsibilities are loaded onto their existing workforce. This, inevitably, leads to worker fatigue, which research has linked to a higher risk of workplace fatalities.",7,971,2021-07-27-T-020-S-00971
2021-07-27-T-020,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"I am glad that the Government has recently allowed a relaxation of requirements for construction companies to bring in additional manpower from less traditional sources.

I also urge companies to put in place strict measures to prevent untrained, uncertified workers from operating machineries and performing other high-risk tasks. In fact, all companies should participate in the Safety Time Out called for by the Workplace Safety and Health Council so that they can review their safety practices at their worksites.",11,975,2021-07-27-T-020-S-00975

The Labour Movement, too, has conducted our own ground sensing and about two-thirds of those we spoke to said they experienced difficulties distinguishing work and non-work hours when working from home.

Neighbours now quarrel because of the slightest noise and smell. Our homes are meant to be a safe space where we can live, work and play in peace. But I can empathise with both sides  the new homeowner trying to move into their new home as soon as possible and their neighbours trying to do an important work presentation virtually from home. As telecommuting work arrangements become more prevalent, we must do more to ease the tensions between neighbours.

Even if tenants wish to cease their businesses, landlords have gone after, or threatened to go after the tenants for rental arrears and damages for landlords’ losses of rent until the end of their leases. It would be good if MinLaw can legislate relief. Such a break would enable tenants of privately-owned commercial properties to terminate their leases earlier without penalty if they show that their revenues have been significantly impacted.

Can more support be given to our self-employed persons and freelancers?",14,1002,2021-07-27-T-020-S-01002

They develop their respective sports from developing the high performance pathways, development programmes and coaching and officiating capabilities. A significant amount of funding comes from sponsorship and participation fees through events. Unfortunately, most national sports associations have not been able to run events in the past year. As national sports associations are an integral part of athlete development, a suggestion would be for the MTF to closely work with this sector in order to develop the roadmap for COVID-19.",15,1003,2021-07-27-T-020-S-01003

2021-07-27-T-020,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"But it is also a policy that creates huge challenges for parents. Parents with children under seven years old only have six days of childcare leave a year. Even before the pandemic, parents had told me that it was not enough. It was just enough to cover them for the six days when childcare centres close every year. Now, they have to take leave even when their young child has only a mild cough or sore throat. They are at their wits' end.",6,1015,2021-07-27-T-020-S-01015

2021-07-27-T-020,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"First, the Government should be cognisant of the current situation when deciding on increasing rental and fee charges.

The Government should be more flexible and sensitive when imposing rental and fee increases, including the GST hike. The Government should also streamline support measures for individuals and small businesses, especially to make it simple for them to utilise. Keep it simple, keep it useful.

In May, the Dutch court made a landmark ruling, ordering Shell to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels. It also deemed Shell responsible for emissions from its customers and suppliers, what we call Scope 3 emissions.

So, if the overall situation, as I said yesterday, cases, clusters under control; hospitalisation rates, ICU rates, remain acceptable and stable, at the mid-term of our Heightened Alert, which is coming soon, we will review and we will consider some easing for vaccinated persons only.",10,1128,2021-07-27-T-022-S-01128
2021-07-27-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Then, I mentioned the next milestone comes in September when we will reach 80% of people in Singapore receiving two doses and, hopefully, similar coverage for our seniors aged 70 and above, then we can make the next move of easing. So, that is already revealing some sense of what roadmap one can expect. It is not all the details because we are still fleshing out details around specific measures and, potentially, next steps after September. And as I have said, when we are ready, when we have more information, we will certainly share this with Singaporeans.",11,1129,2021-07-27-T-022-S-01129
2021-07-27-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Recognising that as we open up with a higher vaccination coverage, our focus will change and we will shift our focus, not just looking at daily infection cases but paying more attention to those who are hospitalised and in ICU. That would be the more salient consideration. Based on that shift, hopefully then, if we see more cases emerging as we open, we can have some confidence. So long as hospitalisation and ICU cases remain stable, we can have some confidence that we, hopefully, will not have to go back to Heightened Alert again. As I have said, important qualifier; so long as hospitalisation and ICU cases remain stable and at an acceptable level.",12,1130,2021-07-27-T-022-S-01130
2021-07-27-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"But we know that we cannot rule out things from worsening. We know that we cannot rule out the risk of new variants coming, that you may have a more severe outbreak, more people hospitalised and, therefore, we have to be prepared we may have to put in additional restrictions down the road; hopefully, not like what we had gone through over these past few weeks and months. But that is the uncertainty that we all have to face and we all should face it together, recognising that this is something we all have to deal with during this pandemic. I would certainly not like to have to impose restrictions again, if I can help it. But if the situation worsens to such an extent where hospitalisation and ICU cases go up, I think, despite our high vaccination coverage, perhaps because of a new variant, then we will have to understand these are the risks and why we may have to put in place such measures.",13,1131,2021-07-27-T-022-S-01131

2021-07-27-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"In my response today, I would like to touch on two broad areas that Members have raised. First, how we are helping workers and businesses to ride through this period of Heightened Alert. Second, how we are preparing for the next phase and gearing up for a post-pandemic world.",17,1135,2021-07-27-T-022-S-01135
2021-07-27-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Let me start with the immediate support that we are giving. Our support measures, as all of you know, will cost more than $2 billion throughout this Heightened Alert period since May. Essentially, we have tried to reallocate as much as we can from the existing Budget to avail funds for the support measures. Based on the amount available for spending, we then had to carefully design the measures to meet the needs of businesses and workers who are most affected.",18,1136,2021-07-27-T-022-S-01136
2021-07-27-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We also took into consideration the strong base of existing measures that have already been rolled out in previous Budgets and which are still in place today. They include the Wage Credit Scheme which continues to support businesses which provided wage increases to their Singaporean workers. The SMEs Go Digital programme and the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package, all of these schemes, programmes, measures, already part of the baseline, part of the existing support and the vast majority of the support, in fact, go to SMEs.",19,1137,2021-07-27-T-022-S-01137
2021-07-27-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"There is also existing support for specific areas like the arts and sports sectors, which Mr Sharael Taha, Mr Mark Chay and Ms Raeesah Khan spoke about. For example, sports coaches and fitness instructors can benefit from the Continuing Coach Education Training Allowance and the Self-Employed Person (SEP) Project Grant. Likewise, we have similar support schemes for arts and culture, freelancers and organisations.",20,1138,2021-07-27-T-022-S-01138
2021-07-27-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Where access to credit is concerned, we had earlier extended measures like the Temporary Bridging Loan Programme and the Extended Support Scheme – Standardised to enable SMEs in affected sectors to defer principal payments on their eligible loans. I heard just now suggestions from Mr Don Wee and Mr Edward Chia to enhance some of these schemes and to extend the moratoriums for the loan schemes. For now, the MAS and our economic agencies assess that the credit market remains healthy and the current support measures are sufficient. But we will continue to monitor the situation closely and we will review the need for any adjustments. Meanwhile, our local banks are proactively reaching out to SMEs to provide relief and restructuring support based on their circumstances.",21,1139,2021-07-27-T-022-S-01139
2021-07-27-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"I also recognise that cash flow is a major concern for many SMEs and several Members highlighted this – I think Ms He Ting Ru, Mr Edward Chia and others. So, we will strive to push out the support as fast as we can. We will do so within our operational limits, while ensuring accuracy and good governance. In fact, Government's assistance is now flowing such that there is cash flow support to businesses throughout the year.",22,1140,2021-07-27-T-022-S-01140
2021-07-27-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"To illustrate, eligible firms have been receiving quarterly Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) payouts since April last year, with the most recent paid in June. And the cash payout under the Rental Support Scheme will be paid out soon in August, before the next JSS payout in September. So, we try to ensure a steady stream of cash payouts to businesses.",23,1141,2021-07-27-T-022-S-01141
2021-07-27-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"There may be businesses or workers who do not meet the qualifying criteria of some of our schemes and that is why we have the COVID-19 Recovery Grant - Temporary to cater to individuals who may not fit into any of our schemes. So, for example, hawkers in coffeeshops, they may not qualify for the Market and Hawker Relief Fund but they can apply for the COVID-19 Recovery Grant – Temporary and we will help them through that avenue. We are also helping these hawkers through rental rebates, to support them through the online delivery platforms and many other ways.",24,1142,2021-07-27-T-022-S-01142
2021-07-27-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Likewise, we also consider businesses which are badly affected but may not fall neatly into the specified SSIC codes, because these are the codes we use to determine which category the business is in and then we would disburse the JSS payouts. The codes may not accurately reflect the kinds of business activities that the firm is involved in. So, since the inception of JSS, we do consider appeals from businesses. In fact, we have extended JSS Support for close to 6,000 companies through such appeals and companies that many Members talked about, those who are suppliers, vendors, to F&B, retail, events companies doing local events. All of these groups, if they appealed, have been successful. So, if you know of such cases, you can let MOF know, you can appeal through IRAS and we will look at each case on its own merit.",25,1143,2021-07-27-T-022-S-01143
2021-07-27-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Likewise, agencies do exercise flexibility in implementation of the different schemes. With regard to the COVID-19 Recovery Grant – Temporary, for example, Ms Jessica Tan and Mr Sharael Taha asked about more flexibility for those with extenuating circumstances, flexibility around the income loss or annual value criteria. Again, agencies will look at each case and consider it on a case-by-case basis.",26,1144,2021-07-27-T-022-S-01144
2021-07-27-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"On rental relief, I recognise the difficult issues faced by landlords and tenants as Ms Jessica Tan had highlighted. I had mentioned it in my Statement yesterday and perhaps it is worth repeating the principles for intervention. The starting point is the sanctity of contract. We do not lightly intervene and we do so only in specific situations and in a carefully scoped manner. This is also in line with Mr Cheng Hsing Yao's caution that we should not create the impression that such interventions are now becoming the norm.",27,1145,2021-07-27-T-022-S-01145

It is not because of financial issues, it is not because of money and then, we can borrow and, therefore, do some of these projects. It is just that the firms will not have workers. And we do not want to rush to bring in workers and then end up with a large outbreak again. We have to do this safely. If we were to do this safely, it has to be done gradually, in a controlled manner, making sure that the pilots work first before we can scale up progressively.

As I have said just now, if we continue on our path of reopening, hopefully, we can continue it in a continuous manner but I cannot rule out the possibility of occasional slowdowns or even pull-backs. If we do so, then we have to introduce additional restrictions and, at that stage, we will have to put in place another package to support businesses. If we have to do that, then we will need to find ways to fund such a package. But as Mr Liang Eng Hwa noted, it is becoming harder and harder to do so.

We all have a part to play to ensure social mobility, opportunity and, importantly, dignity for every worker. We must put maximum effort to help every worker earn a fair wage and be accorded due respect for their contributions.

This includes increasing the number of workers covered by the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) and offering progressive wages in occupations not covered by the mandatory PWMs. The Workgroup will release its recommendations in due course and we are confident that these will lead to tangible and beneficial outcomes for our lower-wage workers. We will also continue to regularly review the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme, which works hand in hand with the PWM, to raise the incomes of our lower-wage workers.",72,1190,2021-07-27-T-022-S-01190

As an alternative-energy disadvantaged country, this is a very ambitious aspiration to be net zero, but we are working very hard to make this happen. For a start, we are reviewing the carbon tax level post-2023, in consultation with the industry, to incentivise the shift to green alternatives. We are also investing in new technologies that can help reduce our waste and emissions.

The G20 consists of the major economies that make up more than 80% of the world's economy, including many of the world's advanced economies, all with high per capita GDP and standards of living.

2021-07-27-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Why has this happened? It often starts with good intentions. For example, increase public spending on healthcare or welfare schemes, all with the best of intentions. But before long, entitlement spending balloons sharply as the economy matures and the population ages, outpacing the ability to raise revenues to cover these spending obligations. What happens then? A country turns to borrowing to finance its annual deficits, year after year. And this ends up quickly in a downward fiscal spiral.",84,1202,2021-07-27-T-022-S-01202
2021-07-27-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"What is more worrying is that societal norms and individual expectations change. An entitlement mindset sets in. It becomes politically very challenging to roll back any benefit and to raise taxes, or even to mention it. There is a tendency to short-change the future and to overspend on the present. That is why we must always resist the siren song of easy money and we must do our part to uphold a culture of fiscal responsibility and stewardship.",85,1203,2021-07-27-T-022-S-01203

The NIR framework would make a very substantial contribution to the Government's annual Budget, but it was not meant to cover every funding need.",87,1205,2021-07-27-T-022-S-01205

2021-07-27-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Mr Yip Hon Weng and Mr Louis Chua suggested that maybe the Government could consider other taxes instead of GST. The truth of the matter is that we need both. The GST rate increase is largely to fund higher spending in healthcare, especially as our population ages. It reflects the support we aspire to provide for every Singaporean  better healthcare for our elderly and for ourselves as we grow old. And because these are broad-based needs, we should fund them using a broad-based tax like GST. That is appropriate and that is responsible.",90,1208,2021-07-27-T-022-S-01208
2021-07-27-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"In fact, even with a two-percentage point GST increase, we will not be able to cover all our projected healthcare spending needs.

2021-07-27-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"I should just make a point of clarification; it is slightly technical. Mr Louis Chua mentioned just now that SMEs contributed 29% of corporate income tax but accounted for just 9% of accounting profit.

2021-07-27-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"This comparison is, in fact, not correct.

2021-07-27-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Number two, corporate income tax is levied on chargeable income, not accounting profits. And Mr Louis Chua, I think, should know accountancy and that chargeable income is not the same as accounting profits. You have to make tax adjustments, like non-tax deductibles, expenses like depreciation or capital allowances. So, the two concepts are quite different. Only the companies with positive chargeable income need to pay corporate income tax. Those with losses can carry forward their losses to offset future years' corporate income tax liability.",94,1212,2021-07-27-T-022-S-01212
2021-07-27-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"In fact, close to 60% of all SMEs do not pay corporate income tax and it is quite clear from the data. We have replied to Parliamentary Questions as well. It is quite clear from the data that SMEs have a lower tax burden than non-SMEs or the larger companies. The effective tax rate for SMEs is 3% but the effective tax rate for non-SMEs is 8% to 10%. So, there should be no doubt. Our system is such that SMEs have a lower tax burden.",95,1213,2021-07-27-T-022-S-01213
2021-07-27-T-022,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Going back to GST, some have expressed concerns that the GST is regressive. But, again, we cannot look at GST in isolation. Our GST system is unique in that it is tied to a permanent GST Voucher scheme, where we offset the GST for lower-income Singaporeans. And we also absorb GST for publicly subsidised healthcare and education. As part of the upcoming increase in the GST rate, we have set aside $6 billion for a temporary Assurance Package to cushion the impact for all Singaporean households, with lower-income households to receive more. In addition, we will enhance the permanent GST Voucher scheme. So, not just the temporary but the permanent layer to strengthen support for lower- to middle-income Singaporeans.",96,1214,2021-07-27-T-022-S-01214

2021-07-27-T-027,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Madam, I stand in support of the Adjournment Motion filed by the hon Mr Murali Pillai. The LSC has evolved over the years to adapt to the changing operating environment. The most significant change in recent times was in 2014 when there was a significant shift towards increasing specialisation through the introduction of Specialist Career Tracks.",1,1322,2021-07-27-T-027-S-01322
2021-07-27-T-027,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"This Motion calls on the Government to rethink our talent management frameworks and development of LSOs. As a practitioner, I have myself seen how much the legal profession as a whole has changed.",2,1323,2021-07-27-T-027-S-01323
2021-07-27-T-027,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"LSOs occupy a special identity. They are part of the Public Service and also form a substantial proportion of the legal profession in Singapore. It is, therefore, important that they keep pace with the changes that are disrupting the profession. For example, digital trends and technology have expanded the frontiers of law.",3,1324,2021-07-27-T-027-S-01324
2021-07-27-T-027,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"One example of a trend needing to be checked is the proliferation of online services on the dark web which have facilitated the rise of complex cross-border cyber crime. This calls for deeper expertise, amongst not just our law enforcement agencies, but also our prosecutors.",4,1325,2021-07-27-T-027-S-01325
2021-07-27-T-027,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),Another example is the increasing use of artificial intelligence in various fields from financial services to legal services and even healthcare. This has given rise to many novel questions of law.,5,1326,2021-07-27-T-027-S-01326
2021-07-27-T-027,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),One need only to look at the increase in the number of law reform reports that have been published in various jurisdictions in this area. Our very own Singapore Academy of Law has published three reports in the past year in this area alone.,6,1327,2021-07-27-T-027-S-01327
2021-07-27-T-027,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I admit that there is a delicate balance to be drawn between specialisation and breadth of experience. As some have said, the world today needs not generalists per se, but deep generalists. These are lateral thinkers who can effectively combine different strands of thought and lessons from different contexts to produce innovative results. What we need is for both legal and judicial officers to pick up depth and breadth in a select number of specific disciplines or specialised areas in a way that allows them to synthesise skills and knowledge and, in so doing, helps the Government innovate in a fast-changing world.",7,1328,2021-07-27-T-027-S-01328
2021-07-27-T-027,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Given the growth in the size of the Legal Service and the growth in the complexity of the work in both the legal and the judicial branches, there are now adequate sub-specialisations within each branch that facilitate the development of such deep generalists.",8,1329,2021-07-27-T-027-S-01329
2021-07-27-T-027,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Having two Services allows for functional separation. Each service can develop its own policies on performance management, recruitment and training. I wish to share my humble view that if a Judicial Service Commission were to be established, movement of officers between the Judiciary, the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) and the various Ministries should continue to be allowed in some form. This is because I am of the firm belief that breadth of exposure is key to the proper development and training of a Legal Service Officer. This belief is born out of my own personal experiences as an LSO in the early days of my career. I started my career as a Judicial Officer, then was posted to the AGC and then was posted back to the Judiciary. I found this movement across branches to be very valuable in providing a more rounded and more informed view of the justice system in Singapore.",9,1330,2021-07-27-T-027-S-01330

2021-07-27-T-027,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"As an independent public institution, the role of the Judiciary is to uphold the law and ensure justice is accessible to all the citizens of Singapore. In a recent survey by the Institute of Policy Studies in March this year, 82% of the respondents had either a great deal or quite a lot of trust in our Courts. As our former Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong observed, there is a high level of trust in the quality and incorruptibility of our judicial system and infrastructure, a strength that has anchored Singapore's economic development.",4,1336,2021-07-27-T-027-S-01336

2021-07-27-T-027,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"When I first started legal practice 32 years ago, we only had the Supreme Court and the Subordinate Courts. Over the years, the laws have developed to cater to our changing society and changing circumstances. The global economy has also changed and our judicial system needs to keep up with such changes. Today, we have increased specialisation to cater to a more diverse population, changing needs and more complex cases.",6,1338,2021-07-27-T-027-S-01338
2021-07-27-T-027,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"For example, the Criminal Courts need to deal with brilliant and sophisticated criminal minds trying to cheat innocent victims of their monies; the Civil Courts have to deal with some of the very complicating civil disputes; intellectual property litigation often involves cross-border disputes and disputes involving sophisticated financial instruments. We also have the Family Justice Courts (FJC); the Community Dispute Resolution Tribunal (CDRT); the Employment Claims Tribunal; and, lastly, the Protection from Harassment Court, all of which require specialised skills in the dispensation of justice to different categories of litigants.",7,1339,2021-07-27-T-027-S-01339
2021-07-27-T-027,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Judicial officers play an important role in the administration of justice, all the more so for State Court Judicial Officers. These officers need more specialised skills and more specialised knowledge to better understand the complex facts and how to apply the law to these facts. They need to have good judicial temperament and show empathy in dealing with members of the public and firmness in dealing with criminals.",8,1340,2021-07-27-T-027-S-01340
2021-07-27-T-027,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"As a family law practitioner, I wish to share that Judges need to deal sensitively with spouses who are highly emotional and they need to deal sensitively with children as well.",9,1341,2021-07-27-T-027-S-01341
2021-07-27-T-027,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the Legal Service Commission (LSC) was set up under Article 111 of the Singapore Constitution. The LSC has played a very important role in staffing the Judiciary, the AGC and the various agencies like the Insolvency Office, Public Trustee's Office, Legal Aid Bureau and the legal departments of the other Government agencies. But having too frequent rotation of Legal Officers under the LSC may not allow them to develop greater depth of skills and expertise required in today's circumstances.",10,1342,2021-07-27-T-027-S-01342
2021-07-27-T-027,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Hence, I submit that it is timely that we consider the need for a dedicated JSC to take over the human resource development functions of officers in the Judiciary. This will allow the proposed JSC to actively source for suitable judicial officers to serve in the various specialised Courts and to meet the challenges of the future. To ensure that we maintain a high level of trust in the judicial system, we need to ensure that our judicial officers are competent and able to dispense justice fairly, expeditiously and to answer the judicial needs for our future.",11,1343,2021-07-27-T-027-S-01343
2021-07-27-T-027,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"I am mindful that this proposal requires a Constitutional amendment. If the Government is minded to move ahead with this proposed review, I would suggest that the Government set up a review committee to ensure that the composition of the new JSC and LSC remains robust and responsive to the new challenges ahead, especially in terms of HR and the personnel management framework for the legal officers.

2021-07-27-T-027,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Let me first set out the Government’s approach towards the Legal Service. The key question is and has always been  how do we structure and design the Legal Service to continually build up our legal system and institutions? This has never been and cannot be a one-off, static exercise; it is a continuous exercise of continuously tending to systematic institution building; to build and improve; to ensure that the structure we have works best for us.",2,1347,2021-07-27-T-027-S-01347
2021-07-27-T-027,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Over the years, we have systematically built up the Legal Service. The enduring challenge has been our very small pool of talent, limited by our small size.",3,1348,2021-07-27-T-027-S-01348
2021-07-27-T-027,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"If we go back to the time of Independence, we had only 45 Legal Service Officers (LSOs) and a total of 130 members at the Bar. From those early days, we have always considered the Legal Service as a critical institution in establishing the rule of law in Singapore. It is part of the DNA of Singapore's governance philosophy.",4,1349,2021-07-27-T-027-S-01349
2021-07-27-T-027,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"The Service provided a dedicated corps of officers who, amongst other things, built a strong, trusted Judiciary, prosecuted without fear or favour; supported effective, active and nimble policymaking; drafted all the laws that are passed by Parliament, and defended and secured Singapore’s interests internationally.",5,1350,2021-07-27-T-027-S-01350
2021-07-27-T-027,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"As Singapore grew and our legal system gained strength, it had to grow and modernise while maintaining high standards of excellence.

2021-07-27-T-027,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"At that time and, for many years after, the small number of LSOs meant that a fully integrated model, where officers were actively deployed to both the Judicial and Legal Branches, better met our needs.

2021-07-27-T-027,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"In 2014, as some Members might know, we made a significant shift. Although the integrated model was retained, separate “Legal” and “Judicial” career tracks were introduced for LSOs in the middle ranks. Existing Personnel Boards were restructured into two Boards, delineated along Branch lines. The Special Personnel Boards exercise jurisdiction over human resource functions, including promotions, of LSOs in respect of Grades below LSO Grade 2. Today, LSOs below LSO Grade 2 constitute about 94% of LSOs.",10,1355,2021-07-27-T-027-S-01355
2021-07-27-T-027,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"The integrated model, on the whole, was retained, particularly for those at the junior and senior ends of the spectrum.

2021-07-27-T-028,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Generally,  BTO flats in the mature estates are highly sought after by home seekers. Given the high demand and limited supply, not all applicants applying for BTO flats in the mature estates can secure a BTO flat in these areas. It is not meaningful to track the time between the first application and when the applicant books a flat in a mature estate as flat buyers may not apply in consecutive BTO exercises and some may apply for flats in non-mature estates as well.",1,1377,2021-07-27-T-028-S-01377
2021-07-27-T-028,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To meet the high demand for flats in mature estates, HDB has launched more new flats in mature estates in recent years. The proportion of BTO projects in the mature towns and estates increased from 44% in 2017 to 55% in 2020. Nonetheless, to increase their chances of securing a BTO flat, home seekers may wish to consider applying for flats in the non-mature estates. First-timer families who are unsuccessful in two or more applications for BTO flats in the non-mature estates will receive an additional ballot chance in their subsequent application in the non-mature estates. Between 2019 and the third quarter of 2020, the mean number of attempts by first-timer families who were successful in their flat applications was 1.3, and the mode and median number of attempts were both 1.",2,1378,2021-07-27-T-028-S-01378

2021-07-27-T-029,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the ballot system for HDB’s BTO flats automatically factors in applicants’ eligibility for priority schemes or flags out the schemes which they qualify for, so applicants need not apply themselves; (b) whether the eligible party has to make a new application and submit the relevant documents for every new balloting exercise; and (c) how long do eligible parties have to wait on average for their applications to be approved.",1,1380,2021-07-27-T-029-S-01380
2021-07-27-T-029,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"HDB has various priority schemes in place to help first-timer families and other applicants with their housing needs. For the Parenthood Priority Scheme (PPS), applicants who meet the eligibility criteria of being first-timer married couples with young children are automatically emplaced on the scheme and do not need to apply.

2021-07-27-T-029,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"However, the other priority schemes, such as the Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS) and the Third Child Priority Scheme (TCPS), impose specific terms and conditions that flat buyers need to comply with until the end of the minimum occupation period of their BTO flats. As such, applicants have to apply for these schemes as part of their HDB application to allow them to decide which priority scheme will best suit their needs and whether they will be able to comply with the corresponding terms and conditions. To ease the application process, the HDB flat application system will prompt flat applicants to choose from a drop-down menu of the priority schemes that may be relevant to them, based on the information that they have provided in the online flat application form.",2,1382,2021-07-27-T-029-S-01382

2021-07-27-T-030,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Government agencies adopt a risk-tiered approach to managing physical items that they own, whereby greater scrutiny is placed on assets that are of higher value or risk. Ministries are responsible for maintaining records and conducting annual stocktakes of their assets. In particular, they have to adhere to requirements and record-keeping for assets worth $5,000 or more. The records would include information, such as (i) date of acquisition; (ii) date of disposal; and (iii) expected period the assets could be used (or useful life).",1,1386,2021-07-27-T-030-S-01386
2021-07-27-T-030,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Accountant-General’s Department provides general guidance on the useful lives of assets that Ministries can use to depreciate their assets. For instance, this is five years for IT systems and eight years for furniture. However, Ministries can choose to depart from these durations for specific assets, should they assess that these specific assets have useful lives that are different from the standard useful lives. This is to allow Ministries to take into account their use of specialised assets or their different operating circumstances, like the intensity of usage.",2,1387,2021-07-27-T-030-S-01387

2021-07-27-T-030,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"All Ministries are expected to continue using assets beyond their useful lives if these assets are in proper working condition and still needed. In the event that the assets become obsolete, uneconomical to repair or are no longer needed, Ministries are required to seek approval from their management to dispose of the assets in the most cost-effective manner and to recover the residual value as far as possible. For instance, Ministries are encouraged to dispose of the assets through sales, transfer to other Government agencies, or donation to charitable or non-profit organisations if the items are in working condition.",4,1389,2021-07-27-T-030-S-01389

2021-07-27-T-032,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Student welfare, including mental well-being, is of utmost importance to MOE. We are monitoring the issue of student suicide closely. The underlying causes of suicide are complex. There are often multiple contributory stressors, including relationship problems with adults and peers, mental health issues, academic-related difficulties and personal struggles. We have observed that the COVID-19 situation has aggravated existing stressors. These could include frustrations arising from disruptions of normal routine, a heightened sense of uncertainty about the future and increased inter-personal conflicts at home due to restricted movement. These observations are in line with international literature, which indicates that the pandemic has resulted in an increase in psychological distress and mental health-related issues among youths.",2,1402,2021-07-27-T-032-S-01402

2021-07-27-T-035,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"First, there was an increase in the number of Malay households staying in HDB public rental flats. This was in tandem with the increase in the supply of HDB 1- and 2-room public rental flats over the last decade, from about 45,500 in 2010 to about 62,000 in 2020. This increase in public rental supply has enabled HDB to provide housing for more lower-income and vulnerable families who do not have other housing options.",3,1418,2021-07-27-T-035-S-01418
2021-07-27-T-035,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Amongst the Malay households who entered public rental, some were young families who were unable to continue staying with their parents and needed housing while they worked towards buying a flat; some were families who were left with no other housing options after having to sell their previous flat due to changes in their family or financial circumstances; and some were seniors who had little savings or income and did not have family support or were unable to stay with their children.",4,1419,2021-07-27-T-035-S-01419
2021-07-27-T-035,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Second, there was also an increase in the share of Malay HDB flat buyers who bought 1- and 2-room HDB flats. Three percent of them did so in 2010 and this increased to 8% in 2020. Similar increases were also observed for other ethnic groups. This could be partly due to singles being able to buy new 2-room flats since July 2013, as well as seniors right-sizing from bigger flats to 2-room Flexi flats.",5,1420,2021-07-27-T-035-S-01420

The account needs to be frozen because there are usually competing claims on the money in the account. These competing claims need to be resolved by the Courts before the money is released to their rightful owners.
