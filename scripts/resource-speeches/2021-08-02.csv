2021-08-02-T-001-S-00001,2021-08-02-T-001,1,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,asked the Minister for Transport what are the transportation infrastructure plans to support the build-up of Tuas Mega Port and increased business activities in Tuas.
2021-08-02-T-001-S-00002,2021-08-02-T-001,2,Chee Hong Tat,"In 2017, LTA completed the Tuas West Extension by adding four MRT stations to the East-West Line. This has brought about significant time savings for commuters travelling to the Tuas area. LTA also introduced two new public bus services 247 and 248 to enhance transport connectivity in the Tuas and Tuas South region. Tuas Road Viaduct Phase 1, which improves accessibility to Tuas South and Tuas Port, has also been completed."
2021-08-02-T-001-S-00003,2021-08-02-T-001,3,Chee Hong Tat,The completion of the Jurong Region Line by the second half of this decade will also significantly improve connectivity in the Western region and benefit workers.
2021-08-02-T-001-S-00004,2021-08-02-T-001,4,Chee Hong Tat,LTA and MPA have also worked with PSA to expand the coverage of their employee shuttle services to complement the public bus network.
2021-08-02-T-001-S-00005,2021-08-02-T-001,5,Chee Hong Tat,"Agencies will continue to monitor the travel demand, review the adequacy of transport provisions, and engage key stakeholders of the area, such as PSA and the unions."
2021-08-02-T-001-S-00006,2021-08-02-T-001,6,Deputy Speaker,Mr Shawn Huang.
2021-08-02-T-001-S-00007,2021-08-02-T-001,7,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank the Senior Minister of State for his answers. I understand that in 2019, an assessment was made that the Tuas South MRT Line has insufficient ridership to support a line there. Three years down the road, based on current estimates, will there be an update for this assessment?"
2021-08-02-T-001-S-00008,2021-08-02-T-001,8,Chee Hong Tat,"Madam, I thank Mr Huang for his question. This is an issue which we will continue to monitor. I have explained in this House previously that the extension of the MRT network will depend on the demand for public transport services. And this is not going to be dependent only on the workers who are going to PSA, but also on the surrounding industrial area where we are planning to build up some manufacturing capabilities in the vicinity of the port."
2021-08-02-T-001-S-00009,2021-08-02-T-001,9,Chee Hong Tat,"So, depending on the developments and also depending on the demand for public transport services, the need to invest additional amount of resources to extend the MRT can then be made based on this more holistic and complete picture."
2021-08-02-T-001-S-00010,2021-08-02-T-001,10,Deputy Speaker,Mr Dennis Tan.
2021-08-02-T-001-S-00011,2021-08-02-T-001,11,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I would just like to ask the Senior Minister of State whether there are any plans to expand the road network or to increase the capacity of current expressways or roads leading to Tuas and the Tuas Mega Port area, specifically, for road transport and logistical purposes? And if so, when will these constructions be taken?"
2021-08-02-T-001-S-00012,2021-08-02-T-001,12,Chee Hong Tat,"Madam, this network of roads leading to the port is important. As Mr Tan pointed out, we want to make sure that for the container trucks and also other vehicles that are travelling to and from the port, there will be sufficient capacity to cater to this requirement."
2021-08-02-T-001-S-00013,2021-08-02-T-001,13,Chee Hong Tat,"It is an ongoing review. The development of the port will not happen in one phase but over a period of time; demand will build up. And therefore, the development of the road infrastructure to support port operations would also have to be reviewed in tandem with how we scale up the operations of Tuas Port."
2021-08-02-T-002-S-00014,2021-08-02-T-002,14,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) for each year in the past five years, what is the estimated percentage of marine debris that originates from (i) disposal of waste from ships and (ii) floating debris from neighbouring countries; and (b) if such data is not currently collected, whether the Ministry will start collecting the data."
2021-08-02-T-002-S-00015,2021-08-02-T-002,15,Deputy Speaker,Mr Louis Ng.
2021-08-02-T-002-S-00016,2021-08-02-T-002,16,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Thank you, Madam. I thank the Minister of State for the reply. I think we have the very beautiful upcoming Khatib Bongsu Nature Park, which I think is going to be covered by marine trash and these alarming figures that the Minister of State has just mentioned. Clean-up after clean-up, we realise that it really and truly is never-ending."
2021-08-02-T-002-S-00017,2021-08-02-T-002,17,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"So, I am just wondering whether MSE can study this. By looking at the packaging labels, we can sort of determine where the trash came from. So, whether we can do some baseline study so that we can address the root of the problem."
2021-08-02-T-002-S-00018,2021-08-02-T-002,18,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Secondly, as part of the Parliamentary Question (PQ), I think it is really an issue of the ships throwing their trash into the waters as well. So, can MSE also look into this and address these root causes?"
2021-08-02-T-002-S-00019,2021-08-02-T-002,19,Desmond Tan,"I thank the Member for the supplementary questions. The bulk of our beach litter comes from the marine trash that are brought in by our natural tidal waves. Given that our monsoon seasons are twice a year, it does not really help. The Member did suggest maybe looking at the labels of the trash and from the labels, we probably can tell where it was made, but it is unlikely to be able to confirm where the litter is thrown from."
2021-08-02-T-002-S-00020,2021-08-02-T-002,20,Desmond Tan,I will take the opportunity to also explain what are the things that have already been done by the Government to try to minimise and reduce the marine trash and marine pollution.
2021-08-02-T-002-S-00021,2021-08-02-T-002,21,Desmond Tan,"First of all, we have strict regulations on pollution control as well as waste disposal. This is both from the land-based inland waterways as well as from the ships from the sea, which are currently regulated by MPA."
2021-08-02-T-002-S-00022,2021-08-02-T-002,22,Desmond Tan,"For land-based sources, NEA administers the Environmental Protection and Management Act as well as the Environmental Public Health Act that governs the discharge of polluting compounds and litter into the waterways such as plastics, chemicals and oil. Our waste management approach in Singapore also ensures that we properly dispose our waste and minimise any waste that is washed into the ocean."
2021-08-02-T-002-S-00023,2021-08-02-T-002,23,Desmond Tan,"As for the ships, MPA is the agency that implements regulations to minimise marine pollution through the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea Act, or PPSA. Any form of disposal into the sea from the ship, is currently prohibited and any violation can result in fines or imprisonment. Ships are also required to maintain records of all their garbage and management plans for verification by inspectors. I understand that MPA today, on average, sends out five garbage collection vessels every day and they have nine additional vessels to pick up the marine trash flotsam from the sea."
2021-08-02-T-002-S-00024,2021-08-02-T-002,24,Desmond Tan,"At the regional level, Singapore, along with ASEAN member states, continues to adopt the Bangkok Declaration on Combating Marine Debris in ASEAN Region and the ASEAN Framework of Action on Marine Debris from 2019. We will continue to actively participate to address marine debris pollution and to contribute to initiatives and ideas that can help ASEAN's collective as well as individual capabilities to address the marine pollution issue."
2021-08-02-T-002-S-00025,2021-08-02-T-002,25,Desmond Tan,"These are the existing measures. We recognise that despite all these regulations, there are still tonnes of garbage that are swept onto our beaches every day. These are important places that our residents and our people value. We thank the many community groups and individuals for stepping forward to keep these clean. NEA will continue to do its part to step up on the cleaning, especially during the monsoon seasons."
2021-08-02-T-002-S-00026,2021-08-02-T-002,26,Desmond Tan,"One last point. I wish to mention that to better understand the marine litter situation in Singapore, NEA has recently embarked on a two-year study to gain a better understanding of the levels as well as the pathways of marine litter and micro-plastics in Singapore's inland waters, coastal waters as well as recreational beaches, which could then support recommendations for future marine litter and micro-plastics monitoring programme or initiatives."
2021-08-02-T-002-S-00027,2021-08-02-T-002,27,Desmond Tan,I want to caveat at this juncture that it is not clear if the study would be able to explain the causes or the origins of the debris but we think that is an important step forward.
2021-08-02-T-003-S-00028,2021-08-02-T-003,28,Wan Rizal,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the number of licensed cleaning businesses that have failed to comply with the Progressive Wage Model since its implementation in 2014; (b) what actions have been taken against these companies; and (c) what efforts are taken to professional the cleaning industry and promote good practices to transform the industry.
2021-08-02-T-003-S-00029,2021-08-02-T-003,29,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, since the introduction of the Progressive Wage Model until 31 May 2021, NEA has imposed financial penalties against 57 licensed cleaning businesses and issued warning letters to 52 cleaning businesses for failing to comply with requirements under the Progressive Wage Model, such as failure to pay eligible cleaners bonuses or progressive wages."
2021-08-02-T-003-S-00030,2021-08-02-T-003,30,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Under the Environmental Services Industry Transformation Map, strategies and initiatives have been developed to professionalise the cleaning workforce through the adoption of technology, upskilling of cleaners and improving procurement practices. These will help to build a professional, skilled and manpower-lean cleaning workforce and drive the adoption of good practices within the industry."
2021-08-02-T-003-S-00031,2021-08-02-T-003,31,Deputy Speaker,Dr Wan Rizal.
2021-08-02-T-003-S-00032,2021-08-02-T-003,32,Wan Rizal,"Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I thank the Minister for the reply. I must say that I am heartened to know that companies were caught for breaching this and I am happy to know that the workers are given such strong support."
2021-08-02-T-003-S-00033,2021-08-02-T-003,33,Wan Rizal,"Based on industry feedback, some companies may try to circumvent the latest Progressive Wage Model (PWM) requirement. They do this by cutting corners at the expense of service delivery to service buyers, engaging in non-licensed cleaning businesses and so on. Will NEA consider a whistle-blower system that will help in ensuring both buyers of cleaning services and cleaning companies comply with the intricacies of the PWM, such as fair contracts to achieve the desired social outcomes?"
2021-08-02-T-003-S-00034,2021-08-02-T-003,34,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"I would like to thank the Member for his interest in protecting our cleaners. The short answer to his question is yes, we will consider anyone who informs us about non-compliance. NEA and MSE, together with MOM, will conduct enforcement checks."
2021-08-02-T-004-S-00035,2021-08-02-T-004,35,Gerald Giam Yean Song,asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the progress of regulatory approval of the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine; (b) when does Singapore expect to receive its first shipments of this vaccine for which advance purchase orders have already been placed; and (c) whether there plans to expedite the acquisition and approval of this vaccine in Singapore.
2021-08-02-T-004-S-00036,2021-08-02-T-004,36,He Ting Ru,"asked the Minister for Health (a) whether short-term visit pass (STVP) holders are eligible for any vaccination schemes in Singapore; (b) if yes, when was this available to such individuals and how many have been vaccinated; and (c) if not, whether the Multi-Ministry Task Force will allow STVP holders who live in close contact with long-term residents to be eligible for the vaccination schemes."
2021-08-02-T-004-S-00037,2021-08-02-T-004,37,Janil Puthucheary,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, may I please address Question Nos 4 and 5?"
2021-08-02-T-004-S-00038,2021-08-02-T-004,38,Deputy Speaker,"Yes, please go ahead."
2021-08-02-T-004-S-00039,2021-08-02-T-004,39,Janil Puthucheary,My answer will also cover Written Question No 23 from today's Order Paper as well as the Oral questions filed by Mr Yip Hon Weng
2021-08-02-T-004-S-00040,2021-08-02-T-004,40,Janil Puthucheary,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the national vaccination programme has been progressing well. As of 31 July 2021, 61% of our population have completed the full vaccination regimen. We are also making steady progress with our seniors  79% of those aged 70 and above have been vaccinated with at least one dose. More seniors are coming forward to be vaccinated; each day, about 1,000 seniors sign up for their first dose."
2021-08-02-T-004-S-00041,2021-08-02-T-004,41,Janil Puthucheary,"We have to continue encouraging our seniors to get vaccinated because they are the most vulnerable to serious illnesses. More than 96,000 or 21% of seniors aged 70 and above have not booked a vaccination appointment. This is six percentage points higher than the general population. We will continue to reach out to as many seniors as possible and encourage them to get vaccinated. Staff and volunteers from the People's Association and the Silver Generation Office have intensified their outreach efforts through house visits and engagement dialogues. They are trained and equipped with an information kit to correct misinformation about mRNA vaccines and allay the fears of seniors. MOH has also called on all primary care providers to persuade seniors who are their regular patients to go for their COVID-19 vaccinations."
2021-08-02-T-004-S-00042,2021-08-02-T-004,42,Janil Puthucheary,"Our mobile vaccination teams have started to provide bed-bound and less mobile seniors with vaccinations in their homes or in the heartlands. The service has started in a few towns with a higher proportion of seniors and complements the main vaccination efforts at the vaccination centres, all of which are wheelchair-accessible. Individuals who have received one dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine but are unable to receive the second dose due to allergic reactions have been invited to take the Sinovac or Coronavac vaccine. MOH has established a dedicated public health programme for them to be vaccinated at a clinic in public hospitals for closer monitoring, considering their previous allergic reaction. These individuals, who receive one dose of the mRNA vaccine and then complete the vaccination process with Sinovac or Coronavac, will be considered as fully vaccinated."
2021-08-02-T-004-S-00043,2021-08-02-T-004,43,Janil Puthucheary,"This group of individuals who are allergic to the mRNA vaccines may also choose to wait for the Novavax vaccine that MOH has procured and expects to be delivered by the end of the year. MOH and HSA are working closely with Novavax to facilitate the regulatory submission for their protein subunit vaccine. The review timeline will depend on the availability and the submission of data by the company to HSA. While we recognise the need to facilitate timely access to the vaccine, there should be no compromise on the scientific rigour of the assessment of their quality, safety and efficacy."
2021-08-02-T-004-S-00044,2021-08-02-T-004,44,Janil Puthucheary,"As for the Sinovac vaccine, on 5 July 2021, the company submitted to HSA the critical data requested by the agency for PSAR approval. HSA is conducting a careful and thorough review of the data and aims to complete its evaluation before the end of August. The national vaccination programme will cover all who make Singapore their home or who are here for an extended period of time. We are reviewing how short-term pass holders, such as those who are more vulnerable and who have been in Singapore on an extended basis due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, may receive vaccinations. We will announce details later."
2021-08-02-T-004-S-00045,2021-08-02-T-004,45,Deputy Speaker,Mr Gerald Giam.
2021-08-02-T-004-S-00046,2021-08-02-T-004,46,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Thank you, Madam. I know quite a number of people, including some of my residents, are eagerly awaiting the approval of the Novavax vaccine which is a protein-based non-mNRA vaccine, while people who have had allergic reactions to the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine are unable to take the second dose. If they get the Novavax vaccine, similar to the Sinovac vaccine, would they be able to be considered fully vaccinated?"
2021-08-02-T-004-S-00047,2021-08-02-T-004,47,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Secondly, some seniors are genuinely concerned about the safety of vaccines, possibly because of the many private messages they might have received about people suffering adverse effects after getting the jabs. Can I ask if MOH can strive to provide more detailed information and updates in response to widely-circulated reports of adverse reactions to the vaccines so that these incidents do not get imprinted in people's minds as this may lead to further hesitancy?"
2021-08-02-T-004-S-00048,2021-08-02-T-004,48,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Lastly, just a quick question. Will international students, including those studying in private schools in Singapore, be allowed to get vaccinated and are there plans to open up the vaccines to other non-residents once there is sufficient supply, possibly at a fee?"
2021-08-02-T-004-S-00049,2021-08-02-T-004,49,Janil Puthucheary,"Mdm Deputy Speaker,  I thank the Member for the questions."
2021-08-02-T-004-S-00050,2021-08-02-T-004,50,Janil Puthucheary,"The first question was whether, if somebody had a first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and had an allergic reaction and completed the process through Novavax, would they be considered fully vaccinated? So, that is taking the analogy from what I have just described as a process where you take one dose of an mRNA vaccine and a second dose of the Sinovac or Coronavax vaccine."
2021-08-02-T-004-S-00051,2021-08-02-T-004,51,Janil Puthucheary,"I think the first thing is that we should not try to second-guess or jump the gun on the professional process that needs to be undergone through our Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC-19 Committee). We need the data submitted by Novavax. We need to study it and make sure that it meets the standards of quality, safety and efficacy. And, in principle, if it does meet those same standards, I see no reason why it should not be considered in the same way as the other processes that I have just described. But I think it is premature at this point to guarantee that it will be. We will get the data, will put it through the process and then we will announce the details later on."
2021-08-02-T-004-S-00052,2021-08-02-T-004,52,Janil Puthucheary,"Mr Gerald Giam brought up a very important point, which is that seniors can get concerned about private messages spreading vaccine misinformation or disinformation. Indeed, MOH continues to try to push back against this by putting out information and infographics. Everyone has a responsibility. It is not just MOH, but, as a society, we do need to make sure that we are providing everyone – our families, our friends, our workplace context – reliable information and not inadvertently spreading misinformation and disinformation. We need to give them access to where they can also educate themselves and seek more information. So, MOH will continue to call out false news, disinformation, put out timely facts and clarifications through the media, as well as our various social media platforms. We try to maintain a sort of a central repository of this at the MOH website and at gov.sg/resources."
2021-08-02-T-004-S-00053,2021-08-02-T-004,53,Janil Puthucheary,"Mr Gerald Giam then asked about the possibility of international students and other non-residents receiving the vaccination. As I have explained, we are studying how, when and the process through which people who are here for a shorter period of time can potentially get the vaccine and details will be announced later."
2021-08-02-T-004-S-00054,2021-08-02-T-004,54,Deputy Speaker,Ms He Ting Ru.
2021-08-02-T-004-S-00055,2021-08-02-T-004,55,He Ting Ru,"Thank you, Madam. I just have a point of clarification or supplementary question for the Senior Minister of State. Can I just ask what are the considerations that are given to whether STVP holders will eventually be eligible for the vaccine, given, after all, a lot of them are living very closely with our longer-term residents or even Singaporeans and PRs within the community? So, what are the reasons why they were not initially considered to be eligible for vaccinations and what are the considerations now when the Senior Minister of State has indicated that there is a review ongoing? When will we expect to hear the outcome of this review?"
2021-08-02-T-004-S-00056,2021-08-02-T-004,56,Janil Puthucheary,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for the questions. The process is ongoing. In general, we will apply similar principles which are around risks and whether the person is at risk in terms of COVID-19. So, age is, of course, a consideration, as well as risks to the people around them"
2021-08-02-T-005-S-00057,2021-08-02-T-005,57,Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what is the proportion of self-employed persons that could not receive their COVID-19 Recovery Grants due to their insufficient MediSave payments.
2021-08-02-T-005-S-00058,2021-08-02-T-005,58,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the Member, Mr Leon Perera"
2021-08-02-T-005-S-00059,2021-08-02-T-005,59,Deputy Speaker,"Yes, please."
2021-08-02-T-005-S-00060,2021-08-02-T-005,60,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Thank you. Both CSG and CRG assist lower to middle income resident employees who, as a result of the economic impact of COVID-19, are"
2021-08-02-T-005-S-00061,2021-08-02-T-005,61,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,(a) Involuntarily unemployed due to retrenchment or contract termination;
2021-08-02-T-005-S-00062,2021-08-02-T-005,62,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,(b) Placed on involuntary no-pay leave for at least three consecutive months; or
2021-08-02-T-005-S-00063,2021-08-02-T-005,63,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,(c) Experiencing significant salary loss for at least three consecutive months.
2021-08-02-T-005-S-00064,2021-08-02-T-005,64,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"CRG also supports self-employed persons (SEPs) who experience significant loss in net trade income for at least three consecutive months. Applications for the CSG closed on 31 December 2020, while CRG is open for applications until 31 December 2021."
2021-08-02-T-005-S-00065,2021-08-02-T-005,65,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For both CSG and CRG, applicants experiencing job loss are required to provide supporting documents for their job search or training efforts. They can include attending job interviews or applying for training opportunities via Government-linked touchpoints like the MyCareersFuture and MySkillsFuture portals."
2021-08-02-T-005-S-00066,2021-08-02-T-005,66,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Employees who are employed but are experiencing income loss or are on involuntary no-pay-leave are exempted from this criterion because they are still working or may be recalled to work and, hence, will face more difficulty committing to job search or training. SEP applicants who wish to remain in their current sector or trade can provide supporting evidence of their attempts to contact new clients or search for new business opportunities, in lieu of job search and training. We have also implemented the COVID-19 Recovery Grant – Temporary (CRG-T), which facilitates quicker assistance to those who are economically affected during this period of Heightened Alert. As it may be challenging for applicants to find jobs or undertake training under the tightened safe management measures, CRG-T does not have job search and training conditions."
2021-08-02-T-005-S-00067,2021-08-02-T-005,67,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Applicants failing to meet the job search or training criterion accounted for less than 1% of unsuccessful CSG applications and around 3% of unsuccessful CRG applications as of 27 June 2021.
2021-08-02-T-005-S-00068,2021-08-02-T-005,68,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Member also asked about the CRG criterion for SEPs to fulfil their MediSave contribution obligations. All working individuals should regularly contribute to their CPF for their retirement and future healthcare needs. As SEPs do not receive MediSave contributions from employers, they are required to contribute to their own MediSave accounts based on their past years' declared earnings."
2021-08-02-T-005-S-00069,2021-08-02-T-005,69,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"To qualify for a second tranche of CRG assistance, SEP applicants should either not have any outstanding MediSave contributions or commit to making contributions via a GIRO instalment plan with CPF Board. We have waived this requirement for those applying for their first tranche of CRG to allow eligible SEPs to receive timely assistance and give them more time to make arrangements for their MediSave contributions. Individuals who do not meet the MediSave contribution criterion make up less than 1% of the unsuccessful CRG applications by SEPs."
2021-08-02-T-005-S-00070,2021-08-02-T-005,70,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I would like to encourage those who do not meet the qualifying criteria for CRG, but are facing extenuating circumstances and need help, to approach our Social Service Offices (SSOs). Our SSOs will look into ways to support them and may also link them to other assistance schemes or community partners for further assistance, if necessary."
2021-08-02-T-005-S-00071,2021-08-02-T-005,71,Deputy Speaker,Mr Leon Perera.
2021-08-02-T-005-S-00072,2021-08-02-T-005,72,Leon Perera,I thank the Minister for his reply and also the assurance that the SEPs who could not meet MediSave requirements constitute 1% of those who are rejected.
2021-08-02-T-005-S-00073,2021-08-02-T-005,73,Leon Perera,"Just one clarification. The Minister mentioned that the Government will consider cases where SEPs still have MediSave arrears, if they will commit to an instalment plan or a GIRO plan, going forward. Bearing in mind that some of the SEPs at the lower end of income may still be very affected by the COVID-19 situation, would such consideration include allowing a time interval before the GIRO plan kicks in? Because some of the SEPs work in certain industries, like MICE and tourism-related, for example, may still face very low income for quite some time, and they may be able to commit to instalment payments of MediSave, but perhaps not so quickly or immediately."
2021-08-02-T-005-S-00074,2021-08-02-T-005,74,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As I mentioned, the number that is rejected on the basis of MediSave contributions is very, very low; less than 1%. This testifies to the commitment by the 99% or more SEPs who actually are very committed to grow their MediSave account, and I think we should compliment them and reward them and not, on the other hand, loosen too much on this MediSave contribution criterion."
2021-08-02-T-005-S-00075,2021-08-02-T-005,75,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Having said that, for everyone who needs help, we will extend help as much as we can. Even if they cannot qualify for CRG, I know, our SSOs look for every other means to help them to ensure that they are not somehow in dire need because of not meeting specific criteria of CRG or other assistance plans."
2021-08-02-T-005-S-00076,2021-08-02-T-005,76,Deputy Speaker,Leader of the Opposition.
2021-08-02-T-005-S-00077,2021-08-02-T-005,77,Pritam Singh,"I would like to thank the Minister for the reply. Just to give us a better sense of the 1%, in absolute numbers, how many individuals are you referring to?"
2021-08-02-T-005-S-00078,2021-08-02-T-005,78,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I thank the Leader of Opposition for the question. I do not have the specific number, but to be specific about the percentage, it is 0.04%. So, 0.04% is very, very small."
2021-08-02-T-006-S-00079,2021-08-02-T-006,79,Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) to date, what is the number of self-employed persons (SEPs) who could have qualified for Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) but are unable to do so because of their lack of MediSave contributions; and (b) whether the Government will consider providing concessions for SEPs to qualify for WIS by having their MediSave eligibility temporarily lowered in light of the COVID-19 crisis or having their MediSave contributions spaced out."
2021-08-02-T-006-S-00080,2021-08-02-T-006,80,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme tops up the incomes of our lower-wage workers, both employees and self-employed persons (SEPs). Eligible SEPs receive up to $2,667 in Workfare payouts a year."
2021-08-02-T-006-S-00081,2021-08-02-T-006,81,Zaqy Mohamad,"All lower-wage employees and SEPs are required to contribute to the CPF to benefit from Workfare. This is because Workfare is a permanent scheme. The need to meet CPF obligations is part of Workfare's eligibility criteria and is consistently applied to both employees and SEPs. This ensures that workers continue to take personal responsibility in saving for their long-term retirement and healthcare needs, while receiving Government support via Workfare."
2021-08-02-T-006-S-00082,2021-08-02-T-006,82,Zaqy Mohamad,"SEPs are only required to contribute to their MediSave accounts after declaring their incomes at the end of the Work Year. They have up to two years to do so. Based on latest available data, among SEPs who met all other Workfare criteria for Work Year 2018, nine in 10 fulfilled the required MediSave contributions and received their Workfare payouts. Complete data on WIS SEP recipients for Work Year 2019 and 2020 are not available, as SEPs have up till 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2022, respectively to make their required MediSave contributions to receive Workfare."
2021-08-02-T-006-S-00083,2021-08-02-T-006,83,Zaqy Mohamad,"Within the two-year period, SEPs can also choose the mode of payment that best suits their circumstances. SEPs can either pay as a lump-sum or via monthly GIRO instalments. CPF Board also exercises flexibility to help SEPs who are facing financial difficulties, such as reducing monthly instalments by extending the GIRO arrangement, or temporarily deferring monthly instalments. We also consider exceptional appeals on a case-by-case basis. Once the SEP makes the required MediSave contributions in full, they will receive their Workfare payout."
2021-08-02-T-006-S-00084,2021-08-02-T-006,84,Zaqy Mohamad,We recognise that this is a difficult period. SEPs who are facing significant income loss and require urgent financial assistance may apply for MSF's COVID-19 Recovery Grant (CRG) or COVID-19 Recovery Grant – Temporary (CRG-T). Taxi and private hire car drivers are also receiving additional financial support from LTA's COVID-19 Driver Relief Fund (CDRF).
2021-08-02-T-006-S-00085,2021-08-02-T-006,85,Deputy Speaker,Mr Leon Perera.
2021-08-02-T-006-S-00086,2021-08-02-T-006,86,Leon Perera,"I thank the Senior Minister of State for his reply. Just one clarification about what he said. I just wanted to understand if, in fact, SEPs who are unable to make the MediSave shortfall, whether there will be consideration given on a case-by-case basis to defer the time at which they can pay the MediSave or start an instalment plan, but they may still be able to get the Workfare payment before that happens. I believe the Senior Minister of State did refer to that, but I just wanted to clarify."
2021-08-02-T-006-S-00087,2021-08-02-T-006,87,Leon Perera,"The reason I ask this is because I think many SEPs are at the lower end of the income scale and very badly hit by COVID-19. A report by DBS Bank, from December last year, said that those of their customers who are earning less than $3,000 a month, had about one-month of emergency funds left. This was in December last year, the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Just wondering what is the extent of flexibility the Government will show to SEPs in that position?"
2021-08-02-T-006-S-00088,2021-08-02-T-006,88,Zaqy Mohamad,"I thank the Member for his question. In fact, these are valid concerns, given the current conditions. As I shared in MOM, we are quite flexible because the SEP has two years to make MediSave contributions and within that, we can provide monthly instalments, or in some cases, as we mentioned, we will put temporary deferment if required."
2021-08-02-T-006-S-00089,2021-08-02-T-006,89,Zaqy Mohamad,"The difference between the Workfare and CRG, or some of the other assistance schemes, is that, this is more an income top-up supplement as opposed to direct financial assistance that one might get out of SSO or CRG. So, these are slightly different schemes, and therefore, the focus is slightly different too."
2021-08-02-T-006-S-00090,2021-08-02-T-006,90,Zaqy Mohamad,"For most SEPs, the MediSave contribution is far lower than that of normal employees. For example, most employees are paying about 20% CPF contributions, while the SEPs' payable is 10.5% on average. For lower-income workers, I think it goes even lower than that. To some extent, it is already a low bar and we are giving a long two-year period for SEPs to contribute to MediSave. I think that is generally quite reasonable and certainly, we can give flexibility, where required."
2021-08-02-T-007-S-00091,2021-08-02-T-007,91,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) for each year in the past five years, what are the average and median starting salaries of a social worker; and (b) whether the Ministry intends to recommend higher salaries for social workers."
2021-08-02-T-007-S-00092,2021-08-02-T-007,92,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mdm Speaker, based on MSF's Manpower and Salary Survey which collected salary data of employees in the Social Service Agencies (SSAs) in 2015, 2017 and 2019, the monthly mean salary of entry-level social workers increased from $3,500 in 2015 and 2017, to $3,600 in 2019, while their monthly median salary increased from $3,400 in 2015 and 2017, to $3,600 in 2019. The figures are comparable with the salaries for all fresh graduates, including those without a Social Work Degree, in those years, based on the Graduate Employment Survey (GES) conducted by the Autonomous Universities."
2021-08-02-T-007-S-00093,2021-08-02-T-007,93,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MSF and the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) are committed in guiding the sector to pay competitive salaries for all social service professionals, including social workers. NCSS publishes sector salary guidelines for a range of professions in the social service sector. The guidelines are updated annually to keep pace with competing market and general wage movements. The majority of SSAs adopt the guidelines and we strongly encourage SSAs to adhere to these guidelines to reward and retain good staff."
2021-08-02-T-007-S-00094,2021-08-02-T-007,94,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Madam, I thank the Minister for the reply, but could I ask the second part of the Parliamentary Question (PQ), which is whether MSF will be proposing increases to the salaries of social workers in the next financial year? And second, I am sure they are not in it for the money, but I think a good salary would help in terms of retaining social workers where I think there is a problem. So, could I ask MSF what else it is doing to retain social workers?"
2021-08-02-T-007-S-00095,2021-08-02-T-007,95,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As I mentioned to the Member and the Members of this House, the guidelines are updated annually to keep pace with a competing market, so it is not just about the competition between SSAs, but also competition for qualified staff that will move out of the sector to other sectors too."
2021-08-02-T-007-S-00096,2021-08-02-T-007,96,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Therefore, we want to make sure that it is at the level, which commensurate with the skills and the market competition that these graduates or social workers can face. I think we should not get ahead of ourselves and we should not intervene with market forces, unless it is drastically bad for our social workers. Even when we do, we must know when to go out and not intervene all the time."
2021-08-02-T-008-S-00097,2021-08-02-T-008,97,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"asked the Minister for Health whether beyond the current utilisation limits for outpatient counselling and inpatient hospitalisation, the Government intends to further tackle the issue of longer term affordability and consistent accessibility for those seeking treatments and medication relating to mental health conditions given that the COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on our people's mental health and insurance options for mental health conditions are limited."
2021-08-02-T-008-S-00098,2021-08-02-T-008,98,Janil Puthucheary,"Madam, MOH has put in place various support measures to ensure access to affordable mental health services."
2021-08-02-T-008-S-00099,2021-08-02-T-008,99,Janil Puthucheary,"At our public health institutions (PHIs), eligible patients can receive up to 80% subsidies for inpatient mental health treatment. They are also covered under MediShield Life and can tap on MediSave to offset their remaining bills, up to prevailing limits. For outpatient treatments, eligible patients can receive up to 75% of subsidies at polyclinics and public specialist outpatient clinics. Patients can also enjoy subsidies of up to $500 per year at participating private general practitioner (GP) clinics via the Community Health Assist Scheme, for the management of mental health conditions under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP). In addition, patients can also tap on their MediSave to pay for their outpatient treatment of mental health conditions under the CDMP. Those who are 60 years old and above can additionally tap on the Flexi-MediSave scheme for outpatient expenses."
2021-08-02-T-008-S-00100,2021-08-02-T-008,100,Janil Puthucheary,"To ensure that no Singaporean is denied access to appropriate treatment due to inability to pay, MediFund is available at PHIs as a safety net to assist Singaporeans who are unable to afford their mental health treatments despite Government subsidies, insurance and MediSave."
2021-08-02-T-008-S-00101,2021-08-02-T-008,101,Janil Puthucheary,"MOH reviews the various financial schemes regularly to ensure they meet the needs of Singaporeans. For example, the MediSave annual withdrawal limit for patients with complex chronic conditions was increased from $500 to $700 from January 2021. The annual limit for Flexi-MediSave was also increased from $200 to $300 from June 2021. Since 1 March 2021, the MediShield Life claim limits for inpatient mental health treatment has been raised to $160 per day for up to 60 days per policy year, from the previous $100 per day for up to 35 days per policy year, which will help to improve patient affordability."
2021-08-02-T-008-S-00102,2021-08-02-T-008,102,Deputy Speaker,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin.
2021-08-02-T-008-S-00103,2021-08-02-T-008,103,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank the Senior Minister of State for his response."
2021-08-02-T-008-S-00104,2021-08-02-T-008,104,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Encouraging help-seeking behaviour is an important part of any mental health strategy. Affordability and the stigma around seeking help are two factors of the many which affect an individual's decision whether or not to reach out for help. For some, the treatment required may be prolonged over several years and can be very expensive. I have two points."
2021-08-02-T-008-S-00105,2021-08-02-T-008,105,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"The first is, many young working adults have come up to me and they are worried about the impact of seeking help and having mental health records and how this may affect their career prospects in the future. While there are many good psychiatrists and counsellors in the public health sector, there remains a segment who fear that their mental health records, will be accessible by Government agencies as well as employers. And so, they postpone seeking help because private help remains out of reach. What is the Ministry's assurance and clarity on this point?"
2021-08-02-T-008-S-00106,2021-08-02-T-008,106,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"The second point is, turning to insurance; Will the Government consider working more closely with private insurers to encourage the provision of affordable and comprehensive mental health coverage for Singaporeans, just like any other medical and surgical coverage? For example, legislation like the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act in the US?"
2021-08-02-T-008-S-00107,2021-08-02-T-008,107,Janil Puthucheary,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for her questions. Let me answer the second point. As far as working with insurance companies to further optimise the coverage process and ensure affordability, that is an on-going piece of work. It will continue and the Ministry is committed to working with the stakeholders in order to ensure that it happens. So, the short answer is yes."
2021-08-02-T-008-S-00108,2021-08-02-T-008,108,Janil Puthucheary,"To her first question, if I understand her question correctly, it is about the issue of health records and the confidentiality of health records. I think she had asked about the difference in the confidentiality of health records between private practitioners and public practitioners. We should be clear that your health record is held in confidence by your medical care provider, regardless of whether it is a public practitioner or a private practitioner. We have a fair amount of regulation and legislation in order to protect and reinforce that process. I hope I have understood her question correctly."
2021-08-02-T-008-S-00109,2021-08-02-T-008,109,Deputy Speaker,Ms Raeesah Khan.
2021-08-02-T-008-S-00110,2021-08-02-T-008,110,Raeesah Khan,"I thank the Senior Minister of State. I have two supplementary questions. I am glad to hear that the withdrawal limit for inpatient treatment is now $160. But the withdrawal limit for physical treatment is $455. Is there going to be a review to, hopefully, equalise this amount?"
2021-08-02-T-008-S-00111,2021-08-02-T-008,111,Raeesah Khan,"Secondly, we know that the pandemic has exacerbated a lot of mental health issues. Are there any plans for establishing another tertiary psychiatric institution?"
2021-08-02-T-008-S-00112,2021-08-02-T-008,112,Janil Puthucheary,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for her questions. The withdrawal limits are always under a regular review. The principle is not so much to make sure that there is a completely flat equivalence for all conditions and for all circumstances, but what is the outcome in terms of access and affordability, both bill size, out-of-pocket and the number of incidents of care-seeking behaviour within a period of time for an individual. So, I think it is the outcome that we want to drive in terms of setting withdrawal limits, together with the outcome of a sustainable healthcare system."
2021-08-02-T-008-S-00113,2021-08-02-T-008,113,Janil Puthucheary,"As for the provisions of infrastructure in terms of dealing with the pandemic and its effects on mental health, this is a matter that the COVID-19 Mental Wellness Taskforce is looking at, as well as the new Inter-Agency Taskforce on Mental Health. We will be looking at the infrastructure and the service provisions that we need for our mental health needs."
2021-08-02-T-008-S-00114,2021-08-02-T-008,114,Janil Puthucheary,"As to whether provision for an extra tertiary hospital is necessary, it is one of the possibilities that the Member has suggested. It is not going to be the only issue that we will be studying. So, it will be looked at and reviewed."
2021-08-02-T-009-S-00115,2021-08-02-T-009,115,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Question No 10, please."
2021-08-02-T-009-S-00116,2021-08-02-T-009,116,Sun Xueling,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the National Schools Games involves intermingling of students from different schools in largely mask-off settings. As such, MOE takes a calibrated approach to the resumption of the games to ensure the safety and well-being of our students."
2021-08-02-T-009-S-00117,2021-08-02-T-009,117,Sun Xueling,"Earlier this year, MOE announced the cancellation of the remaining National Schools Games for 2021 due to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in our community."
2021-08-02-T-009-S-00118,2021-08-02-T-009,118,Sun Xueling,"Our current plan is to resume all sports in the National Schools Games, in a phased approach, next year in 2022. As majority of our Secondary school and Junior College and MI students would have been vaccinated, we aim to resume all sports for the National Schools Games for this group of students first. As for Primary school students, the pace of resumption would depend on whether younger students would be eligible to be vaccinated. If not, we would need to exercise greater caution. For this group of students, similar to what was practised earlier this year, we will resume with low-risk non-contact sports such as badminton, table tennis, tennis and volleyball before higher risk contact sports such as basketball, football, hockey and rugby are considered. If necessary, we will make modifications to the games and competition format to mitigate some of the risk involved in these games."
2021-08-02-T-009-S-00119,2021-08-02-T-009,119,Sun Xueling,"As inter-school games and sports competitions like the National Schools Games are key student development experiences, integral to our students’ holistic development and overall sense of well-being, we would want to resume these activities as soon as we can and when it is safe to do so."
2021-08-02-T-010-S-00120,2021-08-02-T-010,120,Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many Employment Pass and S Pass holders have submitted fabricated or forged education qualification certifications in the past three years in the ICT industry; and (b) whether the Ministry will review and work with only reputable overseas educational institutions with a proven track record for approval of both Employment Pass and S Pass applications.
2021-08-02-T-010-S-00121,2021-08-02-T-010,121,Tan See Leng,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, good afternoon. From 2018 to 2020, 11 Employment Pass and S Pass holders working in the Infocomm Technology (ICT) industry were found to have submitted false qualifications to MOM. Their work passes were revoked and they were permanently barred from working in Singapore."
2021-08-02-T-010-S-00122,2021-08-02-T-010,122,Tan See Leng,All employers have the primary responsibility to ensure the authenticity and quality of their candidates’ qualifications when submitting work pass applications.
2021-08-02-T-010-S-00123,2021-08-02-T-010,123,Tan See Leng,"MOM also conducts additional checks by screening the qualifications submitted through our database of institutions. This database is reviewed regularly through our scan of open source reports and research from third-party screening organisations. For applications containing qualifications from institutions that are not in our database, we require employers to submit verification proof from third-party screening organisations to ensure that the qualifications submitted are accredited. We will reject applications containing fake or unaccredited qualifications."
2021-08-02-T-010-S-00124,2021-08-02-T-010,124,Tan See Leng,"MOM takes a firm stance against foreigners who submit false qualifications to fraudulently obtain work passes. Besides revocation of work passes and debarment from employment in Singapore, we may also prosecute offenders for false declaration under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, which carries a fine of up to $20,000 or up to two years’ imprisonment, or both."
2021-08-02-T-010-S-00125,2021-08-02-T-010,125,Deputy Speaker,Mr Gan Thiam Poh.
2021-08-02-T-010-S-00126,2021-08-02-T-010,126,Gan Thiam Poh,I thank the Minister for the comprehensive reply. May I know how fast can MOM expedite to screen all these non-accredited result slips that are submitted? Can MOM also elaborate whether they would review their process to pick up the cases faster?
2021-08-02-T-010-S-00127,2021-08-02-T-010,127,Tan See Leng,"I thank Mr Gan for his supplementary questions. At MOM, we use a predictive fraud model and we stratify the academic institutions according to different levels of risk. For the highest risk, we require the employers to submit, as I have alluded to earlier on, verification proof from a third-party screening organisation as part of the work pass application process. These verification agencies have been pre-assessed by MOM and they are listed on our MOM website. If there is no verification proof that confirms that the diploma and degree qualifications declared are genuine, the application will be rejected."
2021-08-02-T-010-S-00128,2021-08-02-T-010,128,Tan See Leng,"Of course, there are those on a lower-risk and those that are medium-risk. At different categories, we have a different response mechanism. I hope that answers the Member's question."
2021-08-02-T-010-S-00129,2021-08-02-T-010,129,Deputy Speaker,Mr Leon Perera.
2021-08-02-T-010-S-00130,2021-08-02-T-010,130,Leon Perera,"Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I thank the Minister for his answer. Just one point of clarification. When MOM classifies educational institutions by risks, what is the basis for that classification? Is it that certain educational institutions are deemed to be sort of less reputable or less well-accredited and, therefore, they are deemed to be higher-risk and, therefore, third-party verification will be required by the employer? If so, then what is the assurance that lower-risk institutions may not also be subject to fake educational credentials? For example, someone may fake a degree from a well-known or reputable university. So, what is the assurance in those cases? My supplementary question is, really, what is the basis for this risk tiering?"
2021-08-02-T-010-S-00131,2021-08-02-T-010,131,Tan See Leng,"I thank Mr Leon Perera for his question. For accreditation checks, we have maintained a database over the years as we screened the qualifications, whenever employers submit the respective to-be-hired employees' qualifications. Over the years, as we built the database, we have within our system and, also, we compare them with the database from third-party verification agencies that we work closely with. I have also said earlier on that the list of these third-party verification agencies is available on our website. So, through the years, we have built that. We use a combination of data analytics; we screen them. And from that, we then ascertain a risk stratification strategy in which we match all of these applications when they come to us through this database that we have."
2021-08-02-T-010-S-00132,2021-08-02-T-010,132,Tan See Leng,"To the Member's point about those from accredited universities, or even some of them, Ivy League universities, and whether they can fake these degrees, we do have, from time to time, verification, independent checks where we check with the university concerned. Obviously, we do not do this on 100% of all applications submitted, but based on our predictive analytics, when we find that there is reason for us to have suspicion – and we do have a very high index of suspicion – we then activate this other route where we actually call them for independent checks."
2021-08-02-T-011-S-00133,2021-08-02-T-011,133,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how does the Ministry enforce the restrictions on work pass holders carrying on work outside of the designated employer; (b) over the last five years, what is the annual number of cases of work pass holders found to be working for more than one employer at the same time; and (c) what are the penalties for the employer and employee involved."
2021-08-02-T-011-S-00134,2021-08-02-T-011,134,Koh Poh Koon,"Madam, under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act or EFMA, work pass holders are only allowed to work for the official employer specified in their work pass card. It is an offence for the work pass holder to perform work for any other person or business entity."
2021-08-02-T-011-S-00135,2021-08-02-T-011,135,Koh Poh Koon,"MOM receives complaints, tip-offs and referrals from members of public as well as other public agencies on possible illegal employment of work pass holders. Based on the information received, MOM will conduct inspections and look into each and every allegation. At the same time, MOM also carries out proactive inspections based on our own analysis and triggers to detect possible illegal employment of work pass holders."
2021-08-02-T-011-S-00136,2021-08-02-T-011,136,Koh Poh Koon,"Between 2016 and 2020, MOM issued at least a warning to an average of 160 work pass holders each year who were found to have engaged in illegal employment. All of them were debarred from working in Singapore."
2021-08-02-T-011-S-00137,2021-08-02-T-011,137,Koh Poh Koon,"MOM takes a serious view of illegal employment. Work pass holders found to be engaged in illegal employment will face a fine of up to $2,000 or imprisonment of up to two years, or both. [Please refer to ""Clarification by Senior Minister of State for Manpower"", Official Report, 2 August 2021, Vol 95, Issue 35, Oral Answers to Questions section.]"
2021-08-02-T-011-S-00138,2021-08-02-T-011,138,Koh Poh Koon,"MOM will also debar them from working in Singapore. Likewise, employers who employ any foreigners without a valid work pass will face a fine of up to $30,000 or imprisonment of up to 12 months, or both. Their work pass privileges will also be suspended."
2021-08-02-T-011-S-00139,2021-08-02-T-011,139,Deputy Speaker,Mr Louis Chua.
2021-08-02-T-011-S-00140,2021-08-02-T-011,140,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I thank the Senior Minister of State for his answer. Just a quick clarification, in terms of the things that are being done to ensure compliance and to enforce that there is no moonlighting involved, I am just wondering how has the approach that the Ministry has taken evolved over the last five years, in terms of improving its processes to ensure that these cases are being picked up. A lot of them would be part-time in nature without necessarily any documentation involved."
2021-08-02-T-011-S-00141,2021-08-02-T-011,141,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,A very recent example would be the KTV cluster where a number of them would have committed offences under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act.
2021-08-02-T-011-S-00142,2021-08-02-T-011,142,Koh Poh Koon,"Madam, as I said in my main reply, beyond the public tip-offs and complaints by perhaps a competing company, for example, we also conduct our own proactive data analytics to see if there are suspicious behaviour that we ought to take proactive action to verify and check. Beyond that, part of the work also involves educational efforts to make sure that foreign workers working in Singapore understand what constitutes illegal employment or violation of their work permit kind of conditions."
2021-08-02-T-011-S-00143,2021-08-02-T-011,143,Koh Poh Koon,"So, first, when we give an in-principle approval to the work pass applicants prior to their departure for Singapore, that letter states quite clearly that the work pass applicant can only work for the specified employer in that letter. Engagement and education of the migrant workers are done through several other initiatives and platforms. For example, the mobile app, FWMOMCare, where MOM pushes out  employment-related messages through the app. So, it really is to help foreign workers themselves know what is illegal and wrong."
2021-08-02-T-011-S-00144,2021-08-02-T-011,144,Koh Poh Koon,"There is also the mandatory Settling-in Programme for first-time work permit holders, which educates the migrant workers on their responsibilities and employment rights as well as the laws and regulations for working in Singapore."
2021-08-02-T-011-S-00145,2021-08-02-T-011,145,Koh Poh Koon,"Prior to COVID-19, we did conduct a lot of road shows as well, at dormitories, at recreation centres, in public areas, where MOM would engage these work pass holders on their rights and responsibilities."
2021-08-02-T-011-S-00146,2021-08-02-T-011,146,Koh Poh Koon,"Of course, in the present day, we utilise a lot of social media platforms and the online medium to educate and raise awareness. And if we do have enforcement actions being taken, especially against companies who were egregious, we do publicise them on the mainstream media as well as online social media platforms because this raises awareness and serve as a deterrence to other would-be offenders – whether it is employers or employees."
2021-08-02-T-012-S-00147,2021-08-02-T-012,147,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what are the overall measures to assist the vulnerable in the community such as cardboard collectors, beggars, rough sleepers and pedlars; and (b) what are the ways by which the Ministry can better and continually communicate to the public on the help measures available so that longer term sustainable support can be given to these vulnerable."
2021-08-02-T-012-S-00148,2021-08-02-T-012,148,Sun Xueling,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, there are various schemes and initiatives to provide assistance and support to those in need. For those who require financial assistance, they may apply for ComCare assistance or the COVID-19 Recovery Grant (CRG)."
2021-08-02-T-012-S-00149,2021-08-02-T-012,149,Sun Xueling,"To support employees and self-employed individuals who have been financially impacted by the current period of Heightened Alert measures, we have also implemented the CRG-Temporary (CRG-T) scheme to provide temporary financial support. For clients who require employment support, we link them up with Workforce Singapore or the Employment and Employability Institute. For clients with housing or other social issues, we similarly link them up with the relevant agencies accordingly to help resolve their issues."
2021-08-02-T-012-S-00150,2021-08-02-T-012,150,Sun Xueling,"In parallel, MSF continues to work with community partners to reach out to and befriend those who may be more vulnerable in the community. For rough sleepers, there is the Partners Engaging and Empowering Rough Sleepers (PEERS) Network. PEERS Network partners engage rough sleepers and may refer them to overnight community-based shelters, known as Safe Sound Sleeping Places. Rough sleepers who require short-term accommodation and onsite social work intervention to secure stable housing can seek shelter at MSF-funded Transitional Shelters. Social workers at the Transitional Shelters work with individuals to address their various underlying social issues and progress towards stable long-term housing."
2021-08-02-T-012-S-00151,2021-08-02-T-012,151,Sun Xueling,"For tissue sellers and cardboard collectors, befriending groups from the Vulnerable-in-Community (VIC) Network engage them to find out their needs and bring them into the social support system. For example, VIC partners refer individuals needing financial assistance to Social Service Offices (SSOs). If other forms of assistance are required, the SSOs link them up with the relevant help agencies."
2021-08-02-T-012-S-00152,2021-08-02-T-012,152,Sun Xueling,"MSF regularly shares information on the various available schemes and initiatives, including outreach efforts, through various public communication platforms such as the media, MSF website, MSF Facebook and MSFCares, an electronic newsletter which is disseminated to our partners to keep them connected with news and updates from MSF Family. This includes documentary series and videos which showcase various social issues and the support for beneficiaries."
2021-08-02-T-012-S-00153,2021-08-02-T-012,153,Sun Xueling,"One example would be news stories on the efforts by our charity food workgroup to tackle the issue of food insecurity and the coordination of food support for those in need. Another example would be MSF's collaboration with Nanyang Polytechnic students to produce a video featuring PEERS Network partners, such as Yio Chu Kang Chapel and Homeless Hearts of Singapore, who provide rough sleepers safe places to stay and help them navigate challenges."
2021-08-02-T-012-S-00154,2021-08-02-T-012,154,Sun Xueling,"We also work with our partners such as other Government agencies, social service agencies, grassroots organisations and leaders, and our volunteers to raise public awareness of available assistance schemes. We have plans to expand our engagement efforts. We will continue to feature the work of our existing partners to inform as well as inspire those who are interested to join our outreach and befriending efforts. We would also like to encourage members of the public who come across a rough sleeper, cardboard collector or tissue paper seller who is in need to contact the ComCare hotline at 1800-222-0000 or refer them to the nearest SSO for assistance."
2021-08-02-T-012-S-00155,2021-08-02-T-012,155,Deputy Speaker,Ms Denise Phua.
2021-08-02-T-012-S-00156,2021-08-02-T-012,156,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"I would like to thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive answer. I also pledge that organisations and ground partners, like our CDCs, will continue to work to assist the vulnerable in the community."
2021-08-02-T-012-S-00157,2021-08-02-T-012,157,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"A few supplementary questions for the Minister of State. Number one – obviously, there are many good programmes that are supporting existing vulnerable in the community. But looking at the communications channels listed by MSF, many people who want to help or who need help still would not naturally go to that official MSF channel. So, I wonder if the Ministry could invest even more aggressively and effectively in communications to reach those who need help and those who are willing or want to offer to help, whether in print or social media, or TV and channels and so forth. So, that is one, to invest more."
2021-08-02-T-012-S-00158,2021-08-02-T-012,158,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"The second one is to invest more in public education. There are many persons in the community, in the public, who, whatever their intentions are, have the habit of, for example, just taking a photograph or a video, and then posting it on social media, most of the time, without permission. This kind of effort actually does not render sustainable help to the persons in need. So, I think to discourage such habits which are actually not that effective and sometimes, not very respectful of those who need help, I wonder if the Ministry could consider investing even more in aggressive public education in this, so that, more can be helped in a more dignified way."
2021-08-02-T-012-S-00159,2021-08-02-T-012,159,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"My third supplementary question is on the ComCare helpline. I tried to call the ComCare helpline myself. I find that the response is in English and by a machine to re-direct perhaps due to the need to triage the needs. I wonder if there is another more effective way of looking into beyond the ComCare line, to ensure that it is more effective. Perhaps looking at different ways of doing it, for instance, setting up call centres that are actually answered by real persons and not by a machine."
2021-08-02-T-012-S-00160,2021-08-02-T-012,160,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"So, all the above for the Ministry's consideration."
2021-08-02-T-012-S-00161,2021-08-02-T-012,161,Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for her supplementary questions. I agree that, where necessary and where possible, MSF would invest more in communications to ensure that the vulnerable in our community know where and how they can get help. I had earlier spent some time talking about befriending and MSF is very grateful to our various partners such as Central CDC and other befrienders who have worked with us. Because we know that many of the vulnerable may not have a fixed abode, they may be moving from point to point. And like what the Member mentioned, they may not automatically just walk into an SSO to seek help."
2021-08-02-T-012-S-00162,2021-08-02-T-012,162,Sun Xueling,"That is why we rely on our network of partners in the community to reach out to them, so that they see a physical face, trust is built, relationships are built. And in so doing, some of these vulnerables may be more open to sharing about their underlying problems. Only then, can we really address the root issues that led them to the current situation."
2021-08-02-T-012-S-00163,2021-08-02-T-012,163,Sun Xueling,"The second point that the Member raised about public education, indeed, is a very important point. I know that there are members of the public who feel that they may be helping the vulnerable by taking a photo, putting up a video. But I would urge that members of the public to be cautious when doing so. The most appropriate and effective way really is to introduce, to direct these vulnerable persons to our SSO officer so that professional help is given to the vulnerable persons. Because when you put up a video or a photo, apart from the fact that you might be infringing on the privacy as well as confidentiality of the vulnerable person, sometimes you may be bringing unwanted attention to the vulnerable person which may or may not lead to better outcomes for the person. It might also worsen family relationships which sometimes are the underlying reasons why the vulnerable person is doing what he or she is doing."
2021-08-02-T-012-S-00164,2021-08-02-T-012,164,Sun Xueling,"On the third point that the Member raised, which is on the ComCare hotline, I will bring it back to MSF to discuss with them. At the end of the day, I would like to assure the Member that if there are vulnerable persons and individuals who need to communicate their issues in the vernacular language, we will make sure that we have an MSF SSO officer who is able to do so and to extend the help that is necessary to him or her."
2021-08-02-T-013-S-00165,2021-08-02-T-013,165,He Ting Ru,"asked Minister for Education (a) given the shift back to Phase Two (Heightened Alert), what is the assessed risk level for children under the age of 12 who are unable to be vaccinated; and (b) what are the considerations when deciding the further steps that need to be taken, particularly in indoor educational settings, to ensure the safety of these children and their families, whether now or in the future when moving into COVID-19 as an endemic disease."
2021-08-02-T-013-S-00166,2021-08-02-T-013,166,Chan Chun Sing,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, unvaccinated persons, generally, are at higher risk of COVID-19 infection compared to vaccinated persons of the same age groups. For children, international experience and data on COVID-19 infections have thus far shown that the disease outcome is much less severe as compared to older adults and the elderly. In Singapore, we have so far observed mild disease in local cases aged under 12 years, even with the Delta variant. We are also fortunate thus far that for our children under 12 years who have been infected, none of them has required ICU care nor oxygen supplementation."
2021-08-02-T-013-S-00167,2021-08-02-T-013,167,Chan Chun Sing,"To keep our children safe in the school environment, we implement stringent safe management and surveillance measures, and have adjusted the conduct of school activities where necessary. All staff in schools and preschools are required to wear masks. Students in school are also required to wear masks, while in preschools, either masks or face shields are strongly encouraged for children above the age of two. For mask-off activities in schools, extra safe management measures are taken. For example, physical education classes are conducted outdoors or in well-ventilated venues and in small groups based on national guidelines. Mask-off activities are currently suspended in preschools. Preschools and schools also emphasise good personal hygiene and social responsibility. Staff in preschools and schools are also prioritised for vaccination. These measures collectively mitigate the risks of infection in our students."
2021-08-02-T-013-S-00168,2021-08-02-T-013,168,Chan Chun Sing,"The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination or EC19V as we call it, is monitoring on-going vaccination trials for children under the age of 12. The EC19V will assess if it is suitable to administer these vaccines to children under the age of 12 and make recommendations to MOH at the appropriate time."
2021-08-02-T-013-S-00169,2021-08-02-T-013,169,Chan Chun Sing,"Ultimately, managing COVID-19, whether nationally or in our school setting, is about managing risks and balancing trade-offs. Over time, we have developed a better understanding of the virus and how to live with it in our daily lives. As we move towards a new normal of COVID-19 as an endemic disease, we are making a conscious move to adopt an appropriate risk management strategy and collectively determine what level of risk is acceptable to us as a society."
2021-08-02-T-013-S-00170,2021-08-02-T-013,170,Chan Chun Sing,"The past few months have given us more confidence that we can strike a better balance by taking a more targeted approach to ring-fence cases and their close contacts. For example, by only having affected classes, levels or schools on Home-Based Learning (HBL), rather than resorting to full HBL for everyone on a nationwide scale. This has allowed us to isolate affected students and staff, and not close all Primary schools, where most students are not yet eligible for vaccination."
2021-08-02-T-013-S-00171,2021-08-02-T-013,171,Chan Chun Sing,"The alternative of full HBL on a prolonged basis comes at the cost of the learning and especially the social-emotional development of our young. And it takes a toll on the mental wellness, places additional stresses on educators, parents and students, especially when not all students have home environments that are conducive for HBL. The negative impact also falls disproportionally on lower-income families."
2021-08-02-T-013-S-00172,2021-08-02-T-013,172,Chan Chun Sing,"We will continue to finetune how we manage school cases and ensure its sustainability as we transit towards living with COVID-19 as an endemic disease. Taking reference from the national posture and working closely with parents, we will continue to work hard to keep our schools and students safe."
2021-08-02-T-013-S-00173,2021-08-02-T-013,173,Deputy Speaker,Ms He Ting Ru.
2021-08-02-T-013-S-00174,2021-08-02-T-013,174,He Ting Ru,"I thank the Minister for his response. The reason I asked this question is because a lot of parents have come to me and said they are worried about the health and safety of their children, especially those under the age of 12, who are unable to get vaccinated at the moment. I just wanted to ask what efforts are being made to address these concerns, as in efforts to address  these parents directly? Because, obviously, a lot of them are very worried, a lot of them are writing to me and writing to all of us here. They want to know how about those parents, for example, with children who have pre-existing medical conditions that make these children more vulnerable, if they do actually get COVID-19. Are these children expected to isolate or stay at home? What are the actual effects this will actually have on these children? These are some of the questions that parents have come up to me with and I would just like some clarifications from the Minister about this."
2021-08-02-T-013-S-00175,2021-08-02-T-013,175,He Ting Ru,"Earlier, the Minister also said that the task force is studying the safety of vaccinations on children under the age of 12. Do we have any estimates of when we expect to see results because the Minister mentioned that more announcements and decisions will be made at the appropriate time? Do we have an estimate of when this is expected to be available?"
2021-08-02-T-013-S-00176,2021-08-02-T-013,176,He Ting Ru,"Lastly, I just wanted to ask, especially at the preschools and maybe even infant care levels, as many parents with young children will know, it is actually very difficult for these children to keep their masks on and adhere to hygiene and safe distancing measures. What sort of extra steps and precautions are taken to make sure that these children and by definition, their family members, especially vulnerable family members at home are also protected?"
2021-08-02-T-013-S-00177,2021-08-02-T-013,177,Chan Chun Sing,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, there are three questions. Let me deal with the second one first and that is, when can we expect EC19V to make an announcement. That very much will depend on the work that they are doing and also from the work that the manufacturers of the vaccines are doing now, worldwide. So, at this point in time, I am unable to give a timeline as to when this work will be completed. But as far as we know, the work has started to trial this, to see if it is appropriate for children below the age of 12."
2021-08-02-T-013-S-00178,2021-08-02-T-013,178,Chan Chun Sing,"Let me deal with the first question. Like Ms He Ting Ru, I think all of us, as parents, are, of course, concerned with the safety of our children under the age of 12 who are unable to be vaccinated yet. And we also know that we are unlikely to have a vaccine for those under 12 years old, anytime soon. Having said that, what we need to do is to make sure that we put in place the safe management measures for our children to live their life as normally as possible so that they can continue to grow up and continue learning as much as possible. We need to do this in a sustainable way; and I want to emphasise this  ""sustainable way"". We do not know how long this disease will continue to ravage the world. We do not know when the vaccine will come. Bearing this in mind, we need sustainable solutions in order to allow our children, especially those below the age of 12, to continue learning and growing in as normal an environment as possible."
2021-08-02-T-013-S-00179,2021-08-02-T-013,179,Chan Chun Sing,"As I have mentioned in my speech, what are some of the things that we can do? One, we want to make sure that we observe all the safe management measures that we can practise  personal hygiene, cohorting of the classes to minimise the chances of our younger children getting it."
2021-08-02-T-013-S-00180,2021-08-02-T-013,180,Chan Chun Sing,"And I think, to this extent, the adults also have a role to play, which is why we encourage everyone to try to get vaccinated as soon as possible."
2021-08-02-T-013-S-00181,2021-08-02-T-013,181,Chan Chun Sing,"Having said that, it does not mean that those people who are vaccinated are no longer going to transmit or be carriers of the virus. But what it does mean is that the chances are reduced and the symptoms are much less. That is also one way to keep our younger children safe."
2021-08-02-T-013-S-00182,2021-08-02-T-013,182,Chan Chun Sing,"Beyond that preventive step, we are looking at the next step which we have also done  to make sure that we organise our activities in such a way that can allow our children to interact, learn in a group, but not having too many of them mixing around and just in case anything happens, which means that we have tight cohorting in the schools, preschools, to minimise the chances of this happening."
2021-08-02-T-013-S-00183,2021-08-02-T-013,183,Chan Chun Sing,"The next ring that we must implement is that upon the detection of any of the cases, quickly ring-fence the affected parties so that we can minimise the chances of this spreading to the rest. This is where parents can also play a part to work with the schools and the preschools to keep our children safe. If, for whatever reasons, a member of the family is ill, please do not send the children to school until we have verified that the children or the family will not pose a risk to the other students in the school. So, I think, collectively, we can also do that."
2021-08-02-T-013-S-00184,2021-08-02-T-013,184,Chan Chun Sing,"Going forward, if and when the day comes whereby we have other testing capabilities that are less intrusive, that we can conduct on a mass scale, that will give us yet another tool for us to see how we can safely have more activities by testing more people more regularly, including perhaps the younger ones. But at this point in time, we do not yet have that less intrusive testing capability for the younger ones. So, we have to continue to work together to make sure that we keep our children and our schools safe."
2021-08-02-T-013-S-00185,2021-08-02-T-013,185,Chan Chun Sing,"But coming back to that, I would like to appeal to everyone that we need to make this work on a sustainable basis. And that is why we need to work together. We can do certain things in the short term, we can scale up certain measures but the question is how do we make such measures sustainable, bearing in mind the interests of the children, the families and also the educators, which was what I had explained to the public last Friday."
2021-08-02-T-013-S-00186,2021-08-02-T-013,186,Chan Chun Sing,"The last question Ms He Ting Ru asked about was infant care and the preschool. Indeed, we all understand it is harder for the children of the younger ages to keep their masks on and it will take extra effort for us to make sure that we apply the safe management measures, keeping their personal hygiene good and, at the same time, cohorting them to minimise the chances of transmission, in case something should happen, in case one of them should be infected with this."
2021-08-02-T-013-S-00187,2021-08-02-T-013,187,Chan Chun Sing,"Having said that, it is very important for everyone again to work together so that a child who is sick or a child who is from a family who has someone ill and not verified yet, to avoid sending the child to the school or the preschool so that we minimise the chances of this spreading to other people. And we would need everybody's cooperation to make this happen."
2021-08-02-T-014-S-00188,2021-08-02-T-014,188,Deputy Speaker,"Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon, you have a clarification?"
2021-08-02-T-014-S-00189,2021-08-02-T-014,189,Koh Poh Koon,"Thank you, Madam, I just want to clarify on the answer I had given to  Question No 12. I had misspoken about the fine. For work pass holders found to be engaged in illegal employment, they will face a fine of $20,000 or imprisonment of up to two years, or both; not $2,000. ["
2021-08-02-T-015-S-00190,2021-08-02-T-015,190,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) for workers who are transported in lorries, what are the measures recommended by the Ministry that employers can adopt to ensure that workers remain dry if it rains during the journey; and (b) if there are no guidelines, whether the Ministry is considering implementing such guidelines."
2021-08-02-T-015-S-00191,2021-08-02-T-015,191,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Since 2011, lorries used to ferry any persons in their rear decks are required to be fitted with canopies. These provide shelter, including against inclement weather. Failure to do so is an offence under the Road Traffic Act. First-time offenders will face a fine of up to $1,000, an imprisonment term of up to three months, or both. These penalties are doubled for repeat offenders."
2021-08-02-T-015-S-00192,2021-08-02-T-015,192,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We take such offences seriously and have been actively enforcing against offenders. For the first half of 2021, we caught 23 offenders with lorries ferrying workers without canopies, or without having a sufficiently large canopy to shelter all workers. We will not hesitate to take stern action against the offenders. Members of the public can call LTA's hotline to report any non-compliance with these regulations."
2021-08-02-T-015-S-00193,2021-08-02-T-015,193,Amy Khor Lean Suan,"That said, we strongly encourage all employers to do their part to ensure the welfare of their workers. In the event of severe weather, we recognise that the canopy alone may not confer sufficient protection from the elements. We certainly do encourage employers to take the initiative to install rain covers. These are typically waterproof canvas tarps that are installed on the sides of the rear deck, to complement canopies which serve primarily as a roof shelter. Where possible, employers should also consider putting on hold such trips until the heavy rain has passed."

2021-08-02-T-018-S-00201,2021-08-02-T-018,201,Sun Xueling,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, on behalf of the Minister for Social and Family Development, I beg to move, ""That the Bill be now read a Second time""."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00202,2021-08-02-T-018,202,Sun Xueling,"Madam, families are the foundation of our society. They are the first environment in which children are nurtured and where they experience love and where values are inculcated. Every parent knows that parenthood has its challenges; yet, every parent also knows the joys it brings. The Government is consistent in its approach to supporting couples and, as couples embark on their parenting journey, we are here to support them and their family."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00203,2021-08-02-T-018,203,Sun Xueling,"We have consistently reviewed our policies over the years to strengthen family ties, particularly between parent and child. We have made considerable strides. But we recognise that family formation is a personal decision. Our measures can only go so far as to address practical obstacles or financial concerns that many parents worry about. An overall eco-system, which includes family members, community partners, employers and Government measures, is needed to support parents on their journey."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00204,2021-08-02-T-018,204,Sun Xueling,"We remain committed to encouraging people to get married, have children and to raise them in strong families. The Child Development Co-Savings Act (CDCA) was first introduced in 2001. It has been 20 years. Over the years, we have increased coverage and introduced new schemes under the CDCA as part of a holistic suite of measures that families can tap on. The CDCA now covers the Child Development Account (CDA) and parental leave schemes, with respect to citizen children. Many today will know the CDA as part of the commonly known Baby Bonus scheme."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00205,2021-08-02-T-018,205,Sun Xueling,"In 2008, the CDCA was amended to extend maternity leave from 12 weeks to 16 weeks, childcare leave from two to six days and to introduce six days of unpaid infant care leave. In 2013, one week of shared parental leave and paternity leave were introduced. We kept in mind that the economy could evolve and support could be extended to a wider group of parents, including those not on regular employment. Hence, the Government-Paid Maternity Benefits scheme was introduced for mothers who were either employed or self-employed, but not for the minimum continuous three-month period to qualify for maternity leave. These mothers could be on short-term contracts, or on contracts which expired just before they gave birth. In 2017, we also made it mandatory for employers to grant two weeks of Paternity Leave and increased Shared Parental Leave from one week to up to four weeks."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00206,2021-08-02-T-018,206,Sun Xueling,"As a whole, working couples today can take up to 20 weeks of paid parental leave in the child's first year, comprising 16 weeks of maternity leave, two weeks of paternity leave and six days of childcare leave per parent. This is the result of continuous policy reviews over the years."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00207,2021-08-02-T-018,207,Sun Xueling,"We have also made enhancements on other fronts. The maximum dollar-for-dollar Government co-matching of parents' savings in the CDA for the second child born from 1 January 2021 was doubled earlier this year, from $3,000 to $6,000. This is in addition to the CDA First Step Grant of $3,000 introduced in 2016 that is paid into the CDA when it is opened, without parents having to contribute first. To reassure couples to proceed with their parenthood plans despite the global pandemic, the Government also implemented the one-off Baby Support Grant of $3,000 for Singaporean children born from 1 October 2020 to 30 September 2022."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00208,2021-08-02-T-018,208,Sun Xueling,"The environment that Singaporeans work, live and raise families in, has evolved. MSF has proposed amendments to the CDCA to bolster our support for citizen children and their working parents, as well as employers, in this changing environment. We continue to encourage parenthood within marriage and our proposed amendments also ensure that our operational processes are robust and that there is accountability over public monies even as additional benefits are included and extended."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00209,2021-08-02-T-018,209,Sun Xueling,"I now draw the House's attention to the key components in the Child Development Co-Savings (Amendment) Bill, of which there are seven."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00210,2021-08-02-T-018,210,Sun Xueling,"One, Government-Paid Paternity and Adoption Benefits. As announced in February this year, we will be introducing two new schemes. Some working fathers and adoptive mothers may not qualify for paternity leave or adoption leave under the CDCA respectively owing to their employment arrangements. They may be on multiple short-term contracts, or had their contracts expire shortly before the birth or adoption of their child. Clauses 13 and 26, therefore, legislate the new Government-Paid Paternity Benefit and Government-Paid Adoption Benefit schemes, or GPPB and GPAB respectively, under which such parents can qualify. The new schemes are not unprecedented. Already, working mothers can be eligible for the existing Government-Paid Maternity Benefits scheme, or GPMB in short, and we are extending this to working fathers and adoptive mothers."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00211,2021-08-02-T-018,211,Sun Xueling,"A father can be eligible for GPPB if his child's date of birth or estimated date of delivery is on or after 1 January 2021. Adoptive parents can benefit from GPPB and GPAB if their application to adopt a child is submitted to the Court on or after 1 January 2021. In the case of a foreign child, we will refer to the date on which the dependant's pass is issued."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00212,2021-08-02-T-018,212,Sun Xueling,"With the new schemes, parents can receive a cash benefit in lieu of the Government-paid portion of paternity leave or adoption leave. The parent must have worked as an employee or self-employed person, or both, for at least 90 days in the 12 months immediately preceding the child's date of birth or the eligibility date for an adopted child. The total cash pay-out will be calculated based on the average income earned in the same 12-month period, as prescribed in subsidiary legislation. Therefore, parents who work for longer periods will receive a higher benefit."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00213,2021-08-02-T-018,213,Sun Xueling,"As further amendments need to be made to subsidiary legislation, eligible parents may apply for the new GPPB and GPAB schemes from 1 December 2021. We estimate that around 500 working fathers and adoptive mothers will benefit. Though this number is small, it remains important to ensure that these parents are supported in raising their children."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00214,2021-08-02-T-018,214,Sun Xueling,"Two, assisting parents whose contracts expire, or who are retrenched. Even as we introduce the new GPPB and GPAB schemes, they are not intended to replace the existing schemes for paternity leave and adoption leave respectively. Generally, these schemes are mutually exclusive and parents will not be able to qualify for both leave and benefit schemes simultaneously. The majority of parents will qualify under the relevant leave schemes as they remain employed."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00215,2021-08-02-T-018,215,Sun Xueling,"However, there is one existing exception. The CDCA allows for a GPMB top-up to be given to a mother whose contract expires while she is on maternity leave. An eligible mother may have started her maternity leave, but could not consume all of it before her contract expired due to the lack of time. Such mothers can receive cash benefits for the remaining Government-paid portion of the leave, which the Government would have reimbursed their employers had the leave not been forfeited."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00216,2021-08-02-T-018,216,Sun Xueling,"With the new GPAB and GPPB schemes, we will extend this to working fathers and adoptive mothers in similar situations. They, too, will be eligible for a benefits top-up."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00217,2021-08-02-T-018,217,Sun Xueling,"My Ministry has also proposed to introduce an additional exception, to assist working parents. We know that some parents may be retrenched, and have to give up their remaining leave. Clauses 8(m), 13 and 26 will address this, by granting a benefit top-up to retrenched parents who did not manage to take their leave. This leave would also have been otherwise forfeited. This will help provide greater assurances to parents, as we know that retrenchments are beyond their control."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00218,2021-08-02-T-018,218,Sun Xueling,"Let me be clear that these top-ups will not affect existing protections for female employees who are pregnant, as they should not be denied their maternity leave benefits by the termination of their employment. These protections are provided for under the Employment Act."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00219,2021-08-02-T-018,219,Sun Xueling,"Employers will have to pay maternity leave benefits to pregnant employees who have worked for their employers for at least three months, if their employment is terminated without sufficient cause, or if they are retrenched at any stage of their pregnancy. It is an offence to dismiss employees while they are on maternity leave. It is also an offence for employers to withhold parental leave from working parents."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00220,2021-08-02-T-018,220,Sun Xueling,"Three, supporting parents of stillborn children. The proposed Bill will allow working parents of a stillborn child, who would have been a Singapore Citizen, to qualify for birth-linked Government-Paid Leave and Benefits Schemes – which are maternity leave and benefits, paternity leave and benefits, as well as shared parental leave."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00221,2021-08-02-T-018,221,Sun Xueling,"We appreciate that many employers have been voluntarily granting paid leave to such parents as employers play a key role in fostering family-friendly workplaces in Singapore. Generally, we have supported this by granting reimbursement to them. The Bill will now entitle parents of stillborn children to the relevant schemes. Parents of stillborn children need to recover physically and emotionally and this move can help them in these difficult times."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00222,2021-08-02-T-018,222,Sun Xueling,"The Government-paid portion of certain schemes also vary with the number of live citizen children a mother has; these are the maternity and adoption leave and benefit schemes. For instance, mothers with one or two children who are eligible for maternity leave receive eight weeks of employer-paid leave and eight weeks of Government-paid leave. From the third child, all 16 weeks of maternity leave under the CDCA are paid for by the Government."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00223,2021-08-02-T-018,223,Sun Xueling,"In addition to the above entitlement to leave and benefits, clause 2(1)(h) will count stillborn children or deceased children in determining the number of children a mother has had. Depending on whether they are entitled to leave or benefits schemes, including them in the child order determination will allow more employers and working mothers to receive a higher quantum of reimbursement or payment. We hope that this will go some way to help mothers and also encourage employers to be more supportive of working mothers with more children."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00224,2021-08-02-T-018,224,Sun Xueling,"Four, reimbursement to employers who voluntarily grant leave to employees for parental leave schemes. Employers are one of our main partners in developing a Singapore that is Made for Families. The support from employers is crucial, especially when their employees take on new roles as parents."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00225,2021-08-02-T-018,225,Sun Xueling,"I am heartened to say that many employers have gone the extra mile and allowed employees to benefit from the parental leave schemes, even if the employees have not worked the minimum of three months continuously preceding the birth or adoption of their child to qualify for leave, which is one of the eligibility criteria under CDCA."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00226,2021-08-02-T-018,226,Sun Xueling,"We recognise that progressive employers play an important part in helping working parents who are also new to their companies. To this end, clauses 10(b), 17(b) and 28(b) give the Government the discretion to reimburse employers if they grant paid maternity leave, paternity leave and adoption leave, respectively, even though the three-month criterion under CDCA is not satisfied. The parent must still meet all other eligibility criteria mentioned in the Bill, such as having a child who is a Singapore Citizen."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00227,2021-08-02-T-018,227,Sun Xueling,"I must emphasise that there is no change to a parent’s entitlement. Legislatively, the minimum work criterion is there as a safeguard for employers who also bear some costs. Nonetheless, some employers provide leave for employees out of goodwill and can continue to do so of their own volition. The amendments are only intended to give my Ministry more latitude to reimburse these progressive employers."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00228,2021-08-02-T-018,228,Sun Xueling,"Five, disqualify wed/unwed fathers from paid childcare leave and unpaid infant care leave, in respect of children born from extramarital affairs."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00229,2021-08-02-T-018,229,Sun Xueling,"Over the years, significant steps have been taken to ensure that every child is cared for and supported in his or her development. The CDCA was last amended to extend maternity leave and the CDA, including the CDA First Step Grant and matched co-savings from the Government, to single unwed parents in 2017 and 2016 respectively. Earlier in 2013, we had also extended paid childcare leave and unpaid infant care leave under CDCA to support parents in their caregiving responsibilities. Our approach is to enable all Singaporean children and their parents to receive Government benefits that are intended to support the children’s growth and development. Nonetheless, the desired social norm in Singapore remains parenthood within marriage. These have been our policy considerations."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00230,2021-08-02-T-018,230,Sun Xueling,"However, we have found that parents could also consume childcare leave and unpaid infant care leave with respect to children born as a result of extramarital affairs. This was not the policy intent. Our marriage and parenthood policies are intended to safeguard the family institution and not to condone extramarital affairs."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00231,2021-08-02-T-018,231,Sun Xueling,"With the above in mind, the amendments laid out in clauses 18(c) and (f) and 21(b) disqualify wed and unwed fathers from paid childcare leave and unpaid infant care leave under CDCA with respect to children born from extramarital affairs. Gestational mothers will retain their entitlement to paid childcare leave and unpaid infant care leave to avoid unduly compromising a child’s well-being, given that mothers are, usually, the main caregivers. If the birth parents subsequently marry, the father will become eligible for childcare leave in respect of the child. All other single unwed fathers whose children are not born out of extramarital affairs continue to be eligible for paid childcare leave and unpaid infant care leave."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00232,2021-08-02-T-018,232,Sun Xueling,"Six, disqualify mothers who have consumed maternity leave under the Employment Act (EA) from GPMB. I mentioned earlier that parents will not be able to qualify for both leave and benefit schemes simultaneously, with certain exceptions. Clause 8(l) will ensure that this treatment is equally applied to both mothers of children who are citizens from birth and those who are new citizens."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00233,2021-08-02-T-018,233,Sun Xueling,"To elaborate, mothers of non-citizen children can qualify for maternity leave under the Employment Act. Should the child subsequently gain citizenship within one year of the child’s birth, a mother could then qualify for GPMB under CDCA, if she meets the eligibility criteria. In contrast, a mother of a citizen child would not be able to receive both paid leave and benefits simultaneously under CDCA, except in certain cases, as earlier mentioned."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00234,2021-08-02-T-018,234,Sun Xueling,"The proposed amendment will ensure parity between different groups of working mothers, such that those in similar circumstances benefit equally from the maternity leave and benefits provisions under CDCA."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00235,2021-08-02-T-018,235,Sun Xueling,"Seven, amendments to improve checks and accountability. Finally, the Bill proposes amendments at clause 32 to improve checks and ensure public accountability. First, the amendments will give my Ministry power to carry out audits, or require audits to be conducted."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00236,2021-08-02-T-018,236,Sun Xueling,"Second, we will expand our powers to recover erroneous payments through clauses 6 and 30. Our powers to clawback are, currently, limited to payments made by mistake of fact, or due to false or misleading information or documents furnished. The amendment will allow the Government to also recover payments that were made due to any error; and this could include, for example, errors caused by an electronic system used by the Government to determine claims or made by any person. The Government will also be able to deduct the amount from subsequent claims with respect to the same parent."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00237,2021-08-02-T-018,237,Sun Xueling,"For CDA benefits, the Government may deduct or set off the amount to be recovered from future Baby Bonus benefits payable to the relevant child. We will also be able to recover directly from persons who caused the erroneous payments and clawback from CDA trustees or approved persons in the event of unauthorised withdrawals from the CDA."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00238,2021-08-02-T-018,238,Sun Xueling,"Just as benefits have been progressively expanded over the years, checks and balances must also correspondingly be updated. These amendments ensure that we continue to exercise rigorous oversight over the various schemes provided for under CDCA and bolster accountability over how public monies are utilised."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00239,2021-08-02-T-018,239,Sun Xueling,"Madam, our intent is for the proposed amendments to further support a Singaporean couple’s decision to start, raise and grow their family. We are committed to this cause and have worked to ensure that our policies keep pace with and reflect our desired values. We want to ensure that parents are supported in their journey."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00240,2021-08-02-T-018,240,Sun Xueling,"Nonetheless, the Government cannot be alone in doing so. Legislation is an insufficient and blunt tool for policies to support parents in child-raising, as families have differing needs. Equally important are employers, who can create conducive environments for employees to work and have their families. We are glad to see many have implemented family-friendly practices and I urge others to follow their lead. In addition, the extended family and the community can also pitch in to support families, especially when they are bringing up young children."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00241,2021-08-02-T-018,241,Sun Xueling,"My Ministry will continue to work with our community partners, such as the Families for Life (FFL) movement so that strong family relations can be fostered. A whole-of-society effort is required, and we will continue to support Singaporeans in this journey. Mdm Deputy Speaker, I beg to move."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00242,2021-08-02-T-018,242,Sun Xueling,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00243,2021-08-02-T-018,243,Deputy Speaker,Mr Saktiandi Supaat.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00244,2021-08-02-T-018,244,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill. The proposed amendments are, indeed, helpful in filling the gaps, especially in the current business environment where job losses and business uncertainty are commonplace. Today, I will speak about my thoughts on benefits for retrenched parents, support for parents of stillborn children, followed by support for pro-family employers. Mdm Deputy Speaker, in Malay, please."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00245,2021-08-02-T-018,245,Saktiandi Supaat,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Firstly, I would like to state that I empathise with parents who have babies or young children while struggling with loss of income and uncertainty due to retrenchment. I have encountered several cases among my residents who are parents and not long after having their child, lose their jobs; and the family has to scramble to seek financial support. Such situations are daunting because families would not have expected this unfortunate loss of employment to happen. This is especially difficult for mothers, who will experience a lot of anxiety as well as social and emotional trauma due to concerns, such as how they will be able to provide food or milk to their newborn babies."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00246,2021-08-02-T-018,246,Saktiandi Supaat,"Even if they are able to find short-term contract jobs, there is a lot of uncertainty in the current market whereby some of them quickly find themselves out of a job after a few weeks or even after a few days. There are many business owners and self-employed persons who are also experiencing problems. They may find their incomes cut drastically or they may fall into debt and have to close their businesses for an indefinite period. In such situations, many families are not entitled to normal leave benefits that comes with a conventional permanent employment contract. So, it will be good if the Government can make exceptions to help them."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00247,2021-08-02-T-018,247,Saktiandi Supaat,"It is timely to introduce the Government-Paid Paternity Benefit (GPPB) and the Government Paid Adoption Benefit (GPAB) schemes for working fathers and adoptive mothers who are on short-term employment contracts or whose employment contract had expired before their child was born or adopted. The enhancement of benefits for fathers is, certainly, the right move to improve gender equality. And adopting children, especially in this challenging climate, is a virtuous act that should receive support."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00248,2021-08-02-T-018,248,Saktiandi Supaat,"I note that eligible parents can only apply from December 2021. So, I would like to ask if this can be brought forward. First, this will provide some relief to parents who are feeling anxious and, secondly, this will lower the possibility of confusion amongst parents who take the effort to apply and then realise that it is not yet open for application."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00249,2021-08-02-T-018,249,Saktiandi Supaat,"(In English)  The Bill proposes to grant Government-Paid Maternity Benefit (GPMB), GPPB or GPAB top-ups for parents who have been retrenched but have unconsumed parental leave. Can the Minister elaborate what is the process for affected parents? What kind of documents and evidence will they have to provide, if any? I think the Minister of State provided some details earlier, but further details might be useful, especially for the man in the street."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00250,2021-08-02-T-018,250,Saktiandi Supaat,"What happens if the company they work for is winding up? How do the claimants secure the relevant HR records? So, these are specific details that I am asking for."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00251,2021-08-02-T-018,251,Saktiandi Supaat,"It is a common problem that when the office is in somewhat of a mess, it will be challenging to retrieve records. If the company is unable or unwilling to provide the required information, even going as far as to cut off contact, what can the affected parties do to be eligible for their entitled grants?"
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00252,2021-08-02-T-018,252,Saktiandi Supaat,"On behalf of my residents, I would also like to clarify what is the definition of self-employed in the Bill. I think that gig workers and freelancers like delivery riders should fall under this category. However, a number of residents are telling me that they are quite doubtful, because they do not have employment contracts. A number of them have only started working as delivery riders this year as a last resort, so, they have not filed their income tax returns either. This group, generally, also tends to be the hardest hit, because their earnings are directly dependent on the number of hours worked. If they take a break to tend to childcare needs and if a COVID-19 situation closes down a specific childcare, then they miss all the earnings for that timeframe. Can the Minister share if they get any entitlements? And what is their recourse if they do not?"
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00253,2021-08-02-T-018,253,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, welcoming a newborn should also be a happy occasion for all. But many after-birth healthcare expenses for both mother and child require money. Not only that, but the costs for transport to and from the clinics and hospitals as well as special nutrition for mum and baby all add up. When families are in a stressful situation, the mother, and, sometimes, even the father, too, are prone to post-natal depression, which presents another set of challenges. So, it is important to keep the processes to receive financial grants and aid simplified without compromising governance, so that the applicant would not be put to more stress having to answer a whole gamut of questions. Even the need to get a Notary Public to sign off a document can be a challenge as it means having to find their office, travel to and from the lawyer’s office, showing the original documents for inspection and, finally, paying for the fees."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00254,2021-08-02-T-018,254,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, on this subject of mental health, I am glad to know that the amendment to the Bill extends support to parents with stillborn children. It is indeed very thoughtful that we are extending the birth-linked leave and benefits to these parents as they work towards recovering physically and emotionally."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00255,2021-08-02-T-018,255,Saktiandi Supaat,"I hope the Ministry would also consider subsidising a quantum of any counselling services that the parents may need to undergo to overcome their distress. This would also, hopefully, go some ways towards normalising the need to seek help for one’s mental health. These are very challenging times and many have already found their mental health to be affected by the pandemic which has lasted more than a year. To experience the death of a loved one on top of all these problems is nothing short of devastating."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00256,2021-08-02-T-018,256,Saktiandi Supaat,A group of people that we really need empathy from is employers. Pro-family employers are crucial in shaping a nation and culture that are sensitive and encouraging to the needs of parents.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00257,2021-08-02-T-018,257,Saktiandi Supaat,"Over the years, the Government has ramped up its policies and expanded the pool of parents who are eligible for paid parental leave. With the amendment to this Bill, employers who voluntarily grant leave to their employees who have not met the minimum three-month employment criterion for the various parental leave schemes will also be reimbursed. Employers who do their part to support nation-building and child-rearing must continue to be lauded."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00258,2021-08-02-T-018,258,Saktiandi Supaat,"However, there are some employers and recruiters who still believe that high productivity is only possible when work is not disrupted. They want to hire the employee who takes as little leave as possible. Last month, my colleagues and I moved our Adjournment Motion on workplace discrimination. My colleague Mr Louis Ng spoke about how some women were passed over for job opportunities simply because they were mothers."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00259,2021-08-02-T-018,259,Saktiandi Supaat,"The Government can offer any amount of leave benefits. We can even try to emulate Sweden and give parents an entitlement of 480 days of paid parental leave once a child is born or adopted. But all this means little if employers are passing over parents, especially mothers, for job and promotion opportunities to begin with. Under normal circumstances, when the economy is prosperous and the labour market is tight, it is easy to say that employers with poor employee welfare policies will find themselves penalised with greater difficulty to hire and retain talent. Unfortunately, more people are seeking employment than before. I am concerned that improving employees’ welfare may take a backseat for some employers, although this really should not be the case."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00260,2021-08-02-T-018,260,Saktiandi Supaat,"I hope the Government can do more to reward companies that are genuinely pro-family. The Government already offers leave benefits and reimbursements, as well as grants to cultivate family-friendly workplace polices. We all know there are many long-term benefits when companies have engaged and happy workers. Unfortunately, many are more interested in quick fixes, especially with the current pandemic. So, even if they are essentially funded to redesign their company policies, they may feel the effort is not worthwhile."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00261,2021-08-02-T-018,261,Saktiandi Supaat,"Can the Government, perhaps, look into dangling more carrots, including more grants and loans, where pro-family employers can benefit in other areas? This could be similar to how the Government provides higher subsidies for hiring of mature workers. And, likewise, it would be a temporary move, so, when the economy improves and the employer is able to see for themselves that the effort of implementing family-friendly policies pays off in the long run, they would have an existing system in place and will be inclined to continue with it even without external rewards."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00262,2021-08-02-T-018,262,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, COVID-19 has caused many Singaporeans to postpone or even cancel their plans to have children. For those who go ahead to have children, the poor economy has made parenthood a greater struggle, on top of other social distancing measures that have greatly disrupted play time and the social lives of our young ones. It is prudent to have support measures so that our current generation of little ones may at least have a happy and healthy early childhood. Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00263,2021-08-02-T-018,263,Deputy Speaker,Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00264,2021-08-02-T-018,264,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I more than welcome the proposed amendments to the Child Development Co-Savings Act (CDCA). Many of the proposed changes extend support to those who are either enduring an incalculable loss or taking on an enormous responsibility, as they undertake sacrifices to secure the next generation. As a society, we should absolutely help them in any way we can."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00265,2021-08-02-T-018,265,Jamus Jerome Lim,"I will speak today about the importance of helping the dejected, downtrodden and disaffected  parents of stillborn children, parents who have adopted children and working women in a precarious position due to a pregnancy."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00266,2021-08-02-T-018,266,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, in 1989, my mother became unexpectedly pregnant. At that time, I was 13 and my sister, six. Since our family was of modest means, my mother had to contribute to the household with a full-time job, which meant that she encountered all the challenges that working mothers face when they are working and carrying a child at the same time."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00267,2021-08-02-T-018,267,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Moreover, it was a difficult pregnancy because mom was already more advanced in her years. In the final months, I recall how she had to sleep upright on many nights due to the discomfort. But we took the fact that since the expected birth would occur exactly seven years apart from my sister's and 14 after mine – seven being the perfect number – as a sign that my brother's conception was a gift from God."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00268,2021-08-02-T-018,268,Jamus Jerome Lim,"But his birth was not to be. In the early hours of 6 May, I awoke to my father’s presence in my bedroom. He had tears in his eyes, one of only three times in my life when I had seen him cry. “We lost Jaaron,” he said. My brother had been stillborn. The sign of the seven had not been that perfect, after all."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00269,2021-08-02-T-018,269,Jamus Jerome Lim,"It took my mother at least that many years to recover from that loss. Along the way, she questioned her choices, her faith and herself."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00270,2021-08-02-T-018,270,Jamus Jerome Lim,"That is why amendments, such as that documented in clause 9(a) of the Bill, are so important. There is no difference between the physiological trauma endured by the mother of a healthy versus stillborn child. Consequently, I believe that we should not exempt the latter from any of the benefits of rest and recovery that Government-mandated maternity leave confers."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00271,2021-08-02-T-018,271,Jamus Jerome Lim,"If anything, the added psychological trauma that the latter will experience may even be the cause for being willing to think about extending even longer maternity leave periods for such individuals. Studies suggest that a leave period of 12 weeks post-delivery will positively affect vitality, while 15 weeks yield positive effects on mental health and 20 weeks on role function. Since the norm in Singapore is either 12 weeks of maternity leave or 16 weeks of Government-paid maternity leave, it would not be unreasonable to allow for a longer leave period for those who have to recover from not just physical but also mental wounds."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00272,2021-08-02-T-018,272,Jamus Jerome Lim,"As I shared earlier, the loss of my brother was one of only three occasions when I had seen my father cry. He was a traditional man and not given to public expression of his emotions. But the fact that he mourned the loss of my brother is indicative of the sort of pain and anguish that fathers also go through when they experience the loss of a child."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00273,2021-08-02-T-018,273,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Consequently, it would make eminent sense for compassionate leave to be extended to the father in the case of a stillborn child, too. May I, therefore, clarify if the extension of shared leave benefits, from section 12(E)(5) of the original Act, that this would be applicable in this instance as well?"
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00274,2021-08-02-T-018,274,Jamus Jerome Lim,"At this point, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I will return to the example of my mother. I seem to be talking a lot about my mother; it is something that she would, undoubtedly, find great delight in and I see this as simply payback, since she never seems to tire about talking about her children."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00275,2021-08-02-T-018,275,Jamus Jerome Lim,"As it turns out, my mother was also adopted as a child. This made an immense difference to her life, especially since my grandfather passed on while she was still a very young girl, and the fact that my mother was but one of 10 children meant that it was impossible for my grandmother to have raised her on her own."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00276,2021-08-02-T-018,276,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Adoption confers a lease of life for such children. Adoption is a gift of parenthood for those who might, for various reasons, be unable to have biological children of their own."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00277,2021-08-02-T-018,277,Jamus Jerome Lim,"As every forever parent knows, there is absolutely no distinction between being a parent to a biological or an adoptive child. Indeed, our latest demographic trends suggest that adoption may become ever-more prevalent, given how the median age of female marriages continues to drift higher – it was 28.8 years in 2020, almost a year more than a decade ago – all while our nation’s total fertility rate continues to decline. It stood at 1.1 per female in 2020."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00278,2021-08-02-T-018,278,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Clause 13 is, therefore, a wholly welcome recognition of this reality. However, I should point out that the language in which the amendments are embedded – that the adoption benefits apply to eligible mothers – automatically vests these benefits onto the adoptive mother. Even the proposed addition of section 12A(4)(b) does not fully offset this implicit bias, since it still requires the mother to elect to share these benefits, in accordance with section 12(E)(5) of the original Act, with the father."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00279,2021-08-02-T-018,279,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Moreover, while uncommon, the Adoption of Children Act does allow single men to adopt children, just not girls, except under very special circumstances. If so, fathers might be inadvertently excluded by the benefits outlined in section 12A."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00280,2021-08-02-T-018,280,Jamus Jerome Lim,"It strikes me as far more reasonable to couch the language in terms of the primary caregiver, whether it be male or female, in order to preclude the possibility that male parents forever find themselves ineligible for benefits, simply by dint of their gender."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00281,2021-08-02-T-018,281,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Clause 8(e) of the Bill introduces amendments to section 9A of the Act that are designed to protect working mothers. This House will, inevitably, return to this theme as we debate the gender equality Motion tomorrow. Here, I will limit my comments to underscoring how important it is to protect female employees who become pregnant."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00282,2021-08-02-T-018,282,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Too often, we hear stories from our female friends and residents about how they are burdened by an immense sense of insecurity after they become pregnant. While outright dismissals purely on the grounds of pregnancy alone are exceedingly rare – not least because they would be deemed wrongful – pregnant women, nevertheless, often feel under immense pressure or scrutiny over their workplace performance."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00283,2021-08-02-T-018,283,Jamus Jerome Lim,"In some egregious cases, however, unscrupulous employers may advance a case based on structural reasons to release a pregnant employee. While it is very difficult for an external party to perfectly adjudicate the validity of such justifications, per se, the fallback of Government-provided maternity benefits is, surely, welcome, as an additional safety net."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00284,2021-08-02-T-018,284,Jamus Jerome Lim,"On a parting note, I would like to touch just very briefly on the issue of returns on savings in CDAs. Here, my concern is one of omission, rather than commission. There were notably no amendments proposed to CDCA pertaining to returns on CDAs. Indeed, beyond a brief allusion to returns on CDAs in the original Co-savings Scheme, which states that it seeks, and I quote, ""to facilitate the making of financial provision for the development of a child… through the making of contributions to the child’s bank account"", in section 3 of the original Act, along with some notion of the protection of benefits in section 5, there is remarkably little guidance on returns."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00285,2021-08-02-T-018,285,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Hence, while CDAs do receive a number of Government grant injections and dollar-for-dollar matches, the incentives to further contribute to co-saving into the account – an aspiration embedded right in the name of the Act – is hardly encouraged."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00286,2021-08-02-T-018,286,Jamus Jerome Lim,"As Members of this House will undoubtedly be aware, the closest we have to magic in the world of finance is the power of compound interest. Yet, a causal inspection of available CDA offered by the major bank reveals that returns amount to only at most 2% a year. This is notable especially in contrast to risk-free interest on the other major Government savings scheme, CPF, where there is a legislated mandatory minimum of 2.5% on the Ordinary Account, and significantly higher for other accounts. One is left to wonder why CDAs do not enjoy the same legislative protections that CPF offers to its members."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00287,2021-08-02-T-018,287,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Notwithstanding these additional remarks, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00288,2021-08-02-T-018,288,Deputy Speaker,Ms Joan Pereira.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00289,2021-08-02-T-018,289,Joan Pereira,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I fully support the measures proposed in this Bill which will help Singaporeans have children."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00290,2021-08-02-T-018,290,Joan Pereira,"The introduction of the Government-Paid Paternity Benefit (GPPB) and Government-Paid Adoption Benefit (GPAB) is particularly welcomed, as is the provision for retrenched parents to benefit from the top-ups for leave during this very difficult period. I am very heartened by the support for another group of parents – those with stillborn children – who will receive birth-linked leave and benefits during a distressing juncture in their parenting journey. It is only right that the Government formalises the arrangement to reimburse employers who voluntarily grant parental leave to employees and make provisions for audits and recovery of erroneous payments. Madam, in Mandarin."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00291,2021-08-02-T-018,291,Joan Pereira,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] I would like to take this opportunity to make a request for parents of multiple births. Currently, the birth of twins or multiple babies is considered a single delivery by MOM. Parents do not receive double or additional Government-paid benefits. In fact, many countries already offer additional benefits to parents of multiple births. They include European countries and our neighbours in North and Southeast Asia. I hope that the Government will consider giving these parents more benefits so that they can have more time to take care of their babies, have a good rest and make further efforts to have a few more. This would be helpful in encouraging more births, too."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00292,2021-08-02-T-018,292,Joan Pereira,(In English)  I would like to take this opportunity to make a request on behalf of parents of multiple births. This is a small group of parents but we must try to help them as much as possible.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00293,2021-08-02-T-018,293,Joan Pereira,"Multiple births are a blessing but coping with twins, triplets or more babies is extremely challenging, especially for new mothers, and most of these will be new mothers because Singaporeans are having fewer babies."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00294,2021-08-02-T-018,294,Joan Pereira,"Presently, the birth of twins or multiple babies is treated as a single delivery. The parents will not receive double or additional benefits. While the parents can receive the benefits for a subsequent delivery, due to our low fertility rate, once a family has two or more children, the chance for a subsequent delivery may not be high. Hence, why do we not provide more benefits for such families? The parents will be better rested and, instead of feeling stressed and overwhelmed, might be encouraged to have another child or more children."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00295,2021-08-02-T-018,295,Joan Pereira,"As it is, many other countries are already offering parents of multiple births additional benefits. They range from European countries to our neighbours in North and Southeast Asia."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00296,2021-08-02-T-018,296,Joan Pereira,"If the concern is the impact on employers, the impact is very small. Around 3% to 4% of births over the last decade are multiple births and the days of leave taken by the parents can be spread out over a longer duration, to lower the impact at the workplace. Flexibility and mutual understanding between employers and employees are key. I hope the Ministry will consider my request favourably."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00297,2021-08-02-T-018,297,Deputy Speaker,Mr Louis Ng.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00298,2021-08-02-T-018,298,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Madam, this Bill is a step in the right direction. It expands support to a wider group of working parents and promotes a more family-friendly working environment. The roles of working parents are already challenging in the best of times. Any support is even more welcomed in challenging times like the present pandemic."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00299,2021-08-02-T-018,299,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"While I am supportive of the measures of this Bill, I sincerely hope we can amend this piece of legislation further and provide more support to more parents. I have three suggestions."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00300,2021-08-02-T-018,300,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,My first suggestion is about leave benefits where to-be parents suffer a miscarriage. I am supportive of the move in this Bill to provide birth-linked leave and benefits to parents of stillborn children. This is a compassionate policy which recognises the need for these parents to recover both physically and emotionally.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00301,2021-08-02-T-018,301,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Will the Ministry consider going further and reviewing its leave policies where a mother miscarries before the 28th week of pregnancy?
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00302,2021-08-02-T-018,302,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"While a stillborn child is defined as a child who is birthed after the 28th week of pregnancy, the event is no less traumatic for parents where a mother miscarries in the 27th week of pregnancy."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00303,2021-08-02-T-018,303,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Currently, these mothers are not eligible for maternity leave. MOM's guidance instead states that these others may take sick leave to recover. However, suffering a miscarriage is very different from coming down with the flu. It is also the mother who is entitled to sick leave to recover physically. The reality is that these parents, both mother and father, may require time to recover together."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00304,2021-08-02-T-018,304,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Will the Ministry consider taking a first step by providing partial reimbursements to employers who provide leave benefits to parents where a mother miscarries before the 28th week of pregnancy?
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00305,2021-08-02-T-018,305,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Madam, I would also like to take this opportunity to ask the Ministry to look into two other important issues, which I will cover in my second and third suggestions."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00306,2021-08-02-T-018,306,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,My second suggestion is on providing the cash component of the Baby Bonus for single unwed parents. I have spoken up about this many times over the years and it is time that we allow single unwed parents to qualify for the cash component of the Baby Bonus.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00307,2021-08-02-T-018,307,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"This Bill extends support to parents, including working fathers, adoptive mothers on short-term employment contracts, retrenched parents and parents with stillborn children."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00308,2021-08-02-T-018,308,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Single unwed parents are also parents. In fact, if it is difficult to be a working parent, single unwed working parents have an even heavier burden of filling the shoes of both parental figures both emotionally and financially."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00309,2021-08-02-T-018,309,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,The Government's stance towards single unwed parents has evolved and I am appreciative of this.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00310,2021-08-02-T-018,310,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"In 2019, then Senior Parliamentary Secretary Sun Xueling, in response to my Adjournment Motion, said, ""Single unwed parents and their children are valued citizens in our society, and like all parents, are respected for the love and care they provide for their children. They are no less a mother or a father, just because their child was born outside of marriage. Their children, like any other children in our society, are precious and every parent, regardless of their marital status, ought to be treated with respect. I acknowledge that in the past, the Government was fairly strict in limiting public housing access to married couples. However, over time, this position has evolved. For single unwed parents, we hope to facilitate their efforts to build a stable environment for their child."""
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00311,2021-08-02-T-018,311,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Indeed, we have made much progress. We already provide them with the CDAC component of the Baby Bonus. We have levelled the playing field in terms of maternity leave."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00312,2021-08-02-T-018,312,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"The cash component of the Baby Bonus will go a long way in helping single unwed parents build a stable environment for their children. This policy has to evolve, too. This discrimination may lead to the odd position where millionaires may be getting cash from the Baby Bonus, cash they do not need. But single unwed parents do not receive the same benefits, even though they are parents, too and even though many of them are low-income, with those under 35 years old having just a median salary of $600."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00313,2021-08-02-T-018,313,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Many single unwed parents need the cash component more than parents in dual-income families. They are not asking for more. They are asking to be treated fairly and equally. I sincerely hope that the Ministry will review this.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00314,2021-08-02-T-018,314,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"My last point is on paternity leave. Members of this House will be no stranger to my daughters Ella, Katie and Poppy. Some Members tell me that they wait for me to say their names in my speeches."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00315,2021-08-02-T-018,315,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"I have shared many of their stories in this House. All these stories come from the memories I have forged with them through time spent together, precious time, especially when they were little babies."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00316,2021-08-02-T-018,316,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"I took my paternity leave, treasured it and wished I had more time. My factory is closed, so, I would never get paternity leave again, as Ms Joan Pereira has said, when you have twins, you will never have more kids. But I know how important this leave is and I want to make sure fathers have previous time with their children. I have said this many times  ""Spend time with those you love, one of these days, you will either say I wish I had or I am glad I did."""
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00317,2021-08-02-T-018,317,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Study after study show that paternity leave is vital. Researchers at NUS looked into this and published their findings just a few months ago  ""This is the first evidence-based research that documents the positive relationship between paternity leave provision and family dynamics and children's well-being in Singapore. It is useful to see that, in addition to the immediate benefit for fathers to share the joy and responsibility of childcare when a child is born, leave-taking has a mid-to-long-term impact on children's and family's well-being and that a longer leave has greater benefits to the children's well-being."""
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00318,2021-08-02-T-018,318,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"They concluded that a two-week or longer paternity leave is significantly related to lower family conflict, maternal depression and mothers' parenting aggravation, and positively related to marital satisfaction and father-child closeness. In addition, children whose fathers took paternity leave have fewer behavioural problems."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00319,2021-08-02-T-018,319,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"These findings were similar to an IPS research paper in 2019 that found that fathers who took paternity leave experienced reduced conflicts, stronger family relationships and increased satisfaction in their marriage."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00320,2021-08-02-T-018,320,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Madam, we are calling for more paternity leave not just for fathers to have more time with their babies but also to fight the gender stereotype. What message do we send out when we give mothers 16 weeks of maternity leave and fathers two weeks of paternity leave?"
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00321,2021-08-02-T-018,321,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"The IPS research paper stated that, ""Family policies in Singapore continue to signal that childcare is a woman's responsibility and reinforce gender stereotypes."" Indeed, they do."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00322,2021-08-02-T-018,322,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"The policy recommendations put forth by the IPS study include extending the length of paternity leave and that, instead of shared parenting leave, exclusive and non-transferable paternity leave can be put in place for parents. I wholeheartedly support this call and hope that we set a target year, perhaps 2030 or 2040, at which we will have an equal number of paternity leave and maternity leave."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00323,2021-08-02-T-018,323,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"We can introduce the increases to paternity leave in phases, giving our employers time to plan ahead, while also providing a clear signal of our intentions to reduce the gender stereotype around parenting."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00324,2021-08-02-T-018,324,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"I hope the Minister of State will look into this proposal in consultation with the relevant stakeholders, including the tripartite partners and NGOs, such as Families for Life and Centre for Fathering."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00325,2021-08-02-T-018,325,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Madam, lastly, can the Minister of State share if any public consultation was done for this Bill? If public consultation was not done, can Minister of State share the reasons why it was not done?"
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00326,2021-08-02-T-018,326,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Given the amendments have significant effects on many families and all employers, I am sure many would applaud the amendments in this Bill. I am also equally sure that many would have constructive feedback that would have helped refine the Bill further."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00327,2021-08-02-T-018,327,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Madam, this Bill is all about families and parenting. And we all need to remember the advice that Minister Vivian Balakrishnan gave us, ""Life is a one-way ticket. A baby will only remain a baby for a very short time. They will grow up before we even realise it. The thing about life is we cannot rewind time. So, my advice to young parents here is, your children need you, they need you desperately and they need you only for a very, very transient time in their lives. If we miss it, we cannot get it back."" Madam, notwithstanding the above points, I stand in support of this Bill."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00328,2021-08-02-T-018,328,Deputy Speaker,Mr Desmond Choo.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00329,2021-08-02-T-018,329,Desmond Choo,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join the debate."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00330,2021-08-02-T-018,330,Desmond Choo,"The key message in this Bill is that the Government stands ever-ready to support couples in starting families and having children. The Bill also signals a continuing shift from the traditional notion of mothers being primary caregivers to children, emphasising the role of fathers in parenthood. There are two amendments of special note."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00331,2021-08-02-T-018,331,Desmond Choo,"First, the extension of benefits to parents of a stillborn child. There have been calls from various organisations to legitimise stillbirths as a significant life event. Many jurisdictions, such as the UK, have related policies to support women through stillbirth pregnancies. The trauma of stillbirth pregnancies cannot be understated; not only is there physical trauma, but what we must focus on is the lasting mental trauma it causes. I join Member Saktiandi Supaat in asking for the Government to support greater mental health support for this group of mothers. The extension of paternity leave and benefits to parents of a stillborn child will go a long way in reassuring couples that the Government acknowledges the mental trauma of stillbirths and will fully support these couples through such adversity."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00332,2021-08-02-T-018,332,Desmond Choo,"Second, the pandemic has brought forth many job changes. But structurally, accepting a new job meant that some expectant employees may not be statutorily entitled to maternity benefits if they have worked for less than three months. Under the amendments, the Ministry will now reimburse companies which voluntarily offer maternity and adoption leave to local female employees who have worked for less than three months despite not being required to do so. This is a good move to lean into the needs of our mothers and will encourage companies to go beyond short-term considerations and support our mothers."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00333,2021-08-02-T-018,333,Desmond Choo,"As the next bound of development, I hope that the Ministry can consider greater support for single mothers. We have come a long way in our support for single mothers. In 2016, the extension of maternity leave for single mothers to 16 weeks marked a positive change in our attitudes towards single mothers. In 2019, MND indicated that all mothers are equal and are welcome to apply for HDB housing. We have, indeed, made headway over the past decade in supporting our single mothers and we must not stop here."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00334,2021-08-02-T-018,334,Desmond Choo,"I have spoken about the financial and mental hardships that single mothers face on various occasions. Not only do single mothers have less resources, compared to a two-parent family, but they also face the stigma of being unmarried, with the emphasis on parenthood within marriage in Governmental policies."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00335,2021-08-02-T-018,335,Desmond Choo,"Under the current framework, single mothers are not entitled to various benefits. As Member Louis Ng has pointed out, they are left out of the Baby Bonus scheme which provides a cash entitlement of $8,000 for the first and second child. Furthermore, although many single mothers are in the workforce, they are ineligible for parenthood tax rebates and reliefs, such as the Working Mothers Child Relief (WMCR)."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00336,2021-08-02-T-018,336,Desmond Choo,"Although extending these benefits to single mothers may seemingly deviate from the traditional definition of a family unit, we must remember that the majority of single mothers are in their position due not to reasons within their control. We must ultimately be child-centric. Extending benefits, such as the Baby Bonus scheme to single mothers will benefit the child. Children of single mothers are all of equal importance as children of a married couple. These children all form the future generation of Singaporeans and we must not unduly disadvantage children of single mothers."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00337,2021-08-02-T-018,337,Desmond Choo,"I urge the Ministry to consider extending more benefits to single mothers, such as the Baby Bonus scheme and the various reliefs, that single mothers are entitled to. Notwithstanding the above calls for supporting single mothers, I rise in support of the Bill."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00338,2021-08-02-T-018,338,Gan Thiam Poh,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I am supportive of the amendments. I feel that, as a society, we should have a re-think and consider accepting either the wife or the husband as a full-time homemaker looking after children and to waive the requirement of at least three months of work records. We should recognise that being a homemaker is a job in itself. Hence, the parental benefits can be given to the homemaker, that means, only one of the parents."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00339,2021-08-02-T-018,339,Gan Thiam Poh,"Regarding reimbursements to employers who voluntarily grant leave to employees for parental leave, I would like to ask how much reimbursement has been given each year since the scheme was launched. Although there are caps which vary between high- and low-income groups, the costs of leave among staff do differ for employers. What has been the amounts of reimbursement for each income group?"
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00340,2021-08-02-T-018,340,Gan Thiam Poh,"The Government recently doubled the maximum amount of dollar-for-dollar co-matching for parents' savings for the Child Development Account (CDA) for their second child, from $3,000 to $6,000. While this is good, middle- and lower-income families may not benefit as much as the higher-income groups, because they may face challenges putting in as much savings. How do we encourage parents to contribute to their children's CDAs to ensure they are not left out, especially parents who are self-employed and freelancers? What has been the number of children for each income group which benefited from the scheme? What has been the total grants for each child in each of the income groups? How many appeals has the Ministry received regarding CDAs?"
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00341,2021-08-02-T-018,341,Yeo Wan Ling,"Madam, few things in life are certain  birth, death and change. Yet, with all three come much uncertainty for the Singaporean worker. With today's reading of the Child Development Co-Savings Bill, we welcome amendments that safeguard the interests of workers and families alike. Particularly, we welcome the introduction of benefit schemes for contract workers and the sensible expansion of benefits even to parents of still-born children."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00342,2021-08-02-T-018,342,Yeo Wan Ling,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, when a child is due, a child is due. We cannot tell baby to wait for her parents' economic conditions to make a turn for the better, or for mom and dad to be placed with a permanent job. That is why we are encouraged by the Government's consideration of parents on short-term contracts, as seen in the Government-Paid Maternity Benefit and, so, we celebrate its extension to fathers and adoptive mothers as well. This signals that the Government recognises the biodiversity of livelihoods within our eco-system of workers and that alternative forms of livelihoods, such as contract workers, deserve to be weatherproofed, just as permanent employees' are."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00343,2021-08-02-T-018,343,Yeo Wan Ling,"Not only should all workers be protected equally; so should all parents. Some believe that parenting begins when a child is born, but I believe that parenthood begins in pregnancy – when your pregnancy home kit test first signals that you are positive, when you hear your child's first heartbeat, when you take your first ultrasound picture of your child. For a couple, there is so much expectation, so much preparation up to the due date. For most parents, this due date is a joyous occasion while, for some, a profound pain envelops their expectant hearts. I am referring to parents of stillborn children. Indeed, there is a physical healing process still for the mother to go through. But deeper and more unique to such couples is the emotional healing process, as other Members of this House have talked about. Grieving, accepting and moving on from such a tragedy require plenty of space and time. These birth-linked leave and benefits are thus appropriately and necessarily conferred on these couples who are very much parents in their own right."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00344,2021-08-02-T-018,344,Yeo Wan Ling,"As we celebrate the sensible considerations undergirding the amendments in this Bill that will move us towards more equitable outcomes for families, it is actually of paramount importance that we recall the spirit of the legislation at hand – that is, to support families in having more children. While, on paper, much of the legislation revolves around financial provisions for parents, these measures shape cultural norms, whether we like it or not. In particular, I am referring to the way the burden of parenting is shouldered by couples."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00345,2021-08-02-T-018,345,Yeo Wan Ling,"Mdm Deputy Speaker, more must be done to even out the weight of parenting between couples. However, I would like to preface by saying that this is not a call to point fingers, nor a ""call out"", but rather an invitation to share in the joys of parenting. When fathers do not pull their weight in parenting, both miss out on the joys of parenting – fathers from absence or distance and mothers from tiredness or burnout. However, when both parents are well involved, both share the responsibilities of parenthood and, together with the shared responsibilities, come joy."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00346,2021-08-02-T-018,346,Yeo Wan Ling,"This invitation rides on the low take-up rates of paternity leave, especially in the private sector. Although we may feel our take-up rates are strong against international standards, the actual benchmark for strong take-up rates should instead be compared to the take-up rates of maternity leave at home. Anything less than equal and we still have work to do. This, once again, is not to point fingers at fathers – most dads do want to spend time with their kids and many of my residents who are fathers have expressed joy with how much easier this has become since they have been working from home. We need to pick up our fight with what lies deeper – workplace cultures embedded in our society."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00347,2021-08-02-T-018,347,Yeo Wan Ling,"While no employers are hanging signs on office walls discouraging fathers from taking paternity leave, many fathers might feel the threat of being implicitly penalised for taking days off to care for their children. Perhaps, some employers think that this could be rightfully and naturally left to their spouses, or even see the usage of paternity leave as unnecessary or, worse still, opportunistic. Hence, it is no longer enough that employers merely provide opportunities for fathers taking paternity leave or other benefits, especially when fathers might be left second-guessing the costs incurred to their careers. Instead, employers should go a step further to actively encourage fathers to take days off to care for their family, especially in the form of their paternity leave days. This is the kind of assurance that is sure to drive the take-up rates of paternity leave usage."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00348,2021-08-02-T-018,348,Yeo Wan Ling,"This shift will not come easily. But to break out of old mindsets, new approaches must be embraced. Therefore, we call on the Government to incentivise employers on this front to be champions of equal parenting roles and, so, champions of strong families and children. An example could be expanding the Working Mother's Child Relief and Grandparent Caregiver Relief to working fathers. By availing incentivisation schemes to both mothers and fathers, this would reflect the better sharing of parental duties, reinforce the positive communications and, indeed, raise the visibility to the important role males play in parenting and, indeed, caregiving."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00349,2021-08-02-T-018,349,Yeo Wan Ling,"To go a step further, I draw on two recommendations our Women's Wing and Young PAP have formulated."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00350,2021-08-02-T-018,350,Yeo Wan Ling,"Firstly, we call on the Government to give parents full flexibility in deciding how to share their maternity and paternity leave. This flexible redistribution of the total maternity and paternity leave entitlement pie does not create additional burden to employers who are facing manpower shortages and yet places choice and full control in the hands of the parents."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00351,2021-08-02-T-018,351,Yeo Wan Ling,"Secondly, we call on the Government to create a support network for single mothers. As I have mentioned, not only should all workers be treated fairly; so, also should all parents. This is not an entirely new call. In 2013, the Labour Movement had called for equal benefits for single mothers and, as a result, we now see unwed mothers entitled to the same maternity leave, childcare and infant care leave, as well as the enjoyment of CDCA benefits. We will continue to stand with single mothers and not compound the burden of having to raise a child singlehandedly."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00352,2021-08-02-T-018,352,Yeo Wan Ling,"These make up just two of our 12 robust and highly actionable recommendations. We, too, delight in good ideas, but our delight is made complete in ideas that birth action, rather than just laundry lists that are strong on paper but often remain only on paper. The Labour Movement's continued ability to weave idealism and activation has been a cornerstone for women's consistent elevation in the workforce and we submit these calls to the Government as we march forward in a fruitful partnership."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00353,2021-08-02-T-018,353,Yeo Wan Ling,"Stronger families start with healthier parents and healthier parents are those who shoulder each other's burdens willingly and joyfully. As we gather to debate the Child Development Co-Savings Bill, our considerations must not only be on how the Government can help parents, but how the Government can help parents help each other as well. This is what a strong family starts with. These concerns notwithstanding, I support the Bill."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00354,2021-08-02-T-018,354,Deputy Speaker,Order. I propose to take a break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 4.31 pm.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00355,2021-08-02-T-018,355,Deputy Speaker,Sitting accordingly suspended
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00356,2021-08-02-T-018,356,Deputy Speaker,at 4.11 pm until 4.31 pm.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00357,2021-08-02-T-018,357,Deputy Speaker,Sitting resumed at 4.31 pm.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00358,2021-08-02-T-018,358,Deputy Speaker,[(proc text) Debate resumed. (proc text)]
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00359,2021-08-02-T-018,359,Deputy Speaker,Ms Nadia Samdin.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00360,2021-08-02-T-018,360,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. It has often been quoted that our greatest resource is our people. Our people drive the economy, forming a skilled and productive workforce in order to remain competitive. This same workforce must reproduce itself and, at the same time, provide care to our children who will be the workforce of the future."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00361,2021-08-02-T-018,361,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Our total fertility rate (TFR) in 2020 was a historical low. Today, traditional notions of gender roles have shifted to more women pursuing their aspirations in the workforce while earning to support the family, away from the figure of the sole male breadwinner going out to work while the woman stays home. The last decade has seen an increase in the proportion of resident married-couple households with working wives and, as of 2020, more than half of our married couples are dual-income. With more women participating in the workforce, the dynamics of having a child today are very different from before."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00362,2021-08-02-T-018,362,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"But while the players have changed, the rules of the game have not quite kept up and expectations are still rooted in the past. It is not uncommon to hear women struggling with the mental load, burnt out from caregiving responsibilities, expected to attend that 5.30 pm Zoom work call while preparing dinner for the family and swinging by childcare to pick up the infant. There is still a gender bias in caregiving, something we have repeatedly heard during the ongoing Conversations on Singapore Women’s Development, highlighting a clear demand for greater equality in sharing responsibilities at home."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00363,2021-08-02-T-018,363,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"COVID-19 with home-based learning and work from home, has also brought about new realities, with a marked effect on what the family unit requires of each of its members, fathers included, and also what employers can expect from employees."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00364,2021-08-02-T-018,364,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"I am glad that this Bill introduces the Government-Paid Paternity Benefit (GPPB) and Government-Paid Adoption Benefit (GPAB) schemes – the former giving fathers more benefits, signalling that they are important, too, when it comes to making trade-offs between work and family. I understand that eligible parents will be able to apply for these schemes from December 2021 and hope that the Government can provide an indicative timeline on the application process, as I am sure many will be interested to know how they can apply and what sort of records will employers and employees be required to keep to prevent disputes down the line, especially for retrenched parents."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00365,2021-08-02-T-018,365,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Businesses will take the point from legislation. I am also glad that we are amending the benefits to recognise short-term employment contracts and parents who are, unfortunately, affected by unforeseen circumstances, such as retrenchment, which can cause great uncertainty, as well as extending compassion to parents of stillborn children, allowing them time to recover physically and emotionally."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00366,2021-08-02-T-018,366,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"I would like to raise two points, the first being societal attitudes and women’s development."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00367,2021-08-02-T-018,367,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"The monetisation of unused paternity leave under the GPPB provides an option that can benefit our families. However, it may not provide an incentive for parents to shoulder more responsibility at home. In fact, it may have the unintended consequence of lowering the opportunity cost for fathers. We already have a low take-up rate of paternity leave, with some pointing to societal attitudes, stigma, against men being caregivers as reasons for this, especially in the private sector."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00368,2021-08-02-T-018,368,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"The perfect woman is often imagined to have it all. While I have not yet had the opportunity to be a mom, I remember the daily dilemmas of a former colleague and friend of mine who has three children and, when one child is sick, it can be impossible to find a caregiver or enough days of leave. On the ground, we have heard of parents begging school principals to keep their child in infantcare if it is only a sniffle or light cough, instead of taking the child home, or despairing when a helper or grandparent is suddenly put on a Quarantine Order. It can be an impossible situation for parents."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00369,2021-08-02-T-018,369,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Financial incentives will only go so far. As a society, we need to adjust both policies and mindsets to encourage fathers to play a more active role in raising their children. Currently, fathers have two weeks of paternity leave, with the option of ""taking"" four weeks from their partners. But despite the Government's ongoing efforts to get men more involved in raising their children, the majority of fathers do not take up the shared leave. Some have expressed reluctance to reduce the leave of the mothers as they read the differential in leave as a signal as to who is more responsible. More equal exclusive paternity leave, 16 weeks versus two weeks, will create opportunities for fathers, rather than making couples make tough decisions on a limited number of weeks, as mothers, too, prize the chance to bond with their child."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00370,2021-08-02-T-018,370,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"In the future, we can consider varying mechanisms to support wider family structures of fathers or mothers in their caregiving journey. In Germany, parents can access Parental Allowance Plus, which gives them the right to receive a parental allowance from the government, including if both parents decide to take parental leave at the same time, thus allowing for precious family time instead of foisting the responsibility of caregiving on just one parent. Spouses or partners who take care of the child after birth, even if the child is not their own, may also receive parental allowance, subject to the same conditions which give greater recognition to different family structures. This also applies to relatives up to the third degree, if the parents cannot look after their child alone on account of a hardship, such as disability, and also goes beyond adopted parents to include children taken into foster care with the aim of adoption. I hope that, as society evolves and family structures change, we will be even more inclusive in the definition of the child."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00371,2021-08-02-T-018,371,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"My second point, the impact on business. At the same time, we also need to recognise associated costs in implementing family-friendly policies, especially for businesses, in particular, SMEs or start-ups, which may struggle to find workers to cover. Where we can, we should also try to alleviate the cost on businesses. For example, financially covering more days of childcare leave may take some financial stress off employers, instead of only covering the last three days."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00372,2021-08-02-T-018,372,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Encouraging employees to take paid leave may be costly for employers, but discouraging it or setting up unfriendly work practices can be costlier. Incorporating family-friendly policies in our workplace could be positive tools for hiring and employee retention, where employees feel cared for and they can grow with the family through different life stages and are more likely to remain loyal in a good work environment. There is a high correlation between employee satisfaction, family-friendly policies and flexibility in work."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00373,2021-08-02-T-018,373,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Mr Deputy Speaker, please allow me to continue in Malay."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00374,2021-08-02-T-018,374,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] In several meetings between myself, residents and volunteers in Ang Mo Kio, I have observed a change of mindset among fathers. Many of them now share the same responsibilities as mothers in terms of caregiving, providing guidance and spending time with their families. They show more concern and get involved in the daily chores. But at the same time, fathers have also shared with me the dilemma they face in balancing their responsibilities as dedicated husbands, fathers and workers."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00375,2021-08-02-T-018,375,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"We need efforts, not just on the part of the Government, but also from all levels of society, to eradicate the kind of thinking and workplace culture that places more pressure on the role of fathers or mothers."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00376,2021-08-02-T-018,376,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"There are many companies that can be emulated as inclusive employers. For example, the founder of Zahid & Shah Group encourages their employees to take paternity leave, provides flexible work arrangements and gives time-off to fathers who need to help their wives or accompany their elderly parents to vaccination appointments."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00377,2021-08-02-T-018,377,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Guidance and support from men are also important in our efforts to encourage women to achieve their career aspirations and their lifelong dreams. I will not be here today without the support of my father and husband, who help to prepare breakfast or coffee and with the household chores."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00378,2021-08-02-T-018,378,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,I acknowledge that not all women receive the same support and guidance. Some are facing a dilemma too. They are pressured by their husbands or families to abandon their career aspirations.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00379,2021-08-02-T-018,379,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,This Bill is a step forward that reflects the Government's policy of being inclusive and family-friendly. I hope that this proposal can transform workplace culture to provide opportunities for parents to progress in their careers without any stigma and dilemma. I hope that more fathers will step forward to use paternity leave and the time given to help their wives and children in order to foster closer family ties at home.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00380,2021-08-02-T-018,380,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"(In English)  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am encouraged by the amendments introduced and support the Bill."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00381,2021-08-02-T-018,381,Deputy Speaker,Ms Carrie Tan.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00382,2021-08-02-T-018,382,Carrie Tan,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend and support the changes to the Child Development Co-Savings Act. I am especially glad for the enhancements to the Government-Paid Paternity Benefits, as well as the Government's reimbursements to companies which opt to give additional leave to parents beyond the statutory requirements. It certainly helps in the efforts to encourage workplace cultures to be more family-friendly. I have a clarification to ask and some suggestions to make."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00383,2021-08-02-T-018,383,Carrie Tan,"First, can there be more transparency and clearer instructions on how Self-Employed Persons' claims for Government-Paid Maternity and Paternity benefits will be assessed? I have had residents who write in to ask how and what proof they need to submit to show that they have taken leave when they are their own bosses. This applies to freelancers and sole proprietors who include tuition teachers, coaches, designers, arts and sports instructors, beauticians, home caterers, consultants, marketeers and many others, even including delivery riders, like what my hon colleague, Mr Saktiandi Supaat, has mentioned earlier. They are unsure and confused about what extent of documentation they need to submit and whether their claims will be approved. It would be helpful to have more clarity and certainty, as the success of the paid leave reimbursements impact on their financials at a time when money could be very tight due to the increased expenses brought on by a newborn child."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00384,2021-08-02-T-018,384,Carrie Tan,"Second, amendments must be made for low-income families who currently benefit very little from the dollar-for-dollar matched savings benefit. And I echo my colleague Mr Gan Thiam Poh's call for it. While I welcome and support the recent revisions to increase the capped amount for the second child from $3,000 to $6,000, low-income families may be left with a further gap to catch up on, compared to other families in terms of child financing. Low-income Singaporeans are not able to save much, given their jobs and salaries pay only enough to make ends meet, if at all. Based on the latest Household Expenditure Survey, on average, the bottom 20% of households are now spending $2,570 a month while having a monthly income of $2,235, which includes already the regular Government transfers, such as Workfare. This means that these 20th percentile of families have a shortfall, on average, of $335 each month, leaving them no ability to save."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00385,2021-08-02-T-018,385,Carrie Tan,"I suggest we have a differentiated and higher savings match ratio for households that are within the bottom 20th percentile of income in Singapore, to help make the savings matching scheme more equitable. This will be a positive step to help bridge the inequality gap, by providing better for children from low-income households. A financial literacy programme tailored to this community can also be coupled with this benefit to help equip low-income families with the planning skills to attain and maximise savings."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00386,2021-08-02-T-018,386,Carrie Tan,"Third, we should equalise the Government's treatment of children born out of wedlock and within marriages. I am disappointed that the latest amendments continue to disadvantage children born to unwed parents, which is unfortunate and unfair for the child. I echo and support my hon colleague Mr Louis Ng's call to make unwed parents eligible for the Baby Bonus Cash Gift."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00387,2021-08-02-T-018,387,Carrie Tan,"Although I understand the Government's position that it does not want to signal or encourage the birth of children out of wedlock, it needs to recognise that such circumstances can be born out of misfortune and not always wilful promiscuity."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00388,2021-08-02-T-018,388,Carrie Tan,"I have a resident who was unable to marry her fiancé after getting pregnant because he died from a traffic accident before their wedding. To this day, she still feels penalised from being excluded from the various support schemes, including housing support, due to circumstances beyond her control. Many unwed mothers may also choose not to be trapped by marriage to irresponsible men. The fact that these men are irresponsible is often a discovery after the deed. Marriage is not always the ideal option if the father proves to be an untenable lifelong partner."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00389,2021-08-02-T-018,389,Carrie Tan,"No matter what one's view or value is on wedlock, I believe we can all agree that the child of unwed parents should not be made to suffer the consequences of the parents' choices or mistakes."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00390,2021-08-02-T-018,390,Carrie Tan,"If the Government's intention is to discourage extra-marital affairs, I would urge the Government to look into better enforcement of child support payments. One possibility could be using DNA tests to identify and hold accountable biological parents. Accountability to a child whom one sires or births should be regardless of marital status. This will help unwed mothers caring for a child to access child support payments from their co-parents if necessary."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00391,2021-08-02-T-018,391,Carrie Tan,"In the rare case where the one caring for the child is the biological father, the accountability should be equally applied to any mother who has chosen to bail."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00392,2021-08-02-T-018,392,Carrie Tan,"Every child born is precious, especially in Singapore. I hope CDCA can go beyond being a support programme to encourage and support parenthood to also become an instrument to equalise the circumstances and well-being of every Singaporean child."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00393,2021-08-02-T-018,393,Carrie Tan,"In summary, I would like to make three asks. One, more administrative clarity for self-employed parents to access paternity and maternity benefits. Two, differentiated and higher ratio child-development savings match for low-income families. Three, equalised cash support in Baby Bonus, possibly renamed Baby Support, to children of unwed parents. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00394,2021-08-02-T-018,394,Yip Hon Weng,"Mr Deputy Speaker, families with young children have been profoundly affected by the pandemic. Many have to juggle with work-from-home arrangements and, at the same time, help their children with home-based learning. For others, they may have been made redundant or experienced a drop in income. The Bill amendments reflect that the Government is aware of parenting challenges during this difficult period. I will touch on three issues in my speech."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00395,2021-08-02-T-018,395,Yip Hon Weng,"First, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Government should consider extending the benefits to single parents, including those who are unwed, separated or divorced. Many Members have also proposed this. It would not be a stretch to say that single parents are the hardest hit during the pandemic. They have to juggle managing their children, their jobs and everything else, with little to no support without a spouse. Even if they qualify for maintenance fees, it is a perpetual challenge for some to claim these fees, which involves going to Court each time."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00396,2021-08-02-T-018,396,Yip Hon Weng,"At recruitment interviews, their marital status and caregiving arrangements are a perpetual concern for interviewers. They also do not have sufficient childcare leave or someone else to share the burden. A resident of mine, a single mother of one child, told me that she has been unemployed for two years. This was because she has been unable to find an employer who would accommodate her need to fulfill her caregiving duties."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00397,2021-08-02-T-018,397,Yip Hon Weng,"Although single parents from low-income households may tap on financial assistance, the application and renewal processes are reportedly tedious. Regardless of their circumstances, these children are Singapore Citizens. They are our future. I hope that the Government can accord the same benefits eligible to conventional families to the single-parent families. They are in greater need."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00398,2021-08-02-T-018,398,Yip Hon Weng,"I also wish to request that support for parents with stillborn children be extended to those who have suffered a miscarriage or other pregnancy loss. While some employers may not be compassionate enough to allow them to take bereavement leave, suffering a miscarriage is not quite the same as losing a family member to external circumstances."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00399,2021-08-02-T-018,399,Yip Hon Weng,"We should acknowledge and empathise that a miscarriage is a devastating life event, which can take a significant toll on one's physical and emotional well-being."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00400,2021-08-02-T-018,400,Yip Hon Weng,"Second, Mr Deputy Speaker, with more parents and, in turn, employers becoming eligible for the leave benefits, are they required to apply for the grants or will the process be automated? If manual application is required, can the Ministry share about the application and approval process? Can the platforms to apply and to check on applications be made digital and seamless? For a start, I think applicants should not be required to produce the supporting documents, as the relevant information on employees' marital status, number of children and so on should be available in the Government database. The hassle may be off-putting for employers. It is also an unnecessary inconvenience for the officers processing the applications."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00401,2021-08-02-T-018,401,Yip Hon Weng,"Lastly, Mr Deputy Speaker, as with all new and enhanced initiatives involving finances, there must be effective means to monitor how well they are working. Can the Government share how we intend to measure success for this initiative? What are the KPIs to determine whether more parents are benefiting from family-friendly policies at the workplace? Are we looking beyond the amount of reimbursements issued and leave granted? I hope we can go beyond counting the figures. We should have actual conversations with parents to find out if these measures have boosted their confidence to grow their family in Singapore. These measures would be useful to assess if the initiatives have truly translated into family-friendly work environments."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00402,2021-08-02-T-018,402,Yip Hon Weng,"In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, I appreciate that the Government is extending cash benefits and employment leave benefits to a wider group of parents. As a father of five myself, this issue concerns me personally. I am aware that many fathers do not take paternity leave. In 2019, only 45% of all fathers took paternity leave. As such, the amendments to the Government-Paid Paternity Benefit (GPPB) will be welcomed. It will spur employers to support more fathers to spend time with their families. Likewise, we hope that fathers will actively take up these entitlements to spend time with their children, as they go through their formative years. Nothing should be more important than being there for one's kids when it matters most. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00403,2021-08-02-T-018,403,Deputy Speaker,Minister of State Sun Xueling.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00404,2021-08-02-T-018,404,Sun Xueling,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. To all Members who have spoken on the Bill, I am grateful for your support of the Bill and the queries raised. Many of us continue to place emphasis on ensuring an environment that supports families. We are united in this effort."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00405,2021-08-02-T-018,405,Sun Xueling,"Many Members also recognised that it is a complex task to balance the many interests and considerations at hand when it comes to decisions on whether new policies should be introduced and if enhancements should be made to existing schemes. Some have alluded to the many factors at play and I am glad that they appreciate the balance the Government must strike. We have to safeguard taxpayers' monies and allocate as fairly as we can, knowing that any policy decision made has an indelible impact across multiple stakeholders. Let me touch on the points raised in turn."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00406,2021-08-02-T-018,406,Sun Xueling,"Members, such as Ms Carrie Tan, Ms Yeo Wan Ling, Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin, Mr Louis Ng, Mr Yip Hon Weng and Mr Desmond Choo, have suggested that more could be done for single unwed parents. I respect their views and I thank Member Louis Ng for sharing what I had said in Parliament before. Over the years, all Government benefits that support the caregiving, growth and development of children have been equalised."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00407,2021-08-02-T-018,407,Sun Xueling,"I had highlighted in my opening speech the suite of measures that all Singaporean children can access. These include subsidies in healthcare, education, childcare and infant care, as well as the MediSave Grant for Newborns, MediShield Life coverage from birth and the Foreign Domestic Worker Levy Concession. In 2016, we further extended the Child Development Account (CDA) to children of single unwed parents, which includes the CDA First Step Grant and matched co-savings from the Government. In 2017, we extended support to unwed mothers for maternity leave under the CDCA. For unwed fathers who are the main caregivers of their children, MSF also evaluates their requests for paternity leave on a case-by-case basis."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00408,2021-08-02-T-018,408,Sun Xueling,Members have also raised that more benefits could be extended to single unwed parents. Single unwed parents who require further help can approach our Social Service Offices and Family Service Centres.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00409,2021-08-02-T-018,409,Sun Xueling,"For other benefits, such as the Baby Bonus Cash Gift and parenthood-related tax benefits, these continue to be targeted to encourage parenthood within marriage. We acknowledge Members' concerns about single unwed parents and we will do what we can to support them based on their needs. I also hope to assure Members that, together with other agencies, we regularly review how we can better support them."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00410,2021-08-02-T-018,410,Sun Xueling,"For single unwed parents who require further support, they can also look to the SPIN programme, which can help improve their access to information and resources."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00411,2021-08-02-T-018,411,Sun Xueling,"Ms Carrie Tan shared that there was a need to look into better enforcement of child support payments so as to reiterate that accountability to a child is independent of marital status. The Member will be happy to note that the duty of a parent to maintain his or her child is already provided for under the Women's Charter, regardless of whether the child is legitimate or illegitimate. Unwed mothers are, therefore, already able to apply to the Court for maintenance of a child from the father."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00412,2021-08-02-T-018,412,Sun Xueling,"Ms Carrie Tan and Mr Gan Thiam Poh also shared that some low-income parents may not be able to fully maximise the co-matching feature of CDA. This feature first requires parents to deposit into CDA to receive Government co-matching, which may be challenging for some low-income parents who may not have the means to set aside enough to save into CDA. In 2016, we introduced the CDA First Step Grant, which is a $3,000 deposit when CDA is opened, without parents having to save first. This is granted to all Singaporean children, regardless of their parents' marital or income status. I am glad that some community partners have also stepped forward to help families save more into CDA by making deposits into the accounts of children from low-income families. These contributions will qualify for Government co-matching and we encourage them to continue to do so."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00413,2021-08-02-T-018,413,Sun Xueling,"The Government also provides adhoc top-ups to CDA. For example, as part of the Household Support Package announced at Budget this year, all Singaporean children aged six and under in 2021 will receive a $200 top-up to their CDA from September this year. The CDA remains open for 12 years. Therefore, parents have a substantial amount of time to deposit money into CDA to maximise the co-matching caps and should plan to do so at their own pace."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00414,2021-08-02-T-018,414,Sun Xueling,"Assoc Prof Jamus Lim has asked why there are no legislative provisions to clearly set out the interest rates that apply to CDA. We welcome his wholehearted endorsement of CPF and its very generous, risk-free returns."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00415,2021-08-02-T-018,415,Sun Xueling,"CDA's interest rates are determined by banks but have, generally, been higher than a normal savings account. On top of this, despite CDA being a bank account, the Government provides co-matching. Monies in CDA are intended to support the child's growth and development during their early years, in contrast to CPF, which helps support Singaporeans in their retirement years. And parents are able to withdraw from CDA, as needed, to defray educational and healthcare expenses at approved institutions, as compared to CPF."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00416,2021-08-02-T-018,416,Sun Xueling,"There are dedicated schemes that low-income families can turn to, if they need social assistance, and such families can approach our Social Service Offices (SSOs), which stand ready to render help. Our SSOs will assess their households' needs and circumstances and provide assistance accordingly. For instance, families who require support with their basic living expenses can receive ComCare financial assistance if they meet the criteria and SSOs may also refer families to other Government agencies and community partners, such as Family Service Centres, for further support."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00417,2021-08-02-T-018,417,Sun Xueling,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked that we consider waiving the employment criterion for Leave and Benefits schemes, in consideration of stay-at-home parents. For example, a cash grant could be given to a stay-at-home parent. The Leave and Benefits schemes are meant to support working parents in managing their work and caregiving responsibilities, without having to leave the workforce."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00418,2021-08-02-T-018,418,Sun Xueling,"Nonetheless, we value the contributions of stay-at-home parents, as they, too, play a fundamental role in nurturing the next generation of Singaporeans. As such, we have put in place other support schemes that Singaporean children and their families can receive, regardless of their parents' working status, including the Baby Bonus Scheme, the MediSave Grant for Newborns and the Foreign Domestic Worker Levy Concession."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00419,2021-08-02-T-018,419,Sun Xueling,"One of the Government's key priorities is to ensure that parents have access to quality and affordable preschools for their children. To this end, we have significantly increased the number of full-day places, from about 120,000 in 2015 to around 190,000 today, an increase of over 50%. To answer Mr Yip Hon Weng's query, in spite of the COVID-19 situation, we are on track to grow the number of full-day places to over 200,000 by 2023."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00420,2021-08-02-T-018,420,Sun Xueling,"Mr Yip Hon Weng also asked about the accessibility of preschool places for parents who have switched to hybrid or remote working. Today, almost 70% of all childcare centres and over 95% of Anchor Operator childcare centres are located in residential estates, as families have, generally, expressed a preference for childcare services close to their homes."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00421,2021-08-02-T-018,421,Sun Xueling,"Going forward, we will continue to build more preschool places in tandem with upcoming HDB developments where there are more new families. ECDA closely monitors local preschool enrolment and availability and regularly reviews its plans. Should local demand shift and exceed earlier expectations, ECDA would work with preschools and HDB to look into activating more void deck and communal spaces for centre extensions, where available."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00422,2021-08-02-T-018,422,Sun Xueling,"Members such as Ms Carrie Tan, Mr Saktiandi Supaat, Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin and Mr Yip Hon Weng, have asked for clarity on the application process and how claims and payouts under the Government-Paid Leave Schemes and Benefits are assessed. In particular, Ms Carrie Tan and Mr Saktiandi Supaat have asked how self-employed persons' leave claims are assessed."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00423,2021-08-02-T-018,423,Sun Xueling,"Let me first address Mr Saktiandi Supaat's query on how we define self-employed persons, which relates to how we assess their claims. Broadly, a self-employed man or woman is a resident of Singapore who engages in or carries on any trade, business, profession or vocation other than employment under a contract of service and derives income from such trade, business, profession or vocation. Freelancers and gig workers fall within this definition, as do delivery drivers."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00424,2021-08-02-T-018,424,Sun Xueling,"To be clear, self-employed persons can qualify for payment under either the Leave or Benefits schemes. Their employment arrangement is the one that will determine which scheme they qualify under."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00425,2021-08-02-T-018,425,Sun Xueling,"To Ms Carrie Tan's queries on how self-employed parents' leave claims are assessed and Mr Yip Hon Weng's query on whether the application and approval processes are automated, let me illustrate with an example. Self-employed mothers can submit maternity leave claims at MSF's ""profamilyleave"" website. They have to provide basic information, such as their personal particulars and their child's, as well as their occupation and period of inactivity from work. To avoid over-burdening applicants, we require only critical information to enable assessment. In most cases, they do not need to submit documents at this point of application but are required to declare that the information provided is accurate. We have automated the process, as much as possible."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00426,2021-08-02-T-018,426,Sun Xueling,"We will verify against available data in the Government database that the eligibility criteria are met, for example, that the applicant's child is a Singapore Citizen. If eligible, the applicant will be entitled to payment from the Government for the Government-paid portion of leave, based on one's lost income, as capped by the limits set out in legislation. In determining the amount, we will look at the relevant Notice of Assessment, which is prescribed in the subsidiary legislation. For self-employed parents without a Notice of Assessment, I can assure Members that MSF will consider other documents which can serve as proof of income to facilitate our assessment. These could include bank statements, contracts for services or invoices."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00427,2021-08-02-T-018,427,Sun Xueling,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin asked about the application process for the new Government-Paid Paternity Benefit (GPPB) and the Government-Paid Adoption Benefit (GPAB) schemes. Mr Saktiandi Supaat also asked about the application process for parents who have been retrenched but have unconsumed leave and want to apply for a benefits top-up.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00428,2021-08-02-T-018,428,Sun Xueling,"Generally, the application process is similar to an application under the existing Government-Paid Maternity Benefits scheme, which is done at MSF's ""profamilyleave"" website. Parents will need to submit all their employment contracts for the period of 12 months immediately preceding their child's date of birth or eligibility date for an adopted child and their payslips for the employments or the latest Notice of Assessment. They will also need to submit the retrenchment letter. The amount that a parent receives will be derived from the average income earned over the 12 months preceding the child's date of birth or eligibility date for an adopted child."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00429,2021-08-02-T-018,429,Sun Xueling,"For parents who require more details and fellow Members who meet residents with these queries, I encourage you to visit the ""profamilyleave"" website, which has information on the eligibility criteria, application procedures and payment for the various schemes. MSF is also happy to render assistance to parents who require help in navigating the process."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00430,2021-08-02-T-018,430,Sun Xueling,"Mr Gam Thiam Poh raised a good point that we do not want self-employed persons to be left out. I hope that my explanation will reassure working parents who are self-employed, that they, too, should apply for the Leave and Benefits schemes."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00431,2021-08-02-T-018,431,Sun Xueling,"To Mr Gan Thiam Poh's point that the amounts reimbursed to employers or paid out in the form of benefits may vary from person to person, this is correct. For employees on the leave schemes, they will continue to receive their salaries for the duration of their leave and, for the Government-paid portion, this would be subject to the reimbursement caps. For those who do not qualify for leave but are eligible for the benefits schemes, they will receive a payout from the Government equivalent to the Government-paid portion of leave, pro-rated based on their economic activity in the 12 months preceding the child's date of birth or the eligibility date for an adopted child."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00432,2021-08-02-T-018,432,Sun Xueling,"The more a parent has worked in the 12 months before the birth of the child or eligibility date for an adopted child, the more benefits he or she will be eligible for. Our Leave and Benefits schemes are intended to support bona fide working parents and, therefore, the support granted will differ based on the parents' employment arrangement and economic activity."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00433,2021-08-02-T-018,433,Sun Xueling,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh has also requested for additional data on the various schemes. While having more data-points will bolster our understanding of family needs, as a general principle, MSF does not require information for claims and applications above and beyond what is necessary to determine eligibility and entitlement. This avoids burdening employers and working parents excessively. For instance, household income is not needed to determine the quantum of Baby Bonus benefits, as the scheme does not vary with income. Likewise, we also do not require parents to submit information about the number of children they have when processing claims for Leave and Benefits schemes that do not vary with the birth order. Parents also need not submit information on other grants that they have received."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00434,2021-08-02-T-018,434,Sun Xueling,"In this regard, we seek the Member's understanding that we must balance the need for policy review with making our claim and application processes citizen-centric and efficient."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00435,2021-08-02-T-018,435,Sun Xueling,Mr Saktiandi Supaat requested that the GPPB and GPAB application date of 1 December 2021 be brought forward. I seek the Member's understanding that we require time to make the necessary amendments to subsidiary legislation and to also enhance the IT system to support the schemes.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00436,2021-08-02-T-018,436,Sun Xueling,"Ms Yeo Wan Ling has suggested a review of current schemes to better reflect the principle of shared parental duties, such as through the extension of Working Mother's Child Relief (WMCR) and Grandparent Caregiver Relief (GCR) to fathers. These schemes aim to encourage married women to continue working after childbirth, rather than provide general assistance to families. Families can benefit from other parenthood-related tax benefits, such as Qualifying Child Relief (QCR) and Parenthood Tax Rebate (PTR). She also suggested that exclusive, non-transferrable parental leave be equalised between mothers and fathers."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00437,2021-08-02-T-018,437,Sun Xueling,"Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin stated that more exclusive paternity leave would be a strong signal, so that couples do not have to make tough decisions. Mr Louis Ng has also asked for a phased increase of paternity leave. We know that children benefit from having involved fathers who are committed to their growth and development. Today, fathers can already benefit from a series of leave enhancements made over the years."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00438,2021-08-02-T-018,438,Sun Xueling,"Most recently, in 2017, we made the second week of paternity leave mandatory and shared parental leave was extended from one to four weeks. In total, fathers may take up to eight weeks of leave in the child’s first year, which they can use to spend time with both mother and child."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00439,2021-08-02-T-018,439,Sun Xueling,"Active fatherhood is on the rise. Over the years, paternity leave take-up has increased markedly. In 2013, only 25% of fathers took up paternity leave. In 2019, the proportion has increased to a healthy 55%. The introduction of GPPB is also a recognition of the Government's support for fathers who may be in less conventional working arrangements."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00440,2021-08-02-T-018,440,Sun Xueling,"Despite these improvements, there is still some way to go. I encourage more fathers to take their leave, but in order for fathers to do so, mindsets will have to shift and this can only happen over time."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00441,2021-08-02-T-018,441,Sun Xueling,"One key contributor is whether fathers feel supported in the workplace and I encourage employers to implement more family-friendly practices like flexible working arrangements. I assure Mr Louis Ng that MSF is often in close consultation with our community partners, such as the Families for Life or the Centre for Fathering, which drives the Dads for Life movement to encourage active fathering. MSF takes the building of strong marriages and families seriously. We will continue to push through this effort with our partners."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00442,2021-08-02-T-018,442,Sun Xueling,"Mr Louis Ng and Mr Yip Hon Weng have asked for leave to be extended to couples who suffer miscarriages, as they will need to recover. Mr Louis Ng, in particular, suggested that the Government could extend partial reimbursement to employers who provide leave benefits to couples who have a miscarriage."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00443,2021-08-02-T-018,443,Sun Xueling,"I understand the Members' concern, as miscarriages are unfortunate events. Today, working mothers who need to recuperate after a miscarriage are given medical leave. These working mothers can also use their annual leave and some companies may also offer compassionate leave."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00444,2021-08-02-T-018,444,Sun Xueling,"The Bill takes reference from the Registration of Births and Deaths Act (RBDA) in defining a stillbirth as one occurring after the 28th week of pregnancy. As the Member is aware, the new RBDA was recently passed in Parliament. A stillborn child is now defined to mean a child delivered after the 22nd week of pregnancy. When the new RBDA comes into effect, the CDCA will also take on this interpretation. Parents will become eligible for birth-linked leave and benefits if their child is stillborn after the 22nd week of pregnancy."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00445,2021-08-02-T-018,445,Sun Xueling,"I agree with Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Yip Hon Weng that families require further support as they recover physically and emotionally from the loss of a child, whether through a stillbirth or a miscarriage. We encourage families in need to seek help. Families may also approach Family Service Centres for support on socio-emotional issues."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00446,2021-08-02-T-018,446,Sun Xueling,Assoc Prof Jamus Lim has asked whether shared parental leave could be extended to fathers who have also experienced a stillbirth. I thank the Member for sharing his stories and my heart goes out to him and his family.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00447,2021-08-02-T-018,447,Sun Xueling,I would like to clarify that shared parental leave will be extended to these fathers if their wives have elected to share the leave. They will also be entitled to paternity leave and GPPB.
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00448,2021-08-02-T-018,448,Sun Xueling,"To the Member's query as to whether an adoptive father qualifies for leave and benefits, currently, paternity leave applies to both biological and adoptive fathers. Adoptive fathers will also qualify for the new GPPB scheme."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00449,2021-08-02-T-018,449,Sun Xueling,"Assoc Prof Jamus Lim also suggested that more leave, above and beyond the current maternity leave provisions, could be extended to parents who have stillbirths. Some companies may also offer compassionate leave over and beyond these entitlements."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00450,2021-08-02-T-018,450,Sun Xueling,"Ms Joan Pereira has also called for additional leave for parents with multiple births, as they may face increased caregiving responsibilities. Ms Yeo Wan Ling asked that we consider giving parents full flexibility to share parental leave. While more leave that could be flexibly used could be useful, Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin has rightly pointed out that there are associated costs in implementing family-friendly practices and a practical approach must be taken and we have to be mindful that we do not, inadvertently, affect parents' employability if they are absent from work for an extended period of time."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00451,2021-08-02-T-018,451,Sun Xueling,"Employers face manpower and operational demands and these must be calibrated alongside the need to support working parents. But I would like to reassure Members that I know where they are coming from and I do know that they want to support parents as much as they can. Any increase in leave provisions, however, will have to be considered carefully, especially in periods of business uncertainty."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00452,2021-08-02-T-018,452,Sun Xueling,"I agree with Ms Joan Pereira that flexibility and mutual understanding between employers and employees are key. Flexible workplace arrangements (FWAs), which contribute to a family-friendly work environment are more sustainable and can be tailored to a parent's own needs."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00453,2021-08-02-T-018,453,Sun Xueling,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat suggested that more could be done to reward companies that are pro-family. Today, the Tripartite Standards on FWAs, on Work-Life Harmony and on Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs recognise progressive companies that support their employees, including those with caregiving responsibilities, to manage both their work and personal needs. Employers who adopt these Standards can use the Tripartite Standard (TS) Logo to distinguish themselves as employers of choice. COVID-19 has also helped create momentum for the use of FWAs, as companies realised that FWAs could be implemented effectively and efficiently as we transition into the new normal. We encourage more employers to come on board and the Government will work with the tripartite partners to look into other ways to have FWAs become a norm at workplaces."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00454,2021-08-02-T-018,454,Sun Xueling,"As to the Member's suggestion on introducing grants or funding schemes to employers who have demonstrated their commitment to fostering family-friendly workplaces in Singapore, we thank him for his suggestion and we will review this further."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00455,2021-08-02-T-018,455,Sun Xueling,"Mr Louis Ng has also asked if a public consultation was done for this Bill and to share the reasons why it was not done, given that many could have given constructive feedback to refine the Bill. I would like to share that there was no public consultation with respect to the Bill, specifically, and there are two reasons for this."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00456,2021-08-02-T-018,456,Sun Xueling,"First, the process of consultation is not a one-off event. Many Members today have given their feedback on the various schemes under the purview of the CDCA over the years, both formally and informally. We have also debated vigorously on the merits of various support schemes that families can access. In addition, we have regular touchpoints with parents and employers through our community partners and tripartite partners. I assure the Member that we have always adopted a listening posture and are receptive to feedback. The Bill is, therefore, a culmination of many feedback cycles, instead of a single consultation."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00457,2021-08-02-T-018,457,Sun Xueling,"Second, most will benefit from this round of amendments. This is the result of the Government stepping up to provide additional support that accrues directly to parents and employers."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00458,2021-08-02-T-018,458,Sun Xueling,"Mr Yip Hon Weng raised a question that is close to my heart  how do we measure the success of our efforts to create a Singapore that is Made for Families? Statistics like the take-up rate of various leave schemes, though useful, provide a limited understanding of the daily lives of families and their needs. I can assure the Member that this question preoccupies our minds and, MSF, together with the National Population and Talent Division (NPTD), will strive to continue to keep our ear to the ground. Members may be aware that, as part of the Emerging Stronger Conversations, Minister Indranee Rajah and myself have been leading a series of conversations since April with individuals to better understand their experiences and thoughts on getting married and raising families."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00459,2021-08-02-T-018,459,Sun Xueling,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the current amendments to the Child Development Co-Savings Act are but one step in our endeavour to support marriage and parenthood in Singapore. This is an iterative process and I am heartened by the many views shared by my colleagues; and there are also other ongoing reviews related to the conversations on Singapore Women's Development that the Government is leading and I look forward to sharing more in due course."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00460,2021-08-02-T-018,460,Sun Xueling,"I thank Members for their various suggestions and inputs. The schemes under CDCA, be it the various Leave and Benefits schemes, or CDA, are essential in supporting working parents. However, they do not and should not function in isolation. A tapestry of measures and policies must be woven to ensure that families in Singapore are well-supported in their children's growth and development. This will only be possible with the help of our immediate and extended families, employers and community partners."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00461,2021-08-02-T-018,461,Sun Xueling,"MSF will continue to do our best to ensure that our policies build a better future for Singapore, anchored by strong families. With that, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00462,2021-08-02-T-018,462,Deputy Speaker,"Mr Louis Ng, you have a clarification?"
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00463,2021-08-02-T-018,463,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Thank you, Sir. The Minister of State has shared that we cannot give the cash component of the Baby Bonus to singles or unweds because it is part of the Marriage and Parenthood package, the key word being ""marriage""."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00464,2021-08-02-T-018,464,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"But I just want to point out that the CDA component of the Baby Bonus is also part of the Marriage and Parenthood package, but we do give it to the single unwed parents. So, why can we not just extend the other portion of the Baby Bonus to the single unweds?"
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00465,2021-08-02-T-018,465,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Again, I want to stress, we need to remember our own data shows that single unwed parents under 35 have a median salary of $600. Six hundred dollars for someone caring for a newborn! I think this cash that many of us are pushing for is not a luxury for them. It really is a lifeline and I hope MSF will reconsider this policy."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00466,2021-08-02-T-018,466,Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for his clarification. As I have mentioned, there have been several reviews on our Marriage and Parenthood Packages. The CDA that he mentioned earlier was revised in 2016 to also take into account single unwed parents."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00467,2021-08-02-T-018,467,Sun Xueling,"As I mentioned, there are certain Government policies that encourage parenthood within marriage; the Baby Bonus cash gift is one such benefit. But again, I would like to remind our Members that I have listed a whole series of benefits that have been equalised for children of both unwed as well as wedded parents. So, I hope that we can look at this holistically."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00468,2021-08-02-T-018,468,Sun Xueling,"But again, as I have said, we constantly review our Marriage and Parenthood Packages and will continue to do so."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00469,2021-08-02-T-018,469,Deputy Speaker,"Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, you have a clarification?"
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00470,2021-08-02-T-018,470,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Thank you, Deputy Speaker. And I thank the Minister of State Ms Sun Xueling for the response. I hope that she would be able to clarify  in her explanation about CPF and CDA having different objectives, which she explained at length and, to be clear, I absolutely do not contest, it still remains unanswered why one qualifies for legislative protection of returns but the other does not."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00471,2021-08-02-T-018,471,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Since we are doing clarifications, I should clarify myself that my reference to legislative protections for returns to CPF should not be construed as a ringing endorsement of the scheme."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00472,2021-08-02-T-018,472,Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for his clarification. As I shared in my reply earlier, the CDA's interest rates are determined by banks, that is number one. And number two, different from CPF, for the CDA account, parents can actually withdraw money from it as and when they need it to defray expenses that they need for the upbringing of their children. So, it is more short-term in nature because they can go and withdraw from the CDA bank account to defray those expenses. This is different from the CPF, which is locked in for a longer period of time."
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00473,2021-08-02-T-018,473,Sun Xueling,"[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]"
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00474,2021-08-02-T-018,474,Sun Xueling,[(proc text) Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. (proc text)]
2021-08-02-T-018-S-00475,2021-08-02-T-018,475,Sun Xueling,[(proc text) The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. – [Ms Sun Xueling]. (proc text)]

2021-08-02-T-019-S-00477,2021-08-02-T-019,477,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on behalf of the Minister for Health, I beg to move, ""That the Bill be now read a second time""."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00478,2021-08-02-T-019,478,Koh Poh Koon,"Sir, the practice of dentistry constantly evolves with changes in population demographics as well as advancement in technology and materials associated with dental treatment. With Singapore having one of the world's fastest ageing populations, one of its challenges is ensuring that the needs of a growing ageing population, including dental care needs, are well provided for."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00479,2021-08-02-T-019,479,Koh Poh Koon,"The Singapore Dental Council (SDC) ensures that there is a steady supply of dentists each year to meet the expected demand for dental services. In addition to local graduates from the Faculty of Dentistry of the National University of Singapore, the SDC also registers dental graduates from foreign universities."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00480,2021-08-02-T-019,480,Koh Poh Koon,"The proportion of foreign-trained dentists in Singapore has risen steadily from 20%, or about 302 out of 1,484 dentists in 2008, to 36%, or 900 out of 2,475 dentists in 2019. Against this backdrop, SDC undertook a review of the process for foreign-trained dental graduates to practise in Singapore, to ensure that they meet the same high competency standards as locally trained dental graduates."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00481,2021-08-02-T-019,481,Koh Poh Koon,"SDC assessed that two measures are needed to achieve this objective. First, the Dental Registration Act (DRA) will be amended by this Bill to require that foreign-trained dental graduates must pass a qualifying examination to be eligible for conditional registration; and second, the DRA Schedule will be revised to list the foreign universities whose dental degree holders are automatically eligible to take the qualifying examination."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00482,2021-08-02-T-019,482,Koh Poh Koon,"This Bill gives effect to the first measure, relating to the qualifying examination, which I will explain in more detail now. The second measure, which I will touch on briefly later, will be affected by way of subsidiary legislation."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00483,2021-08-02-T-019,483,Koh Poh Koon,"Under the current DRA, dental graduates from foreign universities looking to practise in Singapore will, typically, have to apply for conditional registration first. This means that they have to complete a period of supervised work, usually around two years, and be assessed to be competent, before they can apply to be fully registered dentists."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00484,2021-08-02-T-019,484,Koh Poh Koon,"For the purposes of an application for conditional registration, the SDC recognises dental degrees from universities in Australia, Canada, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, which are listed in the Schedule of the DRA. If an applicant has a degree in dentistry from a foreign university listed in the Schedule and also meets the other prevailing criteria for conditional registration, the SDC may grant the applicant conditional registration."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00485,2021-08-02-T-019,485,Koh Poh Koon,These criteria do not currently include a requirement to pass a qualifying examination.
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00486,2021-08-02-T-019,486,Koh Poh Koon,"The SDC may also grant conditional registration to applicants who have degrees in dentistry from other foreign universities that are not listed in the Schedule. The SDC evaluates such applications on a case-by-case basis and may require that such applicants pass an examination, to ascertain that they have the minimum skills and knowledge to practise and treat patients safely and competently in our local context."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00487,2021-08-02-T-019,487,Koh Poh Koon,Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 14A of the DRA to introduce a requirement that foreign-trained dental graduates must take and pass a qualifying examination to be eligible for conditional registration.
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00488,2021-08-02-T-019,488,Koh Poh Koon,"This qualifying examination, which is currently already taken by foreign-trained dental graduates who do not have dentistry degrees in the Schedule, is administered by the NUS Faculty of Dentistry and overseen by SDC. It assesses a dental graduate’s clinical knowledge and procedural skills which are fundamental to the practice of dentistry. This is similar in scope and benchmarked to the standards of the final-year examination of the NUS Faculty of Dentistry."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00489,2021-08-02-T-019,489,Koh Poh Koon,"Section 14A, when amended, will make it a requirement for foreign dental graduates, regardless of whether their qualifications are contained in the DRA Schedule, to pass a qualifying examination to be eligible for conditional registration."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00490,2021-08-02-T-019,490,Koh Poh Koon,Foreign graduates who have a degree in dentistry listed in the DRA Schedule will automatically be eligible to take the qualifying examination.
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00491,2021-08-02-T-019,491,Koh Poh Koon,"Those not listed in the DRA Schedule are not automatically eligible to take the qualifying examination, but the SDC may permit them to do so on a case-by-case basis if the circumstances set out in section 14A(2) apply. The treatment of foreign graduates with degrees in dentistry not listed in the DRA Schedule will not be so different from that under the current DRA in that they already have to pass an examination to be eligible for conditional registration."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00492,2021-08-02-T-019,492,Koh Poh Koon,"This amendment will ensure that the competency standards of foreign dental graduates who are granted conditional registration in Singapore, whether or not their degrees are listed in the DRA Schedule, are aligned with those of dental graduates who have a Singapore degree, which means someone who has obtained a degree in dentistry from NUS."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00493,2021-08-02-T-019,493,Koh Poh Koon,"This new requirement of a qualifying examination will also ensure that foreign dental graduates are familiar with the requirements for clinical practice here in Singapore. For example, the local dental curriculum has, in recent times, sharpened its focus on core clinical general dentistry skills and more emphasis has been placed on geriatric dentistry, considering the trends in Singapore’s demographics."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00494,2021-08-02-T-019,494,Koh Poh Koon,"Under the current DRA, any foreign dental graduate with a degree listed in the Schedule is entitled to be registered as a dentist with conditional registration, if he has secured employment with a local dental practice. With the proposed amendment, the qualifying examination will be applicable to graduates with degrees listed in the Schedule as well."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00495,2021-08-02-T-019,495,Koh Poh Koon,"To be clear, there is no change to the regime for dental graduates with a Singapore degree. They continue to be eligible to apply for full registration directly. There is no requirement of a qualifying examination for locally trained dental graduates."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00496,2021-08-02-T-019,496,Koh Poh Koon,I now move on to the second measure which we will be implementing to ensure the continued quality of foreign-trained dental graduates who practise in Singapore.
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00497,2021-08-02-T-019,497,Koh Poh Koon,"This will be a revision of the DRA Schedule, which contains the list of foreign degrees in dentistry that are recognised by the Singapore Dental Council (SDC) for the purposes of conditional registration. This list is curated based on a review of dentistry degrees from foreign universities which the SDC deems prima facie to meet the standards for practice in Singapore, subject to the individual dental graduate’s proof of his skills, knowledge and competencies through the qualifying examination."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00498,2021-08-02-T-019,498,Koh Poh Koon,"As mentioned earlier, foreign dental graduates who have a degree listed in the DRA Schedule will automatically be eligible to take the qualifying examination, unlike the foreign graduates with degrees not listed in the Schedule. Alongside these amendments introduced by the Bill, we will be revising the Schedule to ensure that the list continues to reflect degrees in dentistry from foreign universities that give their holders this automatic eligibility to take the qualifying examination. The last revision of the Schedule was in 2008 and a review is timely to ensure the continued quality of foreign-trained dental graduates who practise as dentists in Singapore."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00499,2021-08-02-T-019,499,Koh Poh Koon,This revision will be done by way of subsidiary legislation and is actually not part of the Bill per se. But I have highlighted this as it complements the introduction of the mandatory qualifying examination that foreign-trained dental graduates must pass to be eligible for conditional registration.
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00500,2021-08-02-T-019,500,Koh Poh Koon,"There will be a transitional period after the revision of the Schedule, where qualifications in the current Schedule will continue to be recognised and, their holders, as well as students who are already enrolled or have secured places in courses leading to such qualifications, may apply for conditional registration under the DRA."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00501,2021-08-02-T-019,501,Koh Poh Koon,"The Bill also makes a number of miscellaneous amendments, which are to provide for payment of penalties and composition sums into the Consolidated Fund, as well as for better administration of the Act."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00502,2021-08-02-T-019,502,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Deputy Speaker, this Bill will ensure the continued quality of foreign-trained dental graduates and that their clinical skills and competencies are aligned with those of locally trained dental graduates, so that they can effectively meet the dental needs of our population."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00503,2021-08-02-T-019,503,Koh Poh Koon,"Once passed, MOH and SDC will work closely with the dental community and other stakeholders to implement and operationalise these requirements. At present, the introduction of the requirement for the qualifying examination is planned for 1 January 2029. In the coming months, SDC will engage dental students who will be affected by these changes, to ensure that they understand the new requirements and to address any concerns that they may have. I seek Members’ support for this Bill. Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00504,2021-08-02-T-019,504,Koh Poh Koon,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00505,2021-08-02-T-019,505,Deputy Speaker,Mr Louis Ng.
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00506,2021-08-02-T-019,506,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, we are facing a supply crunch in dental care. It has become necessary for Singapore to open its doors to graduates with foreign degrees in dentistry to supplement our locally trained dentists."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00507,2021-08-02-T-019,507,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"As early as 2017, the Ministry recognised that there were not enough locally trained dentists to handle all the demands for dental care and set the goal of achieving a ratio of one dentist to 2,200 people. In doing so, it is also important to ensure that there is some standardisation in the dentistry care that is provided in the industry."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00508,2021-08-02-T-019,508,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,This Bill helps to ensure that we strike the right balance between opening our doors and ensuring consistency in the profession.
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00509,2021-08-02-T-019,509,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,I have three points of clarification.
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00510,2021-08-02-T-019,510,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"My first point is on the implementation of the qualifying examination for foreign degree holders. Currently, SDC already administers a qualifying examination for graduates with foreign dentistry degrees from universities not specified in the Schedule to the Dentistry Act. The amendment to section 14A will expand this requirement to all graduates with foreign dentistry degrees, whether specified in the Schedule or not."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00511,2021-08-02-T-019,511,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"The SDC’s website states that an applicant only has two attempts at the qualifying examination which must be taken within 12 months of each other. The feedback from the ground is that the qualifying examination is very stringent and the failure rates are fairly high. I agree that we should set the bar high for the profession. The fact that we have several graduates who are failing the qualifying examination is not a reason to lower the bar. However, we should consider giving more time. With more time to practise and study, with more opportunities to attempt the examination, many dentistry graduates may, eventually, qualify and help alleviate the supply crunch facing the industry."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00512,2021-08-02-T-019,512,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Can the Minister share if the Ministry is considering increasing the number of attempts allowed at the qualifying examination? Can the Minister also share if the Ministry is considering increasing the duration of 12 months between attempts, even as a temporary measure, considering the present circumstances of the pandemic? In addition, can the Minister share whether there are plans to provide increased support or training programmes for those who are struggling to pass this examination?"
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00513,2021-08-02-T-019,513,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Dentistry is an extremely specialised degree and these graduates have spent many years applying themselves to it. It would be a shame to end their aspirations after just two attempts at the qualifying examination, especially when it is always possible to improve."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00514,2021-08-02-T-019,514,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"My second point is on the alternative careers for Singaporean graduates with foreign dentistry degrees. While there is likely to always be a proportion of graduates who are not able to pass the qualifying examination, this group of graduates may, nonetheless, possess some meaningful skills from their years of higher education."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00515,2021-08-02-T-019,515,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Can MOH share if there are alternative pathways within the dentistry industry where we can channel this group of graduates into, so that these graduates can, nonetheless, pursue a career in this industry and help, again, to reduce our supply crunch?"
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00516,2021-08-02-T-019,516,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"My final point is on the present status of the dentistry industry. It is apparent from the 2019 Dental Association survey that we are some distance from easing the supply crunch. Can the Minister share more details about its progress in meeting the goal of the ratio of one dentist to 2,200 people? How effective has the measures adopted since 2017 been in easing the supply crunch? Are there plans to further increase the local intake of dentistry students to meet the population’s dentistry care needs?"
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00517,2021-08-02-T-019,517,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, notwithstanding the above clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00518,2021-08-02-T-019,518,Deputy Speaker,Dr Shahira Abdullah.
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00519,2021-08-02-T-019,519,Shahira Abdullah,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I start by declaring my interest as a locally trained dentist in a public hospital."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00520,2021-08-02-T-019,520,Shahira Abdullah,"For my speech, I will focus on the proposal to register all graduates who hold a foreign degree in dentistry, to pass a qualifying examination before they are granted conditional registration to practise as dentists in Singapore."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00521,2021-08-02-T-019,521,Shahira Abdullah,"Firstly, I would like to say that I believe this is long overdue. Having the qualifying examinations ensures that the competencies of foreign graduates are aligned with the competencies of graduates holding a Singapore degree in dentistry. This protects the public by ensuring that only dentists who are adequately trained and qualified are eligible to start practising under conditional registration. This is already present in most other overseas jurisdictions and, with this, Singapore is actually aligning itself with the rest of the world."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00522,2021-08-02-T-019,522,Shahira Abdullah,"Secondly, though I welcome this proposal, I do have some concerns regarding the implementation timing. At this juncture, there are many young students who are already enrolled in overseas universities who are part of the Schedule. They did so, particularly aiming for these universities, so they would not need to take the qualifying examinations. Therefore, I believe it is only fair to carry out these policies prospectively, giving them a few years, taking into account students who have already been accepted into these universities or who are unable to start the degree programme yet due to circumstances, such as National Service."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00523,2021-08-02-T-019,523,Shahira Abdullah,"Thirdly, I do have some queries regarding section 14A which states that “any person who does not hold a Singapore degree or a degree from a specified university may also sit for the qualifying exam if the degree the person holds is, in the opinion of the Council, not lower in standing than the specified degrees.” May I know if the Council will be having a set of objective criteria to determining the quality of these foreign degrees?"
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00524,2021-08-02-T-019,524,Shahira Abdullah,"I am, however, glad that the Ministry said that it is going to review the Schedule and adding universities or deleting universities from the Schedule, because I believe it will have more clarity for the students who are involved. For example, in my work with youths, I have encountered families who have decided to send their children to study in non-accredited universities just to help them realise their children's dreams. This kind of clarity will allow such families to make more informed decisions when preparing for entrance examinations before university."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00525,2021-08-02-T-019,525,Shahira Abdullah,"Similarly, in subsection (b), clarity will also be beneficial in how the Council determines if a person has “a standing that is not lower than that of a local practitioner”. This is because the assessment has to be made before they are permitted to even take the qualifying examinations, which aim to peg their skills to the skills of a local practitioner."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00526,2021-08-02-T-019,526,Shahira Abdullah,"Fourthly, I would also like to clarify what sort of circumstances MOH is envisaging would be of public interest to allow a graduate to sit or not sit for the qualifying examination."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00527,2021-08-02-T-019,527,Shahira Abdullah,"Lastly, on the basis of the qualifying examination, it is based on the final examinations and competencies criteria of the dental graduates in Singapore. I think this is a fair benchmark to aim for."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00528,2021-08-02-T-019,528,Shahira Abdullah,"However, there will be instances in which these young Singaporean graduates with foreign degrees may fail this examination and this may be due to a variety of reasons. For example, as an orthodontist and dentist myself, I have learnt that certain dental principles have to be applied to the local context. Dental graduates from foreign universities may not be so well-versed in, for example, the Singapore public health aspects, or that a Caucasian face would need a different treatment plan, as compared to the Asian face, or the fact that the range of common diseases changes from country to country, which means their experience and skills may differ accordingly."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00529,2021-08-02-T-019,529,Shahira Abdullah,"The current guidelines dictate that the qualifying examination may be taken a maximum of two times. May I suggest increasing this but within reasonable limits, especially for the Singaporean graduates who have invested significantly in their dental education."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00530,2021-08-02-T-019,530,Shahira Abdullah,"The serious implication that we must take into account is that after failing these qualifying examinations, the young graduate is, practically, unable to practise dentistry in Singapore. They are forced to look for alternative career pathways and maybe not even practise dentistry at all."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00531,2021-08-02-T-019,531,Shahira Abdullah,"Another situation I feel we should think about is the fate of the young graduates with foreign degrees who come from families which are not so well-off. They are not able to work while doing the qualifying examination, which takes about a year to complete. If they fail, this may extend to another year, which may have a big impact on the family’s finances."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00532,2021-08-02-T-019,532,Shahira Abdullah,"A suggestion I have is to provide some sort of scaffolding for these young dental graduates who may need help in retuning their skills to the local context. This can be in the form of short optional courses they can apply for, which the Dental Council can conduct. These young graduates are, essentially, our next generation of dentists and we should give them the support they need so that we do not lose our talents, especially as we aim to raise the standard of dentistry in Singapore."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00533,2021-08-02-T-019,533,Shahira Abdullah,"Before I end, I would also like to wish a Happy Nurses’ Day to all the nurses who are such an integral part of the healthcare system, for their hard work, dedication, contributions and sacrifice, especially during this COVID-19 pandemic. Thank you!"
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00534,2021-08-02-T-019,534,Shahira Abdullah,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding those questions, I support the Bill."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00535,2021-08-02-T-019,535,Deputy Speaker,Mr Ang Wei Neng.
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00536,2021-08-02-T-019,536,Ang Wei Neng,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Dental Registration (Amendment) Bill will require the increasing proportion of foreign-trained dentists in Singapore to be subjected to the mandatory Qualifying Examinations. This is to ensure that their competency and standards are aligned with those of local dental graduates."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00537,2021-08-02-T-019,537,Ang Wei Neng,I support the amendment Bill. Quality dental care is something which all Singaporeans will benefit from.
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00538,2021-08-02-T-019,538,Ang Wei Neng,"However, I want to take a step back to question the current system of training dentists and the target dentist-to-population ratio. It appears to me that we are introducing these amendments because we do not have enough Singapore-trained dentists and we want to make sure that those who studied dentistry overseas are of a good standard."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00539,2021-08-02-T-019,539,Ang Wei Neng,"Why do we not train more dentists in Singapore? Back in 2017, a Straits Times article had already pointed out that Singapore was not training enough dentists to meet the needs of a growing and ageing population. The proportion of foreign-trained dentists in Singapore had risen significantly from 20% in 2008 to 36% in 2019. In 2019, 900 out of a total of 2,475 dentists were foreign-trained. I also understand that many of those who have obtained their dentistry degree overseas are Singaporeans and PRs."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00540,2021-08-02-T-019,540,Ang Wei Neng,"This is not surprising as the Faculty of Dentistry at the National University of Singapore only has a small intake of 44 students in 2008, although it has increased to 80 this year. Even then, many Singaporeans who have very good grades, many with perfect university admission score of 90 points, cannot get into dentistry. As a result, many of the rejected aspiring dentistry students have to ask their families to fork out a fortune for them to pursue a dentistry degree overseas."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00541,2021-08-02-T-019,541,Ang Wei Neng,"Thus, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State if MOH can consider increasing the capacity of the dentistry course at NUS. If NUS has no capacity, can we consider opening up another dental school in say, NTU, to meet the aspiration of Singaporeans and solve the insufficient supply of dentists in Singapore? Or is there an intention to restrict the numbers of locally-trained dentists?"
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00542,2021-08-02-T-019,542,Ang Wei Neng,"Ultimately, how many local and overseas trained dentists we need is contingent on the target dentist-to-population ratio. I understand MOH’s target ratio is one dentist to 2,200 people. Is that enough?"
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00543,2021-08-02-T-019,543,Ang Wei Neng,"Currently, our dentist to population ratio is one is to 2,304, an improvement from one is to 3,215 in 2010. The question is  how do we derive the target of one dentist to 2,200 people?"
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00544,2021-08-02-T-019,544,Ang Wei Neng,"Comparing to other countries’ dentist-to-population ratios, South Korea’s was one is to 2,000 in 2018; United States was one to 1,638 in 2020; Israel's was one is to 1,400 in 2017; Japan's was one is to 1,250 in 2014. So, is Singapore’s target of one is to 2,200 too conservative a figure?"
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00545,2021-08-02-T-019,545,Ang Wei Neng,"Today, MOH recommends we consult a dentist twice a year. How many Singaporeans really consult a dentist every six months? Many Singaporeans that I know of do not. Why? The cost of scaling and checking your teeth by a dentist in an HDB estate will easily set you back by more than $100 and it is not mandatory for companies to provide dental benefits."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00546,2021-08-02-T-019,546,Ang Wei Neng,"If you want to save some money and consult a dentist at a polyclinic, it will cost you about $30 to $50 but you have to wait for months before you can make an appointment to see the dentist in the polyclinic. Why is this so? Is it because MOH does not consider oral health as basic healthcare? Or is it a way to suppress the need to increase the dentist-to-population ratio?"
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00547,2021-08-02-T-019,547,Ang Wei Neng,"Meanwhile, we understand that blue Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS), Merdeka and Pioneer Generation cardholders receive subsidies when they visit private dentists for routine check-ups. To make oral care more affordable, I would like to appeal to MOH to extend the subsidies to orange and green CHAS cardholders. At the same time, I would like to appeal to MOM to make it compulsory for all companies to provide workers with dental benefits in Singapore. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in Mandarin, please."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00548,2021-08-02-T-019,548,Ang Wei Neng,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] MOH has advised Singaporeans to see a dentist twice a year. However, it is expensive to see a dentist. It would cost over $100 even if you have your teeth cleaned at a neighbourhood dental clinic. If you want to save money by going to a polyclinic, you will have to wait a few months before you can see a dentist."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00549,2021-08-02-T-019,549,Ang Wei Neng,"Fortunately, blue CHAS cardholders, Merdeka and Pioneer Generation Singaporeans can enjoy subsidies when they go to private dental clinics. However, green and orange CHAS cardholders do not get subsidies. Moreover, most employers do not give dental benefits to their employees. In other words, most Singaporeans only wait until they have a toothache before they see a dentist. This is not good. Hence, I suggest that MOH consider giving dental subsidies to green and orange CHAS cardholders. I also hope that MOM will also make it compulsory for employers to give dental benefits to their employees so that most Singaporeans can visit a dentist regularly and have affordable dental care."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00550,2021-08-02-T-019,550,Ang Wei Neng,"If Singaporeans can afford seeing a dentist, there would be a corresponding increase in the demand for dentists. Are the current 2,475 dentists sufficient to meet the demand of Singaporeans? At the same time, we have to take into account the fact that an ageing population would have increased demand for dentists."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00551,2021-08-02-T-019,551,Ang Wei Neng,"If there is a shortage of dentists in the short term, we will need to recruit a large number of foreign graduates to make up for the shortage of local dentists. The Dental Registration (Amendment) Bill will make it compulsory for foreign graduates to pass the local dental examinations to ensure that their skills are comparable to those of local graduates. I, therefore, support the Dental Registration (Amendment) Bill."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00552,2021-08-02-T-019,552,Ang Wei Neng,"In the long run, NUS should consider increasing the number of dental students. The current number of 80 per year does not meet the demand of Singaporeans for dentists, much less the large number of students who apply for dentistry every year. As a result, many outstanding students have to pay high tuition fees to study dentistry abroad."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00553,2021-08-02-T-019,553,Ang Wei Neng,"(In English)  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we hope that MOH could revamp the dentistry industry in Singapore and provide more subsidies for dental care. Otherwise, Singaporeans who opt to see a dentist at the polyclinic have to ""dan gu gu"" or ""wait long long"". If you cannot wait and have to see a private dentist, then you have to pay ""high high"", and this is not ideal."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00554,2021-08-02-T-019,554,Deputy Speaker,Mr Yip Hon Weng.
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00555,2021-08-02-T-019,555,Yip Hon Weng,"Mr Deputy Speaker, dental health is important, as oral diseases affect people throughout their lifetime. Although these diseases are less likely to cause death, they can pose significant morbidity."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00556,2021-08-02-T-019,556,Yip Hon Weng,"We need more dentists to meet Singapore’s oral health needs, especially in the public sector. Indeed, with an ageing population, the demand for dental services are not only increasing, but also changing due to more complex dental needs of elderly patients. I see many seniors in my constituency who require dental care. For example, a resident, Mr Tan, told me that he had never visited a dentist in his life. It was only after participating in Project Silver Screen and seeking dental care at a mobile dental clinic deployed at Yio Chu Kang CC that he discovered that he needed dental implants."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00557,2021-08-02-T-019,557,Yip Hon Weng,"Indeed, the importance of dental care rises in old age. Cultivating good oral hygiene habits reduces the chances of dental and other health issues in the future."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00558,2021-08-02-T-019,558,Yip Hon Weng,"Among advanced economies, the top three countries with the largest ratio of dentists per 10,000 population are Sweden, Norway and Spain, based on the latest data available in 2018. Sweden's ratio of dentists per 10,000 population stands at 17.9, Norway’s is 8.7 and Spain's is 8.1. In Singapore, there were about 4.1 dentists per 10,000 residents. The discrepancy is significant. So, we need to up our number of dentists in Singapore."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00559,2021-08-02-T-019,559,Yip Hon Weng,"Mr Deputy Speaker, there are many Singaporeans who want to do dentistry. However, enrolment is very competitive, because the spaces in NUS are limited. Every year, there are between 50 and 60 dentistry graduates from NUS. From there, some stay in general dentistry or specialise. These range from orthodontics, prosthodontics, paediatric dentistry and so on. Hence, the training of aspiring dentists is not just a four-year programme. Many who cannot get enrolled into NUS have gone overseas to pursue their studies."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00560,2021-08-02-T-019,560,Yip Hon Weng,I have two suggestions.
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00561,2021-08-02-T-019,561,Yip Hon Weng,"First, Mr Deputy Speaker, we need to better align the professional qualifications for our dentists. It is important to have more competent and well-trained dentists in Singapore. However, we should ensure that there is alignment in accrediting and consistency in our dentists’ professional skills. This is because they may come from a variety of foreign universities."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00562,2021-08-02-T-019,562,Yip Hon Weng,"Nevertheless, why is it that while their universities are listed in the approved Schedule, yet there is now a move requiring graduates from these universities to take a qualifying exam (QE) when there was none previously from the many years before? Has there been a change in the quality of graduates from some of the universities? The amendments to the Dental Registration Bill make the QE mandatory for all foreign-trained dental graduates with qualifications in the Schedule as well. Can the Minister clarify why the Ministry does not just refine the list of approved universities in the Schedule, to remove the universities that do not produce graduates on par with local graduates, instead of imposing a QE?"
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00563,2021-08-02-T-019,563,Yip Hon Weng,"Similarly, what is the timeline for the implementation of this QE? Will the current students who have already been enrolled in these foreign universities be made to undergo a QE when they choose to return to Singapore to practise? There may be some anxieties that existing Singaporean dentistry students in overseas universities will be affected."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00564,2021-08-02-T-019,564,Yip Hon Weng,"Second, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Government should consider opening up the intake for dentistry in Singapore without compromising the enrolment standards. We only have one dental school in Singapore, in NUS. On the other hand, we have three medical schools in Singapore  the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, the Duke-NUS Medical School and the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine at NTU. Can we attract more foreign specialised universities to set up dental schools together with our universities? Is it possible for NUS to increase its intake? In this way, many of the students need not go overseas for their training. This would, in a way, reduce the number of returning overseas dental graduates."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00565,2021-08-02-T-019,565,Yip Hon Weng,"In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, I appreciate that the overall aim is to get more dentists to practise in Singapore and, at the same time, uphold the quality of practitioners. We all know dentistry is more than just extracting a tooth or doing an implant. Dentists are essential in maintaining oral health in our population, especially for our seniors. Moreover, good oral health can make a difference. It allows one to eat well, speak well and age well. Last but not least, it keeps that smile going. Sir, I support the Bill."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00566,2021-08-02-T-019,566,Deputy Speaker,Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon.
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00567,2021-08-02-T-019,567,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Members who have spoken for their support of this Bill. I will address the queries that they have raised in their speeches."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00568,2021-08-02-T-019,568,Koh Poh Koon,"In my opening speech, I outlined the need for a steady supply of dentists each year to meet the expected demand for dental services by Singaporeans."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00569,2021-08-02-T-019,569,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Yip Hon Weng expressed concern that we need to increase our number of dentists in Singapore. Singapore, indeed, has a lower ratio of dental professionals per capita, as compared to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00570,2021-08-02-T-019,570,Koh Poh Koon,"Hence, the DRA Schedule was revised comprehensively in 2008 to allow for the registration of a wider range of foreign dental qualifications. The dental workforce has experienced a 3% to 5% year-on-year growth since then."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00571,2021-08-02-T-019,571,Koh Poh Koon,"Let me now come to the issue of the present status of the dental workforce raised by Mr Ang Wei Neng, Mr Louis Ng and Mr Yip Hon Weng."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00572,2021-08-02-T-019,572,Koh Poh Koon,"To ensure adequate supply and continuity of dental care for Singaporeans, we have also increased our dental training pipeline to meet the growing dental care needs of our ageing population and to ensure a target ratio of one dentist to 2,200 people or 0.45 dentist per1,000 population by 2030."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00573,2021-08-02-T-019,573,Koh Poh Koon,"The student intake into the NUS Faculty of Dentistry has, historically, been derived based on targeted dentist-to-population ratios."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00574,2021-08-02-T-019,574,Koh Poh Koon,"Predicting how many dentists we will need in the future is actually not a very easy task. There are factors to consider, including population demographics that evolves over time, the different dental awareness amongst the population and also the health-seeking behaviour of our people."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00575,2021-08-02-T-019,575,Koh Poh Koon,"Singapore currently, has 0.84 visits to the dentist per capita per year. This is low, compared to the average of 1.3 in the OECD nations."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00576,2021-08-02-T-019,576,Koh Poh Koon,"We project an increase to one visit to the dentist per capita per year by 2030 and, with that, we will require a ratio of one dentist to 2,200 population by 2030. The annual intake into the NUS Faculty of Dentistry has increased by 36% from 44 in 2008, to 60 in 2018. Based on our service planning parameters, with the increased dental student intake of 80 this year, we expect to be on track to reach a target dentist-to-population ratio of one to 2,200 by 2030. And we will, of course, continue to look at the evolving needs and to adjust the NUS Faculty intake where necessary."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00577,2021-08-02-T-019,577,Koh Poh Koon,"As pointed out by Mr Yip Hon Weng, it is important to have competent and well-trained dentists in Singapore. I could not agree more. All of us who ever see a dentist will want the dentist to be competent."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00578,2021-08-02-T-019,578,Koh Poh Koon,"Currently, foreign-trained dentists who have graduated from the universities on the DRA Schedule can apply to register to practise in Singapore, if they fulfil the requirement to secure employment with a dental clinic or a healthcare institution, which is largely driven by market forces. This employment requirement will still be applicable when the new measures come into force."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00579,2021-08-02-T-019,579,Koh Poh Koon,"Given the high degree of variability in overseas clinical practices and the dental curriculum of overseas universities, based either on the DRA Schedule or otherwise, the qualifying examination is, therefore, an important assessment to determine the clinical skills and competencies of a dentist, which are fundamental to the practice of dentistry and thus would ensure that the quality and competencies of foreign-trained dental graduates who are eligible to register and practise in Singapore remain high."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00580,2021-08-02-T-019,580,Koh Poh Koon,"The qualifying examination, which is administered by the NUS Faculty of Dentistry, is benchmarked to the final-year professional dental examination that locally-trained dentists are required to pass before they can obtain their Bachelor of Dental Surgery degree from NUS. As such, the qualifying examination should be required for foreign-trained dentists applying for conditional registration, irrespective of their nationality."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00581,2021-08-02-T-019,581,Koh Poh Koon,I turn now to address Dr Shahira Abdullah's and Mr Louis Ng's queries on the number of attempts allowed for the qualifying examination.
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00582,2021-08-02-T-019,582,Koh Poh Koon,"To recap, the qualifying examination comprises three parts and the candidates will be provided with the qualifying examination syllabus and related preparatory materials."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00583,2021-08-02-T-019,583,Koh Poh Koon,"For foreign-trained Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who pursue dental qualifications found in the DRA Schedule and wish to practise in Singapore, there will be no cap on the number of attempts to pass each part of the qualifying examination."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00584,2021-08-02-T-019,584,Koh Poh Koon,"For other foreign-trained dentists who pursue dental qualifications found in the DRA Schedule and who wish to practise in Singapore, there will be a cap of two attempts to pass each part of the QE, with each second attempt having to be within 12 months of the first attempt. This has been the practice currently and there will be no change to this. Historically, in the final Bachelor of Dental Surgery degree examination here in NUS, over 90% of local students passed on their first attempt and close to 100% passed by the second attempt."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00585,2021-08-02-T-019,585,Koh Poh Koon,"Hence, a two-attempt cap for non-residents, which is the current practice, is a reasonable benchmark for ensuring the standards of those taking the qualifying examination is on par with our local graduates."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00586,2021-08-02-T-019,586,Koh Poh Koon,"For foreign-trained dentists, irrespective of nationality, who pursue dental qualifications not found in the DRA Schedule and wish to practise in Singapore, SDC will review their applications on a case-by-case basis and allow dentists of good repute who meet the requirements to take the qualifying examination to assess their competency to practise in the local context."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00587,2021-08-02-T-019,587,Koh Poh Koon,"Dr Shahira Abdullah asked how SDC assesses the eligibility of foreign-trained dentists who do not hold a Singapore degree or a degree from a university specified in the DRA Schedule, to sit for the qualifying examination."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00588,2021-08-02-T-019,588,Koh Poh Koon,"As stated in the DRA, this is left to SDC's discretion. SDC has, generally, allowed foreign-trained dentists to take the qualifying examination so long as the university from which they attained their basic dental degree is recognised by the respective dental regulatory body of the country. The teaching medium is in English, failing which, the dentist must take and pass an English Language proficiency test. And thirdly, if they meet other requirements, like having an offer of employment and whether the foreign-trained dentist has a connection to Singapore, such as being a Singaporean/Permanent Resident (PR) or married to a Singaporean/PR or children of PRs, for example, as published on SDC's website."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00589,2021-08-02-T-019,589,Koh Poh Koon,Mr Yip Hon Weng was concerned about the timeline for the implementation of the qualifying examination requirement as this may affect existing overseas Singaporean dentistry students.
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00590,2021-08-02-T-019,590,Koh Poh Koon,"I think it is a fair concern. But I want to reassure Members that there will be a transition period of seven years whereby foreign-trained dentists will still be able to apply for conditional registration under the existing regime under the current DRA, as the implementation of the qualifying examination is intended to only be effective from 1 January 2029. This means that students who are currently enrolled in or have secured places in dentistry courses overseas and will graduate before 1 January 2029, as well as foreign-trained dental graduates who already hold basic dental qualifications from universities on the DRA Schedule will not be affected by this change and will be considered for conditional registration to practise dentistry in Singapore if they fulfil the requirements under the current DRA."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00591,2021-08-02-T-019,591,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Yip Hong Weng has asked for clarification on why the Ministry does not just refine the current DRA Schedule by removing universities that do not produce graduates on par with local graduates, instead of imposing this qualifying examination."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00592,2021-08-02-T-019,592,Koh Poh Koon,"In relation to the DRA Schedule, the SDC has reviewed local and overseas practices to assess the clinical competence and eligibility of a dentist for registration."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00593,2021-08-02-T-019,593,Koh Poh Koon,"Jurisdictions, such as Canada, Hong Kong SAR and Thailand have adopted a national examination regime for foreign-trained dentists. Countries, such as Norway and Germany, use a Schedule of schools with exemptions on a case-by-case basis for non-citizens. Countries, such as Denmark, Ireland, Sweden, United Kingdom, United States of America, Australia and New Zealand have adopted a hybrid of Schedule and national examination, based on citizenship, location of dental training or licence. And as Dr Shahira Abdullah has pointed out, the QE is, in fact, present in many overseas jurisdictions and, with these amendments, Singapore would be in alignment with the rest of the world."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00594,2021-08-02-T-019,594,Koh Poh Koon,"Additionally, SDC has reviewed the international rankings of the 89 universities in the DRA Schedule."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00595,2021-08-02-T-019,595,Koh Poh Koon,"Most of the top-ranked schools in the latest international rankings, which are primarily based on academic/employer reputation and research citations, are not in the DRA Schedule. Together with the variation in dental practices and training across overseas universities, international rankings would, therefore, be less relevant for the purpose of removing universities that may not produce foreign dental graduates on par with local graduates."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00596,2021-08-02-T-019,596,Koh Poh Koon,"Given that the majority of our foreign-trained dentists have graduated from a selected number of foreign dental schools, SDC will curate a more concise list of recognised basic dental qualifications to ensure the relevance of the Schedule. We will remove 27 schools that SDC has not received any registration over the past 12 years. The list of overseas dental schools and universities in the Schedule will be reduced from the current 89 to 62.  SDC will make available the revised Schedule by end 2021."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00597,2021-08-02-T-019,597,Koh Poh Koon,"Sir, I would like to conclude by addressing Mr Ang Wei Neng's query on making dental services affordable, especially for our ageing population."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00598,2021-08-02-T-019,598,Koh Poh Koon,"I must clarify that, in contrast to what Mr Ang Wei Neng has said earlier, MOH actually has no guidance for a twice-a-year visit to a dentist. In fact, we are already moving to a risk-based approach, which is what is practised in the UK as well. For example, those who are deemed to have low dental risks actually may only need to see the dentist once every two years. So, this is more of a risk-based approach. And in the context of our local practice, we also have upstream basic care given to students in the schools. So, it is to be seen in the context of a holistic dental care ecosystem and not just at the primary care level, when the person has become an adult."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00599,2021-08-02-T-019,599,Koh Poh Koon,"MOH monitors and reviews primary care dental capacity provided by private CHAS dental clinics and public polyclinics, both of which provide subsidised dental services. There are, currently, over 800 CHAS dental clinics islandwide."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00600,2021-08-02-T-019,600,Koh Poh Koon,"Pioneer Generation, Merdeka Generation, as well as Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) Blue and Orange card holders, enjoy subsidies for selected basic dental services at private CHAS dental clinics. Singaporeans can also look forward to dental services in the upcoming polyclinics, such as Bukit Panjang and Eunos Polyclinic, which are scheduled to open this year."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00601,2021-08-02-T-019,601,Koh Poh Koon,"Sir, I would like to assure Singaporeans that MOH will ensure that dental care will remain accessible, affordable and of good quality by competent dentists."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00602,2021-08-02-T-019,602,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to express my gratitude to the Members who have spoken on this Bill. Their questions and comments have provided valuable insight on the areas that we should focus on when implementing these measures. I am heartened at their support."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00603,2021-08-02-T-019,603,Koh Poh Koon,"I should reiterate that, as I have mentioned in my speech earlier, for these proposed measures to ensure the continued quality of foreign-trained dentists seeking to practise in Singapore, we will need the support of the dental community to help implement and operationalise these amendments."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00604,2021-08-02-T-019,604,Koh Poh Koon,I am confident that these amendments will go a long way to ensure the continued high quality of foreign-trained dentists to complement our dental workforce in Singapore.
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00605,2021-08-02-T-019,605,Deputy Speaker,"Dr Shahira Abdullah, you have a clarification?"
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00606,2021-08-02-T-019,606,Shahira Abdullah,I thank the Senior Minister of State for his comprehensive reply. I just have two points of clarification.
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00607,2021-08-02-T-019,607,Shahira Abdullah,"Moving forward, may I ask if the Ministry will consider reviewing the DRA Schedule more regularly because the last one was actually quite a while back and a lot of things have changed since then."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00608,2021-08-02-T-019,608,Shahira Abdullah,"Secondly, is it moving forward in a manner in which to only allow those from schools on the DRA Schedule to take the qualifying examination, for better clarity of all those involved, instead of depending on SDC?"
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00609,2021-08-02-T-019,609,Koh Poh Koon,"Sir, I thank the Member for her questions."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00610,2021-08-02-T-019,610,Koh Poh Koon,"On the review for the DRA Schedule, yes, I think we can review it periodically. But I think that the key is in the fact that dentistry is more of a practice where you actually do things with your hands, whereas the ranking of dental schools is not necessarily in conjunction with the quality of the practice of the person but more so depending on citations, research outputs, which does not necessarily translate into actual dental practice. So, the reputation of the school itself could well be more biased towards academia and research. What we want to do then is to put in place a qualifying examination where we can ascertain the actual quality, in terms of competency, skills and ability to perform a procedure, for example, of a foreign-trained graduate."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00611,2021-08-02-T-019,611,Koh Poh Koon,"So, that leads me to the Member's second question, which is, when will SDC be the one that takes a case-by-case approach. In fact, actually, if the graduates are from the Schedule list after this amendment and they can secure employment, they will all, automatically, be eligible for the qualifying examination, the difference being, if you are a Singaporean/PR, you can take it many times. But if you are a non-Singapore/PR, you may only take it with a cap of two times within a 12-month period."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00612,2021-08-02-T-019,612,Koh Poh Koon,"For those that SDC needs to make a decision, those are graduates who are not within the list itself, that means, if you take a degree that is outside the Schedule list, then you will need to have SDC look upon your application on a case-by-case basis, before the person can be allowed to take the qualifying examination. I hope that clarifies the Member's questions."
2021-08-02-T-019-S-00613,2021-08-02-T-019,613,Koh Poh Koon,"[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]"

2021-08-02-T-020-S-00618,2021-08-02-T-020,618,Desmond Tan,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, ""That the Bill be now read a Second time""."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00619,2021-08-02-T-020,619,Desmond Tan,"Singapore is one of the safest countries in the world. In 2020, Singapore was ranked top in the Gallup Global Law and Order Report for the seventh year running. This is, in large part, due to the Singapore Police Force, or SPF in short."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00620,2021-08-02-T-020,620,Desmond Tan,"The Bill seeks to amend the Police Force Act, or PFA, so that SPF can carry out its mission to prevent, deter and detect crime and ensure the safety and security of Singaporeans even more effectively. The amendments aim to achieve the following  first, to enhance SPF's operational capabilities and readiness; second, to improve SPF's disciplinary, administrative and human resource processes; and third, to strengthen controls over the Auxiliary Police Forces."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00621,2021-08-02-T-020,621,Desmond Tan,Let me start with the first objective of enhancing SPF's operational capabilities and readiness.
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00622,2021-08-02-T-020,622,Desmond Tan,"The Bill enhances the regime against evading Police roadblocks. Drivers who evade roadblocks endanger the lives of Police officers and other road users. In an ensuing car chase, for example, evading drivers often exhibit dangerous driving behaviours, such as speeding, running red lights and swerving in and out of lanes suddenly without warning."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00623,2021-08-02-T-020,623,Desmond Tan,"In 2017, a driver was instructed to stop at a roadblock. Not only did he not stop his vehicle, he dashed through the roadblock, which triggered a chase. He was sentenced to only three weeks' imprisonment for the offence of roadblock evasion. We were lucky that the driver did not cause harm in that instance to other road users and to our officers. In other instances, roadblock evasion has led to more serious damage to property and even injuries."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00624,2021-08-02-T-020,624,Desmond Tan,"To increase deterrence, clause 6 of the Bill increases the maximum jail term and fine for evading a Police roadblock."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00625,2021-08-02-T-020,625,Desmond Tan,"Clause 6 will also expand the definition of roadblock evasion to cover more modalities of evasion. Currently, the offence of roadblock evasion only applies to drivers who physically dash through a roadblock with their vehicle. However, SPF has encountered cases where drivers evade roadblocks by other ways, such as reversing, making a U-turn or alighting from their vehicle and escaping on foot."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00626,2021-08-02-T-020,626,Desmond Tan,"In 2016, a motorcyclist stopped before a roadblock, abandoned his vehicle and fled on foot. While arresting the motorcyclist, a Police officer was injured. The motorcyclist was, eventually, convicted of voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant, unlawful possession of a weapon and possession of a controlled drug. However, no further action could be taken against him for evading the roadblock, as he did not physically dash through it."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00627,2021-08-02-T-020,627,Desmond Tan,"Clause 6 will make it an offence for a driver to fail to follow a Police officer's order, be it given by a spoken word, a hand signal, a notice or a sign, warning of the presence of a roadblock, to proceed towards a roadblock, stop, remain in the vehicle and keep the vehicle stationary until he or she is permitted to proceed."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00628,2021-08-02-T-020,628,Desmond Tan,"Next, on the set-up of barriers to control human traffic. SPF sets up various types of barriers to control human traffic, such as to prevent members of the public from entering a crime scene or high-security area. However, even though the PFA provides that SPF has the duty to take lawful measures to preserve public peace and prevent and detect crimes and offences, the PFA does not explicitly empower Police officers to set up these barriers. Clause 6 makes explicit Police officers' powers to erect barriers to control human traffic. It also creates an offence for persons who fail to follow a Police officer's order to not cross such barriers."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00629,2021-08-02-T-020,629,Desmond Tan,"Next, forced entry for cases of medical emergency. Police officers' powers to make forced entry are currently scoped to very specific circumstances, such as to perform rescue operations in cases of attempted suicide or to arrest suspects. However, Police officers would sometimes also respond to cases of medical emergency."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00630,2021-08-02-T-020,630,Desmond Tan,"In June 2021, SPF received a call from a resident who heard a weak voice coming from a nearby unit asking for help. A senior resident resided in that unit alone. When our officers arrived outside the unit, they could not hear any sounds, were unable to contact the senior or even his next-of-kin and were told by his neighbour that the senior had just returned home from the hospital that very morning. As the senior could have been in dire need of help, the Police officers decided to make a forced entry immediately. They discovered that the senior had fallen and was unable to move. Thanks to our officers' actions, the senior was able to receive help quickly and was conveyed to the hospital."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00631,2021-08-02-T-020,631,Desmond Tan,"Currently, in such cases of medical emergency, Police officers rely on the common law defence of necessity to make forced entry. To provide Police officers with greater assurance that they can make forced entry to conduct life-saving operations, clause 7 makes explicit that Police officers have the power to make forced entry of any place if they reasonably suspect that a person requires assistance because of injury or poor health."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00632,2021-08-02-T-020,632,Desmond Tan,"Next, on providing Special Police Officers, or SPOs, with the same powers conferred on regular Police officers. SPOs comprise four categories of officers – full-time Police National Servicemen, or NSmen; Operationally-ready Police NSmen; Volunteer Ex-NSmen; and Volunteer Special Constabulary Officers."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00633,2021-08-02-T-020,633,Desmond Tan,"In the PFA, our SPOs are vested with the same duties as regular Police officers. Like regulars, they have the duty to prevent and detect crimes, preserve public peace and protect persons from injury or death. However, SPOs, currently, only have powers of investigation under Part IV of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC). This means that while they have the power to arrest a suspect or execute a search warrant, they do not have powers beyond investigations. These include the powers to set up roadblocks and search a person before they enter a high-security area."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00634,2021-08-02-T-020,634,Desmond Tan,"To close this gap, clause 10 provides SPOs with the same powers conferred on regulars. This will allow SPF to deploy SPOs to a wider range of operations."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00635,2021-08-02-T-020,635,Desmond Tan,"To ensure that these powers are exercised appropriately, SPF has in place robust safeguards. SPF will ensure that only SPOs who pass the requisite training can exercise policing powers and be deployed on the frontline. SPOs who are deemed unsuitable to exercise policing powers will be deployed to perform backend and administrative duties. This is already being done today."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00636,2021-08-02-T-020,636,Desmond Tan,"For those who misuse their powers, SPF will take strict disciplinary action. In serious cases, we will also initiate criminal proceedings."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00637,2021-08-02-T-020,637,Desmond Tan,"Next, providing Commercial Affairs Officers, or CAOs, with necessary powers. CAOs are public officers employed by SPF to investigate commercial and financial crimes. Currently, the PFA only provides CAOs with the powers of investigation under Part IV of the CPC. However, there are other powers which are necessary for their work."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00638,2021-08-02-T-020,638,Desmond Tan,"For example, CAOs, currently, have the power to arrest suspects for an arrestable offence. However, if the suspect is unable to furnish bail and is subject to lock-up, CAOs will have to seek the assistance of Police officers to search the suspect to remove illicit items or items that may be used to facilitate escape or cause harm, prior to the lock-up. This is not an efficient process."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00639,2021-08-02-T-020,639,Desmond Tan,"Hence, clause 9 provides CAOs with more powers, such as the power to arrest persons who possess anything reasonably suspected to be fraudulently obtained, and the power to issue bails and bonds."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00640,2021-08-02-T-020,640,Desmond Tan,There will be safeguards to prevent CAOs from misusing their new powers.
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00641,2021-08-02-T-020,641,Desmond Tan,"Clause 9 makes it explicit that CAOs are subject to certain restrictions when carrying out procedures relating to arrest and search, such as the mode for searching women. These are the same restrictions which apply to Police officers."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00642,2021-08-02-T-020,642,Desmond Tan,CAOs must also attend training and pass the requisite tests before they can exercise these powers.
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00643,2021-08-02-T-020,643,Desmond Tan,"Next, empowering the Commissioner of Police to delegate his powers to civilian officers. Currently, the Commissioner can delegate his powers to Police officers in leadership positions. However, he cannot do the same for civilian officers in leadership positions, such as the Director of the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD)."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00644,2021-08-02-T-020,644,Desmond Tan,"This hampers operational efficiency. For example, if the CAD Director wishes to issue Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) on how to handle cases of specific commercial crimes to Investigation Officers, he will have to ask a Police officer to do so on his behalf."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00645,2021-08-02-T-020,645,Desmond Tan,Clause 5 allows the Commissioner to delegate his and his Deputy Commissioners' powers to civilian officers in leadership positions.
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00646,2021-08-02-T-020,646,Desmond Tan,Some powers conferred on the Commissioner will continue to be non-delegable. Examples include those under the Public Order and Safety (Special Powers) Act.
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00647,2021-08-02-T-020,647,Desmond Tan,"Next, protecting officers from liability for acts done in good faith and with reasonable care. At times, Police officers have to make split-second decisions and take decisive action in order to save lives, even if their actions may result in injury or damage to property. Such time-critical and dangerous situations are often a matter of life and death and present themselves in high-stress environments."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00648,2021-08-02-T-020,648,Desmond Tan,"For example, if a patrolling Police officer finds a person in a crowded public place waving around a chopper in his hand and shouting at passers-by and, if the person becomes increasingly agitated, the Police officer might tase the person to ensure public safety. Here, the defence of good faith and reasonable care applies even if the person suffers injuries as a result, as the Police officer believed honestly and based on objectively reasonable grounds that his actions were necessary to prevent harm and the Police officer had adhered to the standard operating protocol for using a taser to restrain a dangerous and armed person."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00649,2021-08-02-T-020,649,Desmond Tan,"Clause 27 protects Police officers, SPOs, CAOs, Intelligence Officers and Forensic Specialists from liability for acts and omissions done in good faith and with reasonable care."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00650,2021-08-02-T-020,650,Desmond Tan,"When carrying out their lawful duties, our officers can already rely on the common law defence of necessity. But we want to give greater assurance to our officers and make it explicit that they have protection for acts done in good faith and with reasonable care under the law, so that they can carry out their duties with greater confidence."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00651,2021-08-02-T-020,651,Desmond Tan,"This is similar to the protection that is already accorded to other Home Team officers, such as SCDF officers."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00652,2021-08-02-T-020,652,Desmond Tan,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to emphasise that the new provision will not mean that our officers can act with disregard. It only applies when our officers have acted in good faith and with reasonable care. Officers who act irresponsibly will be subjected to disciplinary proceedings or even criminal proceedings."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00653,2021-08-02-T-020,653,Desmond Tan,"Next, the Bill provides SPF with the legal power to retain the employment of regular Police Officers during a major crisis. Major crises may include a major terrorist incident or a large-scale, sustained public order incident. SPF would need to have sufficient manpower to manage such crises."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00654,2021-08-02-T-020,654,Desmond Tan,"Today, SPF can already mobilise SPOs under certain circumstances and require them to serve until they are demobilised. Full-time NSmen and Operationally-ready NSmen can already be retained for mobilised service upon a proclamation by the President under section 16 of the Enlistment Act. For volunteers, the Commissioner of Police can already mobilise them for active service under any circumstances under section 73 of the PFA, so long as the Minister’s permission is sought."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00655,2021-08-02-T-020,655,Desmond Tan,"However, SPF does not have the legal power to stop regular Police Officers from resigning in the midst of a major crisis. To make sure that SPF has sufficient manpower resources during a major crisis, clause 3 provides that the Commissioner may refuse a notice of resignation given during a crisis period."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00656,2021-08-02-T-020,656,Desmond Tan,"The Commissioner must be of the opinion that the officer’s service is necessary for the securing of the public safety, defence and security of Singapore."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00657,2021-08-02-T-020,657,Desmond Tan,"The definition of a “crisis” only applies when the President has issued a Proclamation of Emergency under the Constitution, or the Minister for Home Affairs has given an activation order under the Public Order and Safety (Special Powers) Act."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00658,2021-08-02-T-020,658,Desmond Tan,This is broadly similar to how the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) can already retain regular servicemen for mobilised service upon a proclamation by the President pursuant to section 16 of the Enlistment Act.
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00659,2021-08-02-T-020,659,Desmond Tan,"I will now speak about the second objective to improve SPF's disciplinary, administrative and human resources processes."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00660,2021-08-02-T-020,660,Desmond Tan,"First, clauses 8 and 15 increase the maximum fines for Volunteer Special Constabulary Officers and regular Police Officers below the rank of Inspector. This ensures our officers continue to uphold the highest standards of integrity and conduct."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00661,2021-08-02-T-020,661,Desmond Tan,"Next, today, SPF issues recall orders under the Enlistment Act to compel NSmen to report for disciplinary proceedings and NSmen can claim for loss in civilian remuneration."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00662,2021-08-02-T-020,662,Desmond Tan,Clause 16 allows SPF to issue orders under the PFA to compel NSmen who have committed disciplinary offences to report for disciplinary proceedings without having to make up for any loss in civilian remuneration. This is because the disciplinary proceedings arose out of their own wrongful actions in the first place.
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00663,2021-08-02-T-020,663,Desmond Tan,Similar provisions for SCDF and SAF NSmen already exist in the Civil Defence Act and the Singapore Armed Forces Act respectively.
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00664,2021-08-02-T-020,664,Desmond Tan,"Next, currently, the Commissioner’s approval has to be sought for the discharge of NSFs for reasons other than completing full-time service, even when the reasons are straightforward, such as the NSF having a serious medical condition or being transferred to the SAF or SCDF."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00665,2021-08-02-T-020,665,Desmond Tan,"To streamline this process, clause 13 specifies the conditions under which NSFs may be discharged from SPF automatically, without the need for the Commissioner’s approval. This aligns with the approach for Operationally-ready NSmen, who can already be automatically discharged under the same conditions."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00666,2021-08-02-T-020,666,Desmond Tan,"Next, currently, the PFA allows the Minister to make regulations for Police associations, such as the Police Central Welfare Fund, which advance the welfare of regular Police officers."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00667,2021-08-02-T-020,667,Desmond Tan,Clause 28 allows the Minister to also include SPOs and civilian officers employed by SPF in Police associations. This is in recognition of the contributions that they make to support SPF in ensuring the safety and security of Singapore.
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00668,2021-08-02-T-020,668,Desmond Tan,"Next, disbandment of the Vigilante Corps (VC). Currently, full-time NSmen and Operationally-ready NSmen in SPF serve in one of two Forces  they may serve in the Special Constabulary, where they perform the same duties as regular Police officers and have powers of investigation under Part IV of the CPC. Otherwise, they may also serve in the Vigilante Corps."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00669,2021-08-02-T-020,669,Desmond Tan,"Since the introduction of the VC in 1964, VC officers have made important contributions in supporting SPF to maintain law and order in Singapore. They mainly perform support roles and do not have any policing powers."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00670,2021-08-02-T-020,670,Desmond Tan,"Moving forward, MHA will be disbanding the VC and transferring all existing VC officers to the Special Constabulary. This gives our NSmen the opportunity to be deployed in a greater variety of roles in SPF."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00671,2021-08-02-T-020,671,Desmond Tan,"The Bill also makes minor amendments to streamline SPF’s administrative and human resources, which I will not go into further here."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00672,2021-08-02-T-020,672,Desmond Tan,"The Bill also strengthens controls over Auxiliary Police Forces (APFs), which provide armed security services and supplement the Home Team’s efforts in ensuring the safety and security of Singapore."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00673,2021-08-02-T-020,673,Desmond Tan,"The armed security industry was liberalised in 2004 to allow more APFs to operate islandwide. This was in consideration of the increasingly complex security environment, which required a larger pool of armed officers to step up security measures at various critical infrastructure and key installations. With the APFs providing support for such functions, SPF is also better able to focus on its core mission to prevent, deter and detect crime."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00674,2021-08-02-T-020,674,Desmond Tan,"We had stated then that it was necessary to ensure that only trusted agents may operate and manage APFs in Singapore. These considerations remain valid today, as Auxiliary Police Officers bear arms and are vested with certain powers to perform their functions effectively. They also have access to the sensitive locations where they are deployed to protect. Having reviewed the regulatory regimes of other essential services sectors and the prevailing operating environment, we felt that we should update the APF controls in the PFA, to ensure that the controls remain effective."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00675,2021-08-02-T-020,675,Desmond Tan,"Currently, the PFA requires an APF employer to obtain the Minister’s approval before the APF employer is acquired by any other person. The Minister’s approval is also required before one becomes a substantial shareholder of an APF employer. Going forward, we will make these controls more holistic."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00676,2021-08-02-T-020,676,Desmond Tan,"First, before a person acquires the business of an APF employer, clause 21 requires both the person and the APF employer to seek approval from the Minister."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00677,2021-08-02-T-020,677,Desmond Tan,"Second, clause 21 will require the chairman and directors of an APF employer to be approved by the Commissioner of Police, on top of the existing requirement for the CEO to be approved."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00678,2021-08-02-T-020,678,Desmond Tan,"Third, clause 22 will require a person to notify the Commissioner after becoming a 5% controller of an APF employer and to seek the Minister’s approval before becoming a 25%, 50% or indirect controller, or ceasing to be a 50% or 75% controller. These thresholds, which take reference from the legislation of other essential services sectors, ensure that only trusted agents can have the ability to influence and direct actions of the APF. Clause 19 imposes a requirement on APF employers to inform the Commissioner after becoming aware of such transactions. This provides another layer to detect any potential attempts to circumvent our reporting and approval requirements."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00679,2021-08-02-T-020,679,Desmond Tan,"There may be circumstances, such as public emergencies, where it is crucial that we ensure the continuity of security services provided by the APFs. Clause 24 provides for the Minister to issue a special administration order to allow the affairs of an APF employer to be managed by the Commissioner or an appointed person. This regime is found in other essential services sectors, to ensure no disruptions to the provision of these services."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00680,2021-08-02-T-020,680,Desmond Tan,MHA will also update the penalties for offences and infringements in relation to APF employers and controllers.
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00681,2021-08-02-T-020,681,Desmond Tan,"Finally, clauses 25 and 26 update existing powers to investigate and to make regulations, to reflect the changes in APF controls."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00682,2021-08-02-T-020,682,Desmond Tan,"Mr Deputy Speaker, with the evolving security landscape, our laws in relation to SPF have to be kept up-to-date, so that it is well-poised to tackle any challenges. Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move."
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00683,2021-08-02-T-020,683,Desmond Tan,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2021-08-02-T-020-S-00684,2021-08-02-T-020,684,Deputy Speaker,Leader.
2021-08-02-T-021-S-00685,2021-08-02-T-021,685,,"[(proc text) Resolved, ""That the proceedings on the business set down on the Order Paper for today be exempted at this day’s Sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No 2."" – [Ms Indranee Rajah.] (proc text)]"
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00686,2021-08-02-T-022,686,,[(proc text) Debate resumed. (proc text)]
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00687,2021-08-02-T-022,687,Deputy Speaker,We move on with the Second Reading for the Police Force (Amendment) Bill. Mr Desmond Choo.
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00688,2021-08-02-T-022,688,Desmond Choo,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I declare my interest as a board director of Surbana Jurong Pte Ltd which owns Aetos Holdings Pte Ltd, an Auxiliary Police Force (SPF)."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00689,2021-08-02-T-022,689,Desmond Choo,The Bill marks another important step ahead in protecting the safety and security of Singaporeans and enforcement officers. It is perhaps also most opportune during the 200th year of the establishment of the Singapore Police Force.
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00690,2021-08-02-T-022,690,Desmond Choo,The enhancement of the SPF’s operational capabilities is greatly welcomed. Section 114A now explicitly affirms the protection of Police officers from personal liability. Officers must be assured that they are protected so that they can discharge their duties without the nagging worries of personal liability while legitimately carrying out their duties. We note that this has been carefully calibrated  greater protection is afforded to our officers but balanced by criminal liability and disciplinary actions to prevent and punish those who flagrantly abuse their powers in bad faith.
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00691,2021-08-02-T-022,691,Desmond Choo,"Our officers do not operate in a risk-free, benign and simplistic environment. They often have to rely on their training, exercise judgement and take on certain risks, especially in critical, complex and time-sensitive situations. In my years of running operations in the Police Force, I have seen that even the best officers could and would make mistakes. And these mistakes were crucial to the Police's collective learning. Mistakes can also come from taking well-managed risks."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00692,2021-08-02-T-022,692,Desmond Choo,"Nothing affects the ability of an officer to discharge his duties more than knowing that the law does not protect them or is even against them. I hope that these considerations can be included in the upcoming regulations to be prescribed by the Ministry in determining what constitutes ""good faith"" and ""reasonable care"". These regulations should also not be unnecessarily rigid or prescriptive such that they stifles execution in fluid operational situations. Yet, neither could it be so broad as to leave practitioners directionless. Can the Minister share what might some of these regulations be? What were examples of cases that the officers did not act in good faith or reasonable care?"
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00693,2021-08-02-T-022,693,Desmond Choo,"Enforcement officers work in a hierarchy with clear chains of command. They are usually either guided by supervisors or Standard Operating Procedures. If there is, indeed, a situation where an officer did not act in good faith and/or reasonable care, then what is also the liability of officers in the chain of command? I hope that officers do not lose operational effectiveness in becoming overly circumspect in guiding their officers or executing their duties."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00694,2021-08-02-T-022,694,Desmond Choo,"Sir, I also seek a few clarifications and suggestions on the amendments for the Ministry’s consideration."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00695,2021-08-02-T-022,695,Desmond Choo,"My first suggestion relates to motorists who evade road barriers. Under section 26(8)(a), a person guilty of evading a road barrier faces a fine of up to $10,000, imprisonment of up to a term of seven years, or both. The Mackenzie Road incident in 2017, which left two of our officers injured, has shown us how brazen a minority of motorists can be in evading road barriers. Evasion not only reflects intent to conceal criminality but can also cause considerable danger and inconvenience. Could the Ministry consider imposing a minimum punishment, including a mandatory jail term, for evading road barriers?"
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00696,2021-08-02-T-022,696,Desmond Choo,"I believe this would serve as a forceful deterrent, demonstrating the Ministry's zero-tolerance stance towards such acts."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00697,2021-08-02-T-022,697,Desmond Choo,"My next suggestion relates to the liability of employers of Auxiliary Police Forces, or APFs, under section 87(9). At present, liability under section 87(9) is not explicit within the following provisions  sections 87(5), (7) and (8). These subsections are important in ensuring that MHA retains regulatory oversight over how APFs are run. For example, section 87(7) underlines the need for Singaporeans to retain the controlling interests in APF companies. Should we attach legal liabilities for infringing the above-mentioned provisions?"
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00698,2021-08-02-T-022,698,Desmond Choo,"Can I also clarify that section 88 also applies to entities and persons with indirect control over the board of the employer of the Auxiliary Police Forces? For example, company A has an indirect control over the employer of the APF via a controlling stake in the parent company owning the employer of the APFs? Ultimately, the Ministry should be afforded greater regulatory oversight over APFs, ensuring that APFs maintain the highest standards expected."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00699,2021-08-02-T-022,699,Desmond Choo,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, at its core, passing this Bill will strengthen our ability to keep the people of Singapore safe by judiciously strengthening the operational readiness of the SPF and the Ministry's oversight over APFs. Our officers must be provided with the full armour of the law to take the stand against criminals and discharge their duties. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00700,2021-08-02-T-022,700,Sylvia Lim,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to seek some clarifications on the Bill. These clarifications pertain to three areas. First, the delegation of powers to civilian officers; second, the conduct of roadblocks; and third, the new powers to be given to Commercial Affairs Officers and Special Police Officers."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00701,2021-08-02-T-022,701,Sylvia Lim,"First, delegation of powers to civilian officers. Under the existing Act, the powers of the Commissioner (CP) may be delegated by him to a Police officer not below the rank of superintendent. In the case of the Deputy Commissioner (DCP), his powers may be delegated by CP to a Police officer not below the rank of an assistant superintendent."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00702,2021-08-02-T-022,702,Sylvia Lim,"Clause 5 of the Bill will change the position to enable such powers of the CP or DCP to be delegated to non-Police personnel who are performing duties in the Police Force not below the prescribed grade. In the Ministry's media release on the Bill on 5 July, it was clarified that this provision would allow delegation of CP’s or DCP’s powers to civilian officers in leadership positions within the SPF."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00703,2021-08-02-T-022,703,Sylvia Lim,"I am somewhat concerned about what this change will entail. For instance, is it envisaged that the command of the force at the highest levels could conceivably be delegated to civilian officers from time to time? If this is so, I wonder how well this will go down amongst uniformed officers."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00704,2021-08-02-T-022,704,Sylvia Lim,"Sir, we assume that Police training is a critical prerequisite for exercising Police powers, let alone for commanding those who exercise such powers. Further, developing Police leadership skills is a specialised field that, in recent years, has been spearheaded by the Police Psychological Services Division. The assessments require potential Police leaders to be put through simulations of incident management at the frontline and officers are also continually developed for Police leadership. There is also an organisational culture amongst uniformed personnel which can be quite distinct from civilians working in the same organisation."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00705,2021-08-02-T-022,705,Sylvia Lim,"That being the case, one has to wonder about the delegation of Police leadership powers at the highest level to civilians. While these civilians may be senior enough in grade, would they have the necessary experience and credibility to exercise such command responsibilities?"
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00706,2021-08-02-T-022,706,Sylvia Lim,"Although there are other provisions in the main Act that allow for assignment of powers to civilians, they are usually clearly scoped. For instance, section 18 of the Act enables the Minister to appoint civilians to exercise powers to grant licences. To expect civilians to exercise such administrative powers seems unobjectionable, compared with the prospect of them exercising command or frontline powers."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00707,2021-08-02-T-022,707,Sylvia Lim,"Sir, my view is that the scope of clause 5 is not clear as the wording is not qualified. A further explanation of what is envisaged would be necessary. Earlier in the Second Reading speech, the Minister of State did reiterate or confirm that certain powers of the CP would be non-delegable. Where are we to find this list for clarification?"
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00708,2021-08-02-T-022,708,Sylvia Lim,"Next, conduct of roadblocks. Clause 6 of the Bill makes changes to the provision on conducting roadblocks. Under the amendments, it is much more explicit what drivers and Police officers can and cannot do. This is an improvement."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00709,2021-08-02-T-022,709,Sylvia Lim,"Sir, I have a query about the proposed section 26(6), which is new. This sub-section will make it an offence for pedestrians travelling in the direction of a roadblock to cross the barrier and subjects pedestrians to the officers’ instructions as well. Earlier, the Minister of State explained that one of the targets for this provision are car drivers who attempt to abandon their cars and escape on foot. Could he clarify whether there are other categories of pedestrians who are being envisioned by this new provision?"
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00710,2021-08-02-T-022,710,Sylvia Lim,"Finally, Police powers to Commercial Affairs Officers (CAOs) and Special Constabulary. Clauses 9 and 10 of the Bill propose to expand the powers of CAOs and Special Police Officers (SPOs). These clauses will empower these officers not just to do investigations but to exercise all Police powers, including the power of arrest without warrant, and have similar powers of search, forced entry and so on."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00711,2021-08-02-T-022,711,Sylvia Lim,"From my understanding, CAD has had Police officers attached to it since it was formed. This arrangement was made precisely because the CAO’s powers were limited; when it was time to do raids, the Police officers attached to CAD would accompany the investigators in charge to exercise their full powers. My understanding is that this arrangement has worked for many years."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00712,2021-08-02-T-022,712,Sylvia Lim,"Sir, may I ask what has motivated the change to give CAOs and SPOs full Police powers now? Is this due to manpower shortage issues or some other operational reason?"
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00713,2021-08-02-T-022,713,Shahira Abdullah,"Mr Deputy Speaker, the Police Force (Amendment) Bill will enable the SPF to continue to keep Singapore safe and secure in an increasingly complex operating environment. On the whole, I do support the Bill. However, there are certain queries or concerns I have which I will put forth."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00714,2021-08-02-T-022,714,Shahira Abdullah,"Firstly, I have some concerns for section 17 which empowers the Commissioner of Police and Deputy Commissioner to delegate their powers to non-Police personnel in leadership positions within SPF if they are unable to carry out their duties. Currently, the Commissioner may only delegate his and the Deputy Commissioner's powers to Police officers in leadership positions within SPF. Non-Police personnel may not have the same experiences as a Police officer. Therefore, I would like to clarify in what instances the Minister of State envisages the need to execute section 17."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00715,2021-08-02-T-022,715,Shahira Abdullah,"Secondly, I would like to refer to section 26, which allows forced entry in order to protect the life, health or safety of a person. I feel this is especially pertinent and important in domestic violence cases where the victim may be in imminent danger. Just in January this year, the Minister of State for Home Affairs Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim had said there was a 10% increase in family violence cases every month between April and December last year. Having this amendment will add another layer of protection to the victims as it allows the Police officers to render help immediately as time may be of the essence in such cases."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00716,2021-08-02-T-022,716,Shahira Abdullah,"However, I would still call for caution when executing forced entry. There should be clear guidelines on what is considered a reasonable situation for it and all officers should be suitably trained before being able to exercise these powers. Limits should be clearly stated. This may be particularly important in domestic violence cases where it is not clear or easy to determine if a crime is being committed in the premises."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00717,2021-08-02-T-022,717,Shahira Abdullah,"Additionally, in cases of forced entry, there may be circumstances in which there may be damage to the premises, or instances when the forced entry is actually unwarranted. I would, therefore, like to clarify if there is proper recourse available to the premise owner in such cases."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00718,2021-08-02-T-022,718,Shahira Abdullah,"Thirdly, I welcome the fact that forced entry is not applicable to persons who may be attempting suicide. I do agree that these are very complex and, possibly, emotionally-charged situations. Officers who do not understand the ramifications of forcing entry into premises occupied by a suicidal person may run the risk of making matters worse. The person they are trying to help may end up seriously injured or dead, with the officer as a contributing factor, intentionally or otherwise."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00719,2021-08-02-T-022,719,Shahira Abdullah,"For example, in February, officers had to force their way into a Toa Payoh flat after a 64-year-old man locked himself in his room and threatened to commit suicide. The man charged towards the officers and allegedly stabbed a Police officer in the thigh."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00720,2021-08-02-T-022,720,Shahira Abdullah,"I would like to clarify, though, whether units, such as the Crisis Negotiation Unit, are, today, already empowered to force entry to premises in attempted suicide cases, given that attempted suicide has been decriminalised since 1 January 2020. And if they do have the requisite powers, what sort of legal protections are afforded to them in the event their actions lead to undesirable consequences for the suicidal individual?"
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00721,2021-08-02-T-022,721,Shahira Abdullah,"Lastly, for section 120A, which relates to the granting of permission for the sale or manufacture of Police uniform or insignia, may I suggest that the word ""written"" be inserted before the word ""permission"" in the revised section, meaning the section should be amended to read, ""has the written permission of the Commissioner"" for clarity and transparency of procedure?"
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00722,2021-08-02-T-022,722,Shahira Abdullah,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, all in all, I believe the amendments will allow the Police to carry out their functions more effectively and, therefore, I support the Bill."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00723,2021-08-02-T-022,723,Shahira Abdullah,"Before ending, I would also like to congratulate the Singapore Police Force on celebrating their 200th Anniversary. May they continue their good work for many more years to come."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00724,2021-08-02-T-022,724,Gan Thiam Poh,"Deputy Speaker, Sir, I strongly support the empowerment of our officers in order to achieve more efficient response to emergencies and assist people in distress. This measure will help to save lives and prevent tragedies."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00725,2021-08-02-T-022,725,Gan Thiam Poh,"I have been concerned about the safety of Police officers on duty at roadblocks which are necessary to deter drink-driving, illegally-modified vehicles and associated offences."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00726,2021-08-02-T-022,726,Gan Thiam Poh,"I have some questions. In the last five years, how many roadblock operations were there and how many offenders had been caught?"
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00727,2021-08-02-T-022,727,Gan Thiam Poh,"Will the empowerment of the APFs be helpful in supporting more roadblock operations at problematic road segments? I am referring to those which many residents provide feedback about, particularly speeding and noisy modified vehicles."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00728,2021-08-02-T-022,728,Gan Thiam Poh,Would the Ministry consider allowing APFs to carry out such operations independently so as to achieve a greater deterrent effect?
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00729,2021-08-02-T-022,729,Gan Thiam Poh,"In addition, will the Police look into more transportable and solid barriers to minimise the risk to the lives of the Police on duty at roadblocks and to deter dash-throughs, such as by putting up impact absorbers used by contractors on highways while carrying out construction works?"
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00730,2021-08-02-T-022,730,Gan Thiam Poh,Will such operations be effective against motorcyclists who have more avenues to evade the roadblocks?
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00731,2021-08-02-T-022,731,Gan Thiam Poh,"I would also like to ask if the Police will equip all the staff and officers, including SPOs and CAOs, with cameras and recorders. The records should be kept independently for safekeeping as evidence to prevent wrongful accusations and misuse. Such information shall not be shared, unless with permission and when needed to respond to fake news and wrongful accusations. Safeguarding of these recordings is also necessary to prevent cyberattacks and manipulation that could jeopardise the safety of operations."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00732,2021-08-02-T-022,732,Gan Thiam Poh,"While SPF is provided with the power to retain the services of Police officers in times of crises, it should also be provided with an alternative for such officers to be redeployed to other appropriate services. This is because commitment and dedication are required to maintain the integrity and efficiency of operations during a crises. Officers should be able to address an appeal board for reviews of their cases."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00733,2021-08-02-T-022,733,Gan Thiam Poh,"With that, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Police Force for keeping Singapore safe."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00734,2021-08-02-T-022,734,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Police Force (Amendment) Bill introduces, inter alia, new provisions as regards our APFs. I will cover three areas as regards these provisions. The first is the provisions to do with tightening control over the controllers of APFs. The second is with regards to advertising for security services by APFs. The third is the introduction of a special administrative order or other order that the Minister may make under certain circumstances."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00735,2021-08-02-T-022,735,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Sir, I declare at this juncture my interest as the President of the Security Association Singapore."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00736,2021-08-02-T-022,736,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Sir, the first set of amendments are in the new section 88 and tightens controls over the controllers of APFs such that any person who comes in, between 5% and 25% control of an APF must notify the Minister, and a controller above 25% control of an APF must seek prior approval from the Minister. Sir, I support these changes. Our APFs are an extension of the Singapore Police Force and it is critical to ensure that there is accountability to the Minister for Home Affairs as regards control, so as to ensure that our APFs are not diverted from their missions."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00737,2021-08-02-T-022,737,Raj Joshua Thomas,"A second area is the introduction as a new section 86A of restrictions on advertising, where only an APF may carry on the functions of an APF and advertise or, in any other way, hold out that it carries on or is willing to carry on the functions of an APF. This is an important new section, which also provides sufficiently heavy penalties for offenders."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00738,2021-08-02-T-022,738,Raj Joshua Thomas,"On this particular amendment, Sir, I have a point of clarification. Some of our APFs, like Certis and AETOS are both employers of armed APFs and owners of security agencies that carry out unarmed services, but which bear their same logo and same name. In this regard, APFs must exercise caution in how they advertise and hold out their non-APF businesses in such manner that there is no conflation between their APF business and non-APF business. MHA and the Commissioner may wish to consider how to ensure this, perhaps through the promulgation of guidelines or further regulations."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00739,2021-08-02-T-022,739,Raj Joshua Thomas,"The third set of amendments introduces under the New Division 1C of Part IX, a Special Administration Order or other order to transfer management of an APF from an employer to the Commissioner or anyone appointed by the Minister. This can be done in situations where the employer is unable to pay its debts, during a public emergency, or when the Minister deems it in the public interest. This new proviso ensures that the provision of essential security services remains unhindered and coordinated across employers of APFs, especially in view of the central role that our APFs have played in our COVID-19 response, which I will elaborate on."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00740,2021-08-02-T-022,740,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Sir, these amendments proposed in the Bill are timely and important to ensure our APFs' continued ability to contribute to the safety and security of Singapore and Singaporeans."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00741,2021-08-02-T-022,741,Raj Joshua Thomas,"The utility of our APFs was made apparent recently, as Certis took up duties urgently needed for the issuance, enforcement and execution of quarantine orders and quarantine operations of MOH. These services included administration of quarantine orders to Persons under Quarantine (PUQs) and the enforcement of such orders as directed by MOH."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00742,2021-08-02-T-022,742,Raj Joshua Thomas,"In a recent article in June 2021 by Yahoo, several persons affected by such orders described the effort as ""disorganised"" and officers as ""unhelpful"" and who caused frustration and confusion amidst PUQs."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00743,2021-08-02-T-022,743,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Sir, our APOs have worked hard to transition and learn new skills to take on these new COVID-19-specific tasks and it is important that we acknowledge the difficulty of carrying out, at short notice, what can be accurately described as a herculean task. I thus urge Singaporeans to be empathetic when interacting with our officers as they go about carrying out their duties in this regard. I was also happy to read in that same Yahoo article that MOH acknowledged the concerns raised and said it would continue to improve communications between the various agencies involved, including Certis."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00744,2021-08-02-T-022,744,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Alongside Certis, AETOS and SATS, APOs also stepped up in our battle against COVID-19, being deployed at various locations across the island, including Government quarantine facilities, floating hotels under the Maritime and Port Authority, airports, military camps and high-risk areas like the red migrant worker dormitories last year. Such high-risk locations meant that officers had to don full personal protective equipment for their entire 12-hour shifts, as they assisted with temperature checks, social distancing measures and escorting workers who had tested positive."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00745,2021-08-02-T-022,745,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Sir, in peacetime, our APFs are equally busy keeping us safe and secure. They are part of the private security industry and have been situated on the frontlines, engaging in traffic and crowd control, event security, providing remote surveillance and enforcing security rules and regulations. Furthermore, they are strategically relied on to provide protective security for many important and sensitive Government and civilian institutions, such as at our airports, naval installations and checkpoints. While some APFs provide extremely specialised services, as private entities, they are freed from various obligations and restrictions and can operate flexibly and competitively. This is precisely why, Sir, it is extremely important that we ensure that there are sufficient controls over the employers of APFs or the controllers of APFs."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00746,2021-08-02-T-022,746,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Sir, as front-facing personnel on the ground, our APOs sometimes face abuse from members of the public. In December last year, an APO was headbutted several times by a member of the public. In January this year, another APO was punched on the head while carrying out safe distancing checks. I am heartened that swift action was taken and, appropriately, heavy punishment meted out."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00747,2021-08-02-T-022,747,Raj Joshua Thomas,"In this regard, Sir, I would also like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to all our APOs for carrying out their duties diligently and professionally during this pandemic and, even before that, to keep Singapore secure and orderly. I trust we will see our APOs and, for that matter, our security officers, increasingly not just as partners of the Home Team but as part of the Home Team."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00748,2021-08-02-T-022,748,Raj Joshua Thomas,"Sir, our APFs are an armed and highly recognisable form of authority in Singapore. Due to their professionalism and hard work over the decades, our APFs and APOs are respected and trusted by Singaporeans. We must not take this for granted. In this regard, today's amendments to strengthen control over the APFs to ensure their continued operations as going concerns and that they stay true to their mission are timely and welcomed. I also welcome the other amendments that strengthen our Police Force. Sir, I support the Bill."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00749,2021-08-02-T-022,749,Sharael Taha,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. The amendments will enable SPF to continue keeping Singapore safe and secure amidst an increasingly complex operating environment. I am in support of the amendments. However, I would like to raise three clarifications  One, more clarity on the power to enter any place in case of an emergency; two, the delegation of Commissioner of Police (CP) and Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) powers; and three, protecting officers from liability for acts done in good faith."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00750,2021-08-02-T-022,750,Sharael Taha,"Firstly, it is important for us to update and equip our Police officers with the necessary powers so that they can respond swiftly in order to protect and save lives. As such, it is appropriate that we do allow our Police officers to enter any place, in case of medical emergency, to protect persons from injury or death. This would allow our Police officers the necessary access in situations where lives may be at stake. I would like to clarify on the definition of a ""medical emergency"". What constitutes a medical emergency? And how would a Police officer assess the medical emergency behind locked doors?"
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00751,2021-08-02-T-022,751,Sharael Taha,"Secondly, the CP is a respected public officer who wields considerable authority and is appointed by none other than our own President. Currently, the CP may only delegate his and the DCP's powers to Police officers in leadership positions within SPF. However, with the new amendments, the CP is empowered to delegate CP and DCP powers to civilian officers in leadership positions within SPF. In his opening statement, Minister of State Desmond Tan had shared that one instance in which the CP may consider delegating his power is when the CP delegates his or her power to the Director of Commercial Affairs to issue SOPs. Can the Minister clarify on the type of powers which the CP cannot delegate to civilian officers?"
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00752,2021-08-02-T-022,752,Sharael Taha,"Will the CP or DCP delegate the power to investigate scams, financial or cybercrimes, given the increase in the number of such crimes which may require a different skillset from the traditional policing? Do we have a shortage of this skillset within our current men in blue and how do we ensure that delegating these powers do not dilute the investigative capability of our Police from solving scams, financial or cybercrimes that are getting increasingly complicated?"
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00753,2021-08-02-T-022,753,Sharael Taha,"The amendment also seeks to ""Make explicit the protection for Police officers, Special Police officers (SPOs), Commercial Affairs officers (CAOs), Intelligence Officers and Forensic Specialists from liability for acts and omissions done in good faith and with reasonable care."" Currently, our officers rely on the defence of necessity under common law. The amendment seeks to codify and enhance existing protection for our officers in their execution of the Police Force Act (PFA) or any other written law. This will allow them to carry out their lawful duties with greater assurance. Nevertheless, officers may still be taken to task and face disciplinary actions or even charged for criminal offences if they are found to have acted inappropriately."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00754,2021-08-02-T-022,754,Sharael Taha,"Given the recent false allegations on social media against our Police Force in the recent months, it underscores the importance of protecting our men in blue in the course of their duty. An officer faces many important decisions daily. An officer, for example, who has been dispatched to a road traffic accident and is the first officer at the scene, has only a split second to decide on what to do next. While awaiting the arrival of paramedics, the officer, having been trained in CPR, may need to provide first-aid to the victim. While administering CPR and trying to resuscitate the victim through chest compressions, the officer may have cracked the victim's ribs. The victim may or may not have survived, but should we not protect our officer for acting in good faith and using as much care as he possibly could at that moment?"
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00755,2021-08-02-T-022,755,Sharael Taha,"The last few weeks also saw an example where a shirtless man was acting aggressively towards our Police officers. The officers were unable to calm the man down, he continued to behave aggressively and, finally, tried to attack our officers. At that point, there was no other option for our officers but to tase the person. What if the individual who was tased had died due to a pre-existing medical condition? Should the officer not be protected from liability? It stands to reason that if the officer had acted in good faith and followed all the rules of engagement and SOPs, he should not be personally liable in these instances. This amendment would undoubtedly protect and reassure our Police officers as they go about their duties. Should this assurance be extended to our Prison wardens and other officers in the Home Team, too?"
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00756,2021-08-02-T-022,756,Sharael Taha,"While we increase the protection to our officers, we must never allow errant officers who act inappropriately to hide behind this. Hence, the protection from liability in the act of good faith must be balanced with stiffer penalties if this is abused. Mr Deputy Speaker, in Malay, please."
2021-08-02-T-022-S-00757,2021-08-02-T-022,757,Sharael Taha,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] It is important for us to equip our Police officers with the necessary powers so that they can respond swiftly in order to protect and save lives.

2021-08-02-T-025-S-00772,2021-08-02-T-025,772,Deputy Speaker,Miss Cheryl Chan.
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00773,2021-08-02-T-025,773,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Mr Deputy Speaker, yesterday was Nurses Day. I wish to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to all our healthcare workers for the tireless work they have been doing for us all these years and, in particular, during this pandemic. It has not been easy, but we have been very appreciative of all that they have done."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00774,2021-08-02-T-025,774,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak on the Rare Disease Fund (RDF)."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00775,2021-08-02-T-025,775,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Jointly established by MOH and SingHealth Fund in July 2019, RDF aims to ensure affordability in treatment costs for Singapore Citizens with rare diseases through providing supplemental financial assistance for those who still require it after Government subsidies, insurance and financial assistance, with the premise that treatment is sought at public healthcare institutions."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00776,2021-08-02-T-025,776,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"According to the Agency for Care Effectiveness (ACE), there are over 2,000 Singaporeans with rare diseases and 700 of them being children. Treatment and medications for rare diseases are for life, with expenses ranging from tens of thousands per month to over half a million per year. Hence, any help for these families is welcomed and much appreciated."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00777,2021-08-02-T-025,777,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Through a $3-to-$1 matching donation from the Government to the RDF, it is with the hope that this would encourage the larger community including philanthropists, corporates, community groups and individuals to join in to support these patients in fostering a more caring and inclusive society. In just five months after the introduction of RDF, the initial fund of $70 million has increased to $90 million. However, a year since November 2019, it was reported by MOH that the value of the RDF had only increased from $90 million to $93 million, with one's hypothesis that a comparatively slower increase could be due to the economic fall-out from COVID-19, which saw a corresponding decrease in public donations."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00778,2021-08-02-T-025,778,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"While I understand that the objective of the RDF is to sustainably support beneficiaries, giving them the assurance that financial support will be available over their lifetime, but the number of beneficiaries since the introduction of the RDF appears to be small."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00779,2021-08-02-T-025,779,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Today's Motion seeks to explore ways to increase the uptake of the RDF through more awareness, expanding the scope of eligible conditions and drugs under the RDF. Further, what can be done to ensure sustainability of the RDF through continued encouragement of donation and the involvement of medical insurers and drug manufacturers?"
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00780,2021-08-02-T-025,780,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"In response to a Parliamentary Question by Dr Tan Wu Meng, MOH replied that, currently, only six medicines that treat the four rare conditions are eligible for the RDF, with a few more drugs under consideration. Six beneficiaries are supported with a total of $2 million and, by April 2021, the number of beneficiaries has increased to seven."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00781,2021-08-02-T-025,781,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"While I can understand the RDF had, indeed, managed to assist seven beneficiaries, I cannot help but worry about the other 2,000 Singaporeans with rare diseases and how they are being supported. Thus, I would like to raise some points for MOH to consider."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00782,2021-08-02-T-025,782,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"First, potential to increase the uptake of the RDF. With only eight applications received since the introduction of the RDF, it begs the question, are we doing enough through the RDF? There are possibly reasons why people do not apply  from not fulfilling the eligibility requirements, to other funding sources available, lack of awareness of the existence of the RDF, or some reasons we may not even be aware of."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00783,2021-08-02-T-025,783,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Regarding the eligibility requirements, I would call for an expansion in scope in the list of drugs and conditions eligible for the RDF. But before that, the question is, are there sufficient awareness on the existence of the RDF amongst those who are suffering from rare diseases? I understand that groups like the Rare Disorders Society (Singapore) and Rainbow Across Borders help in raising awareness and providing support to patients with rare diseases. But could there be further touchpoints that could allow those with rare diseases to know more about and benefit from the RDF? For example, this could be more widely shared through the community level and family touchpoints like the general practitioners, pediatricians and polyclinics."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00784,2021-08-02-T-025,784,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Second, the list of conditions that are eligible for the RDF. For the current four eligible conditions for the RDF, there is a strict process in assessing eligibility. Understandably so, as we want to ensure that those who really need the funds can obtain the funds and on a long-term basis. However, for those with rare diseases beyond these four eligible conditions, they face the strictest of processes and a flat rejection. One example would be the Ding family whose young daughter suffers from Turner Syndrome, a condition, currently, that is not eligible and, despite their best efforts in appealing for coverage, they were rejected."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00785,2021-08-02-T-025,785,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"There are, presently, over 6,000 types of rare diseases in the world and, yet, only four types are eligible for the RDF. While I can understand that it is not feasible to be comprehensive and exhaustive to cover all rare diseases for eligibility, could we do more to expand the current scope of conditions?"
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00786,2021-08-02-T-025,786,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"The sad truth is that some of these rare diseases that affect young children currently do not have any treatments that are readily available and, even if they do have some form of preventive measures, the measures would, usually, result in death. Hence, it is very important that for conditions with appropriate treatments and medications, we provide sufficient resources and support to ensure that these young children who need it, get it. With that, I would like to propose to include coverage of the following two conditions  neuroblastoma and Krabbe Disease. These two conditions have been listed under the 10 most common rare diseases among young children in the world today."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00787,2021-08-02-T-025,787,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Neuroblastoma is one of the most common childhood cancers found in children under the age of five. Neuroblastoma accounts for about 5.3% of all childhood cancers diagnosed in Singapore annually, equivalent to about 15 children from March 2017 to February 2019, and with the cost of treatment going upwards of $1 million and some of the specialist treatments not available in Singapore."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00788,2021-08-02-T-025,788,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Meanwhile, Krabbe Disease is a hereditary genetic disorder and 43 Singaporeans are known to have this. The younger the disease develops in the individual, the more severe it would be as they grow to adulthood."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00789,2021-08-02-T-025,789,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Third, the list of drugs that are eligible for the RDF. With reference to the United States, there are close to 30 million people who suffer from some form of rare disease. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 22 novel drugs in 2019 alone just to combat against a variety of rare diseases."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00790,2021-08-02-T-025,790,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"While it is understood that the RDF is currently considering more drugs for eligibility, could the Minister shed more light on the process and timeline of the type of drugs under evaluation? In order to expedite approval and eligibility to allow more beneficiaries for this fund, could there be an opportunity for the RDF to collaborate with overseas governments and institutions to exchange research and information? This will better accelerate local understanding of different rare diseases and the corresponding drugs and treatments here."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00791,2021-08-02-T-025,791,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Current eligibility for drugs under the RDF follows a rigorous process. I am not against a rigorous process, as, rightfully so, this matters lives. But could some relaxation on the criteria for drug approval be exercised to include palliative care as well? For the Krabbe Disease, there are, currently, no cures with the existing treatments. What is available, usually, involves the relief of the severity of the symptoms as well as supportive care. Only a limited number of success in infants who were given stem cell transplants at an early age had been known at this stage."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00792,2021-08-02-T-025,792,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"For the 43 Singaporeans with Krabbe Disease, they have to shoulder the high medical costs year after year. If the drug eligibility could be relaxed, I believe this would bring some respite and cheer to them and help them to continue life with zest despite the perennial looming thought that the disease has no cure and the treatment can only allay their symptoms."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00793,2021-08-02-T-025,793,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Looking at our nation with an ageing population and the likely exponential budgets we are projecting for future healthcare costs, I can only imagine the treatment costs for rare diseases and, consequently, the RDF as no exception. The following two points would explore how to ensure the sustainability of the RDF and the role of medical insurance and drug manufacturers in achieving this goal together."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00794,2021-08-02-T-025,794,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"So, first, the efficacy and sustainability of the RDF. Apart from the seed fund, the RDF is heavily reliant on community donations matched by the Government grant, with eventual reliance on investment returns. However, with the call to increase the scope of conditions and drugs included, it is inevitable this will lead to more funds required if the number of beneficiaries grows. Herein lies the question  how do we ensure sustainability of the RDF, so that the RDF would be able to last the beneficiaries a lifetime and also account for an increase in the number of recipients?"
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00795,2021-08-02-T-025,795,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"As last year has shown, community donations are very much dependent on economic conditions. However, those suffering from rare diseases cannot stop treatment and wait for the conditions to improve, regardless of economic conditions. So, how can we encourage a more sustainable and recurring model of community donations?"
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00796,2021-08-02-T-025,796,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Besides raising awareness on the RDF for more fundraising efforts, can corporate donations that span over a period of five to 10 years be explored with differentiated tax treatment? In so doing, it could increase donations from corporates or family offices. With some certainty in donations, it could help to act as a bulwark against the smaller community donations that are more dependent and fluctuate according to economic conditions."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00797,2021-08-02-T-025,797,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Given the limited drugs that are available for each rare disease, the drug manufacturers can consider, as their social effort, to pay it forward and balancing the cost offset with other commercial drugs in their portfolio by subsidising the cost of trial or unique medication, or what they call ""novel drugs"" for patients. This will greatly assist the patients as they are restricted by options, to begin with, and unable to bear the cost of standard commercial models of drugs and treatment. So, this is probably a critical way forward for a sustainable outcome."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00798,2021-08-02-T-025,798,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Finally, on medical insurance for those with rare diseases. Many of those with rare diseases do heavily rely on insurance to manage medical costs. However, the knotty situation is that many insurance products excludes pre-existing conditions, and even if the insurance does allow for some pre-existing conditions, it comes at a very high premium."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00799,2021-08-02-T-025,799,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"The pricing of insurance premiums is a delicate one. Through a risk-pooling mechanism, insurers seek to diversify the risk of payout. Generally, in recent times, insurance premiums have been increasing, with increased consumption of medical services as an oft-cited reason. While active measures have been taken to keep the insurance premiums in check, this will place an even heavier toll on those with rare diseases; if only they are covered in the first place."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00800,2021-08-02-T-025,800,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"In order to allow for better access to medical insurance and a more manageable and sustainable insurance premiums for those with rare diseases, can insurance companies consider providing coverage under a higher co-payment condition for those with rare diseases? Alternatively, could the RDF be explored to partially offset the cost for the insurance premium in order to assist them?"
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00801,2021-08-02-T-025,801,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"Having medical insurance does, indeed, help take some financial and mental pressure off the individual and their family. This may allow them to better focus on improving and have better health outcomes. But as a country, it is pivotal that we try our utmost to support them through the RDF and other means and jointly work towards our vision of creating a more caring and inclusive society."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00802,2021-08-02-T-025,802,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"To conclude, Mr Deputy Speaker, the RDF is indeed necessary and very helpful for those with rare diseases. After all, every bit counts. However, it is timely that we ask whether RDF has achieved its initial objectives and what more can we do to make it more inclusive. I look forward to the Senior Minister of State's reply."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00803,2021-08-02-T-025,803,Deputy Speaker,Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon.
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00804,2021-08-02-T-025,804,Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, having a child born with a rare disease can be a life-changing event for an entire family. In addition to the suffering that the child goes through, it also creates a lot of emotional distress, uncertainties and anxieties for the parents and can impose greater financial  as well as physical demands in caring for the needs of the child. The high cost of treatment adds to the overall burden."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00805,2021-08-02-T-025,805,Koh Poh Koon,"As a doctor, I have walked this difficult journey with many patients and their families before, especially when they had an unexpected diagnosis being revealed to them."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00806,2021-08-02-T-025,806,Koh Poh Koon,"So, I would like to thank Miss Cheryl Chan for her passionate speech and proposals relating to the Rare Disease Fund (RDF) in support of these families. The Government shares her concern for individuals with rare diseases where medication is very costly and required for life. This was why, in 2019, the Government provided a generous matching of $3 for every $1 of public donation to establish the RDF as a charity fund to support Singapore Citizens diagnosed with rare genetic diseases."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00807,2021-08-02-T-025,807,Koh Poh Koon,"The RDF supports high-cost, life-saving treatments for very rare genetic conditions where the medicines, firstly, have a proven therapeutic efficacy; secondly, are able to substantially extend a patient's lifespan and maintain a quality of life as a direct consequence of its use and; thirdly, be reasonably priced as when compared to its price in other countries."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00808,2021-08-02-T-025,808,Koh Poh Koon,"Rare diseases with onset in childhood are prioritised initially as these patients with conditions, such as rare diseases, can often go on to lead full and meaningful lives if they are diagnosed early in the course of their disease and receive the required treatment promptly."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00809,2021-08-02-T-025,809,Koh Poh Koon,"Because these treatments tend to be lifelong, the RDF is structured as an endowment fund to ensure that only the interest income generated is used to fund the treatment and the capital sum continues to generate a sustainable stream of income to ensure patients enrolled into the programme will have assured support."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00810,2021-08-02-T-025,810,Koh Poh Koon,"While welcoming the set-up of the RDF, Miss Cheryl Chan has highlighted that the number of patients, conditions and medicines covered by the RDF is low, potentially leaving some rare diseases patients unassisted."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00811,2021-08-02-T-025,811,Koh Poh Koon,"Let me, first, clarify three common misconceptions."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00812,2021-08-02-T-025,812,Koh Poh Koon,"First, this is not a situation in which eligible patients are not applying for the RDF due to a lack of awareness. In fact, as the costs are high, patients with rare diseases, generally, seek care in the public sector. We can, therefore, easily identify patients with rare diseases covered by the RDF and invite those who require financial assistance to apply. Furthermore, many of the public sector specialists who treat genetic disorders are on the expert panel that advises the RDF Committee on the rare disease medicines that should be considered for coverage by the RDF. Some patients with rare diseases have insurance coverage or alternative financial means and need not apply for RDF grants. For those who are in financial need, medical social workers in the public healthcare institution and the patient’s specialist will assist the patient to apply for RDF assistance."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00813,2021-08-02-T-025,813,Koh Poh Koon,"Second, when we first set up the RDF, it was established that there were up to 2,000 patients with rare diseases in Singapore. However, the majority of these patients have conditions where no treatments are available to correct the genetic deficiency and life expectancy may be limited with poor quality of life; or where treatments were relatively low cost and, hence, can already be supported under current funding sources."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00814,2021-08-02-T-025,814,Koh Poh Koon,"We had, therefore, anticipated there could be up to 15 medicines that needed RDF support, based on experiences of equivalent rare disease funds from overseas. In two years, we have covered six medicines. We need to do more, but it is tangible progress in a short time of two years. I would like to thank the RDF Committee for what has been achieved and for the work that is to come to bring support to more patients."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00815,2021-08-02-T-025,815,Koh Poh Koon,"Third, Miss Cheryl Chan also proposed to list more rare diseases and medicines on the RDF. We should only do so if the rare diseases have effective treatments that can meaningfully extend the life expectancy. But adding more medicines does not, in itself, enable more patients to be helped, especially if the RDF does not have sufficient funds to support more patients for the entire lifetime of their treatment costs."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00816,2021-08-02-T-025,816,Koh Poh Koon,"In the last financial year alone, the RDF made grant payouts of around $1 million. Many of the beneficiaries are children. They will grow and increase in body weight, which means that the medication dosage required, along with the cost of treatment, will go up commensurately. For example, in this financial year, RDF is projecting to make grant payouts of around $1.5 million, which is 50% more than the last financial year for the same group of patients."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00817,2021-08-02-T-025,817,Koh Poh Koon,"In the coming years, the annual sum in grant payouts required would increase significantly just to support these same patients. We have to cater for these increases with age when we decide how many patients the RDF can sustain, in order that the supported patients can be assured that they can continue to afford their medications once they are started on treatment."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00818,2021-08-02-T-025,818,Koh Poh Koon,"The reality is that this is a large sum for a very small number of patients. But that is how expensive rare diseases medicine costs and why we need all of us – the Government, the community – to work together to help this group. Without more donations, it will be very difficult for the RDF to list more medicines or to support new patients."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00819,2021-08-02-T-025,819,Koh Poh Koon,"This, therefore, brings me to the crux of what will allow RDF to help more patients with rare diseases – raising more donations. Miss Cheryl Chan has also recognised this in her speech. It is not easy raising funds for patients with rare diseases. It was in recognition of this difficulty that the Government decided to match donations $3-to-$1, so that every donation dollar is stretched further and also to help encourage donors to come forward. In addition, all donations to the RDF are also eligible for a generous level of tax deduction at 250% and the Government also funds all administrative costs of the RDF so that donors are assured that every single cent of their donation goes to the patients. This also applies to all donations made by corporations and family offices."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00820,2021-08-02-T-025,820,Koh Poh Koon,"Fully aware of the importance of raising more funds, the RDF Committee, together with its secretariat at KK Hospital, is doubling up their efforts to raise funds. It has and will continue to approach high networth individuals, foundations as well as corporate sponsors, as suggested by Miss Cheryl Chan. It also stands ready to collaborate with organisations to help raise funds for the RDF, as it has done so on a few occasions in the past. It is also exploring how it can develop a base of supporters who can reach out to their networks to fundraise."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00821,2021-08-02-T-025,821,Koh Poh Koon,"The RDF Committee will appreciate all the help that it can get. If Members of this House would like to help raise funds for the RDF, please let me know and I will gladly put you in touch with the RDF Committee."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00822,2021-08-02-T-025,822,Koh Poh Koon,Let me now turn to a few other proposals made in Miss Cheryl Chan’s speech.
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00823,2021-08-02-T-025,823,Koh Poh Koon,"First, Miss Cheryl Chan proposed to include two specific rare diseases  neuroblastoma and Krabbe Disease. Neuroblastoma is a form of cancer. Treatments for cancer, including neuroblastoma, are not covered under the RDF as mainstream financing is available through MediShield Life currently. Those who need further assistance can apply for MediFund. As for Krabbe Disease, there are, unfortunately, no treatments available to slow disease progression today, with most patients succumbing by age two. The current available medicines are for palliative and supportive care only, which would not fulfil the inclusion criteria for RDF of being able to substantially extend a patient’s lifespan. Patients who require additional assistance for palliative care are already supported via mainstream financing schemes, such as subsidies and our 3M of MediSave, MediShield Life and MediFund."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00824,2021-08-02-T-025,824,Koh Poh Koon,"I would like to assure Miss Cheryl Chan that the RDF Committee is well advised by the Rare Disease Expert Group on the rare disease drugs that should be prioritised for coverage. Currently, the RDF Committee has a pipeline of five other medicines for three more rare diseases that stand ready to be added to the RDF list once sufficient funds are raised."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00825,2021-08-02-T-025,825,Koh Poh Koon,Miss Cheryl Chan also suggested going beyond the RDF and leveraging more on insurance. I note that Miss Cheryl Chan is familiar with the practice among private insurers of not covering pre-existing illnesses.
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00826,2021-08-02-T-025,826,Koh Poh Koon,"Where coverage of pre-existing illnesses is provided, it comes with the loading of the insurance premium, which can be significant. The benefits and premiums of private insurance products, such as Integrated Shield Plans (IPs), are determined by insurers, based on their own commercial and actuarial considerations."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00827,2021-08-02-T-025,827,Koh Poh Koon,"In doing so, insurers have to strike a balance between providing more comprehensive coverage and ensuring the affordability of premiums, as well as the sustainability of their insurance fund. As private insurance is optional, the insurers also need to guard against adverse selection that can affect sustainability."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00828,2021-08-02-T-025,828,Koh Poh Koon,"Miss Cheryl Chan may, however, be pleased to know that some insurance products, such as IPs, do not set exclusions for rare diseases, unless these are pre-existing conditions. In addition, our universal national medical insurance, MediShield Life, covers all Singaporeans from birth, with no disease exclusions, including all rare diseases, subject to the relevant claims limit. Where there are claims limits to payouts such that there remains an out-of-pocket payment for the patient, the RDF would consider an application to support this remaining out-of-pocket payment."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00829,2021-08-02-T-025,829,Koh Poh Koon,"In conclusion, establishing the RDF was but a first step in assisting patients with rare diseases. The task remains ahead of us, as a community, to muster all the necessary resources and assistance that we all agree are needed for this group of fellow Singaporeans."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00830,2021-08-02-T-025,830,Koh Poh Koon,"I would like to thank Miss Cheryl Chan for calling on both the community and the Government and even the pharmaceutical companies to provide stronger support towards patients with rare diseases. I would like to reiterate the Government’s commitment towards supporting these patients with rare diseases. I encourage everyone to donate generously, so that more can benefit from the RDF."
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00831,2021-08-02-T-025,831,Koh Poh Koon,"[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]"
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00832,2021-08-02-T-025,832,Koh Poh Koon,"[(proc text) Resolved, ""That Parliament do now adjourn."" (proc text)]"
2021-08-02-T-025-S-00833,2021-08-02-T-025,833,Koh Poh Koon,Adjourned accordingly at 7.41 pm.
2021-08-02-T-026-S-00834,2021-08-02-T-026,834,Darryl David,asked the Minister for Education whether he can provide an update as to how the Direct School Admission (DSA) for admission into Secondary schools is progressing under the present COVID-19 restrictions.
2021-08-02-T-026-S-00835,2021-08-02-T-026,835,Chan Chun Sing,"There continues to be healthy interest in the Direct School Admission for Secondary schools (DSA-Sec) this year. There were about 31,400 applications received from 12,100 unique applicants, which was a slight increase from last year. In 2020, 30,500 applications were received from 11,900 unique applicants."
2021-08-02-T-026-S-00836,2021-08-02-T-026,836,Chan Chun Sing,"The 2021 DSA selection is being held between end-June to mid-September. Similar to the 2020 DSA exercise, all shortlisted applicants will have their interviews and selection trials conducted via video-conferencing in their own Primary schools, using a standardised set-up and equipment. This ensures the safety and well-being of students and school staff by preventing the intermingling of students across schools."
2021-08-02-T-026-S-00837,2021-08-02-T-026,837,Chan Chun Sing,"Secondary schools will continue to take a holistic approach to DSA selection, considering not only the student's achievements and performance at the e-interviews and e-selection trials, but also their interest and passion for the talent area, their potential and personal qualities. During the e-selection, students will be asked to perform suitable tasks that demonstrate their attributes and potential in their talent area. The format and task will vary, depending on the talent area and the Secondary school's selection criteria. With insights gained from their experiences in implementing the 2020 DSA exercise, the DSA schools’ selection panels, made up of staff experienced in talent identification, will, collectively, evaluate each DSA applicant to ensure objectivity and select students who can most benefit from their development programmes."
2021-08-02-T-026-S-00838,2021-08-02-T-026,838,Chan Chun Sing,"Offers will be made by schools after assessing the relative merits of all applicants and taking into account the applicant’s passion, potential, personal qualities and suitability for admission to the school."
2021-08-02-T-027-S-00839,2021-08-02-T-027,839,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Minister for Health for Quarantine Orders (QO) that have been issued to persons identified as close contacts of COVID-19 cases (a) what are the average and longest time intervals from the day of their exposure to the infected individual, to the day the QO is served; and (b) how has the average speed of isolating close contacts of COVID-19 cases changed since the start of the year."
2021-08-02-T-027-S-00840,2021-08-02-T-027,840,Ong Ye Kung,"As of July 2021, the mean time to issue the QO from notification of case was two days. The longest time interval was 14 days. This happened for a small number of individuals, where it was particularly difficult to trace the contacts of the infected. The mean time in January 2021 was shorter – 1.5 days, as we had fewer daily cases then."
2021-08-02-T-027-S-00841,2021-08-02-T-027,841,Ong Ye Kung,"While on the subject, we would like to record our appreciation for the men and women who work 24/7 on the contact tracing and quarantine ops, as they are a vital enabler for our COVID-19 strategy and we urge members of the public to cooperate with their requests for information, so that we can all be better protected."
2021-08-02-T-028-S-00842,2021-08-02-T-028,842,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Minister for Manpower for foreign students holding a student pass (a) whether there is a requirement for foreign students holding a student pass to declare if they are undertaking part-time work during the school term; and (b) over the last five years, what is the annual number of student pass holders found to be working where a work pass would have been required."
2021-08-02-T-028-S-00843,2021-08-02-T-028,843,Tan See Leng,"Foreign students who are accorded a Student’s Pass should be, primarily, here to study. To guard against potential abuse, Student’s Pass holders need a work pass in order to work, just like any other foreigner in Singapore."
2021-08-02-T-028-S-00844,2021-08-02-T-028,844,Tan See Leng,"However, we do allow Student’s Pass holders to work during term-time without a work pass if they meet highly specific requirements. First, the work must not exceed 16 hours a week, or must be for an industrial attachment that is part of course requirements. The 16-hour limit allows foreign students to engage in part-time work to defray their living expenses, while ensuring that the bulk of their time remains dedicated to their studies, which is the primary reason for them to be in Singapore. Aside from defraying living expenses, some students also use the flexibility to gain practical experience that are relevant to their course of study or to take up volunteer work. Other educational hubs offer foreign students similar flexibilities to undertake part-time work during term-time – in the United States and the United Kingdom, the limit is higher, at 20 hours a week."
2021-08-02-T-028-S-00845,2021-08-02-T-028,845,Tan See Leng,"Second, the Student’s Pass holder must be enrolled in an approved institution. These are institutions with stringent admissions criteria and where the intake of international students is controlled. There are currently, 20 approved institutions, 14 of which are MOE’s Institutes of Higher Learning, such as our local Universities and Polytechnics. The remainder are foreign universities and business schools with campuses in Singapore. MOM, together with the relevant supporting agencies, like MOE and EDB, assesses all approved institutions, and placement on this list requires approval from the Minister for Manpower. The list is tightly-scoped and we have rejected many appeals from businesses to include more educational institutions on this list to augment labour shortages."
2021-08-02-T-028-S-00846,2021-08-02-T-028,846,Tan See Leng,"This balanced approach has allowed us to guard against abuse, while maintaining a vibrant educational ecosystem in Singapore for top international students, who may stay on to contribute meaningfully to our economy even after graduation. Our own Singaporean students who venture overseas have also benefited from similar flexibilities accorded to them by their host countries to work during their studies."
2021-08-02-T-028-S-00847,2021-08-02-T-028,847,Tan See Leng,"Given the strict requirements, we do not require foreign students who are eligible for work during term-time without a work pass to declare their undertakings. We take a firm stance against foreign students who work illegally. From 2016 to 2020, MOM and ICA took enforcement action against 73 Student’s Pass holders who were found to be working illegally. These students were not from the list of approved institutions. Student’s Pass holders found to be working illegally can face a fine of up to $20,000 or imprisonment of up to two years or both, upon conviction. MOM and ICA will also cancel their Student’s Pass, deport them and debar them from future employment in Singapore."
2021-08-02-T-028-S-00848,2021-08-02-T-028,848,Tan See Leng,"Employers will need to make sure that they are in compliance with MOM’s regulations when hiring foreign students. Employers who illegally employ these Student’s Pass holders, or abet these Student’s Pass holders in illegal employment, can face a fine of not less than $5,000 and not more than $30,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both. Their work pass privileges may also be suspended."
2021-08-02-T-029-S-00849,2021-08-02-T-029,849,Jamus Jerome Lim,"asked the Minister for Finance in light of SGX’s efforts to promote more widespread remuneration disclosures by listed companies done in compliance with Singapore’s Code of Corporate Governance, whether the Ministry will consider (i) instituting industry best practices on remuneration disclosures for Government investment entities on average or for key management personnel and (ii) requiring Temasek Holdings to make bonus disclosures on average or for key management personnel."
2021-08-02-T-029-S-00850,2021-08-02-T-029,850,Lawrence Wong,Singapore’s Code of Corporate Governance relates to remuneration disclosures by listed companies.
2021-08-02-T-029-S-00851,2021-08-02-T-029,851,Lawrence Wong,"Nevertheless, as the shareholder of GIC and Temasek, the Government monitors both investment entities on their long-term performance, net of fees or expenses. This takes into account their overall expenses, including staff cost."
2021-08-02-T-029-S-00852,2021-08-02-T-029,852,Lawrence Wong,"We had addressed the issue of public disclosure practices and the specific level of disclosures at MOF’s COS last year. GIC and Temasek are commercial entities. It is the boards of GIC and Temasek that are responsible for such decisions. The Government, in turn, holds the boards accountable for instilling good corporate governance practices."
2021-08-02-T-029-S-00853,2021-08-02-T-029,853,Lawrence Wong,"GIC and Temasek, currently, disclose relevant information in their annual reports, including their compensation approaches and how these are linked to their performances. Both have disclosed more information over the years. We encourage them to continually review whether there are other meaningful additional disclosures to make. The Government’s principle is that what the entities disclose should be part of an overall system that enables them to maximise their ability to achieve their objective of generating long-term returns."
2021-08-02-T-030-S-00854,2021-08-02-T-030,854,Darryl David,asked the Minister for Law (a) how many mediation cases have there been between wedding couples and vendors who are affected by the COVID-19 restrictions in the last 12 months; and (b) how many of these cases have been successful.
2021-08-02-T-030-S-00855,2021-08-02-T-030,855,K Shanmugam,Mediations between wedding couples and vendors affected by COVID-19 may have taken place with various organisations offering mediation services in the last 12 months. MinLaw is unable to track the number of such mediations and the number of successful settlements arising from such mediations.
2021-08-02-T-030-S-00856,2021-08-02-T-030,856,K Shanmugam,"Between 20 April 2020 and 31 January 2021, wedding couples and vendors whose wedding events were affected by COVID-19 could seek relief under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act. Some parties secured a moratorium against enforcement action under the Act, and mutually resolved the matter between themselves, including via mediation."
2021-08-02-T-030-S-00857,2021-08-02-T-030,857,K Shanmugam,"In early May 2021, after the Heightened Alert was announced, some wedding events could not be carried out as contracted due to the tightened safe management measures. MinLaw received feedback that, in many cases, parties were able to work out alternatives amongst themselves, but there were some who were unable to reach an agreement on how to proceed with the contract for the wedding event."
2021-08-02-T-030-S-00858,2021-08-02-T-030,858,K Shanmugam,"To help wedding couples and vendors affected by the Heightened Alert measures and who have been unable to reach an agreement on how to proceed with the contract for the wedding event, MinLaw introduced the MinLaw COVID-19 (Wedding) Mediation Programme (MCMP) on 14 July 2021. Under the MCMP, a neutral, trained mediator will facilitate discussions between the parties and assist parties to work out a mutually agreeable way forward. Mediation under the MCMP is free-of-charge."
2021-08-02-T-030-S-00859,2021-08-02-T-030,859,K Shanmugam,"We encourage contracting parties to be fair and reasonable to each other. The COVID-19 restrictions have affected both wedding couples and vendors, and mutual understanding of the difficulties faced will help them reach a better outcome."
2021-08-02-T-031-S-00860,2021-08-02-T-031,860,Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) for each of the years from 2011 to 2015, what is the five-year recidivism rate; (b) whether the Singapore Prison Service can publish the five-year recidivism rate, alongside the two-year recidivism rate in its annual report; and (c) what is the proportion of current inmates in Changi Prison who have been imprisoned before."
2021-08-02-T-031-S-00861,2021-08-02-T-031,861,K Shanmugam,"The five-year recidivism rates for the 2011 to 2015 release cohorts are 43.1%, 43.2%, 41%, 41.3% and 41.7% respectively."
2021-08-02-T-031-S-00862,2021-08-02-T-031,862,K Shanmugam,About four-fifths of the inmate population have been incarcerated before. The majority of these inmates are repeat drug offenders.
2021-08-02-T-031-S-00863,2021-08-02-T-031,863,K Shanmugam,"The Singapore Prison Service, or SPS, currently publishes two-year recidivism rates in its annual statistics release, as this is aligned with common international practice, which also allows for meaningful comparison across jurisdictions. The two-year recidivism rate has remained low and stable, with the overall recidivism rate for the 2018 release cohort being 22.1%. Singapore’s two-year recidivism rate is amongst the lowest internationally."
2021-08-02-T-031-S-00864,2021-08-02-T-031,864,K Shanmugam,"While SPS does not include the five-year recidivism rates in its annual statistics release, we have released it on occasions. For instance, it was recently mentioned by Second Minister for Home Affairs, Mrs Josephine Teo, during her opening speech at the CARE Network Summit on 13 July. This has been helpful in raising awareness and rallying the community to support ex-offenders in their rehabilitation and reintegration journey."
2021-08-02-T-031-S-00865,2021-08-02-T-031,865,K Shanmugam,"MHA regularly reviews the statistics that we make public. As part of these reviews, we are considering including the five-year recidivism rates alongside the two-year rates in the annual statistics release."
2021-08-02-T-032-S-00866,2021-08-02-T-032,866,He Ting Ru,"asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the total number of cases of long-COVID diagnosed and logged in Singapore since the figure of zero reported in November 2020, broken down by gender and age group; (b) what are the plans for dedicated, integrated care for long-COVID patients, including physiological and psychological care; and (c) what measures have been taken to support patients with long-COVID symptoms."
2021-08-02-T-032-S-00867,2021-08-02-T-032,867,Ong Ye Kung,"""Long COVID"" is not a distinct medical condition or a formal diagnosis and refers to persons who have continued symptoms of COVID-19 infection. The underlying reasons for continued symptoms vary, as do the symptoms themselves. We continue to offer care to all these patients, who require support from different clinical teams, depending on their condition."
2021-08-02-T-032-S-00868,2021-08-02-T-032,868,Ong Ye Kung,"A multi-centre study led by the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) showed that one in 10 COVID-19 patients who recovered after the initial infection continued to display symptoms, such as cough or breathlessness, six months after resolution of the acute illness. Those aged above 65 years and who had severe infection were associated with an increased likelihood of these persistent symptoms."
2021-08-02-T-033-S-00869,2021-08-02-T-033,869,Gerald Giam Yean Song,asked the Minister for Home Affairs since 7 April 2020 (a) whether the Police have permitted any vice activities to continue operating; (b) how many enforcement operations have been conducted against illegal vice activities; (c) how many individuals and businesses have had action taken against them for engaging in vice-related activities; and (d) how do the Police ensure that such activities are not a source of spread of COVID-19.
2021-08-02-T-033-S-00870,2021-08-02-T-033,870,K Shanmugam,Vice activities are inconsistent with several of the Safe Management Measures implemented since 7 April 2020. Enforcement action can and has been taken to deal with such breaches.
2021-08-02-T-033-S-00871,2021-08-02-T-033,871,K Shanmugam,"From 7 April 2020 to June 2021, Police have conducted more than 1,200 enforcement operations against vice activities. These operations targeted online vice activities, and vice services offered at other places, such as massage establishments. More than 500 individuals were arrested for alleged offences under the Women’s Charter, the Immigration Act and the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act."
2021-08-02-T-034-S-00872,2021-08-02-T-034,872,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Government will be implementing changes to improve safe management measures in KTV bars and similar nightlife establishments; (b) if so, what are these; and (c) whether the Government will ensure that such measures will not unfairly affect other nightlife establishments whose businesses are substantially different from bars with hostesses."
2021-08-02-T-034-S-00873,2021-08-02-T-034,873,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Operators of pivoted nightlife establishments who wish to reopen after the two-week suspension period will be required to implement additional Safe Management Measures (SMMs), on top of existing ones, to further reduce public health risks and facilitate enforcement checks. They must then pass inspections and receive a conditional permit from MTI before they can resume operations."
2021-08-02-T-034-S-00874,2021-08-02-T-034,874,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We have announced the requirements recently and MTI, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and other relevant enforcement agencies will be engaging operators on the follow-ups. The additional SMMs include installing CCTVs to monitor operations, removing public entertainment equipment like karaoke machines and pool tables from sight, and ensuring that the business activities are visible from outside the business premises. These SMMs will be included in MTI’s conditional permits to reopen. Operators with queries may email the MTI helpdesk at covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg to find out more."
2021-08-02-T-034-S-00875,2021-08-02-T-034,875,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"While these SMMs may be onerous for some operators, they have been designed such that genuine F&B operators are not overly affected. A tightening is necessary so as to prevent another cluster in pivoted nightlife establishments. MTI and Enterprise Singapore will continue to work closely with the Singapore Nightlife Business Association and the various regulatory agencies to provide support to the nightlife industry."
2021-08-02-T-035-S-00876,2021-08-02-T-035,876,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Defence (a) what are the reasons for allowing the National Day Parade (NDP) to proceed in the midst of Phase Two (Heightened Alert) from 22 July to 18 August 2021; and (b) whether the event will increase the risk of the spread of infection to COVID-19 frontliners and essential workers invited to watch the NDP in person and who will, thereafter, be in frequent contact with members of the public."
2021-08-02-T-035-S-00877,2021-08-02-T-035,877,Ng Eng Hen,"As announced on 22 July 2021, the National Day Parade 2021, originally planned on 9 August has been postponed to 21 August 2021, after the scheduled end of Phase Two (Heightened Alert). Stringent COVID-19 safety measures will be taken in the preparation and conduct of the event."
2021-08-02-T-036-S-00878,2021-08-02-T-036,878,Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) how many Singaporean citizens are currently registered to be still within Myanmar; and (b) whether there will be further relief flights scheduled for August 2021.
2021-08-02-T-036-S-00879,2021-08-02-T-036,879,Vivian Balakrishnan,"There are currently around 240 Singaporeans in Myanmar who have registered with MFA. The Singapore Embassy in Yangon has been providing regular consular advice and updates on the situation in Myanmar to them. Presently, there are three relief flights a week from Yangon to Singapore which are operated by Singapore Airlines and Myanmar National Airlines. Singaporeans can book the flights directly with the airlines to return home."
2021-08-02-T-036-S-00880,2021-08-02-T-036,880,Vivian Balakrishnan,"MFA cannot guarantee that these relief flights will continue on a regular basis throughout August and beyond. In such a scenario, we may also not be granted permission to conduct repatriation flights. Consequently, MFA has advised Singaporeans currently in Myanmar to consider leaving as soon as they can via commercially operated flights. The situation in Myanmar remains volatile, compounded by the recent surge in the number of COVID-19 cases which has placed tremendous stress on the public health system in Myanmar. Singaporeans who choose to remain in Myanmar must consider the risks to their health and personal safety. If they have not yet e-registered with MFA, they are strongly advised to do so immediately."
2021-08-02-T-037-S-00881,2021-08-02-T-037,881,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether ICA will consider providing some reason or a general response as to why an application for permanent residency is unsuccessful, especially for repeat applicants who have been living in Singapore for a long period of time, so that they can have a better understanding of their path towards permanent residency."
2021-08-02-T-037-S-00882,2021-08-02-T-037,882,K Shanmugam,"Applications for Permanent Residency (PR) are evaluated on criteria covering a range of factors. The applicant’s length of residency is only one of the factors considered by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA). The other factors include, but are not limited to, the applicant’s family ties to Singaporeans, economic contributions, educational qualifications, age and family profile, the applicant’s ability to integrate into our society and commitment to sinking roots in Singapore."
2021-08-02-T-037-S-00883,2021-08-02-T-037,883,K Shanmugam,"We do not share the specific grounds for rejecting PR applications. First, information about detailed assessment criteria can be abused to inflate an undeserving applicant’s chances of success or to game the system. Second, the reasons for rejection may be used to arouse negative sentiments in other countries. This may create bilateral sensitivities and is not in Singapore's interest."
2021-08-02-T-038-S-00884,2021-08-02-T-038,884,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the Familial Ties Lane is still available for foreign visitors who are entering to register their marriage in Singapore to a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident; and (b) if so, what are the requirements."
2021-08-02-T-038-S-00885,2021-08-02-T-038,885,K Shanmugam,Foreign visitors who are fiancés/fiancées of Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents can apply to enter Singapore under the Familial Ties Lane (FTL) for the purpose of marriage.
2021-08-02-T-038-S-00886,2021-08-02-T-038,886,K Shanmugam,"Applicants will need to provide supporting documents, such as appointment letters from the Registry of Marriages or Registry of Muslim Marriages, where required. Their applications will also be subject to security and immigration risk assessment."
2021-08-02-T-038-S-00887,2021-08-02-T-038,887,K Shanmugam,"If the entry application is approved, they will be subject to the prevailing COVID-19 measures for inbound travellers, such as the Stay-Home Notice (SHN) and swab test requirements."
2021-08-02-T-039-S-00888,2021-08-02-T-039,888,He Ting Ru,asked the  Minister for Home Affairs
2021-08-02-T-039-S-00889,2021-08-02-T-039,889,K Shanmugam,"The Member's questions have been addressed in the speech made by the Minister for Home Affairs during the Statement on ""Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19"" at the 26 July 2021 Sitting. ["
2021-08-02-T-040-S-00890,2021-08-02-T-040,890,He Ting Ru,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs for each month since January 2020, how many short-term visit pass holders are present in Singapore on average."
2021-08-02-T-040-S-00891,2021-08-02-T-040,891,K Shanmugam,The number of short-term visit pass (STVP) holders in Singapore from January 2020 to June 2021 is provided in Table 1.
2021-08-02-T-041-S-00892,2021-08-02-T-041,892,Hazel Poa,asked the Minister for Law whether the Government has updated its position on the necessity for the implementation of a Good Samaritan law in Singapore.
2021-08-02-T-041-S-00893,2021-08-02-T-041,893,K Shanmugam,The Government has previously given its reasons for deciding that we did not need a Good Samaritan Law
2021-08-02-T-041-S-00894,2021-08-02-T-041,894,K Shanmugam,The Government’s position remains the same at this time. This position will be reviewed as necessary.
2021-08-02-T-042-S-00895,2021-08-02-T-042,895,Hazel Poa,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what are the reasons behind the second review of the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) taking eight years to complete; (b) what are the main contentious issues in the second review of CECA; and (c) what are the issues under review in the current third review of CECA.
2021-08-02-T-042-S-00896,2021-08-02-T-042,896,Gan Kim Yong,"MTI periodically reviews our trade agreements to keep them updated and relevant, given that economic interests, business models, regulations and trade flows between Singapore and its trade partners will change over time. All our Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), including CECA, have provisions to review and amend the agreements."
2021-08-02-T-042-S-00897,2021-08-02-T-042,897,Gan Kim Yong,"There is no prescribed timeline for negotiating or reviewing FTAs. During the Second Review of CECA, both parties carefully studied the proposed changes, conducted consultations, exchanged views and discussed counter-proposals before reaching an agreement on a mutually beneficial package of amendments. The Second Review expanded tariff concessions for an additional 30 products and updated the rules of origin. These provide more flexibility for Singapore exports into India to qualify for preferential tariffs under the agreement. Singapore exporters benefit as their products become more price-competitive in India, while Indian consumers gain from lower-priced goods."
2021-08-02-T-042-S-00898,2021-08-02-T-042,898,Gan Kim Yong,"Details of past and ongoing FTA negotiations between both parties are confidential. Revealing details, such as issues that are covered, would constitute a breach of confidentiality and erode trust in Singapore as a partner, making future negotiations more difficult. However, the outcome of the review is publicly available and the concluded text is published online."
2021-08-02-T-043-S-00899,2021-08-02-T-043,899,Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether nightlife businesses that pivot to other industries besides F&B receive Government assistance; (b) with only 18 nightlife businesses out of 400 taking up the Pivot Grant Support, what is the reason for the low take-up rate; and (c) how does the Ministry follow up with nightlife businesses after their licence to pivot to other commercial operations has been approved."
2021-08-02-T-043-S-00900,2021-08-02-T-043,900,Gan Kim Yong,"Nightlife businesses may apply for a pivot grant from Enterprise Singapore if they wish to pivot to other permitted activities, such as F&B, fitness gyms and co-working spaces."
2021-08-02-T-043-S-00901,2021-08-02-T-043,901,Gan Kim Yong,"Firms that accept the pivot grant are not permitted to resume their nightlife operations for at least 12 months, even if the nightlife sector is reopened. Based on industry feedback, some firms did not take up the pivot grant because of this moratorium, as they wanted the flexibility to resume their original nightlife activities if the nightlife sector reopened."
2021-08-02-T-043-S-00902,2021-08-02-T-043,902,Gan Kim Yong,"All firms which pivot, regardless of whether they receive a grant or not, must adhere to the relevant Safe Management Measures (SMMs) and regulatory requirements of its new sector. Firms which took up the pivot grant and were subsequently found to have breached SMMs or violated the permitted use of their premises will have their grant rescinded."
2021-08-02-T-044-S-00903,2021-08-02-T-044,903,Leong Mun Wai,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the Ministry’s forecast of job creation in the industries covered by Industry Transformation Maps; and (b) what steps is the Government taking to meet those demands.
2021-08-02-T-044-S-00904,2021-08-02-T-044,904,Gan Kim Yong,"The Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) were launched from 2016. From December 2016 to December 2019, total employment across the economy increased by about 111,400."
2021-08-02-T-044-S-00905,2021-08-02-T-044,905,Gan Kim Yong,"However, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our economic development. The Future Economy Council (FEC), chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, has, therefore, launched ITM 2025, to refresh all 23 ITMs to address the structural shifts from COVID-19. ITM 2025 reviews are currently in progress, and updates will be shared progressively."
2021-08-02-T-044-S-00906,2021-08-02-T-044,906,Gan Kim Yong,"Meanwhile, the Government continues to support our businesses and workers through this pandemic and prepare for a changed future. The SME Working Capital Loan and Temporary Bridging Loan Programme help businesses tide through these difficult times. Programmes such as the Jobs Support Scheme and Jobs Growth Incentive, encourage businesses to hire and retain their local staff. Tripartite partners are also working closely together to uplift the productivity and wages of our workers, create good jobs and prepare Singaporeans for future jobs and skills."
2021-08-02-T-045-S-00907,2021-08-02-T-045,907,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked  the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Government will consider working with the various hawkers’ and F&B associations to establish a centralised hawker food platform, to provide an open platform to all hawkers and assist, in particular, those less-technologically inclined."
2021-08-02-T-045-S-00908,2021-08-02-T-045,908,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Online  food delivery services can support and boost hawkers’ businesses, which have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic."
2021-08-02-T-045-S-00909,2021-08-02-T-045,909,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"There is no one-size-fits-all solution for all hawkers, as they have diverse profiles and considerations. The AfA is working together to drive actionable outcomes to support our hawkers, especially those who are less technologically savvy, through three workstreams, each co-led by industry and hawker representatives. The AfA aims to raise hawkers’ awareness of different online ordering platforms and enhance ease of adoption, work towards lower and more sustainable platform costs for hawkers through exploring different business models and increasing consumer awareness of hawkers’ online presence and activating consumer demand through digital and other means."
2021-08-02-T-045-S-00910,2021-08-02-T-045,910,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The AfA will complement existing community initiatives as well as Government schemes, such as NEA’s Food Delivery Support Scheme, which supported hawkers to onboard food delivery services and IMDA’s Hawkers Go Digital programme which supported hawkers to adopt e-payment. On the ground, Digital Ambassadors from SG Digital Office will continue to engage and support hawkers on their digitalisation journey, including getting onboard e-payment and online food delivery platforms. Details of AfA’s recommendations will be shared in the last quarter of 2021."
2021-08-02-T-046-S-00911,2021-08-02-T-046,911,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in light of the required closing of certain markets and hawker centres to try and contain the spread of COVID-19, whether the Government can consider a coordinated purchasing and distribution effort of safe food supplies to prevent mass wastage of supplies which have already been bought by the stallholders."
2021-08-02-T-046-S-00912,2021-08-02-T-046,912,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Many market stallholders receive their supplies on a daily basis. To minimise food wastage following the closure of the Jurong Fishery Port and some wet markets, the Singapore Food Agency and Enterprise Singapore quickly worked with distributors and supermarkets to activate alternative arrangements. These arrangements include diverting supplies directly to the supermarkets’ distribution centres and retail outlets."
2021-08-02-T-046-S-00913,2021-08-02-T-046,913,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We have been reviewing longer-term plans for this sector. Since 2020, SFA has been conducting studies on enhancements to the wholesale fresh produce sector and is working with the NEA to study our wet markets to better meet the future demands of consumers and industry. We will factor in lessons learnt from this episode to better future-proof the sector."
2021-08-02-T-047-S-00914,2021-08-02-T-047,914,Tan Wu Meng,asked the Minister for Education whether enrichment teachers at tuition centres and after-school care centres can be considered for vaccination priority in future vaccination exercises when COVID-19 vaccination boosters are needed.
2021-08-02-T-047-S-00915,2021-08-02-T-047,915,Chan Chun Sing,MOH is currently reviewing the emerging international and local data on COVID-19 booster vaccination.
2021-08-02-T-047-S-00916,2021-08-02-T-047,916,Chan Chun Sing,"Should booster shots be recommended to sustain a high level of protection among our population, MOH will determine how these shots are made available based on public health considerations and availability of vaccine supply. If prioritisation is required, MOE will work with MOH to determine how to prioritise eligible groups in the education sector."
2021-08-02-T-048-S-00917,2021-08-02-T-048,917,Jamus Jerome Lim,asked the Minister for Education what assistance is the Ministry offering to NTU to resolve the hall allocation issue faced by students.
2021-08-02-T-048-S-00918,2021-08-02-T-048,918,Chan Chun Sing,"NTU has residential hostels which cater to students who wish to live on-campus. Staying on-campus is not guaranteed by NTU except for Years 1 and 2 students. For Years 3 and 4 students applying for hall places, they are prioritised based on their participation in hostel activities and co-curricular activities (CCAs)."
2021-08-02-T-048-S-00919,2021-08-02-T-048,919,Chan Chun Sing,"This year, NTU saw exceptionally strong demand, with around 20% more applications for hostel places, compared to previous years. Some of these applications are from incoming new students while the rest are from existing students who wish to continue staying on-campus and those who had previously been staying off-campus but now wish to move into the NTU hostels."
2021-08-02-T-048-S-00920,2021-08-02-T-048,920,Chan Chun Sing,"In view of the higher risk of COVID-19 transmission associated with communal living arrangements, MOE has been working closely with the Autonomous Universities (AUs) since last year to put in place strict Safe Management Measures (SMMs) in the hostels to safeguard the health and well-being of students. This had reduced hostel capacity to minimise risks of transmission."
2021-08-02-T-048-S-00921,2021-08-02-T-048,921,Chan Chun Sing,"With vaccinations now well under way and the  expected strong take-up, MOE has worked with the AUs to allow more students to stay in hostels, with strict SMMs continuing to be in place."
2021-08-02-T-048-S-00922,2021-08-02-T-048,922,Chan Chun Sing,"With this increase, NTU has allocated more hostel places to students, including international students and those who would have been previously guaranteed a hall space under NTU’s two years’ guaranteed hall accommodation guideline. Students with exceptional circumstances are also considered on a case-by-case basis."
2021-08-02-T-048-S-00923,2021-08-02-T-048,923,Chan Chun Sing,"For students who have not been allocated a hostel space and have difficulty finding housing options, NTU has been helping them to find alternative accommodation. To better support its students, NTU is also expanding the coverage and increasing the frequency of its island-wide shuttle bus services to support students’ travel from pick-up points near their places of residence to campus."
2021-08-02-T-049-S-00924,2021-08-02-T-049,924,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for Education (a) to date, what are the COVID-19 vaccination rates for students aged 12 to 18; and (b) whether students will be given priority timings on vaccinations to ensure minimal disruptions to their school schedules."
2021-08-02-T-049-S-00925,2021-08-02-T-049,925,Chan Chun Sing,"Based on actual vaccination rates to date and appointment bookings, by end-July, over 90% of eligible students aged between 12 to 18 in MOE schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) would have received at least their first vaccination dose. Over 70% of these students would have received both doses. This figure is expected to reach 80% by early-August and about 90% by early-September."
2021-08-02-T-049-S-00926,2021-08-02-T-049,926,Chan Chun Sing,"To take full advantage of the June holidays, students were prioritised and invited to sign up for their vaccination from 1 June 2021. Students sitting for the GCE ""N"", ""O"" and ""A"" Level examinations or equivalent qualifications in the second- half of 2021 were the first to receive their invitations to be vaccinated. This gave graduating students greater flexibility to schedule their vaccination appointments in view of their upcoming national examinations. By end-July, over 80% of the graduating GCE ""N"", ""O"" and ""A"" Level cohorts would have received both doses."
2021-08-02-T-049-S-00927,2021-08-02-T-049,927,Chan Chun Sing,"Students in schools and IHLs whose vaccination appointments are during school hours, as well as those feeling unwell from the side effects of the vaccine, are given time off and assistance to minimise the impact of missed lessons. In addition, there is currently ample capacity in our community Vaccination Centres to allow for students to readily change their appointments to minimise disruptions to their school schedules."
2021-08-02-T-050-S-00928,2021-08-02-T-050,928,Hazel Poa,"asked the Minister for Finance (a) how many China- and India-headquartered companies and subsidiaries of such companies in the finance, ICT and professional services sectors are currently engaged by the Government as contractors; (b) what is the total value of these contracts; and (c) what is the number of Singaporeans employed by these companies."
2021-08-02-T-050-S-00929,2021-08-02-T-050,929,Lawrence Wong,"Government procurement is conducted according to the principles of transparency, open and fair competition. Contracts are awarded to suppliers who are best able"
2021-08-02-T-050-S-00930,2021-08-02-T-050,930,Lawrence Wong,"In 2020, Government engaged more than 1,400 suppliers for ICT, finance and other professional services, of which 86% are located in Singapore. These entities won about 97% of the approximately $1.5 billion contract value awarded by the Government for these services. MOM publishes statistics on the number of employed residents by industry sector in the Labour Force in Singapore reports which are published annually and available publicly on MOM’s website."
2021-08-02-T-051-S-00931,2021-08-02-T-051,931,Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development how does the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) ensure that there are sufficient numbers of infant care centres, childcare centres and kindergarten places in each constituency."
2021-08-02-T-051-S-00932,2021-08-02-T-051,932,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"ECDA plans for preschool demand by urban planning divisions known as Planning Areas, taking into consideration factors, such as demographics, local enrolment trends and existing supply. To meet the preschool needs of young families, ECDA then works closely with agencies, such as HDB and URA, to develop new centres in tandem with new public housing developments, and set aside space for preschools in private housing developments through the Government Land Sales programme respectively. Where required, ECDA also facilitates the development of preschools in community and commercial premises, as well as on vacant state land."
2021-08-02-T-051-S-00933,2021-08-02-T-051,933,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As demand changes over time, ECDA regularly reviews plans and closely monitors the preschool enrolment and availability in each Planning Area. Should local demand shift and exceed earlier expectations, ECDA works with preschools and HDB to activate more void deck and communal spaces for centre extensions, where available."
2021-08-02-T-051-S-00934,2021-08-02-T-051,934,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"To date, the rising demand for preschool places has been primarily for full-day childcare. This is due to the growing prevalence of dual-income families and more grandparents working. We have therefore significantly increased the national supply of full-day infant and childcare places by 50% since 2015 – from 125,000 to about 190,000 places today. These new preschool places are concentrated in areas with more young families. For example, in the two newer planning areas, Punggol and Sengkang, the number of infant and childcare places has increased by 90% since 2015."
2021-08-02-T-051-S-00935,2021-08-02-T-051,935,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For families that prefer half-day kindergarten services, we ensure that accessible, affordable and quality kindergarten services are provided by Anchor Operators and MOE. These centres are distributed across various locations in Singapore. More MOE Kindergartens (MKs), which also offer an optional Kindergarten Care (KCare) service for parents who require full-day services, will be developed in areas of demand. The total number of MKs will increase from 36 today to about 60 by 2025."
2021-08-02-T-051-S-00936,2021-08-02-T-051,936,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"By 2023, ECDA will develop another 10,000 new full-day preschool places, mainly in Planning Areas with upcoming HDB developments for new families. As families' demand for infant care, childcare and kindergarten change over time due to various factors, including COVID-19 which may alter working arrangements, ECDA will continue to regularly review its plans and strive to ensure adequate preschool provision in each Planning Area for families."
2021-08-02-T-052-S-00937,2021-08-02-T-052,937,Sitoh Yih Pin,"asked  the Minister for Social and Family Development in the past three years, how many cases of Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPAs) involved fraud or abuse."
2021-08-02-T-052-S-00938,2021-08-02-T-052,938,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Since 2018 to date, there was one case where the powers of the donee under the Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) were curtailed by the Court on grounds of financial abuse. We have more than 120,000 LPAs registered as of May 2021."
2021-08-02-T-052-S-00939,2021-08-02-T-052,939,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) encourages anyone who knows, suspects or believes that a person who lacks capacity is being neglected and/or needs care or protection, to report it to the OPG. The Mental Capacity Act protects the identity of the whistle-blower when such reports are made."
2021-08-02-T-053-S-00940,2021-08-02-T-053,940,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what are the criteria for a case handled by a Family Service Centre (FSC) to be considered as an active case and eligible for funding from the Ministry; and (b) whether the Ministry is reviewing these criteria.
2021-08-02-T-053-S-00941,2021-08-02-T-053,941,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Family Service Centres (FSCs) serve individuals and families who need help addressing their social needs. FSC cases are considered active and eligible for funding when they have registered at least one 20-minute casework session within  each quarter
2021-08-02-T-053-S-00942,2021-08-02-T-053,942,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"From April 2021, MSF revised the criteria for ""active"" cases taking into account the COVID-19 pandemic, to also fund cases with case sessions conducted by remote modes of communication, such as phone text exchanges and emails."
2021-08-02-T-054-S-00943,2021-08-02-T-054,943,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many calls has the National Care Hotline received between 1 August 2020 and 1 August 2021; and (b) whether there are any trends which have been detected in terms of the issues faced by callers.
2021-08-02-T-054-S-00944,2021-08-02-T-054,944,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Mental well-being is a pertinent issue, and has been brought to the fore by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the start of the circuit breaker, MSF and MOH set up a dedicated National CARE Hotline, to provide emotional and psychological first aid to those who have been affected by COVID-19."
2021-08-02-T-054-S-00945,2021-08-02-T-054,945,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The hotline has managed over 45,000 calls since it commenced operations in April 2020. The number of calls managed by the hotline has decreased from a monthly average of 9,800 during the circuit breaker period to an average of 1,600 calls in recent months. Since the inception of the hotline, the common issues faced by callers have consistently included the need for emotional support, mental health, as well as marital and family issues. Callers who need further psychological help are referred to public healthcare institutions or community service providers for follow-up."
2021-08-02-T-055-S-00946,2021-08-02-T-055,946,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether HSA will consider public education for Singaporeans on identifying medical and surgical masks that meet the EN 14683/ASTM F2100 standards; and (b) whether HSA will require e-commerce platforms to check that the surgical masks that they sell are of the necessary standard.
2021-08-02-T-055-S-00947,2021-08-02-T-055,947,Ong Ye Kung,"HSA has published a guideline titled ""What you need to know about masks"" which provides information on the specifications of good quality medical and surgical masks. HSA also licenses manufacturers of medical and surgical masks, which requires them to meet standards, such as the EN 14683 or ASTM F2100, which are adopted by the European Union and USA respectively. A list of locally-manufactured medical and surgical masks that have been tested and verified to meet these standards has also been published by HSA on their website."
2021-08-02-T-055-S-00948,2021-08-02-T-055,948,Ong Ye Kung,"Importers of medical and surgical masks are required to notify HSA and submit test reports to show that their products meet a minimum bacterial filtration efficiency based on the EN 14683 or ASTM F2100. HSA also engages the various e-commerce platform administrators on an ongoing basis, to check on the vendors selling medical and surgical masks on their platforms and ensure that the masks on sale are from HSA-licensed local manufacturers or importers with evidence of import notification to HSA."
2021-08-02-T-056-S-00949,2021-08-02-T-056,949,Tan Yia Swam,"asked the Minister for Health (a) of the 13.6 million swab tests that have been performed, what is the breakdown into (i) symptomatic patients, (ii) close contacts of confirmed positive COVID-19 cases and (iii) Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) respectively; and (b) how many positive cases were picked up after symptomatic patients had the deep nasal swab and RRT respectively."
2021-08-02-T-056-S-00950,2021-08-02-T-056,950,Ong Ye Kung,"Testing is a key enabler in our efforts to contain COVID-19. As of 30 June 2021, 1,176 of close to 127,000 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) swab tests conducted on close contacts of COVID-19 infected individuals were found to be COVID-19 positive. Additionally, about 959,000 PCR swab tests were conducted on individuals who had respiratory symptoms and presented themselves at our Public Health Preparedness Clinics and Polyclinics. Of these, about 255 tested COVID-19 positive."
2021-08-02-T-056-S-00951,2021-08-02-T-056,951,Ong Ye Kung,"Workers in higher risk settings such as our borders, the Construction, Marine and Process (CMP) sectors, inpatient healthcare, as well those living in high density environments, such as dorms, undergo rostered routine testing (RRT). As of 30 June 2021, there are about 550,000 workers who are undergoing PCR RRT, of which, 536 of them had tested COVID-19 positive."
2021-08-02-T-056-S-00952,2021-08-02-T-056,952,Ong Ye Kung,"RRT allows us to detect and ringfence cases early. It protects workers and limits the spread of COVID-19 by allowing us to detect spread early and to intervene. RRT also helps us focus public health resources where it is needed. Positive test results allow rapid intervention to protect workplaces and the community. Negative test results are also useful as it provides reassurance to the workers and their clients, and allow these groups of employees in critical roles, to avoid facing further restrictions on social activities."
2021-08-02-T-057-S-00953,2021-08-02-T-057,953,Gerald Giam Yean Song,asked the Minister for Health how individuals who have allergic reactions to their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and are prevented from getting their second dose will be able to eventually attain “fully vaccinated” status.
2021-08-02-T-057-S-00954,2021-08-02-T-057,954,Ong Ye Kung,This question for written answer has been addressed by oral reply to Question Nos 4 and 5 standing on the Order Paper for 2 August 2021. [
2021-08-02-T-058-S-00955,2021-08-02-T-058,955,Sitoh Yih Pin,asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether there is an expectation that the fifth consecutive quarter rise in private property prices will continue in the foreseeable future; and (b) whether there are any plans by the Government to manage this trend.
2021-08-02-T-058-S-00956,2021-08-02-T-058,956,Desmond Lee,"The increase in private housing prices since the second quarter of 2020 reflects broad-based demand for housing, supported by the low interest rate environment. However, the pace of price increases slowed in the second quarter of 2021, with prices increasing by 0.8% quarter-on-quarter, compared to the 3.3% increase in the first quarter of 2021."
2021-08-02-T-058-S-00957,2021-08-02-T-058,957,Desmond Lee,"As has been previously communicated, the Government’s intent is to ensure a stable and sustainable property market, where prices move broadly in line with economic fundamentals. To this end, the Government continues to monitor economic and property market conditions closely."
2021-08-02-T-059-S-00958,2021-08-02-T-059,958,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the measures adopted by NParks to control the population of birds in HDB housing estates or assist in the relocation of birds in a sustainable and humane way in order to reduce the noise disturbances caused to residents in areas where there is an over population of birds roosting in trees; and (b) whether NParks is studying other innovative ways or collaborating with other agencies in such measures.
2021-08-02-T-059-S-00959,2021-08-02-T-059,959,Desmond Lee,"NParks adopts a holistic, science-based approach to manage the population of birds in Singapore, comprising measures, such as habitat modification, food source reduction and population control."
2021-08-02-T-059-S-00960,2021-08-02-T-059,960,Desmond Lee,"At HDB housing estates, NParks carries out habitat modification, such as the directional pruning of trees. The intent is to deter birds, such as crows and mynahs, from perching and to break up large roosts. NParks also works with Town Councils to remove the nests and to replace certain tree species with suitable ones to discourage roosting. In addition, NParks carries out studies to understand the ecology of birds, such as their roosting patterns and movements, to support its bird management strategies."
2021-08-02-T-059-S-00961,2021-08-02-T-059,961,Desmond Lee,"To reduce the availability of food sources, NParks works closely with SFA, NEA and Town Councils to encourage proper food waste management at food establishments around HDB housing estates and to enforce against littering and illegal bird-feeding. NParks also partners agencies and Town Councils to educate the community on proper refuse management."
2021-08-02-T-059-S-00962,2021-08-02-T-059,962,Desmond Lee,"NParks will continue to work closely with agencies to enhance its bird management strategies to reduce bird-related disamenities, such as noise disturbances caused to residents."
2021-08-02-T-060-S-00963,2021-08-02-T-060,963,Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether the Government is working with ticketing companies offering online streaming services to introduce age gates so that arts groups can produce non- ""G"" rated work digitally and still enjoy access to funding from the Digital Presentation Grant for the Arts (DPG)."
2021-08-02-T-060-S-00964,2021-08-02-T-060,964,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"MCCY and the National Arts Council (NAC) introduced the Arts and Culture Resilience Package (ACRP) in April 2020 to protect the arts and culture ecosystem, provide support and opportunities for arts and culture practitioners and help them develop longer-term capabilities for the post-COVID-19 recovery. The ACRP included support for arts and culture practitioners to present their works in digital form through grants, such as the Digital Presentation Grant for the Arts (DPG). These grants sought to generate work opportunities for arts groups and artists, and build industry capabilities in digital content production, while enabling new offerings for Singaporeans."
2021-08-02-T-060-S-00965,2021-08-02-T-060,965,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The DPG was open from April to September 2020, for projects to be completed by March 2021. It was well-received by the arts community, with NAC extending the application window from June to September 2020 to cater to demand. The DPG supported close to 700 digital projects that offered innovative digital content to Singaporeans, and generated over 9,000 work opportunities."
2021-08-02-T-060-S-00966,2021-08-02-T-060,966,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"NAC's objective was for content supported by the DPG to be as inclusive and accessible as possible, to reach as many audiences, including young children, and introduce them to the offerings of our arts groups and artists. In addition, online content is easily and generally available and it is not always feasible to enforce age-appropriateness for online content. This made it prudent for the DPG to underwrite productions suitable for the general public."
2021-08-02-T-060-S-00967,2021-08-02-T-060,967,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Since the closing of applications for the DPG, arts practitioners have been able to apply to NAC’s enhanced Presentation and Participation Grant to support activities and works in digital or hybrid formats. NAC has also continued to provide its regular grant schemes and commissions which have been enhanced to include digital works and presentations. These cover wide-ranging works, including those with a higher-than-General rating."
2021-08-02-T-061-S-00968,2021-08-02-T-061,968,Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) for the past three years, what is the number and proportion of foreign domestic workers (FDWs) who are diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) following commencement of employment in Singapore; (b) how many of these FDWs are medically assessed to be infectious and have insurance coverage for TB treatment; and (c) what can be done to help employers whose FDWs are diagnosed with TB."
2021-08-02-T-061-S-00969,2021-08-02-T-061,969,Tan See Leng,"Employers are responsible for their Migrant Domestic Workers’ (MDW) medical expenses. To support employers in meeting their obligations, employers are required to purchase mandatory medical insurance of at least $15,000 coverage for inpatient care and surgery. This amount has been sufficient in covering about 95% of MDWs’ inpatient or day surgery bills. MOM is reviewing the medical insurance coverage for Work Permit and S Pass holders to strengthen the protection for MDWs and their employers while keeping costs affordable."
2021-08-02-T-061-S-00970,2021-08-02-T-061,970,Tan See Leng,"To Dr Tan Wu Meng’s specific question about TB, all MDWs are required to be screened for active TB, including having a chest X-ray, within two weeks of arrival in Singapore. This is done prior to the start of employment, and another time upon two years of stay in Singapore. From 2018 to 2020, about 300 MDWs (0.1% of MDW population) per year were diagnosed with active TB after commencing employment in Singapore, that is, after their Work Permits were issued. Anyone diagnosed with active TB will be treated immediately to reduce the risk of further transmission."
2021-08-02-T-061-S-00971,2021-08-02-T-061,971,Tan See Leng,"The large majority of TB cases are managed via outpatient treatment. In rare cases where the disease leads to complications, the MDW may need to be hospitalised for further treatment. Like for Singaporeans, the full cost of hospitalisation for MDWs referred under MOH’s National TB Programme is paid for. For outpatient treatment under the National TB programme, while the medication under Directly Observed Treatment is free, MDWs would, nonetheless, incur consultation and other testing costs. Employers who face difficulties paying for their MDWs’ medical bills may approach the medical social workers at the public health institutions for assistance."
2021-08-02-T-062-S-00972,2021-08-02-T-062,972,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what are the measures and training provided to foreign domestic workers or other migrant workers to raise awareness of their rights and protection under the laws of Singapore in order to protect them against any mistreatment, abuse or violence perpetrated upon them; and (b) whether such measures include counselling and psychiatric support in their own language for any survivors of such violence."
2021-08-02-T-062-S-00973,2021-08-02-T-062,973,Tan See Leng,"Migrant Domestic Workers (MDWs) and Migrant Workers (MWs) attend their respective Settling-In-Programmes (SIPs) conducted in the workers' native languages and are educated on their employment rights, Singapore's laws and channels to seek help. For example, they are advised to call the Police if they are subjected to any physical abuse. The workers are also advised to seek help on employment issues and well-being matters using the hotlines set up by MOM, the Centre for Domestic Employees (CDE) or Migrant Workers' Centre (MWC)."
2021-08-02-T-062-S-00974,2021-08-02-T-062,974,Tan See Leng,"The SIP also covers topics related to mental well-being, such as relationship and stress management tips, to help workers adjust to working and living in a new environment. Apart from the SIP, reminders with mental health messages, such as adopting healthy habits to manage stress and identifying early signs of distress, are disseminated regularly to the MWs and MDWs via the FWMOMCare application and e-newsletters."
2021-08-02-T-062-S-00975,2021-08-02-T-062,975,Tan See Leng,"MOM partners non-governmental organisations (NGO)1 to provide a range of assistance to the workers who are victims of abuse or violence. For example, MWC, CDE and HealthServe operate counselling hotlines to provide mental health support to MWs and MDWs in six native languages2 at any time and not only after an incidence of abuse. CDE also operates a shelter for MDWs where counselling services and legal advice are made available free of charge. MWC and CDE also worked with Law Society Pro Bono Services to offer free legal advisory services to MWs and MDWs."
2021-08-02-T-062-S-00976,2021-08-02-T-062,976,Tan See Leng,"The Assurance Care and Engagement (ACE) Group of MOM is strengthening the mental health support ecosystem for MWs through Project DAWN. Under the programme, peer support leaders among MWs are trained to lend a listening ear and administer psychological first aid. ACE officers deployed to the dormitories are also being trained to provide mental health support to MWs. MWs also have access to primary healthcare services, such as the regional medical centres and telemedicine, for mental health assessment, intervention and follow up. MWs who require specialist psychiatric services are also promptly referred, when required."
2021-08-02-T-063-S-00977,2021-08-02-T-063,977,Leong Mun Wai,"asked  the Minister for Manpower from 2005 to 2020, how many intra-corporate transferees, foreign professionals and dependants who have initially entered Singapore respectively through the Movement of Natural Persons provisions in the various free trade agreements subsequently (i) became citizens (ii) became Permanent Residents or (iii) re-entered Singapore’s workforce through another type of visa."
2021-08-02-T-063-S-00978,2021-08-02-T-063,978,Tan See Leng,"Our records prior to 2014 do not distinguish between applications from overseas intra-corporate transferees (ICT) invoking provisions in the World Trade Organisation’s General Agreement on Trade in Services (WTO GATS) or other Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). For overseas ICT applications invoking WTO GATS or FTA provisions, they are exempted from the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) job advertising requirement introduced in 2014 because it would be illogical for a company to advertise a position intended for an existing employee. However, they are subject to additional checks to verify their eligibility under the WTO GATS or FTA provisions. These include their seniority, employment history and relevant work experience. They are also subject to more conditions in their eligibility to bring in dependants, as well as apply for permanent residency or future employment in Singapore. Under WTO GATS and all FTAs, the Government retains full rights to decide who can enter the country to live, work and become PRs or citizens."
2021-08-02-T-063-S-00979,2021-08-02-T-063,979,Tan See Leng,"Out of the overseas ICTs who have come in via WTO GATS or FTA provisions between 2014 and 2020, on average, around 30 persons a year have acquired permanent residency or citizenship."
2021-08-02-T-063-S-00980,2021-08-02-T-063,980,Tan See Leng,"Between 2014 and 2020, on average, around 140 persons a year who initially came in via WTO GATS or FTA provisions subsequently obtained another work pass that was processed and approved under the prevailing criteria. This is a negligible share of the overall number of EP holders approved each year, under our prevailing criteria."
2021-08-02-T-063-S-00981,2021-08-02-T-063,981,Tan See Leng,"As for foreign professionals, the 6 July 2021 Ministerial Statements already explained that the professions listed in the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) do not have any bearing on how we decide on work pass applications. Their applications have to meet our prevailing work pass criteria. Similarly, all dependants who wish to enter are also subject to the usual prevailing criteria. It is, therefore, meaningless to ask how many of them entered through our FTAs."
2021-08-02-T-064-S-00982,2021-08-02-T-064,982,Leong Mun Wai,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the relevant dependency ratio ceiling applies to companies who supply labour to the construction, marine and process (CMP) sector and services sector; (b) to date, what are the types and respective numbers of violations that the Ministry has discovered with regard to recruitment of foreigners in these sectors; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider resuming regular publications of the Employment Agency (EA) Enforcement Digest on the Ministry’s website that contains such information."
2021-08-02-T-064-S-00983,2021-08-02-T-064,983,Tan See Leng,"Labour supplying of foreign workers by the employer to another company is only allowed within the construction and process sectors and not in the marine sector. The employer of the foreign worker continues to be subject to the dependency ratio ceiling (DRC). Companies that supply their own labour to another company are not required to obtain an employment agency (EA) licence, unless they perform EA work."
2021-08-02-T-064-S-00984,2021-08-02-T-064,984,Tan See Leng,"EAs perform work to facilitate the recruitment and hiring of workers by their client companies. The EA Enforcement Digest was introduced in 2016 to share enforcement statistics on common EA infringements with the industry. The statistics provided in the Digest are for infringements across the whole EA industry, where the clients come from all sectors. They are not specific to the construction, marine and process (CMP) sectors. The most common infringements in the EA industry were contravening EA licence conditions and performing EA activities without an EA licence. In the CMP sectors, common offences committed by employers include illegal employment and unacceptable accommodation."
2021-08-02-T-064-S-00985,2021-08-02-T-064,985,Tan See Leng,"Since 2019, instead of publishing the Digest, MOM has engaged the EA industry through small-group sessions involving the relevant associations and electronic mailers to the industry, such as EA alerts. These have been effective in ground sensing and updating the industry on compliance issues."
2021-08-02-T-065-S-00986,2021-08-02-T-065,986,Hazel Poa,"asked the Minister for Manpower, to date, what is the total number of work passes that have been issued to foreign nationals (not restricted to Indian nationals) who belong to any of the 127 professions listed under Annex 9A of the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA)."
2021-08-02-T-065-S-00987,2021-08-02-T-065,987,Tan See Leng,"I refer to the reply to Question No. 29 for written answer standing on the Order Paper for 2 August 2021 filed by Mr Leong Mun Wai. It was already explained in the 6 July Ministerial Statements that the 127 professions listed under Annex 9A of CECA do not have any bearing on our assessment of work pass applications. In processing work pass applications, the Ministry does not ask if an applicant is seeking to enter under Annex 9A of CECA as there is no such route. All foreigners who wish to work in Singapore need to meet the prevailing work pass criteria before they are granted a work pass. As such, the Ministry does not track or report employment data based on the occupational grouping requested by the Member."
2021-08-02-T-065-S-00988,2021-08-02-T-065,988,Tan See Leng,"Moreover, it is not meaningful to look at the number of non-Indian professionals belonging to any of the 127 professions, as requested by the Member. A foreign professional from any other country would be unlikely to have any link to India or CECA."
2021-08-02-T-065-S-00989,2021-08-02-T-065,989,Tan See Leng,"Nevertheless, if the Member is interested to know broadly the share of work pass holders (all nationalities) amongst all workers under the much broader Singapore Standard Occupational Classification (SSOC) Group 2 (Professionals)1, the answer is that they make up less than one-quarter of all employed persons in SSOC Group 2."
2021-08-02-T-066-S-00990,2021-08-02-T-066,990,Leong Mun Wai,"asked the Minister for Manpower with regard to the more than 270,000 locals hired under the Jobs Growth Incentive as of February 2021 (a) which industries are the beneficiaries; (b) how many Singaporean Citizens have been hired; and (c) what is the breakdown of these locals by monthly salary bands of (i) less than $3,000 (ii) $3,000 to less than $4,500 (iii) $4,500 to less than $6,000 (iv) $6,000 to less than $10,000 and (v) $10,000 and above."
2021-08-02-T-066-S-00991,2021-08-02-T-066,991,Tan See Leng,"Based on the latest available data, the Jobs Growth Incentive (JGI) has supported the hiring of  more than 270,000 locals"
2021-08-02-T-066-S-00992,2021-08-02-T-066,992,Tan See Leng,"We question the Progress Singapore Party’s fixation on drawing lines among locals. Permanent Residents may have spouses or dependants who are Singapore Citizens, and providing employment facilitation support allows them to continue supporting these Singaporean family members. In any case, the proportion of JGI-supported hires who are Singapore Citizens is similar to the proportion of Singapore Citizens in the resident labour force."
2021-08-02-T-066-S-00993,2021-08-02-T-066,993,Tan See Leng,"The top hiring sectors were Food Services, Wholesale Trade, Professional Services, Retail, and Information and Communications. The median wage of JGI-supported hires between September 2020 and February 2021 ranges from around $3,900 in the Information and Communications sector, around $3,000 in the Professional Services sector, around $1,900 in the Wholesale Trade sector to $1,400 in the Retail and Food Services sectors. The median wage of JGI-supported hires in each sector was higher than the median wage of all new hires in the same sector, over the same period. As mentioned in the 22nd Jobs Situation Report, six in 10 of the JGI-supported hires earned the same or higher wages, compared to their previous jobs."
2021-08-02-T-067-S-00994,2021-08-02-T-067,994,Leong Mun Wai,"asked the Minister for Manpower what are the respective current numbers of Work Permit holders who earn basic wages (i) from $3,000 to less than $4,500 and (ii) more than $4,500."
2021-08-02-T-067-S-00995,2021-08-02-T-067,995,Tan See Leng,"As of December 2020, excluding migrant domestic workers, the median fixed monthly salary of Work Permit Holders (WPHs) is around $1,100. Nearly all WPHs (about 98%) earn less than $3,000 per month."
2021-08-02-T-067-S-00996,2021-08-02-T-067,996,Tan See Leng,"We would also like to remind the member that WPHs are subjected to quotas and levies, which vary by sector. In addition, employers are required to meet additional conditions, including source restrictions and security bond requirements. WPHs are also required to go for six-monthly medical examinations, and face marriage and pregnancy restrictions."
