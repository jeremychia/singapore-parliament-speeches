2021-09-13-T-001,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport and Minister in-charge of Trade Relations (Mr S Iswaran) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Mr Speaker, on behalf of Minister Gan Kim Yong. In August, MTI projected that the Singapore economy would expand by 6% to 7% in 2021, taking into account several developments.",1,2,2021-09-13-T-001-S-00002
2021-09-13-T-001,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport and Minister in-charge of Trade Relations (Mr S Iswaran) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"One, the global economic recovery has remained largely on track, notwithstanding the risks posed by the pandemic. High vaccination rates in key advanced economies such as the US and Eurozone have allowed them to press on with reopening even amidst a rise in infections. While regional economies have had to reimpose tight restrictions to curb a resurgence in cases, they are also ramping up vaccination efforts, which should facilitate the resumption of economic activities in the coming quarters.",2,3,2021-09-13-T-001-S-00003
2021-09-13-T-001,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport and Minister in-charge of Trade Relations (Mr S Iswaran) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Two, Singapore's GDP growth in the first half of the year came in at a better-than-expected 7.7% on a year-on-year basis. In particular, the outward-oriented sectors continued to grow strongly, with the manufacturing and finance and insurance sectors achieving growth of 14.5% and 7.4% respectively during this period. At the same time, our vaccination programme has made good progress, which will allow for the progressive easing of domestic and border restrictions over the course of the year.",3,4,2021-09-13-T-001-S-00004
2021-09-13-T-001,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport and Minister in-charge of Trade Relations (Mr S Iswaran) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Barring a major setback in the global economy, the growth of outward-oriented sectors will remain healthy in the second half of the year. The progressive easing of domestic and border restrictions will also help to support the recovery of consumer-facing sectors such as food and beverage services, and alleviate labour shortages in sectors that are reliant on migrant workers such as construction. On the other hand, the tourism- and aviation-related sectors are likely to see a slow recovery due to ongoing global travel restrictions and weak travel demand.",4,5,2021-09-13-T-001-S-00005
2021-09-13-T-001,S Iswaran,The Minister for Transport and Minister in-charge of Trade Relations (Mr S Iswaran) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Looking ahead to 2022, MTI expects the Singapore economy to continue to recover as global growth is projected to remain positive. MTI will announce Singapore's 2022 GDP growth forecast in November 2021.",5,6,2021-09-13-T-001-S-00006
2021-09-13-T-002,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair,asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether the current political situation in Malaysia has any implications for Singapore.,1,7,2021-09-13-T-002-S-00007
2021-09-13-T-002,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs in light of Malaysia’s recent change of government (a) whether he can provide an update on our bilateral ties with Malaysia; and (b) how the Government will move forward on the many bilateral partnerships with Malaysia such as the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link and COVID-19 border control measures.,1,8,2021-09-13-T-002-S-00008
2021-09-13-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 2 and 3 together?",1,9,2021-09-13-T-002-S-00009

2021-09-13-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Mr Speaker, Malaysia will always be our closest neighbour. This is a geographical fact. Our long-term relationship will always be bound by the ties of kinship, culture, history and economic interdependence. A stable and prosperous Malaysia is good for Singapore and indeed, good for our region. Naturally, the Singapore Government watches developments in Malaysia very closely.",1,11,2021-09-13-T-002-S-00011
2021-09-13-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"As Members of the House would be aware, there has been a change in leadership in Malaysia. Its new Cabinet, led by Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob, was sworn in on 21 August 2021. Prime Minister Lee spoke with Prime Minister Ismail Sabri the very next morning. Many Singapore Ministers have also established or renewed contact with their Malaysian counterparts. Singapore’s consistent position is to work with the government of the day.",2,12,2021-09-13-T-002-S-00012
2021-09-13-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Mr Speaker, we have enjoyed good relations with successive Malaysian governments and leaders, and we have cooperated well with them across a wide range of areas. For example, we cooperated closely with the previous government led by former Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, including contributing medical supplies and test kits. We acted quickly in the early days of the pandemic to set up the Singapore-Malaysia Special Working Committee on COVID-19, which was co-chaired by Senior Minister and the Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean and then-Senior Minister and Minister of Defence of Malaysia Ismail Sabri, in order to coordinate both countries’ measures to respond to COVID-19, and minimise disruptions to our companies, workers and citizens. We also launched several travel arrangements, such as the safe movement of cargo trucks, the Periodic Commuting Arrangement for workers and a framework for Death and Critically Ill Emergency Visits. These travel arrangements will continue.",3,13,2021-09-13-T-002-S-00013
2021-09-13-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Our leaders are familiar with Prime Minister Ismail Sabri and his Cabinet members. We have worked with them on many bilateral and regional issues. Prime Minister Ismail Sabri and I have known each other from the days when we were both the Ministers for Youth and Sports. That was some time ago. We also met during my more recent visit to Malaysia in March earlier this year, when we discussed COVID-19 safeguards and cross-border travel arrangements. My counterpart – Minister of Foreign Affairs Saifuddin Abdullah – is also a familiar face. We worked closely together when he held the Foreign Affairs portfolio between 2018 and 2020. Besides the political leadership, our respective civil service maintains good relations and communications with each other and officials on both sides are in regular contact.",4,14,2021-09-13-T-002-S-00014
2021-09-13-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Singapore remains committed to maintaining a constructive and positive relationship with the current Malaysian government. We will also follow through with our commitments on bilateral projects and our partnerships on the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link Project and COVID-19 border control measures. On the RTS Link Project, Singapore and Malaysia reached an agreement to resume the project in July last year. Construction has in fact commenced on both sides and there has been good progress. The RTS Link will be a game changer when it commences service at the end of 2026. We look forward to it significantly improving connectivity between Singapore and Johor Bahru, and easing congestion on the Causeway.",5,15,2021-09-13-T-002-S-00015
2021-09-13-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"We are continuing discussions with the Malaysian government on the safe and gradual resumption of cross-border movement of people as we enter the endemic phase. This will require mutually agreed public health protocols to preserve the public health and safety of residents on both sides, whilst taking into account the medical resources available. For example, both sides are currently working towards recognising each other’s vaccine certificates. These discussions have been fruitful and we hope that this can map our path forward for a safe and gradual reopening of our borders when the situation permits it.",6,16,2021-09-13-T-002-S-00016
2021-09-13-T-002,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,Singapore and Malaysia will always be closely intertwined and interdependent. We are committed to engaging and cooperating with the new Malaysian government to seek win-win outcomes. This is especially important in order for both our countries to recover and emerge stronger together from the COVID-19 pandemic situation. And I am confident that our bilateral cooperation will continue to expand for the mutual benefit of citizens on both sides.,7,17,2021-09-13-T-002-S-00017
2021-09-13-T-003,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"asked the Minister for Finance (a) what action does the Government intend to take with respect to irregularities found in audited documents reported in the Report of the Auditor-General for FY2020/2021 where documents were altered, backdated, artificially created and falsified by officers across three Ministries and two Statutory Boards; (b) how many investigations have been undertaken arising from these irregularities; (c) how many individuals are involved for each Ministry and Statutory Board; and (d) what specific action has been taken against officers in cases where investigations have concluded.",1,18,2021-09-13-T-003-S-00018
2021-09-13-T-003,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Finance (a) in the past five years, what are the types of recurring themes for issues flagged out by the AGO; (b) which are the Ministries and agencies that are repeatedly flagged out by the AGO; (c) why do these lapses and violations keep recurring; and (d) what action is taken to prevent their recurrence.",1,19,2021-09-13-T-003-S-00019
2021-09-13-T-003,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Mr Speaker, Sir, Question Nos 4 to 11 are Parliamentary Questions (PQs) pertaining to the AGO report.

The PQs will be answered by the Ministers from the relevant Ministry and thereafter, for supplementary PQs to be asked.",1,20,2021-09-13-T-003-S-00020

2021-09-13-T-003,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Carry on.,1,23,2021-09-13-T-003-S-00023
2021-09-13-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Members have asked questions about various lapses and irregularities highlighted in the AGO report. Let me first provide an overview, before I address the specific questions by Mr Singh and Mr Yip.",1,24,2021-09-13-T-003-S-00024
2021-09-13-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The Government’s approach to governance is one of responsibility, transparency and accountability. To that end, we have put in place governance structures at the whole-of-Government (WOG) and agency levels to ensure proper accountability for the use of public funds.",2,25,2021-09-13-T-003-S-00025
2021-09-13-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"At the WOG level, we have rules and guidelines on financial controls for public agencies carrying out finance functions. Central agencies such as the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) and Grants Governance Office in MOF oversee common functional areas and work with agencies to ensure robust internal controls. MOF has recently set up the Government Procurement Function Office. There are also ongoing efforts to review policies and processes and strengthen capabilities, particularly for more complex areas such as IT and construction.",3,26,2021-09-13-T-003-S-00026
2021-09-13-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"At the agency level, enterprise risk management and system controls are in place. Regular internal audits are conducted. The management of development projects and facility management are specialised areas requiring deeper technical expertise and experience. In addition to raising the capabilities of our officers, agencies are enhancing supervision of contractors and managing agents.",4,27,2021-09-13-T-003-S-00027
2021-09-13-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The AGO is an important part of our system of checks to uncover weaknesses and shortcomings. AGO adopts a risk-based approach in determining which areas to cover in an audit. AGO takes into consideration factors such as materiality and potential impact. Areas selected for audit could include areas with higher value expenditure, higher volume of transactions and key IT systems that deal with financial transactions. For example, as part of AGO’s annual audit of the Government Financial Statements, it examines the controls in place for payments to government suppliers and also audits the key IT systems used to process financial transactions, including those administered by MOF.",5,28,2021-09-13-T-003-S-00028
2021-09-13-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Given the scale and complexity of Government operations it would be unrealistic to expect zero lapses. With 150,000 officers in the Public Service handling hundreds of thousands of transactions each year and more than 2,000 Government IT systems built over the years by different vendors and using different technologies, human errors and process gaps will occur from time to time.",6,29,2021-09-13-T-003-S-00029
2021-09-13-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Given this, what is important, therefore, is that we must have the means to pick up such lapses and address them in an upfront and transparent manner. The annual AGO report and other elements of our governance system outlined earlier function as regular “health checks” for the Public Service and allows it to take corrective and preventive actions as may be necessary.",7,30,2021-09-13-T-003-S-00030
2021-09-13-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Yip asked about the types of recurring lapses. These have typically been in the areas of procurement and contracts management, IT controls and grants management, which share common factors like the scale and complexity of operations, a constantly changing operating environment, high volume of transactions and multiple touchpoints.",8,31,2021-09-13-T-003-S-00031
2021-09-13-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"In the past five years, six agencies have been mentioned in the Auditor-General’s reports for recurring lapses, mainly in the areas of procurement and contract management, and IT controls. These are the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, MINDEF, MOE, MOF, MOH and the People’s Association (PA). The lapses arose from gaps in agency processes and human factors. Let me share the actions we are taking to improve our processes and our officers’ capabilities.",9,32,2021-09-13-T-003-S-00032
2021-09-13-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"First, on process improvements. To mitigate the risks associated with IT and our digitalisation efforts, we are deploying more central IT infrastructure and common services, which facilitate regular reviews at the WOG level. SNDGG is implementing central tools to automate agencies’ review of privileged users’ activities and management of user accounts. The former will be implemented for about 800 high priority systems by December 2022 and all applicable systems by December 2023, while the latter will be implemented for all applicable systems by December 2023.",10,33,2021-09-13-T-003-S-00033
2021-09-13-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Agencies regularly review and strengthen their own processes and systems to mitigate agency-level risks. For example, the Accountant-General's Department has taken steps to enhance IT security and will be adopting the central tools to automate the review of privileged users' activities.",11,34,2021-09-13-T-003-S-00034
2021-09-13-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Second, we are strengthening our officers' capabilities. For example, MOF has established the Finance and Procurement Academy, in partnership with the Civil Service College, to better equip public officers with relevant competencies. Officers involved in finance, procurement and contract management receive refreshers and updates on policies and practices. We will step up our efforts as the recent audit findings pertain to more complex types of procurement and contract management, particularly in the areas of IT and development projects.",12,35,2021-09-13-T-003-S-00035
2021-09-13-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,Officers involved in IT roles are actively engaged on audit findings as well as learning points and ways to prevent lapses. Agencies have also stepped up the training of these officers to strengthen IT governance and security processes.,13,36,2021-09-13-T-003-S-00036
2021-09-13-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Singh asked what actions are being taken in respect of the irregularities in the records furnished for audit. The Government takes a serious view of such irregularities. Every case is thoroughly investigated. Public officers found guilty of misconduct face disciplinary actions, depending on the nature, extent and circumstances of the breaches.",14,37,2021-09-13-T-003-S-00037
2021-09-13-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Five agencies were highlighted by AGO for possible irregularities in records furnished for audit. Public officers from two agencies, MCCY and PA, were investigated for the fabrication of records. MCCY's internal investigation has concluded. Two MCCY officers admitted to fabricating claims records for services rendered by external parties as the officers could not locate the records when requested by AGO. However, the investigation verified that the claims were valid and the services were in fact rendered. So, while the claims were real, the conduct of the officers in fabricating the claims records was wrong. The officers were issued official warnings and their performance assessments were affected.",15,38,2021-09-13-T-003-S-00038
2021-09-13-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"In the PA case, investigations are ongoing. The officers involved have been suspended from duties pending the outcome of the investigations.",16,39,2021-09-13-T-003-S-00039
2021-09-13-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"MHA had three cases of possible irregularities in records furnished by contractors. In two cases, Police reports were lodged and the investigations have been completed. One contractor was charged in Court and the other was given a 12-month conditional warning. In the third case, action has been taken against the contractor for non-compliance of contractual requirements. There was no fabrication of records by public officers in any of these three cases. However, two officers are undergoing internal investigations for the lack of due diligence.",17,40,2021-09-13-T-003-S-00040
2021-09-13-T-003,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"For the remaining two agencies, MOE and HDB, investigations are ongoing. Appropriate action will be taken depending on the outcome of the investigations.",18,41,2021-09-13-T-003-S-00041

2021-09-13-T-004,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth with respect to the Report of the Auditor-General for FY 2020/2021 (a) why did the People's Association (PA) not adopt the Government's instruction to adopt full price fluctuation in construction contracts; (b) how long has the PA practised this incorrect methodology; and (c) what is the total value of the contracts that invoked this incorrect methodology over the last seven years.",1,43,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00043

2021-09-13-T-004,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"During times of crisis, in particular, these community nodes become critical points of support for our residents. For instance, in our fight against COVID-19, PA transformed its CCs and RC Centres into distribution networks. We were able to quickly give our residents much-needed masks, sanitisers, TraceTogether tokens, Antigen Rapid Test (ART) test kits and so on. Almost overnight, many CCs were also turned into Vaccination Centres, to support our nation-wide vaccination efforts.",4,53,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00053

2021-09-13-T-004,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Pritam Singh asked about the adoption of full price fluctuation in relation to OTH's main construction contracts.,14,63,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00063
2021-09-13-T-004,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"For all public construction developments with a contract value of more than $5 million, the Government requires agencies to adopt full price fluctuation adjustment for key construction materials, specifically, concrete and steel reinforcement. This is to encourage companies, the bidders, to put in a more realistic bid for public sector projects.",15,64,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00064
2021-09-13-T-004,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"AGO observed that the full price fluctuation was not adopted in the case of OTH's main construction contract. Instead of a full price fluctuation adjustment, the parties in that case adopted a 70% price fluctuation adjustment for OTH’s main construction contract.",16,65,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00065
2021-09-13-T-004,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"When PA did its investigations, it found that this had been discussed and proposed by PA's appointed team of external consultants and was then accepted by PA. However, this was a mistake as PA should have adopted full price fluctuation instead, in accordance with the Government’s instruction.",17,66,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00066
2021-09-13-T-004,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Following this finding, PA undertook a review of the 31 relevant public construction developments over the last seven years. It found that, in this period, two other construction projects had also erroneously adopted a 70% price fluctuation adjustment, instead of a full price fluctuation.",18,67,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00067
2021-09-13-T-004,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On these two construction projects, the preliminary calculation is that if a full price fluctuation had been adopted instead, this would have resulted in a price adjustment differential of about $60,000 in favour of PA.",19,68,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00068
2021-09-13-T-004,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"PA has since ensured that the provision in all such similar standard construction contracts is clear and is fixed, to ensure greater clarity and compliance on how price fluctuation adjustments should be made, as per the requirement for all Government projects. It has also been reiterated to relevant officers who oversee such projects to ensure compliance.",20,69,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00069
2021-09-13-T-004,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Next, Sir, let me address AGO's findings on the management and oversight of contract variations. This applies for the main construction contracts during the development phase of both OTH and HBB.",21,70,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00070
2021-09-13-T-004,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In its audit, the AGO had test-checked 465 contract variations from both developments and found lapses in the approvals for 252 variations. The lapses relate to improper approval processes for variation works that had been conducted. The AGO found that there was a lack of evidence of approvals and in some cases, approvals which were given after the works had commenced or were already completed. And in some other cases, approvals for the increase in variation costs were not documented.",22,71,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00071
2021-09-13-T-004,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,AGO opined that these lapses indicated weaknesses in the monitoring of contract variations and inadequate oversight of the consultants by PA.,23,72,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00072
2021-09-13-T-004,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Subsequent to AGO's findings, PA undertook a thorough check on all 252 cases flagged by AGO. The check showed that whilst there were inadequate or missing documentations in respect of those variation works identified by AGO, these variation works were in fact requested for and approved.",24,73,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00073
2021-09-13-T-004,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"PA was able to independently verify, including through contemporaneous materials, that the variation works were carried out following discussions and decisions taken at project site meetings between PA and its consultants, and following the issuance of work orders. However, the project staff and consultants at that time, did not maintain proper documentation of these decisions, resulting in AGO’s observations. This is a lapse which has to be addressed.",25,74,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00074
2021-09-13-T-004,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In addition, PA is now undertaking a full review of the remaining contract variations, beyond those sampled by AGO, for the main construction contracts for these two developments.",26,75,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00075
2021-09-13-T-004,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Whilst these were not part of AGO’s test check requirements, PA is doing so, to ensure that the contract variations were carried out with the appropriate approvals and proper documentation, and if not, then to take the appropriate remedial actions.",27,76,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00076
2021-09-13-T-004,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"To further improve the future management of contract variations, PA has since also implemented the following  one, required the reporting and monitoring of contract variations in project progress meetings as a standard form; two, published a manual on contract variation process and procedures to further guide PA staff and its external consultants in the management of contract variations; and three, established an e-filing system for documenting variation approvals to enhance oversight and tracking.",28,77,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00077
2021-09-13-T-004,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, the third observation by AGO is in relation to the possible irregularities in documents relating to payments and lapses in the management of facility maintenance contracts at OTH. Mr Pritam Singh, Ms Foo Mee Har and Mr Sitoh Yih Pin have raised questions with regard to this observation.",29,78,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00078
2021-09-13-T-004,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"AGO's findings under this heading relate to transactions carried out in conjunction with minor building works at the facility, undertaken by external contractors during the maintenance phase of OTH. In respect to these works, PA had engaged an external managing agent to support the onsite facilities management team and also, supervise the works by the contractors.",30,79,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00079
2021-09-13-T-004,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In reviewing the payments made to the contractors, AGO had sampled 36 payments, totalling $1.27 million and found that there were possible irregularities in the supporting documents. These irregularities include the possible falsification of quotations, alteration of hard copy payments, payment supporting documents and also the creation and backdating of documents to give the false impression that proper processes had been followed.",31,80,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00080
2021-09-13-T-004,,,"When PA was notified by AGO on the irregularities observed, an internal investigation panel was immediately convened to look into these transactions. This panel was led by senior officers from PA and MCCY to conduct a thorough review of the related processes.",1,81,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00081
2021-09-13-T-004,,,"The investigations confirmed AGO's observations. PA took a very serious view of these irregularities. In addition, as the findings relate to claims involving possible falsification of documents, including in relation to claims by external parties, PA lodged a Police report after the conclusion of this investigation.",2,82,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00082
2021-09-13-T-004,,,"In addition, the staff who were directly involved have also been suspended pending the outcome of these investigations. PA is presently reviewing each of these transactions to ascertain if any losses have been occasioned by these irregularities and if so, to take the appropriate recovery action.",3,83,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00083
2021-09-13-T-004,,,"In the meantime, to ensure that the operations and maintenance of facilities at OTH carries on without disruption, PA has set up a task force to review and take steps to strengthen existing processes in procurement, contract and facility management, all of which, carry on at OTH. Second, to also improve staffing resources, including the appropriate oversight of contractors and managing agents.",4,84,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00084
2021-09-13-T-004,,,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin has asked if PA will conduct a thorough investigation into all payments made in relation to OTH's facility maintenance contracts. I would like to assure Members of this House that PA has done so. The internal audit team has since undertaken a sample review of all the other facility maintenance contracts entered into by OTH and did not find any irregularities similar in nature as those flagged by AGO.,5,85,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00085
2021-09-13-T-004,,,Mr Sitoh also asked whether PA's internal audit team had picked up any of these lapses raised by AGO. The internal audit team identifies key compliance risk areas and conducts sample checks to detect lapses or non-compliance.,6,86,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00086
2021-09-13-T-004,,,"In addition to compliance and operational audits, PA also engages an external auditor to conduct annual audits on its financial information. The integrated community hubs that I have mentioned, are audited regularly on a cyclical basis. PA last audited OTH and HBB in 2018 and 2019 respectively. At that time, these developments had just started their operations and the audits then were focused on procurement, revenue and tenancy management. PA's internal audit did not uncover any significant discrepancies, nor did AGO highlight any issues with respect to these three areas.",7,87,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00087
2021-09-13-T-004,,,"In February 2020, PA's internal audit had included in their FY2021 workplan to conduct checks on OTH and HBB. The checks were to be focused on the facilities' development and maintenance relating to progress claims, documentation and term contracts. These plans were, however, put on hold when AGO began its audit of OTH and HBB in July 2020. The planned areas of audit for OTH in FY2021 were eventually covered under AGO's audit that was conducted in FY2020.",8,88,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00088
2021-09-13-T-004,,,"Sir, PA accepts AGO's findings and will take steps to thoroughly review its governance and compliance systems. Ms Foo, in particular, asked about the control measures. Besides the above, PA has since appointed an external consultant from a leading accounting firm to examine its governance system and oversight functions in relation to contract management and the operations of all its development projects.",9,89,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00089
2021-09-13-T-004,,,The external consultant will conduct an audit and Business Process Review on the contract management of development and facility management projects of PA in recent years; review the governance structure for similar integrated community complexes; and also provide recommendations to strengthen systems and also processes in relation to the oversight functions of all development projects.,10,90,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00090

2021-09-13-T-004,,,"Sir, as a steward of public funds, we know that there must be public confidence in the integrity of governance systems. And PA takes the findings of AGO very seriously. This is underscored by how immediate steps were taken to review the observations, going beyond AGO's findings and subsequently, the remedial steps that I outlined earlier.",12,92,2021-09-13-T-004-S-00092

2021-09-13-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what caused HDB to make erroneous payments of CPF housing grants to ineligible applicants as highlighted in the Annual Report of the Auditor-General’s Office for FY2020/2021; and (b) in what manner will HDB be improving its controls over the processing and assessment of CPF housing grants.,1,94,2021-09-13-T-005-S-00094
2021-09-13-T-005,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Sir, applicants for CPF housing grants must declare all relevant information about themselves and the proposed occupiers of their HDB flats, as well as submit documentary proof of income, employment and details of their ownership of private property, if any.",1,95,2021-09-13-T-005-S-00095
2021-09-13-T-005,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"HDB assesses each application by manually verifying, amongst other things, the declared incomes against the documents submitted by the applicants and their occupiers, such as pay slips, employers’ letters, commission statements, CPF contribution histories and Notices of Income Tax Assessment. For ownership of private property, HDB will verify documents such as the Notice of Transfer, Transfer Instrument, and Sale and Purchase Agreement. The verification process is often complex, especially when flat buyers and their occupiers have multiple sources of income and/or property ownership, both local and overseas.",2,96,2021-09-13-T-005-S-00096
2021-09-13-T-005,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"AGO checked a total of 22,627 resale applications with the Family or Singles Grant approved by HDB between 1 April 2018 and 30 September 2020. These applications involved a total of 47,808 applicants and occupiers. AGO found that HDB had disbursed grants to 13 applicants who did not meet the eligibility criteria. Of the 13 applicants, HDB has since verified that one applicant had in fact been correctly assessed for the grant disbursement. Further investigations revealed that the grants were wrongly disbursed for the remaining 12 applicants because the applicants had failed to declare material information such as their actual income and private property ownership to HDB. This omission was not detected in the verification checks.",3,97,2021-09-13-T-005-S-00097
2021-09-13-T-005,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"HDB has taken immediate action to recover the grants that were disbursed to ineligible applicants and is working to verify the eligibility status of the remaining 1,055 applicants flagged by AGO. HDB is also implementing process improvements and automating eligibility check processes. This will allow HDB to more efficiently and accurately assess the eligibility of the very many grant applicants, even if they fail to declare any material information to HDB.",4,98,2021-09-13-T-005-S-00098

2021-09-13-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"For Question No 4 to Minister Indranee, this year's AGO report was unusual in that there were a number of Ministries and Statutory Boards observed to have documents altered, backdated, artificially created or falsified. Hence, my Parliamentary Question was to inquire into the number of investigations and individuals involved, to get a better extent of the size of these infractions and the number of people involved. In view of information that the Minister has just shared and her reply that efforts will be stepped up to resolve some of these issues, can the Minister share what is the nature of these efforts, do they include more frequent internal audits, for example, or intensive contract management and procurement-related training programmes for the relevant personnel?",2,101,2021-09-13-T-005-S-00101
2021-09-13-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To Minister Edwin Tong, two questions. I understand that PA's internal investigation went beyond the test checks that were done for the contract variations with regard to the two development projects. Can I confirm that PA also will be making an announcement on the results of these findings when the investigations are complete, in view of the statement that was released on 22 July 2021.",3,102,2021-09-13-T-005-S-00102
2021-09-13-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second supplementary question for Minister Tong is  is there a process or procedure in place to bar companies including managing agents for all Government-related tenders that are found to have been flagged out by AGO for significant irregularities, for example, like the managing agent identified at paragraph 56 of the AGO report which found irregularities in more than 90% of payments that were test checked?",4,103,2021-09-13-T-005-S-00103
2021-09-13-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Mr Speaker, I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his supplementary questions. He had asked what efforts are being taken to address this because there were a number of infractions across various Ministries and agencies.",1,104,2021-09-13-T-005-S-00104
2021-09-13-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"I think we can break it down to two responses that would be appropriate. As you can see from the lapses, one is a process problem. For the process problem, the key is to be able to pick this up as quickly and as efficiently as possible. And the key to that is lies in having more automated processes.",2,105,2021-09-13-T-005-S-00105
2021-09-13-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"As I had indicated in my earlier answer, what we are doing is to have more process improvements and to deploy more central IT infrastructure and common services to facilitate regular reviews. That way, hopefully, you minimise human error and you are able to flag up the inconsistencies or the red flags as and when they occur.",3,106,2021-09-13-T-005-S-00106
2021-09-13-T-005,Indranee Rajah,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The second and the more important one is really the people part. Partly, it is building capability, but the other part is impressing upon public officers the importance of doing this well and carrying out these functions well, so that in fact, they internalise it. The Public Service has in place platforms such as sharing sessions and training programmes to educate and engage the officers on the importance of maintaining the high standards of personal conduct and upholding the integrity of the Public Service. And the leaders in the Public Service will continue to emphasise to their officers that misconduct is viewed seriously and will not be condoned; and will also remind them that there are internal avenues to report wrongdoing and fraudulent acts, if these occur and if the reporting is made in good faith.",4,107,2021-09-13-T-005-S-00107

2021-09-13-T-005,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Mr Speaker, there is already a framework in place to address the issue that Mr Yip had raised. Essentially, what happens is that we have the Public Accounts Committee which is a committee of Parliament. The Public Accounts Committee can enquire from the Ministry what the updates are. The Ministry will reply and the reply is effectively to a committee of Parliament, so it is as if it is to Parliament. And the Public Accounts Committee will then issue a public report.

The significant observations arising from AGO's audit of the two development projects under the People's Association are disturbing. So, I would like to ask the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth to clarify the following. One, whether the lapses uncovered in contract management are systemic across the development projects. It is surprising to hear that PA actually manages 788 projects at any one time. Second, whether the root causes of irregularities have been identified and isolated, and if new projects that are now ongoing need to be suspended, pending the consultants' study of the issues that have been uncovered.",1,116,2021-09-13-T-005-S-00116
2021-09-13-T-005,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I thank Ms Foo Mee Har for raising the point. The lapses, as far as we can tell, were not systemic. But at the same time, as I have mentioned earlier, we have already immediately implemented some changes to improve the system and oversight governance functions. We will also subject our oversight and governance of such matters to a professional external review, as I have mentioned. And I have mentioned that an external consultant has been appointed, being given a broad mandate to look at these governance systems and oversight functions.",1,117,2021-09-13-T-005-S-00117

And on top of that, regular AGO audits which go deeper into specific matters. We take each case of lapse very seriously. And in this case, as Members know, once PA became aware of these findings, an internal investigation was carried out immediately. This led to staff being suspended and a Police report was filed; all of these even before AGO disclosed its findings.

The first is, besides clawing back the grants that were wrongly paid, HDB has stated that it would also take enforcement action against those who have suppressed material information. So, I would like the Minister to confirm whether HDB, by saying this, accepts that there could be some cases where the applicant did not act deliberately but there could have been some genuine misunderstanding about the eligibility criteria or the information that needed to be provided. That is the first question.",1,123,2021-09-13-T-005-S-00123

2021-09-13-T-005,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I thank Miss Cheng for the question. Yes, the staff obviously have been affected in that they have been cooperating with AGO.

So, there is a wide range of other responsibilities that the staff are looking into. And it is important to ensure that there is enough resourcing and staffing to see to this. I would like to assure Miss Cheng that there is a task force that has been put in place to shore up the staff necessary for OTH, including to replace the personnel who had been suspended, to ensure that the functions and performance levels of OTH do not drop.",2,133,2021-09-13-T-005-S-00133

2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Let me start with the first, the reasons for the merger. Mr Speaker, Sir, 21 years ago, NUS established the USP. USP started as one of NUS’ early ventures in offering a broad-based, interdisciplinary education to students. Today, it is a very successful residential living and learning model that admits around 220 students each year and has produced about 2,500 alumni to date.",3,153,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00153
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Ten years ago, NUS and Yale University established YNC. The aim was to establish a new unique education model that draws on the best traditions of both the East and the West, with a multidisciplinary curriculum. YNC has an intake of about 250 students each year. More than 800 students have graduated from YNC thus far. It is autonomous within NUS, but as part of the wider NUS family, it taps on the resources and facilities of NUS. The YNC degree is awarded by NUS. This decade-long partnership with Yale University has given NUS valuable insights into interdisciplinary liberal arts education and its defining features such as the integration of residential living and learning.",4,154,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00154
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Over these years, the rest of NUS too has continued to evolve and innovate to remain relevant to the needs of our students and country. Today, NUS is one of the leading universities in Asia and the world. And in one international ranking, the QS World University Rankings, NUS is ranked 11th in the world. However, NUS, like all our other Universities, cannot remain static in the face of a changing and in many ways, more challenging world; NUS will have to continue to evolve. So, in our quest for excellence, it means that we must continue to learn from the best internationally, while charting our own path forward with confidence. This is what brought us thus far; and this is how we will go forward.",5,155,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00155
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In a more complex, uncertain and even fragmenting world, our Universities must enable our students",6,156,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00156

2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Against this backdrop, NUS has charted a bold roadmap of educational innovations since 2018, geared towards delivering a common curriculum with more flexible pathways and more interdisciplinary learning, to develop in students greater intellectual versatility.",10,160,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00160
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Part of this roadmap includes the establishment of the College of Humanities and Sciences or CHS in December 2020, which brought together two of NUS’ largest faculties to offer students multiple pathways across the Humanities, Social Sciences and STEM.",11,161,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00161
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"This will be followed by the establishment of the College of Design and Engineering or CDE which will similarly transform the experience of our engineering, architecture and design students.",12,162,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00162
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The New College is a third important step in this roadmap.

2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"YNC and USP share many common features, including smaller group teaching, a common curriculum and residential living and learning. Both YNC and USP graduates go on to enjoy similarly excellent employment outcomes, contributing in different sectors. The New College will bring together the best educational features of both YNC and USP. With the New College more fully integrated with the rest of the University ecosystem, its students will benefit from greater exposure to a wider range of disciplines compared to just YNC alone.",14,164,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00164
2021-09-13-T-006,,,"Mr Speaker, Sir, when we first decided to set up YNC, we knew that it would cost more. The cost of education of a YNC student today is more than double that of a Humanities or Science student in NUS. Likewise, both tuition fees and Government funding are more than double. But we accepted this because we saw value in having a liberal arts college in our tertiary education system. YNC had hoped to raise over S$300 million to reach an endowment fund size of around S$1 billion, with Government matching and investment returns. This would then have reduced the burden on the annual operating income of fees and Government subsidies.",1,165,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00165
2021-09-13-T-006,,,"YNC has done its utmost in raising funds, but through no fault of its own, has not reached its target.

This will be an important consideration but not the main motivation for the change.",2,166,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00166
2021-09-13-T-006,,,"NUS has learnt much from its partnership with Yale and in operating YNC, and it has affirmed the value of a liberal arts educational approach.

2021-09-13-T-006,,,"The launch of the New College is an important move. It has also implications for many stakeholders, not least for the YNC community of students, parents, faculty and staff. I understand the sadness and sense of loss and uncertainty they may feel, especially for those who have played a part in building up YNC over the past decade.",5,169,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00169

2021-09-13-T-006,,,"First, the decision-making process and the timing of the announcement. In early-July 2021, NUS initiated discussions with Yale University. Yale acknowledged NUS’ vision to bring together both YNC and USP into a New College that would not bear Yale’s name. The YNC leadership was informed in the same month. The NUS Board of Trustees endorsed the decision in early-August 2021 and the YNC Governing Board endorsed the transition plans in late-August.",7,171,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00171
2021-09-13-T-006,,,"In July, the issue of timing was also discussed with Yale and jointly determined. While the partnership would only end in 2025, both parties felt that the responsible thing to do was to announce it early rather than to hold back. It would have been bad faith to delay the announcement and continue to admit students who would not be able to complete their education in YNC, or to continue to hire faculty, beyond this juncture.",8,172,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00172
2021-09-13-T-006,,,"The announcement was thus planned for August, after the YNC Governing Board considered and endorsed the broad transition approach. This allowed faculty and staff the maximum time – between now and 2025 – to work through the details of the transition. This also means that YNC’s 2021 intake would be its final cohort. The Class of 2025 cohort would have the full four years to complete their undergraduate studies at YNC.",9,173,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00173
2021-09-13-T-006,,,"Some have also asked why was there no consultation with the current student body and staff. NUS did not do so because the decision involved discussions between the senior leadership of two Universities and with their respective Boards, on sensitive issues of strategy and finance. Instead, NUS, once having settled the broad parameters, wanted to give maximum time for the transition to occur and for the stakeholders to be involved in working through the transition issues.",10,174,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00174
2021-09-13-T-006,,,"Second, students, parents and alumni have asked how the move affects the stature of the YNC degree. Today, YNC graduates graduate with a YNC degree that is awarded by NUS itself. NUS and YNC have assured all current students that they will graduate with the same degree as their predecessors.",11,175,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00175
2021-09-13-T-006,,,"NUS and Yale are both globally renowned universities which are well-recognised by employers, including the public sector and postgraduate institutions. I am confident that the YNC degree will continue to be highly valued and its past and future graduating cohorts will remain in good standing, even beyond 2025.",12,176,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00176
2021-09-13-T-006,,,"Beyond 2025, NUS will continue to provide supporting documentation to explain the context of YNC and what a YNC degree conveys, and provide letters of recommendation or referees if alumni need them.",13,177,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00177
2021-09-13-T-006,,,"Third, concerns around how the merger will affect current students, faculty and staff. Students in YNC will continue to have access to the full range of majors and minors currently offered by YNC until 2025.",14,178,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00178
2021-09-13-T-006,,,"I know that many YNC students are actively involved in student organisations and look forward to a fulfilling campus life during their time at the College.

NUS is, in fact, building on the foundations of YNC and USP, as well as the lessons gleaned from the collaboration with Yale University. It wants to make the distinctive feature of education in YNC and USP more inclusive and more accessible.

2021-09-13-T-006,,,"First, there had been similar concerns about a perceived lack of academic freedom when YNC was established. They proved unfounded. In fact, few believed then that YNC would live up to its ambition. Even fewer would own it. It is, perhaps, ironic and a testimony to NUS and YNC’s efforts all these years, that YNC is now seen as a paragon of academic freedom in Singapore.",21,185,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00185
2021-09-13-T-006,,,"Second, YNC's current policies on academic freedom were, in fact, framed by taking reference from NUS' practices relating to academic freedom and these practices have remained unchanged since. The faculties of Arts and Social Sciences in NUS and other Autonomous Universities also have had a long history of teaching and research, including on potentially sensitive and difficult topics, long before the establishment of YNC. They are highly ranked globally and attract distinguished scholars. It would be grossly unfair to faculty members in NUS and other Autonomous Universities to suggest that their teaching or research is in any way less rigorous, of lower quality or less free than that of the YNC faculty.",22,186,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00186
2021-09-13-T-006,,,"Mr Speaker, Sir, our Universities must continue to adopt a globally oriented and inclusive posture to stay relevant in the world and keep striving to improve. Many of our newer institutions were started in partnership with leading global universities, so that we can learn from the best globally. These partnerships have generally progressed, evolved and matured as intended. In some cases, they come to a natural end at the checkpoints designed into the initial partnership agreements.",23,187,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00187
2021-09-13-T-006,,,"Meanwhile, our Universities continue to seek out new partnerships where we can benefit from the experiences of others and where we can value-add to the relationships meaningfully. We have much more to learn from others, not just from universities in the United States, but equally from Europe, Asia and elsewhere. But to be an attractive partner for others, we too must find our own unique value propositions. We cannot and should not be a cloned version of others, no matter how successful they may be.",24,188,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00188
2021-09-13-T-006,,,Yale has been a longstanding friend of NUS and a visionary partner in the YNC College.

Firstly, what is the extent of integration between YNC and NUS today, and how would this change with the merger? Second, the Minister mentioned that costs were a relevant consideration but not the main motivation for the merger. Can the Minister elaborate on how the financial sustainability was factored into this consideration and how the New College would be made more financially sustainable?",1,200,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00200

2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,The New College will be more integrated with NUS compared to YNC. It will not have a separate governing board but will instead have an international advisory panel. This will become clearer as the Planning Committee engages stakeholders and formulates its vision and plans for the New College in due course.,6,206,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00206

2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Second, the New College can attract students from across a wider range of discipline. Today, YNC students who want to benefit from the immersive residential and interdisciplinary experience in YNC can only choose their majors from 14 options. In future, students from the New College will be able to enjoy immersive residential and interdisciplinary experience and access a whole range of about 50 possible majors across NUS, enabling them to interact with a greater diversity of students.",9,209,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00209

2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the second supplementary question by Mr Patrick Tay about the cost issue, let me first reiterate that the overriding reason for this move, as NUS has shared, is the vital role of a broad-based interdisciplinary education and our job to reimagine the higher education and how it will fit into our country's plans going forward so that we can develop a new generation of students that are much more global in their perspective, much more able to connect the East and the West, the North and the South. So, that is our higher goal.",13,213,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00213
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"When YNC was first established, the Government recognised that education in YNC will cost more because of its smaller size and unique education model. But we were prepared to invest in building the new facilities for YNC and we accepted this because we saw value in having a liberal arts college in our tertiary education system.",14,214,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00214
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the specific numbers, on a recurrent basis, YNC is more costly. In 2020, MOE provided around $48 million to YNC in operating grants per year for about 1,000 students in YNC. On a per student basis, this was more than double that of a Humanities and Science student in NUS on average, reflective of the higher cost in education. Beyond the operating grant, MOE has also provided capital funding for YNC's infrastructure and matched donations to YNC's endowment fund.",15,215,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00215
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"When NUS consulted MOE on its plan to merge the YNC and USP programmes together to form the New College, we were supportive of this for two reasons.",16,216,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00216
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"First, because this is in line with our broader push for Institutes of Higher Learning to expand their interdisciplinary approach to education. Second, because it will make education much more affordable to many more NUS students in keeping with NUS' ethos and mission as a public University. Prof Tan Eng Chye, President of NUS has articulated the reasons for the merger in his recent op-ed over the weekend. I think it makes sense for him to have the interests of the wider NUS student population and the whole NUS at the forefront of what he is doing with his leadership team in NUS.",17,217,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00217
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,Merging YNC and USP to form the New College therefore allows NUS to combine the best elements of both sides and to achieve economies of scale to allow us to scale this experience to many more students in part or in full across NUS.,18,218,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00218

2021-09-13-T-006,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"The first is given that the intention is to make the liberal arts education more accessible, how much larger does MOE expect the cohorts to be, given that it is to be noted that the current projected 500-student cohort for the New College is not actually that much bigger than the current combined cohorts of USP and YNC, as well as to what extent will the composition be made up of Singaporeans as well as foreign students?",2,221,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00221
2021-09-13-T-006,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"Second, given that potential students will be applying for the next admission cycle in the coming months, will MOE guide or require the New College to set out its admission policy and confirmed majors to be offered, for example, so that potential students and parents can make considered decisions, given that this is a fairly short amount of time?",3,222,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00222
2021-09-13-T-006,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"And Minister, if I could just go back to the Question No 13, my original Parliamentary Question  if MOE will consider facilitating any assistance to those who had to forego other universities in order to take up this offer?",4,223,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00223
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, let me deal with the supplementary questions in order.",1,224,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00224
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"First, the scaling up of the education. The more interdisciplinary approach to the education system will not be just confined to the 500 students in the New College. Some of the best elements that we have been able to learn from these two traditions is that we will be able to scale this even to students beyond those that are going to be at the New College. So, yes, for a start, I think the Planning Committee is looking at 500 or a bit more for the New College, but there are elements of this that will actually percolate to the rest of the NUS ecosystem. That is the first one.",2,225,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00225
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Second, today, YNC takes in about 40% of its cohort from the international student community; NUS takes in about 10%. Going forward, for the initial planning parameters of the 500, what is the balance between the international and the local students will still have to be decided by the Planning Committee. I would look forward to NUS coming back to us on this.",3,226,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00226
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the third issue about the admission policies for the next batch, yes, indeed, NUS is now making clear the offerings for the subsequent batch as early as possible so that they have the maximum time before they sign up for the different courses – for the next batch which will matriculate next year.",4,227,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00227
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the fourth question, yes, NUS will definitely provide assistance to staff and faculty, as I have mentioned, for those who want to make alternative plans.",5,228,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00228
2021-09-13-T-006,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Can Members keep to two supplementary questions, maximum, please? Thank you. Ms He Ting Ru.",1,229,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00229
2021-09-13-T-006,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),I thank the Minister. I have two supplementary questions.,1,230,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00230
2021-09-13-T-006,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"The first is, as part of my original Parliamentary Question, what other options and alternatives were considered and why were they not taken?",2,231,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00231
2021-09-13-T-006,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Secondly, what do you feel is the impact on the future possible tie-ups and also, some of our existing tie-ups, for example, Duke-NUS? There is a certain impression given that maybe, even though we might approach other external parties for similar collaborations in the future, will we then suddenly decide that actually, we have had enough, we have benefited enough, we are going to forge ahead. So, I think that really ties into our academic standing and our reputation.",3,232,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00232
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Ms He for her two supplementary questions.",1,233,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00233
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"First question  what other options have we considered? In fact, the President of NUS, Prof Tan Eng Chye had laid it out in his op-ed. There are various options to consider but the most important thing is to remember what are the guiding considerations in deciding on any option.",2,234,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00234
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"There are two guiding considerations. One, to make sure that we develop a generation of students that are much more global in their perspective, much more able to apply interdisciplinary approach to problem-solving. Second is to make sure that the whole experience in our Universities is much more inclusive, much more affordable, much more accessible to a wider number of students.",3,235,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00235
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"It is based on these that we decided that amongst the various options, whether to continue the current model, to merge the USP with YNC or to even develop a separate model as someone who would have said, that amongst all these different models, NUS has decided that the best way to achieve both objectives that I have just illustrated is to combine the USP and the YNC programme together to make it much more affordable and accessible to many more students.",4,236,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00236
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the Member's second supplementary question about our posture towards the international partnerships with other foreign universities, indeed, as we speak today, we are in the process of building up new partnerships with other universities across the world. And why are we doing so? For two reasons.",5,237,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00237
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"First, we must make sure that we continue to learn from the best. I am personally not very taken by ranking per se, because even if a university is ranked high or low, there are elements in the university that we can learn from. It does not mean that a highly ranked university is good for everything and another university that is not so highly ranked, there is nothing that we can learn.",6,238,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00238
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"So, I think we must take a very open approach to considering partnerships with others to make sure that we continue to learn from them and to take the best aspects from these partnerships.",7,239,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00239
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the other hand, as I have mentioned, when we go into a partnership with any foreign universities, we must also bring value to other people and we cannot just copy on the basis that they are better for us. Even if we try to learn from others, we must be prepared and be confident to chart out our own way to have our own unique value propositions. And that is how we will continue to go forward.",8,240,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00240
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"At this point in time, I do not think this partnership coming to its natural checkpoint, will have any implications for any of the other partnerships that we are in or exploring with others.",9,241,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00241
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"As I have mentioned in my Parliamentary Question reply, actually for every partnership, we have milestones to check to make sure that both parties find it mutually beneficial for both of us to continue that relationship. And at times, when it comes to a natural conclusion, we must be prepared to chart our own way forward, develop our own unique value proposition so that we can even be more attractive to other partners who would want to work with us and that we must continue to work together.",10,242,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00242

Sir, I have one supplementary question for the Minister and that is coming back to my original Question No 20  whether NUS will be prepared to provide refunds to newly matriculated students of Yale-NUS College and for existing students, whether they will be allowed to look at alternatives, like transfers to other courses or to other programmes.",1,244,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00244
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is yes. NUS is in contact with the students who may want to consider other options and to see how we can best render help to them.",1,245,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00245

2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, this question will take me quite some time to answer but I try to cut to the crux. I usually try not to have more than three KPIs for the organisations that I work with.",1,248,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00248
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,But it is a serious question. What is my definition of success for NUS and what is my definition of success for NUS students? I would say three for NUS and three for the NUS students.,2,249,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00249
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"First, to me, in time to come, I will consider it a success if NUS produces quality graduates that are much more global in their perspective, able to connect the East and the West, the North and the South; that these students will be able to provide unique solutions in context to the challenges that Singapore faces and if possible, to make a contribution to the rest of the world. So, first is the quality of our students in being able to be an integrative force for the world.",3,250,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00250
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Second, NUS will continue to be successful if NUS continues to remain humble and learn from the best in the world, while at the same time, being confident to chart out its own way forward, so that NUS is not just copying from the best in the world but instead, in the process, create something new, create something better that in and of itself becomes a valued partner to the rest of the world.",4,251,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00251
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Third, that NUS, as a University, will help to reinforce Singapore's standing in the world because we stand for openness, integration, inclusivity. That we provide solutions in context for the world just as we provide for ourselves. So, these are my three KPIs for NUS.",5,252,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00252
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"How do I consider whether NUS students are successful? First, let me declare this. I do not measure NUS students' success just by how well they do for themselves in the type of income that they earn or the type of jobs that they get. And that is because simply, NUS takes in the best from every cohort. And as a society, as a country, we expect them to perform well, perform way above the average. That is to be expected. But in my own sense, I would like to see the success of NUS students defined in three ways.",6,253,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00253
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Number one, they define success beyond themselves for the country. Number two, they define success beyond themselves for our people. Number three, they define success beyond themselves for our future. And let me explain why.",7,254,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00254
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"For NUS students to be individually successful, that is to be expected because they are the cream of the crop from every cohort in Singapore. But we want them to have a sense whereby their definition of success is not just about they, themselves, but how they can help Singapore defy the odds of history and continue to be a shining beacon, not just in Southeast Asia, but across the world and in history.",8,255,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00255
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Number two, we want NUS students not to only define their success of again how well they do for themselves, but how well they enable the rest who are less privileged, perhaps less talented than them, to come along so that we can forge one people together, we can forge a nation together, we can forge that solidarity together, notwithstanding the forces that threaten to pull us apart.",9,256,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00256
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Last but not least, we hope that the NUS students' success will be defined by not just how successful they are in this generation but by how successful they enable the next generation to be, perhaps to be even more successful than this generation.",10,257,2021-09-13-T-006-S-00257
2021-09-13-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"If the NUS students can embody this spirit of being successful beyond themselves for the country, for our people and for our future, I think NUS and NUS students would have done Singapore a great service for many generations to come.

2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Third, we extended protection to minors between 16 and 18 years of age. Sexual activity with this category of minors was criminalised where the relationship was exploitative. These minors above the age of 16 are slightly above the age of consent for sexual activity. They can consent but in reality, they are susceptible to exploitation by those who are in a relationship of trust with them. In such cases, the minor's consent is compromised and we dealt with that.",5,311,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00311

This sought to protect victims from violations to their sexual autonomy and the serious risks that arise from that.",6,312,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00312

2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"First, on outrage of modesty (OM) under section 354(1) of the Penal Code. We have seen an increased in the number of OM cases from 2016 to 2020.

2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"This maximum imprisonment term of three years is only for the primary offence of OM under section 354(1). There are other aggravated variants of the offence such as OM against minors under 14 or where hurt is caused to the victim in order to commit OM, which already attract higher penalties.",12,318,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00318

An exploitative relationship may be found, for example, between a parent or a step-parent, teacher, sports coach, musical instructor of the minor and so on.",15,321,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00321
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Currently, the maximum imprisonment term for these two offences is one year. We will increase that to two years. This will bring the punishment in line with similar offences involving sexual communications with minors.",16,322,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00322
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Apart from increasing the penalties for these three offences, the Bill also makes amendments to other sexual offences such as sexual assault involving penetration, procuring sexual activity by deception or false representation, sexual penetration of a corpse, offences relating to voyeurism and intimate images, and offences relating to child abuse material.",17,323,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00323

2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"The need to review this arises from a recent decision of the High Court, Public Prosecutor v Chua Wen Hao. In that case, the Police were looking for a suspect who had committed an offence at a hotel. At the hotel, the Police asked the accused person whether he knew the suspect. The accused person told the Police that he did not and that he had not allowed such a person to enter his hotel room.",4,330,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00330
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Police investigations subsequently revealed that this was not true. In fact, not only was the accused person a friend of the suspect, they had gone out for drinks together and had planned to meet at the hotel. The suspect arrived at the hotel slightly after the accused person and joined him in his hotel room. As a result of the false information, Police officers wasted additional effort and time to uncover the identity of the suspect.",5,331,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00331
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"The accused person was charged under section 182 of the Penal Code, which provides for the offence of giving false information to a public servant with the intent of causing or knowing that it will likely cause a public servant to use his lawful power to the injury or annoyance of another person or to do or omit anything which the public servant ought not to do or omit if he had known the truth.",6,332,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00332
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"The High Court held that section 182 did not apply as the offence is concerned with situations where the offender intends to cause or knows that he will likely cause a public servant to abuse, misuse or improperly withhold the use of his or her lawful powers as a result of the false information.",7,333,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00333
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),The High Court held that the offence does not cover cases where a person gives false information with the intent of causing or knowing that it will likely cause the public servant to be ineffective and inefficient in exercising his lawful powers.,8,334,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00334
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Giving false information to a public servant who is carrying out his or her duties is a very serious matter. There can be very serious consequences, for example, when the Police are hunting for a suspect in a murder or sexual assault case or when SCDF officers are responding to an emergency. The delay in identifying the offender could be a matter of life and death.",9,335,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00335
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),Clause 12 therefore amends section 182 to cover cases where the offender gives false information intending or knowing it is likely that the false information would cause the public servant to do anything which he or she would not otherwise do. This would cover cases where the false information results in the inefficient exercise of the public servant's lawful powers.,10,336,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00336
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"In addition, clause 13 amends section 186 of the Penal Code, which criminalises the voluntary obstruction of a public servant in the discharge of his or her public functions. The amendment makes clear that the act of giving of false information to a public servant can amount to obstruction, even if there was no physical obstruction or the use of threats. Whether the false information does in fact amount to obstruction is a question of fact for the Court to determine in each case.",11,337,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00337
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"In addition, the maximum imprisonment term under section 186 will be increased from three to six months. These amendments will strengthen our levers to deal with offenders who deceive public servants and in so doing, harm public interests.",12,338,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00338
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Turning to the other offences, first, clause 23 amends section 376 of the Penal Code, which provides for the offence of sexual assault involving penetration. Subsection (1) of section 376 makes it an offence for a male offender to cause a male victim to penetrate the offender's anus or mouth with the victim's penis without the victim's consent or where the victim is below 14 years of age. This subsection will be deleted as the conduct is already covered under the broader subsection (2)(b).",13,339,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00339
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Today, the offence of sexual assault involving penetration is gender-neutral. It can be committed by males or females. Therefore, we will also amend the defence under section 376(6) so that both male and female offenders may rely on it.",14,340,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00340
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Next, clause 28 amends section 376H of the Penal Code, which makes it an offence for a person to procure consent to sexual activity by deception or false representation.",15,341,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00341
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Clause 28 widens the offence to cover deception pertaining to the risk of the victim contracting a sexually transmitted disease, for example, a lie that the disease is not transmissible by sexual intercourse. The offence will also be widened to cover cases where the offender deceives the victim into consenting to being touched by a third person or into touching the bodily fluids of the offender or another person.",16,342,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00342
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Clause 29 amends the offence of sexual penetration of a corpse. The offence currently prohibits a man from penetrating a corpse's vagina, anus or mouth with his penis. It also prohibits any person from causing a man to do so without the man's consent. The proposed amendments will (a) criminalise other forms of sexual penetration involving corpses; and (b) make the offender gender-neutral.",17,343,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00343
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Clause 30 broadens the scope of the offence of voyeurism under section 377BB by replacing the term ""genitals"" with ""genital region"". This will ensure that the offence is wide enough to cover cases where the offender manages to capture an image of the victim's genital region but not the genitals themselves.",18,344,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00344
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Clauses 31 and 34 deal with the definitions of ""child abuse material"" and ""abusive material"" under section 377C and section 377BL.",19,345,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00345
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Currently, ""child abuse material"" and ""abusive material"" include material that depicts an image of a minor's breasts or genital or anal region in circumstances which reasonable persons would regard as being offensive. We will amend this definition to cover images of a minor's genital region, buttocks or breasts, whether exposed or covered.",20,346,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00346
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"This will enhance protections for minors by ensuring that the relevant offences apply to sexual images of scantily-clad children or close-up images of the child's genitals, buttocks or breasts – even if covered by clothing – in circumstances which reasonable persons would regard as offensive.",21,347,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00347
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"In addition, the Bill clarifies that the depictions must be sexual in nature. This will make clear that the intent is not to cover non-sexual depictions of minors, such as diaper advertisements.",22,348,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00348
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Finally, clause 10 rationalises the punishments for abetting and attempting to commit serious offences that are punishable with death or life imprisonment but where the offence was eventually not committed.",23,349,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00349
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Currently, under section 512 of the Penal Code, a person who attempts to commit an offence punishable with death or life imprisonment will face a maximum imprisonment term of 20 years.",24,350,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00350
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"However, where a person abets the commission of an offence punishable with death or life imprisonment but that offence is ultimately not committed, section 115 only provides a maximum imprisonment term of 15 years. This is even though an abettor under section 115 may be equally culpable as or even more culpable than a person who attempts to commit such an offence. For example, a person who conspires with another to murder a victim where the murder was not carried out could, depending on the facts, be just as culpable as a person who attempts but fails to commit the murder itself.",25,351,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00351
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"We will therefore increase the maximum imprisonment under section 115 from 15 years to 20 years, for parity with section 512.",26,352,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00352
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),I now turn to the amendments relating to the operation of certain defences.,27,353,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00353
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Clauses 5, 6 and 7 amend the provisions relating to mistake or ignorance of fact, mistake or ignorance of law and accident. These clauses are intended to provide greater clarity on the way these provisions operate. They do not change the general common law principles on burden of proof, namely, that the prosecution must prove the elements of the offence and that the accused person must prove a defence.",28,354,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00354
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Next, clauses 8, 9 and 17 amend the defence of unsoundness of mind, the defence of intoxication and the partial defence of diminished responsibility. The amendments clarify that where an accused person claims that he was incapable of knowing that what he was doing wrong, by reason of unsoundness of mind, the accused person must prove that he was incapable of knowing that what he was doing was both wrong by the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest persons, and wrong as contrary to law.",29,355,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00355
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"In other words, the two limbs are to be read conjunctively. This was in fact the position taken when the Penal Code was last amended in 2019, where we inserted the illustration to section 84. The present amendments only serve to make this clearer and do not change the state of the current law.",30,356,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00356
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Finally, clause 20 amends section 352, which provides for the offence of using criminal force otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation. If criminal force was used on grave and sudden provocation, a less serious offence under section 358 will apply instead.",31,357,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00357
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Currently, the explanation under section 352 provides that the partial defence of grave and sudden provocation does not apply if, among other things, the provocation was given by anything done in obedience to the law or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the public servant's power. This means that an accused person cannot rely on the partial defence in this scenario, even if the accused person did not know and had no reason to believe that the provocation was given by anything done in obedience to the law or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the public servant's power.",32,358,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00358
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),The amendment will broaden the scope of this partial defence so that an accused person can rely on the partial defence if he did not know and had no reason to believe that the provocation was given by anything done in obedience to the law or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the public servant's power.,33,359,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00359
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"This aligns the partial defence of grave and sudden provocation under section 352 with the partial defence of grave and sudden provocation for more serious offences such as murder, voluntarily causing grievous hurt and voluntarily causing hurt. Similar amendments will be made to the partial defence of provocation where it appears in other Penal Code provisions.",34,360,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00360
2021-09-13-T-014,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Lastly, this Bill seeks to modernise the language of certain provisions under the Penal Code. As part of our continuing efforts to ensure that the law is more easily understood by present-day readers, clauses 11, 14, 15, 16, 32, 33 and 39 replace certain archaic terms, such as ""wantonly"", ""maliciously"", ""malice"" and ""malignantly"", with modern terms that are more easily understood and already defined in the Penal Code, such as ""rashly"" and ""intentionally"".",35,361,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00361

2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the broad aims of the Bill, as articulated by the hon Minister and the hon Minister of State. I wish to touch on two areas in my speech.",1,363,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00363
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"First, noting that it is intended to narrow the applicability of the defence of unsoundness of mind, I would argue that public interest may be better served to go to the other direction – to broaden the grounds for raising the defence of unsoundness of mind. Second, in keeping with the raison d'etre of this Bill, which is to protect women, children and vulnerable persons from sexual predators, there should not be an age limit to caning as punishment. Instead, we should look to whether the person is medically fit to be caned. If it is found to be so, age should be no impediment.",2,364,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00364
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"On the first point, I note that it is proposed that before an accused may rely on the defence of unsoundness of mind under section 84 of the Penal Code, he needs to prove that he is both incapable of knowing that what he did was wrong by the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest persons; and wrong as contrary to law. In other words, he did not know what he did was both morally and legally wrong.",3,365,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00365
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I further note that the amendments do not seek to widen the ambit of section 84, which covers only cognitive disorders, to include conative or volitional disorders; meaning to include situations where the accused simply cannot control his actions because of a mental disorder.",4,366,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00366
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I am concerned that, because of the two observations that I made, the ambit of the proposed section 84 is too narrow and this may not be in public interest.",5,367,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00367
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Let me explain. Any lawyer who has raised the defence of unsoundness of mind in Court, and I have done so, would know that an acquittal represents somewhat a Pyrrhic victory. This is because when an accused is held to have done the offending act but acquitted on the grounds of unsoundness of mind, will be ordered by the Minister to be kept in safe custody, usually, in a psychiatric institution ""during the President’s pleasure"".",6,368,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00368
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In other words, he will be incarcerated at the institution indefinitely. Whilst there, he would receive treatment and would be monitored every six months. The Minister who gets the six-monthly reports on the accused, may order him to be discharged, if it is determined that the accused would not be a danger to himself and to others.",7,369,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00369
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Instead of narrowing the ambit of section 84 of the Penal Code, it is my respectful view that public interest may be better served with a broader section 84, so that in an appropriate case, the Court is able to invoke the provisions to ensure that a person who is suffering from a serious mental illness, gets inpatient psychiatric treatment for as long as he would be a danger to himself and the public.",8,370,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00370
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"As it stands today, he may be punished and sentenced in the usual way. If he were to be sentenced to imprisonment, the public will then have to run the risk that the person may reoffend after serving the sentence, causing harm to himself or others, because of his continuing mental illness.",9,371,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00371
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Let me illustrate this through a case – the 2001 High Court decision of PP and Dolah bin Omar. In that case, the accused, aged 55, murdered his own uncle by bludgeoning him to death with a stool. He then cut off his uncle's genitals. The trial judge described the killing as ""utterly gruesome"". The accused, however, was suffering from chronic schizophrenia which brought about a persecutory delusion. Through his counsel, he pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder on the basis of diminished responsibility. The accused however did not raise the defence of unsoundness of mind.",10,372,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00372
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The Court was faced with a dilemma. It recognised that it is arguable that the accused should deserve compassion and leniency since what he did was because of his mental illness. Ordinarily, this would have meant that he should be sentenced to imprisonment not exceeding 10 years.",11,373,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00373
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"That in turn, would have meant he would have been back in circulation in about seven years' time after taking into account remission. Given his mental illness, this may cause further danger to himself and others. Naturally, the Court felt that such an eventuality was not desirable. It rued over the fact that the defence of unsoundness of mind was not invoked because that would allow the accused to be kept in custody in a psychiatric institution for so long as necessary. In the end, the Court, after expressing a lot of difficulty, decided to impose a life imprisonment sentence purely on a utilitarian basis, that is, of course, not doctrinally ideal.",12,374,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00374
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I would also add that since then, we have passed in this House, provisions that would allow for the imposition of Mandatory Treatment Orders (MTOs) on persons who, as a result of their psychiatric conditions, committed minor offences.",13,375,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00375
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Some years back, I argued in this House for a widening of the ambit of offences for which MTOs may be imposed. This led to the issuance of the Criminal Procedure Code (Prescribed Offences for Mandatory Treatment Orders) Regulations 2018 which prescribed a wider list of more serious offences for which MTOs can be imposed. So, the trend where persons with mental illnesses are concerned, is where possible, to impose sentences which will allow them to get treatment which will, hopefully, allow them not to continue with their harmful behaviour.",14,376,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00376
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In 2018, the Penal Code Review Committee (PCRC), in its seminal report issued in August 2018 that precipitated the amendments to the Penal Code in 2019, also advocated a broadening of section 84 of the Penal Code that would allow accused persons with serious mental illnesses to receive clinical intervention instead of being punished.",15,377,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00377
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"It made two points  that section 84 should be broadened to include volitional acts because ""there is no good reason why the criminal law should not account for the fundamental principle that a person should not be held criminally responsible for his involuntary conduct"".",16,378,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00378
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The majority of the Committee also felt it would be sufficient for an accused to be entitled to the defence of unsoundness of mind even if he knew what he did was legally wrong, so long as he did not know what he did was morally wrong, by reference to an objective standard. Against this backdrop, amendments were made in this House to the text of section 84 of the Penal Code in 2019.",17,379,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00379
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I had occasion to review the speeches made by the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary then, who moved several Penal Code amendments, which included section 84 of the Penal Code in 2019. With respect, it was a missed opportunity for the Government to explain why it was taking a different tack from the PCRC which advocated a broadening of the unsound mind defence.",18,380,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00380
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In fairness, as the hon Minister of State said, I noted the illustration too, that was introduced through the amendment of section 84 of the Penal Code which, on its own, seems to manifest an intention that a conjunctive interpretation should be adopted for the amended section 84 of the Penal Code. I am however not surprised that the current amendments are still being sought to amend the wording of section 84.",19,381,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00381
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"This is because it is specifically provided under section 7A of the Interpretation Act, where an illustration is inconsistent with the provision, the provision prevails. In other words, parliamentary intention could not have been sufficiently manifested by mere reference to the illustration. As a result of these developments, even though this provision is being amended for the second time in two years, this is probably the first time that we will be able to hear why is it that it is being proposed to narrow the ambit of section 84 of the Penal Code.",20,382,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00382
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),I would invite the hon Minister of State to please explain why it is felt that the conjunctive interpretation is to be preferred over the disjunctive interpretation of section 84 of the Penal Code; and why is that section 84 is still not broadened to include volitional acts?,21,383,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00383
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I now turn to the primary intention of this Bill which is to enhance penalties for some sexual offences such as outrage of modesty, sexual activity in presence of a minor and so on. Having regard to the crime trend that is being highlighted, I support the amendments to the sentencing provisions that will enable more deterrent sentences to be imposed in egregious cases. This includes not just imprisonment but caning too.",22,384,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00384
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"What I would like to focus on in my speech is whether the provisions providing for the sentence of caning that may be imposed by the Court on male offenders for committing serious sexual offences are fit for purpose. As is well known, sentences of caning prescribed in the Penal Code provisions dealing with serious sexual offences are subject to a requirement in the Criminal Procedure Code that a male offender of or above the age of 50 cannot be caned.",23,385,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00385
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"This has been interpreted by the Court of Appeal in 2015 decision of Yong Vui Kong v PP, to mean that Parliament intended to use the age of 50 as ""a convenient proxy to screen out those who are likely to be unfit for caning"", given that there is ""an inverse relationship between one's age and one's physical condition"".",24,386,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00386
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In March 2020, I highlighted in this House, that the cut-off age of 50 was first introduced in 1900. I also highlighted that the life expectancy at birth for males in Britain, from which the Criminal Procedure Code was enacted in Singapore through Imperial legislation, was 47. The cut-off age more or less coincided with the life expectancy of males at that time. More than 120 years later, the life expectancy at birth for males in Singapore is slightly more than 80 years.",25,387,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00387
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I further pointed out that in Malaysia, whilst the age of 50 has still been retained as a cut-off point for caning, when it comes to serious sexual offences, there is no cut-off age for a male convicted for a serious sexual offence. So long as he is assessed to be medically fit, he can be caned.",26,388,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00388
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I asked if the provision limiting caning for serious sexual offenders to males below 50 is fit for purpose. In reply, the hon Minister of State informed this House then, that her Ministry will look into it and take steps as necessary. More than a year later, I remain concerned whether the provision is still fit for purpose.",27,389,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00389
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),I also wish to highlight an unintended consequence of maintaining the age of 50 as a cut-off age. A repeat offender over 50 may potentially get a less deterrent sentence even after taking into account that he may get an additional term of imprisonment of up to 12 months in lieu of caning.,28,390,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00390
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Just a few days ago on 31 August 2021, The Straits Times published an article of a case of a man who was convicted in 2001 and sentenced to 19 years' jail and 24 strokes of the cane for rape and other sexual offences committed against his then-stepdaughter. After coming out of prison in 2013, the man, after less than three years, sexually abused his two grand-nieces aged nine and 11 respectively. He pleaded guilty to these offences. The irony is that even though he is a repeat offender, he will be getting a sentence without caning because he crossed the age of 50.",29,391,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00391
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"This state of affairs, with respect, is not desirable. I do not see why Parliament should presume in his favour, in favour of a repeat sex offender, that he is not fit to be caned when he is clearly fit to commit those heinous acts. I also think it is not a coincidence that such middle-aged offenders tend to target younger victims. We need to ensure that such like-minded offenders will be strongly deterred from harming them.",30,392,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00392
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In my respectful view, it is for this House to ensure that the caning provisions being passed as punishment for serious sexual offences continue to be fit for purpose. That is, whether a person can be caned or not should be determined by medical fitness, and not age. It is this House’s duty to deal with the unintended consequence of maintaining 50 as the cut-off age for such sexual offenders.",31,393,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00393
2021-09-13-T-014,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I welcome the hon Minister of State’s response to the points I make about caning. With that, I support the Bill.",32,394,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00394

2021-09-13-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, I declare that I am a lawyer in the criminal law practice. Sir, the rationale for some of the key amendments was previously discussed in the House in March, during the Ministerial Statement on the Review of the Sentencing Framework for Sexual and Hurt Offences. Earlier, in his Second Reading speech, the Minister reiterated the Government's position as well.",1,396,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00396
2021-09-13-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Today, I wish to instead raise some reservations about another aspect of the Bill  the changes to the offences involving giving false information to public servants or obstructing them in their duty. Overall, it appears to me that the changes in the Bill will result in a blurring of the distinctions between different offences and I am not clear as to why this is necessary or desirable.",2,397,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00397
2021-09-13-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Let me explain. Under clause 12, the scope of the offence under section 182 of the Penal Code will be expanded. Section 182 deals with the offence of giving false information, with intent to cause a public servant to use his lawful power to the injury of another person. According to the Explanatory Note to the Bill and confirmed by the Minister of State earlier as well, section 182 is being amended in light of the High Court decision this year in Public Prosecutor v Chua Wen Hao.",3,398,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00398
2021-09-13-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, in that case, the offender falsely told Police that he did not know the identity of the person who had set fire to certain property belonging to a hotel. This denial led the Police to spend nearly 22 man-hours on investigations to establish the identity of the culprit. In giving his judgment in the case, as noted by the Minister of State earlier, the Chief Justice ruled that section 182 did not cover a situation where the false information simply led to a public servant being inefficient in exercising his lawful powers to investigate the case. He ruled that section 182 was meant to cover situations where the offender intended or knew that the false information would likely lead the public servant to abuse or misuse his powers, or to improperly omit to use lawful powers. Such scenarios would include false statements that lead to a wrongful arrest, or which subject innocent persons to annoyance. The Chief Justice made clear that false information leading to a public servant simply being inefficient in carrying out his lawful duties did not come under section 182.",4,399,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00399
2021-09-13-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, while clause 12 of this Bill is clearly intended to plug that gap, what is notable about Chua's case is that the offender was not let off scot-free, but was convicted of a simpler offence of furnishing false information to a public servant, under section 177 of the Penal Code. That being the case, I wonder why it is necessary to amend section 182 and, in particular, to add another illustration (d) to capture the situation where false information simply leads to an inefficient use of Police resources. Such conduct is already caught by section 177. In addition, the sub-heading or marginal note to section 182 is not being amended, so it will still read ""False information, with intent to cause a public servant to use his lawful power to the injury of another person"". This could result in some misunderstanding by the public as to the scope of the section.",5,400,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00400
2021-09-13-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"It, therefore, seems to me that there will now be a blurring of the lines between sections 177 and 182, and the rationale for this change is not compelling.",6,401,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00401
2021-09-13-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Yet another blurring may be caused by clause 13, which amends section 186 of the Penal Code. Section 186 deals with ""Obstructing public servant in discharge of his public functions"". Under clause 13, a new subsubsection (2) will be added, to state that obstructing a public servant may be caused other than by use of physical means or threatening language. A new illustration is introduced, where a group of SCDF paramedics is attending to a case of heart attack in a high-rise block, intending to use the lift to the 30th floor; the paramedics are then told by the offender that the lift is out of order, which is not true, causing them to take the stairs. This new illustration confirms that section 186 too will be expanded to cover the giving of false information.",7,402,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00402
2021-09-13-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"There now appears to be yet another overlap between offences, in that giving false information could come within section 177 and also within section 186. How will the Police decide which section to charge a person under?",8,403,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00403
2021-09-13-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, in studying this matter, I note that under section 177, the offender must have been under a legal duty to give information, whereas under section 186, the offender need not have been under such a duty. Giving false information to a public servant when one is under a legal duty to give information is arguably more serious than when one is not under such a duty. This raises the additional question of why the maximum jail term under section 186 is now being brought to the same level as section 177, being raised from three months to six months, when there is a difference in culpability.",9,404,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00404

In this regard, I am heartened by the various efforts made by the Government to make it easier and less straining on minor victims to describe what they had gone through. For example, the multi-disciplinary interview model for children who have been sexually abused by their family members consolidates interviews from various parties into just one interview, so that child victims do not need to repeat accounts of traumatic experiences multiple times. I note also that the National Institute of Early Childhood includes in its curriculum for teachers, concepts of body safety, such as identifying good or bad touches and how to teach children protective skills to prevent sexual abuse. Separately, I look forward to the findings of the review on whether screening should be implemented for persons who work with children.",3,409,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00409

In this regard, I would urge that the Minister consider including a definition or illustrations to make clear what “genital region” refers to.",5,411,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00411

CJ Menon observed in that case that there was a distinction that had to be drawn between a ""misuse"" of Police powers, where an officer ought not to have done something, which is the wording of section 182 in the current Penal Code and an ""inefficient"" use of Police powers, that is, something the officer would not or might not have done.",7,413,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00413

The recent case of Dr Yeo Sow Nam who obtained a discharge amounting to acquittal illustrates how an innocent person can have his name sullied and suffer public and long-term stigma, which affects not only his professional life, but also his personal life. To quote Dr Yeo  ""It was humiliating, a lot of ignominy, public shame, a feeling of persecution by the country I love when I have not done anything wrong"".",10,416,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00416
2021-09-13-T-014,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"Sir, I ask for this review to be done, in particular, for persons accused of sexual crimes because this category of crimes leaves a particular stain on how a person is viewed by the public, even if that person is ultimately found not guilty or discharged. Furthermore, such crimes, because they often occur in private, tend to have a ""he-said-she-said"" character. The Courts themselves have acknowledged this in how they assess the evidence adduced, in requiring that testimony be ""unusually convincing"" for a conviction. I also urge that the study consider whether such protection should be provided until all avenues of appeal are exhausted.

2021-09-13-T-014,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Firstly, as we increase the sentence for engaging in sexual activity before a minor or causing a minor to observe a sexual image, does it also include sending hyperlinks or deceptively embedding hyperlinks to sexual images, content and websites to minors? Secondly, beyond harsher sentences, how can we better protect the vulnerable. Finally, while we support harsher sentences, we must also protect the wrongly accused.",2,422,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00422
2021-09-13-T-014,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Let me touch on the first clarification. We must recognise that sexual offences are not only physically damaging but it scars the victims emotionally and psychologically. There has been an alarming increase of outrage of modesty cases. As mentioned by Minister Shanmugam, which was reported in The Straits Times on 5 March 2021, the number of outrage of modesty cases between 2016 and 2020 was 24% higher than from 2011 to 2015. Given the rise in cases, the harsher sentences will act as a strong deterrence for would-be offenders.",3,423,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00423
2021-09-13-T-014,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The increased use of the digital space amongst our youth, unfortunately, also increases the chance of them being exposed to sexual grooming, sometimes even on seemingly innocent online platforms. Beyond just sending inappropriate pictures and content to the vulnerable, I would like to clarify if this also includes sending hyperlinks of sexual images or hyperlinks to sexual content and websites through platforms, such as Instagram Chat, WhatsApp chat, Tik Tok comments, or chat on games platforms like Minecraft or Roblox. Sometimes, these hyperlinks are also deceptively embedded in an online chat and take the form of what is known as ""clickbait"". An innocent child may inadvertently be routed to inappropriate content and this is, indeed, something that is increasingly worrying. In addition, what legal action can be taken by the Ministry if the perpetrators are not in Singapore as it is more than conceivable that online sexual grooming can occur across state borders? Will the Ministry consider setting up a platform where parents, adults and minors can easily report such perpetrators?",4,424,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00424
2021-09-13-T-014,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Is there a register of sexual offenders in Singapore? Do we have the capability and resource to track such offenders if there is, indeed, one? And how do we prevent such sexual offenders from taking on roles which may put others at risk? For example, will they be barred from becoming teachers or private tutors and coaches? And what happens when a person on such an offenders’ list is successfully rehabilitated and fully repentant?",5,425,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00425
2021-09-13-T-014,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The change to gender-neutral language also reflects the unfortunate realities of such heinous acts. Any vulnerable person can be a victim and to characterise a person as a potential offender through a checklist, is creating caricatures. As such, it is of utmost importance that parents and guardians be mindful about who is trustworthy, exercise vigilance and educate the young to spot and report what is not appropriate. In addition, the community has a responsibility to create safe spaces for the vulnerable to report such acts without shame, guilt or fear.",6,426,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00426
2021-09-13-T-014,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"While harsher sentences do act as a deterrence, how can we further protect the vulnerable against convicted offenders? Can the Ministry consider some form of registry or self-declaration such that convicted offenders of sexual offences will not be able to work in situations where they will be exposed to the vulnerable? How do we enhance the protection to our children and allow parents to make an informed decision? Many of our children are taking private tuition, coaching lessons, or extracurricular activities, such as piano lessons. It can even extend to school bus drivers and their attendants, and vendors for after-school programmes. It is of paramount importance that we do not make our children more vulnerable than they already are.",7,427,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00427
2021-09-13-T-014,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"For convicted offenders of sexual offences who prey on victims online, can the Ministry consider monitoring their online activities during their rehabilitation period after they have served their sentences?

2021-09-13-T-014,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"These two methods may prove to be more of a deterrent to potential offenders than simply increasing the maximum sentence of the offences. However, while we support harsher sentences, we must also protect the wrongly accused. The nature of sexual offences is such that it takes a lot courage for a victim to proceed in making a report. Self-doubt, embarrassment and even a sense of self-blame plague many victims. It is because of this mental anguish, on top of any physical harm and abuse that have already occurred, that perpetrators must be brought to justice. However, it should not be abused by the very few who, out of spite or mischief, decide to lodge such reports. Mr Speaker, Sir, in Malay, please.",9,429,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00429

2021-09-13-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"First, I would like to seek clarification on the measures to ensure that adult offenders who commit sexual and hurt offences no longer pose a threat to public safety once they have served their sentences. This Bill will raise the maximum penalties for outrage of modesty, engaging in sexual activities in the presence of a minor and causing a minor to view sexual images.",2,437,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00437
2021-09-13-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"This is consistent with Minister Shanmugam’s Ministerial Statement last month, when Minister stated that the sentences for sexual and hurt offences must reflect that such acts are deeply offensive to society’s fundamental values. Also in line with this is the announcement that AGC will, generally, object to rehabilitative sentences, such as probation and community-based sentences, where the offenders are adults who commit certain types of hurt or sexual offences.",3,438,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00438
2021-09-13-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I agree with the strong signal sent by focusing on the punitive purpose of sentencing for adult offenders of hurt and sexual offences. However, even with a harsh sentence, there remains a need to ensure that such offenders receive appropriate counselling and treatment. Can the Minister share what kinds of counselling and treatment are provided to offenders of hurt and sexual offences? Will they receive such treatment only during their sentence? Is there scope to consider mandating post-release treatment for such offenders, where medical and psychiatric professionals deem necessary?",4,439,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00439
2021-09-13-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My second point is on the changes of the fault element for certain offences from “malice” to “intent to cause injury” for certain offences. The purpose of this is to clarify the fault element of the offence.,5,440,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00440
2021-09-13-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Injury is defined under the Penal Code as “any harm whatever illegally caused to any person, in body, mind, reputation or property”. Can the Minister confirm that an “intent to cause injury” does not succeed in causing the specific type of injury intended, or the offender does not succeed in injuring the intended victim? Can the Minister also clarify whether emotional injury, such as feelings of harassment or distress, not amounting to psychiatric or mental injury, constitutes injury?",6,441,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00441
2021-09-13-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My final point is on compensation orders for victims. Under section 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the Court is required, after the conviction of an accused, to consider whether or not to make an order for the accused to pay compensation to the person injured. This gives due regard to the harm suffered by the victim of a crime who is an equal participant in the criminal justice system and not simply a means to an end of convicting the accused.",7,442,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00442
2021-09-13-T-014,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"This is also an important mechanism to provide some measure of compensation for the victim of a crime, without requiring the victim to commence lengthy and costly civil proceedings separately after criminal proceedings conclude. Minister Shanmugam announced in his Ministerial Statement that the Ministry will be setting up a Sentencing Advisory Panel to issue non-binding sentencing guidelines. Will the Minister also consider including in the Panel’s scope of work a review and publication of guidelines on compensation quantum under section 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code?

I welcome these amendments to provide greater protection to the most vulnerable groups of our society – children and foreign domestic workers, or FDWs, included. At the same time, these amendments also enhance the punishment for sexual offences and violence against such groups. I agree with the strong signal that abuse of vulnerable persons, children and FDWs cannot be condoned.",1,445,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00445
2021-09-13-T-014,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"The current amendments also expand the jurisdiction of the District Court and Magistrates' Court to hear and mete out enhanced punishments for racially or religiously aggravated offences. This is a welcomed move, especially given the recent discussions on race and racism issues. I hope that these amendments, together with the introduction of the Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act in the future, shall help promote and preserve our racial and religious harmony which is precious to all of us. I do have three clarifications.",2,446,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00446
2021-09-13-T-014,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Firstly, with regard to the amendments to the Penal Code relating to the mistake of law or fact under sections 79, 79A and 80  with the burden of proof on the Prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt, the fault element of the offence, what are the safeguards to prevent abuse of such defences of mistake, especially when someone claims mistake without needing to provide the reasonableness of the same?",3,447,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00447
2021-09-13-T-014,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Secondly, in relation to the offences of obstructing a public servant in the discharge of his public functions, while I agree with the enhanced punishment to six months’ imprisonment, I would like to ask whether there would be a harsher sentence when aggravating factors are present, for example, if the said obstruction has caused damage to public property or loss of life, compromised the safety of the officers, or even jeopardised the operational effectiveness of the mission success or exercise. Perhaps a harsher sentence or appropriate restitution or compensation order should be made in that respect.",4,448,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00448
2021-09-13-T-014,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Thirdly, I welcome the enhanced penalties under the amendment to section 354(1) of the Penal Code, which increases the penalty for the outrage of modesty cases. Anyone who assaults or uses criminal force with intent to outrage modesty would be attracting an enhanced punishment from two years to three years. This sends a strong signal that such sexual violence cannot be condoned.",5,449,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00449
2021-09-13-T-014,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"However, under section 354(2), where the offence is perpetrated upon children under the age of 14, the penalty has not been increased. What is the rationale for not increasing the penalty under section 354(2), if I may ask? Previously, the offence, if committed against children, attracts more than double the punishment, if not committed against children.",6,450,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00450
2021-09-13-T-014,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Separately, what is the rationale to limit section 354(2) to victims under 14 years of age and children as defined under the Children and Young Persons Act (CYPA)? Why not cover all minors under 16 years old? This will be consistent with the offences of sexual grooming or exploitation in sections 376A to 376EE.",7,451,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00451
2021-09-13-T-014,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"In summary, Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the amendments to enhance the punishment for sexual offences and violence. I think there needs to be greater protection for not only children under 14 years of age but all minors under 16 years old.",8,452,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00452
2021-09-13-T-014,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Mr Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding the clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill.",9,453,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00453
2021-09-13-T-014,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Minister K Shanmugam.,1,454,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00454
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Thank you, Sir. I thank the Members who spoke in support of the Bill. I will deal with the questions and suggestions raised by Members in turn.",1,455,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00455
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim suggested that we should raise the penalty for section 354(2). We had considered this and reviewed it. We felt that it was not necessary at this stage. The penalty is severe enough. It has got to take reference from other penalties across different sections.,2,456,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00456
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Murali Pillai asked whether the age limit for caning remains fit for our purpose today. Again, our assessment is that there is no reason to raise the age limit. The number of men over the age of 50 arrested for serious offences that attract caning is significantly lower, compared to men under the age of 50. Where an offender is not eligible for caning, as Mr Murali Pillai and Members of this House will know, the Court can still impose an additional imprisonment term of up to 12 months, in lieu of caning, if it assesses that there is a need to do so.",3,457,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00457
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Member raised the concern of offenders who are near the age of 50 delaying the proceedings to escape caning. Raising the age limit, by itself, may not stop the problem because, when you shift the line, the problem may also shift. But I accept that, in logical terms, by reference to life expectancy, Mr Murali Pillai's case is a cogent one. My response to him is that we have been quite cautious about extending the categories of people who are caned.",4,458,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00458
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"A clarification. In the example cited by Mr Murali Pillai of the accused person who tried to delay proceedings, caning was not carried out in that case because the accused was found medically unfit for caning, not because he had crossed the age of 50. The Court then imposed an additional imprisonment term of 12 months, on top of the initial imprisonment sentence.",5,459,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00459
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Raj Joshua Thomas asked for an update on the setting up of the Sentencing Advisory Panel with regard to the terms of reference and its composition. We will provide, on the formation of the Sentencing Advisory Panel, the terms of reference and its composition in due course, after the details are firmed up.",6,460,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00460
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Mr Louis Ng asked about the Sentencing Advisory Panel as well and whether it could review and publish guidelines on victim compensation under section 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC). Compensation orders under the CPC are meant for cases where the fact and the extent of damage are either agreed or readily and easily ascertainable on the evidence.,7,461,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00461
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Raj Joshua Thomas sought clarification on the rationale for amending section 182. Ms Sylvia Lim made the point as to whether the amendment is necessary, considering that giving false information to a public servant is already dealt with by section 177. As Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Raj Joshua Thomas pointed out, section 177 applies if the person giving false information was legally bound to provide the information to a public servant. In Chua Wen Hao's case, again, as both Members of Parliament pointed out, the Court said that section 182 is not designed to protect a public servant from the inefficient exercise of lawful powers.",8,462,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00462
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Now, I should make clear that inefficient exercise in that case arose from false information being given. Because false information was given, the Police had to spend extra time running around, doing the investigations.",9,463,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00463
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Court held that an offence under section 182 was not made out although Police took more time to investigate the identity of one of the persons of interest because the Police would have had to investigate this case anyway, regardless of the false information.",10,464,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00464
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,We are amending section 182 in a very simple way to deal with this lacuna. Section 182 applies even when you give false information even though you are not under an obligation to do so. Section 177 applies when the person is under a legal obligation to give information.,11,465,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00465
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I note Ms Sylvia Lim's point on the marginal note. We did not amend the marginal note of the provision because the main thrust of the offence has not changed. The intent and the scope of the amendment, of course, is made clear through the wording of the provision, the illustration that has been added, the Explanatory Statement and the discussion in the House today.",12,466,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00466
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Let me now move to section 186.,13,467,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00467
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Ms Sylvia Lim highlighted the overlaps between sections 177 and 186, and sought clarification on the rationale for raising the maximum imprisonment term for section 186, even though providing false information to a public servant when one is under a legal duty to do so, which is section 177, is arguably more serious than when one is not under such a duty. On section 186, I think Ms Sylvia Lim is right if both cases involve giving of false information. Sections 177 and 186, however, can cover different types of criminal conduct.",14,468,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00468
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Section 177, as we have just seen earlier, applies when one is under a legal duty to give information to a public servant. The provision of the false information is the central element of the offence.",15,469,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00469
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In contrast, section 186 deals with obstruction of public servants in the discharge of their public functions. It can be through the provision of false information but it can also be through other means and one can imagine easily very egregious circumstances – deliberate physical obstruction of public servants when they are doing something extremely important and urgent, for example, in the saving of lives.",16,470,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00470
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Quite apart from giving of false information, the crux of the offence under section 186, therefore, is, in some way, interfering or obstructing the performance of a public servant's duties.",17,471,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00471
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The new illustration being added will help to explain this. So, the illustration  a person plays a prank on, say, SCDF paramedics who are responding to an emergency and he gives false information to the paramedics with an intention of causing a delay in the paramedics' provision of medical assistance. Even though the person may not be legally bound to provide information, his act of giving false information, intentionally wasting SCDF's time and resources in the midst of an emergency, could lead to very serious, possibly even fatal consequences.",18,472,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00472
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, the proposed amendments clarify that section 186 is not limited to physical acts of obstruction. They could also include the provision of false information, depending on the facts of each case.",19,473,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00473
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,There is some overlap. I accept that. But the essence of the offences is distinct and primarily addresses different types of conduct.,20,474,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00474
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The proposed raising of the maximum imprisonment term for section 186 to six months is to align the penalties with that of section 177(1) so that they can potentially cover conduct of similar blameworthiness. The actual penalty imposed will, of course, depend on the facts.",21,475,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00475
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Raj Joshua Thomas also highlighted the overlaps between section 177 and the amended section 182 and asked if accused persons will be charged under section 182 instead of the less serious section 177. It is up to the prosecution to assess, exercising their prosecutorial discretion, as to which offence has been established, which charge should be preferred, depending on the facts of each case.",22,476,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00476
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim suggested that persons who obstruct public servants in the discharge of their public functions under section 186 should face a jail term of up to two years, compared to the six months proposed in this Bill. He has said that obstruction could lead to grave consequences. I agree that it could lead to grave consequences, but, at present, having reviewed it, we do not see a need to increase the maximum sentence, based on the cases that have arisen. Some of the more egregious instances raised by the Member will likely be caught by more serious offences, such as section 353 on using criminal force to deter a public servant from discharging his duty.",23,477,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00477

2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim asked why aggravated penalties for outrage of modesty under section 354(2) only apply when the minor is under 14 years old. He suggested aggravated penalty should also apply when a minor is under 16, consistent with the offences of sexual grooming and exploitation.",25,479,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00479
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"This question was considered by the Penal Code Review Committee (PCRC). They submitted their recommendations in 2018. Both sets of offences – whether the victim is below 16 or below 14 – are treated seriously. An offence of sexual penetration under section 376A of the Penal Code is now punishable with up to 10 years of imprisonment and/or a fine if committed against a victim between the ages of 14 and 16. So, it is pretty serious, the penalties.",26,480,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00480
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"However, if the victim is below the age of 14, the offence is punishable with up to 20 years of imprisonment instead and there is also a possibility of caning.

2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Sharael Taha expressed concern about sexual grooming in the digital space. He asked three questions  first, whether the offence of sexual grooming will cover persons who send links to sexual images or content through various online platforms; second, whether the Government could consider setting up a platform for members of the public to report such perpetrators; and third, how will the Government act on information if the perpetrators are not within Singapore?",28,482,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00482

These offences include sexual communications with minors, sexual activity or image in the presence of a minor and depending on the facts of the case, the act of sending links to sexual images or content to a minor under the age of 16 will be covered by this rubric of offences.",29,483,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00483
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"A similar situation will apply if the minor is aged between 16 and 18, and the perpetrator is in an exploitative relationship with the minor. The offences will be committed even if the communication originated from outside of Singapore or the perpetrator is outside Singapore. But bringing him into Singapore and making him face justice is, of course, a separate question. The offences will also apply, regardless of the online platform through which the sexual content was communicated. So, this will cover links sent via Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok, games platforms and so on.",30,484,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00484

Suppose the accused claims a mistake of fact that he mistakenly believed that the watch was his, he needs to show that to the Court.",53,507,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00507
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But the burden remains on the Prosecution. Overall, after taking into account the different facts and different parties in a case may have the burden of proving specific facts, the Prosecution has to show to the Court that the accused had acted dishonestly.",54,508,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00508
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Mr Murali Pillai spoke on the defence of unsoundness of mind under section 84 and suggested for the defence to be broadened in two ways.,55,509,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00509
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"One, to cover volitional disorders. But this was covered in the 2019 Penal Code amendments. Under section 84(c), nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is completely deprived of any power to control his actions.",56,510,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00510
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We are quite cautious about further expanding the defence to cover persons whose mental disorder impaired their control over their actions, but who retained some control over their actions despite their mental disorder. In principle, a person who retains some power to control his actions, but does not do so, remains blameworthy and should face the appropriate legal consequences as opposed to a full acquittal.",57,511,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00511
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Pillai also suggested that section 84(b) be amended to apply disjunctively, instead of conjunctively. In other words, to be acquitted under this defence, the accused person needs only to show either that he was incapable of knowing that what he was doing was wrong by the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest persons, or that he was incapable of knowing that it was wrong as contrary to the law.",58,512,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00512
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,We considered this issue during the last review of the Penal Code in 2019. Our policy position was that the requirements should be conjunctive. Just because a person was incapable of knowing that his action was contrary to law does not mean that we should avail the defence to them.,59,513,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00513
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Pillai said that an acquittal due to the defence of unsoundness of mind would be a Pyrrhic victory, as the accused will be ordered by the Minister to be kept in safe custody, which usually means a psychiatric institution ""during the President's pleasure"".",60,514,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00514
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The reasons why that is done is that if he is released out, the person may go out and do more harm. And there is also a significance to a conviction. It is a finding that a person is guilty and should be appropriately punished. We are not narrowing the ambit of the defence.",61,515,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00515
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Prior to the 2019 amendments, the legal position on whether a conjunctive or disjunctive reading should be applied was unclear. This ambiguity was acknowledged by the PCRC. We sought to clarify this in 2019 in favour of a conjunctive reading and are making it even clearer now.",62,516,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00516
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Even if an accused person does not meet the threshold of unsoundness of mind under section 84, the Court will still consider the evidence on the person's mental condition in determining what the appropriate sentence should be.",63,517,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00517
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Finally, Mr Pillai made the point that section 84 should be broadened in the way that he suggested, so that a person can continue to be detained and treated for as long as he remains a danger to himself and the public, instead of having to release him into the community after completing his imprisonment term.",64,518,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00518
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"During imprisonment, prisoners with serious mental disorders receive treatment by professionals from both the Prisons and the Institute of Mental Health, or IMH. When prisoners are due to be released, those whose conditions remain severe enough to warrant immediate follow-up are assessed directly by IMH. IMH may decide to detain the individuals further at IMH under the provisions of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act.",65,519,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00519
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"IMH can act in those ways and the Act allows for the detention of a person at IMH for treatment if he is suffering from a mental disorder which warrants his detention at IMH for treatment; and it is in the interests of the health or safety of the person or for the protection of other persons, that he should be detained. In less severe cases, Prisons may make referrals to IMH or polyclinics for follow-up care, after the offender's release from prison.",66,520,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00520
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But ultimately, this relates to public safety and protection, which is a separate issue from that of criminal responsibility, which is what section 84 is basically concerned with.",67,521,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00521
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Pillai cited the case of Public Prosecutor v Dolah Bin Omar, to suggest that the defence of unsoundness of mind should be broadened. In that case, the unsoundness of mind defence was not pleaded. The lawyer for the accused and the Judge both accepted that on the evidence, the accused's mental condition did not come within the rubric of unsoundness of mind defence. There is nothing to indicate that the accused would have qualified for the defence, regardless of whether a disjunctive or conjunctive reading is to be applied.",68,522,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00522
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Thomas suggested including a definition or illustrations to make clear what ""genital region"" refers to. The term ""genital region"" is currently used in existing provisions to define child abuse material and there have not been concerns raised over the interpretation of this term so far. So, there is a fair degree of clarity on it and we do not expect that there will be difficulty in interpreting the term in the context of the offence of voyeurism. But if such difficulties arise, we will relook at this.",69,523,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00523
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Louis Ng sought clarifications on our proposals to update older terms in the Penal Code, say, replacing the word ""malice"" with the phrase with ""intent to cause injury"".",70,524,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00524
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"To clarify, the phrase ""intent to cause injury"" relates or refers to the offender's mental state. Therefore, an offender may be found to have intended to cause injury, even if he had not succeeded in causing the specific type of injury intended or injuring the intended victim.",71,525,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00525
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As stated in the definition of ""injury"", any harm that is illegally caused to the victim, in the mind, will amount to an injury. It is not necessary for the harm to take the form of a psychiatric or mental disorder, for there to be an injury.",72,526,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00526
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Courts will have to decide in each case, based on the circumstances, whether there is harm that is illegally caused to the victim's mind. Feelings of harassment or distress may, depending on the circumstances, satisfy this test.",73,527,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00527
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Zhulkarnain sought clarification on who section 304C targets. Section 304 sets out the offence of causing or allowing the death of a child below 14 years of age, or a domestic worker, or a vulnerable person in the same household. And Members will realise, a child under 14 years old as well as a domestic worker can broadly be classified as vulnerable persons as well. I spoke about this earlier in the House, I think, in March or perhaps earlier.",74,528,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00528
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"This offence deals with situations where two or more persons were in a position to cause the death of the victim, but both deny that they were the ones who caused the death. Frequently, we have come across cases, child, five years old or six years old, scalded, beaten up, bones broken, brought to the hospital, dead and some story is given. And both parents, and sometimes, it is the step parent that denies responsibility. This provision will cover such situations because if they did not do it, nevertheless, they knew it was happening and they had a duty to protect the child.",75,529,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00529
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sometimes, it is very difficult to prove in Court who committed the abuse and who permitted the abuse. With such ambiguity, a perverse result that both get acquitted on the basis that the case against neither can be proven beyond reasonable doubt, that is a travesty of justice.",76,530,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00530
2021-09-13-T-014,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, we introduced section 304C in 2019 to allow us to deal with persons and not just persons who abused a victim and caused his/her death, but also persons who stood by and allowed the abuse.",77,531,2021-09-13-T-014-S-00531

2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Sir, when the Copyright Act was first introduced in 1987, we recognised that copyright law could benefit society by encouraging the production of creative works like books, news articles, software, music, art and films by ensuring that the flow of such knowledge, ideas and information will not be unduly stifled.",2,543,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00543
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"To do so, copyright law needs to strike a fair balance between, on the one hand, ""rights owners"", who are the owners of copyright or rights of protected performances and users on the other hand.",3,544,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00544
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"This balance is achieved by giving rights owners the right, for a limited duration, to prevent or restrict others from using their works or protected performances while also providing limitations and exceptions to those rights to allow the public to use those works or protected performances without encumbrance.",4,545,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00545

Now, anyone can be a photographer or even produce a short video or film. New platforms enable these new creators to reach their audiences directly.

And a public consultation on the draft Bill was held in early 2021. We received over 500 responses from both individuals and organisations alike.

2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"First, let me highlight the change which helps in the use of works and recordings of protected performances for education.",29,580,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00580
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The use of Internet materials for educational activities has increased in importance over the years and now, even more so, particularly in the context of the pandemic, with home-based learning and other online activities.",30,581,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00581
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Clause 204 of the Bill creates a new permitted use of Internet materials for educational activities, including home-based teaching and learning conducted by non-profit educational institutions.",31,582,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00582
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"It is limited to Internet materials that are generally accessible to the public for free.

The student, in turn, can use these materials for their projects or their assignments in school.",32,583,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00583
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"One condition is that the teacher or student must not knowingly use Internet materials which infringe copyright. If they unknowingly do so and subsequently receive a notification from the rights owner, then, they must stop using the material. If the material has been communicated to the public, they must take reasonable steps to prevent further access to the material. Any further use of that material would not be allowed under this permitted use.",33,584,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00584

2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In particular, the requirement to pay fees to rights owners when organisations help people with print disabilities convert works and protected performances into accessible formats was seen as making the conversion process even more expensive and time-consuming. It also effectively charged persons with print disabilities twice, since they would have already purchased a copy of the work or the recording of the performance for the organisation to make the conversion.",37,588,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00588
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Consequently, Division 4 of Part 5 of the Bill, modifies the permitted uses relating to persons with print disabilities to remove the obligation to pay fees to the rights owner when conversions are made and distributed.",38,589,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00589

2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Another change, Sir, is found in clause 244 of the Bill, which allows the use of works and recordings of protected performances for computational data analysis. To give Members an example, this permitted use can be relied on when training an Artificial Intelligence programme or using computers to analyse large databases of materials, without needing to seek permission from each rights owner.	It will apply in both commercial and non-commercial contexts.",40,591,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00591

2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"At this juncture, Sir, let me highlight that I would also be moving two amendments to the Bill at its Committee stage, to correct a drafting omission in clauses 247 and 248. These clauses allow the use of sound recordings and recordings of performances under specified circumstances, subject to payment of equitable remuneration to the copyright owner. The amendments, Sir, replace the term ""copyright owner"" with the term, ""rights owner"" in both clauses. The latter is a broader term and also includes persons who are entitled to bring an action for infringing uses of a performance. As the scope of the exception covers performances, the amendments ensure that there is a corresponding obligation to pay the rights owner of the performance.",42,593,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00593
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, the third category of changes strengthens the overall copyright ecosystem and I will touch on this now. Divisions 1 and 2 of Part 9 create a new class licensing scheme that sets minimum standards for how Collective Management Organisations, or CMOs, operate. CMOs are private organisations that represent groups of rights owners to grant licences to users. This is an efficient way for users to get licences from a large group of rights owners. For example, users often get licences from CMOs to play songs in public. The alternative would be for users to have to seek permission directly from the composer and the lyricist of each song.",43,594,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00594
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Historically, CMOs have not been regulated.

2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In response, an arrangement was reached in 2012 for CMOs to self-regulate through a voluntary code of conduct.

Our public consultation in 2017 garnered feedback that the earlier concerns still remain relevant. Thus, the need for some oversight of CMOs.",45,596,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00596
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In this Bill, the new CMO regulatory framework will be administered by the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) and will address issues of transparency, governance, accountability and efficiency.

This Bill will also rationalise and update the existing criminal offences relating to works and protected performances. Part 8 of the Bill provides for these offences.	Offences are now categorised into those with commercial element, which share the same higher penalty and those without a commercial element, which attracts a lower range of penalties. The penalties reflect the severity of the different types of criminal activities and will more effectively deter future acts of infringement.",48,599,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00599
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Finally, Sir, I want to speak briefly on the changes we have made to the structure of and the language used in the Bill. We had made three key changes in this respect.",49,600,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00600
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"First, the structure has been redesigned, overhauled, to improve the organisation of the legislation. Second, we have taken the opportunity to ensure that the Bill is written in plain English, for ease of reading and understanding. For existing provisions that have been rewritten in plain English, section 9B of the Interpretation Act helps to clarify that such changes in style do not affect the meaning just because different forms of words have been used to express the same idea. Third, we have included illustrations showing how certain provisions should be applied in common situations to help rights owners and users understand their rights and obligations more easily.",50,601,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00601

Because copyright affects everyone, whether as a rights owner or user, these changes will make the Bill easier for all to understand.",51,602,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00602
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, we intend to implement the majority of the Bill, if passed, in November this year.

2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Speaker, let me now conclude. At slightly over 320 pages, the Bill is a significant undertaking. The responses we have received in our various public consultations, including the most recent one for the Bill itself, have been generally supportive. Respondents tell us that the Bill meets its goal of responding to the challenges and opportunities of the current digital environment and also being easier to understand. Importantly, this Bill will play its part in helping Singapore maintain our top-class intellectual property regime. With that, Mr Speaker, I beg to move.",53,604,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00604

It discourages creative work of authors and unfairly allows those who infringe copyright to profit without putting in their effort.",6,611,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00611
2021-09-13-T-015,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),The Copyright Bill 2021 is a comprehensive Bill of some 348 pages. I support the Bill but I wish to seek clarifications on some of the changes to the existing Act which MinLaw had highlighted.,7,612,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00612
2021-09-13-T-015,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"First, it is about ownership of copyright. Sir, I am concerned about the changes brought about under clause 133 of the Bill. The clause provides that creators of certain type of works like photographs, portraits, engravings, sound recordings and films will by default be the first owner of the works, unless there is a contrary intention in a written agreement. This is a slightly different position from the current section 30(5) of the Copyright Act whereby the ownership of the copyright of the artistic works would belong to the person who engages or commissions the author for valuable consideration.",8,613,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00613
2021-09-13-T-015,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"As an illustration, in a case where a consumer engages a photographer to take a video or photographs for a wedding or a birthday party or a family function, he may not be aware that the position has changed and that he need to expressly sign a written agreement to retain ownership of the copyright of his photos or the video. Without the written agreement, the photographer or the videographer may be able to retain these personal photographs of the consumer.",9,614,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00614
2021-09-13-T-015,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"May I ask the Minister whether the Government can consider allowing agreements to be made orally and not just in writing so that a consumer would not inadvertently lose the copyright to his personal photos or video recording just because he forgot to sign a written contract. Would the Ministry also consider providing a standard template for a written agreement in the IPOS or in the Consumers' Association (CASE) website, so that consumers can easily reply on the template agreement to retain the copyright to their videos or photographs.",10,615,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00615
2021-09-13-T-015,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sir, this will be a major change in the current position as to who owns the copyright of personal videos or photos. I urge the Government to embark on an education exercise to inform consumers as to the changes which may impact their lives. I believe many individuals may not be comfortable that the photographer, whom they engage to take photos for their wedding, birthday, or social function is entitled to keep these photos in his portfolio. If they are paying the photographer or the videographer, why are they not the owner of the copyright?",11,616,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00616
2021-09-13-T-015,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Next, Fair Use Exception. I support the strengthening of the Fair Use exceptions contained at clauses 190 to 194 of the Bill. Although the concept of copyright is to protect the intellectual outputs of the creator of the works, the Government needs to balance the rights of the IP owner versus the public interest involved or the needs of society to use the works for education or research or certain other purposes as described in those clauses. Ms Ng-Loy Wee Loon, the author of the textbook, Law of Intellectual Property of Singapore, quoted Sir Isaac Newton as saying, ""If I have seen further, it is by standing on ye shoulders of giants"".",12,617,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00617
2021-09-13-T-015,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"This is a reminder that every IP creator is building on works created by those who come before him. Thus, the law should allow for the use of certain types of copyright because it would advance the interest of the public. It is also clear that some creators of current copyright works today are only able to do so because there were other foundational creative works done by people before them.",13,618,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00618
2021-09-13-T-015,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sir, I wish to seek clarification on clause 204 of the Bill. This clause allows schools and students of non-profit educational institutions to use certain works or recordings or performances available on the Internet. Sir, what if the works, recordings or performances are used by students from institutions which are for-profit private schools, but nevertheless, still for educational purposes? If these private schools have to pay for the royalties, it is likely that they will pass on the additional costs of copyright fees to their students who are also consumers.",14,619,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00619
2021-09-13-T-015,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"I know of many Singaporeans who are mature students and pursuing their further education in commercial education institutions, which are for-profit. Has the Government assessed the financial impact of the increased costs of education to these students? In the larger picture, would it not be better for the Government to encourage education by making it less costly? I wish to ask the Government to consider extending the exception under clause 204 to all educational institutions.",15,620,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00620

Can the Minister clarify whether Institutions of a Public Character (IPCs), which have been set up as non-profit entities and exist for charitable purposes can be granted the same exemption under clause 204?",16,621,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00621
2021-09-13-T-015,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Next, I wish to talk about commercial dealing in set-top boxes. Clause 150 makes it an infringement of copyright if a person makes a device or provides a service and so on to access works communicated without authority.",17,622,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00622
2021-09-13-T-015,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"I understand that this clause 150 refers to the sale of set-top boxes which allows the buyer of the set-top box to gain access to various online audio or visual content. I can appreciate how this clause is intended to stamp out the sale of set-top boxes in some shopping complexes. But the reality is that similar set-top boxes are also easily available in other countries and in particular, just across the Causeway. May I ask the Minister how does the Government intend to stop the consumer from buying such set-top boxes from overseas? Otherwise, it would be a loophole where consumers cannot buy infringing set-top boxes in Singapore but can do so easily overseas.",18,623,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00623

2021-09-13-T-015,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Currently, CMOs are not regulated. For example, a consumer, who is a video producer, who wishes to use a song for his home-made video as background music, would need to find out which is the CMO which can issue him a licence for the use of the lyrics or the song in the video. He has to enquire whether the CMO is the only organisation allowed to collect the royalty. He then has to negotiate the fee collected by the organisation. As a consumer, he has limited negotiating powers to deal with such CMOs.",20,625,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00625
2021-09-13-T-015,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Hence, I think it is helpful to regulate such organisations that collect royalties or fees so that there is greater transparency as to the ownership of the copyright and the fees payable. Thus, individuals and commercial entities that play or broadcast music in their restaurants, hotels, malls, offices or shops would be able to deal with the correct CMO and negotiate for the payment of the royalty in a transparent manner.",21,626,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00626
2021-09-13-T-015,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),May I ask the Minister whether there is intent to regulate the amount of royalties or the fees payable to such CMOs.

2021-09-13-T-015,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"I will begin by stating my support for the Bill. However, I will point out a number of residual concerns that I have, notably, on the duration of copyrights, copyrights associated with sound recordings, default ownership of copyright works and fair use provisions. I will conclude by taking a step back and asking the broader question of whether intellectual property law has fulfilled its intended purposes.",2,630,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00630
2021-09-13-T-015,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Clauses 114, 122 and 125 introduced a number of revisions to copyright duration. To the good, it streamlines the expiry of copyrights to a common 70 years, starting either posthumously or from the date of creation or publication, depending on the nature of the work. Such harmonisation and simplification, in general, are certainly welcome in the areas of the law.",3,631,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00631
2021-09-13-T-015,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Inherent in this simplification, however, are a number of implicit choices that, to my mind, raise some questions. Limiting the duration of copyright for anonymous works to 70 years is certainly better than perpetuity, which was the case before. But setting aside minimum terms stipulated in international conventions, why would such a long duration of protection be necessary in the first place? With no identified author, who would be the beneficiaries of a 70-year copyright and more importantly, would conferring such protection generate net benefits for society rather than releasing its use to the public domain? I shall return to this more general point about the benefits and costs of granting intellectual monopolies at the end of my speech.",4,632,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00632
2021-09-13-T-015,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Similarly, it is worth observing that the decision to limit copyright protection to 70 years following the creator's passing as opposed to the date of publication, as was the case previously, amounts to an extension of the period of protection. Again, while I understand why such consistency between clauses may be attractive, we should be aware that this inhibits the free usage of such works for the purposes of teaching and research, which yield benefits of their own instead of extending additional rent to copyright beneficiaries.",5,633,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00633
2021-09-13-T-015,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Before I move on, I would just add that while the comparatively longer copyright duration of 70 years is certainly the norm in most high-income countries, this is by no means unanimous. Canada, Hong Kong and New Zealand have also chosen the lower threshold of life, plus 50 years instead.

2021-09-13-T-015,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Educating the public. Second, we need to do more to educate the public. In one of my dialogues with a freelance professional, he explained that in the course of his work, he had to obtain various licences and permits from seven different publishing houses to use and perform a particular performance. He told me that it was an administrative hassle determining who he had to liaise with, especially since each publishing house owned different rights over that single performance. In his words, I quote, ""It is not that we do not want to comply, We want to comply, we really do, but we do not know how to! It is too confusing.""",30,693,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00693

2021-09-13-T-015,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Another aspect of education involves educating the service buyers. As highlighted earlier, some of these onerous clauses are terms ""copied-and-pasted"" across many contracts and thus regarded as the ""norm"". As some of the service buyers are not legally trained, they are therefore averse to any amendments. Accordingly, a basic course and guide on contract principles may be useful so that once service buyers are aware of their rights and implications, they would be less resistant towards contract negotiations. And where reasonable, they would be inclined to agree to it, which would expedite matters.",32,695,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00695

2021-09-13-T-015,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"The objectives of the Bill are laudable and include upholding Singapore's international obligations relating to intellectual property (IP), updating and rationalising various aspects of our existing laws on IP and improving accessibility to and ease of understanding these laws. Critically, it also confers upon authors and performers the moral right to be identified and includes provisions governing fair usage of IP matters. It is these final two elements of the Bill that I will concentrate my speech on.",2,704,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00704

Divisions 1 and 2 of Part 7 automatically grant authors the right to be identified in relation to the works they produce and performers to be identified with their performances. This is a welcome step further than the current regime under which creators and performers only have a right to prevent the false attribution of another person as the author or performer.",3,705,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00705

2021-09-13-T-015,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"In many other jurisdictions, for example, the UK, US, Australia, New Zealand and various European countries, creators and performers earn residual payments, or royalties for the use of their works and performances. For example, writers and actors of television programmes broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) earn royalties. This is in contrast to the situation in Singapore where writers and actors on Mediacorp television programmes do not do so.",5,707,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00707
2021-09-13-T-015,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"It is further notable that creators and performers have organised themselves into guilds and unions, such as the powerful British performers' union ""Equity"" and the Writers' Guild of Great Britain, which have not only been crucial in fighting for better pay and working conditions for their members, but are also key in protecting such practitioners and their livelihoods in the wake of the devastation wrought by COVID-19, by negotiating with employers to improve working terms and conditions, improve and ensure diversity in their ranks. They also have a right to be consulted on various matters. The ability to have such representation and rights recognised was particularly important as the industry was wrecked by the lockdowns and restrictions brought on by the coronavirus and will be key in helping them to weather any future major disruptions. In contrast, the Screenwriters' Association (Singapore), while doing good work for the training and development of its members, does not have the power to negotiate minimum standards and protections for its members, and is limited to providing feedback to IMDA focus group meetings upon invitation.",6,708,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00708
2021-09-13-T-015,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"The system in Singapore surrounding creative practitioners is therefore still very much tied with the involvement and endorsement of the Government. Therefore, the Workers' Party would support a move that goes even further than the current Bill in giving more rights, protections and rewards to creators and performers to be in line with those in developed countries. With this in mind, I would like to ask if the Government intends to go even further to recognise the rights of creators and performers by legislating for them to receive royalty payments. Is the change in copyright law, meant to be a step in that direction?",7,709,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00709

I note that these assert a territorially-premised copyright claim. However, it is less clear what the protections and provisions available for international and enforcement of such claims are. What cross-border legal resources are available and are these embedded within a new copyright protection regime? These are not abstract and theoretical questions, as recently seen in the case of a dispute that arose earlier this year over one of our beloved National Day songs.",8,710,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00710

Division 2 of the Bill replaces the fair dealings provision in sections 35, 36, 37, 109, 110 and 111 of the existing Act with the concept of fair use, which ""depend on the facts"", while still being subject to the considerations specified in clause 191. This shifts the treatment of alleged copyright infringements away from the fair dealings doctrine – the treatment under English law, where violations must fall into categories defined in the statue – toward a more open-ended fair use doctrine, the approach adopted in the US, where factors did not match any exhaustive list.",9,711,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00711
2021-09-13-T-015,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Importantly, the Bill's open-ended fair use exception now means that the Court need to determine whether the fair use exception applies. I note that this discretion opens up the possibility of significant ambiguity, particularly in the beginning without a body of case law to back it up. This is especially in the case of online content and for themes that are deliberately ambiguous, such as memes or parody.",10,712,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00712
2021-09-13-T-015,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Given that an increasing number of Singaporeans are creating online content, will the Minister provide any further clarification on what would constitute ""fair use"" or would this await the guidance of the Courts when the matter has been taken to litigation? This could be confusing for existing content creators who might only have guidance to what would constitute ""fair use"" of their works but undertaking costly and time-consuming litigation over the potential infringement of their ownership rights. Would IPOS provide specific illustrations of when a use connotes fair use versus when it would not? Such an approach would further the Government's purpose for introducing the fair use exception, in particular, to ""create an environment conducive to the development of creative works"".",11,713,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00713
2021-09-13-T-015,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"One potential way forward would be for industry associations to take the lead and issue guidelines on what ""fair use"" would look like for that particular industry, an approach that MinLaw appears to have considered, as mentioned in 2019 MinLaw and IPOS Copyright Review report.

This applies to both commercial and non-commercial activities and would permit reproduction of works and recordings of performances for ""computational data analysis"", including the preparation of works for analysis.

Nowadays, if I want to see if Roger Federer would ever win another Slam, I would need to pay around $49.90 a month or $449 a year for the Sports Plus package to watch it on TV after spending lots of time and effort navigating the confusing variety of different sports, the different channels and providers offer and deal with changes to availability due to exclusivity rights expiring.

For example, the Bill makes it explicit that it is permitted to make copies and use copyright works for the purposes of computational data analysis, subject to certain conditions and safeguards. This will allow for aggregation and analysis of data for such purposes as sentiment analysis or machine learning. These, ultimately, have a public interest aspect to synthesise data for better understanding of, for example, social or economic trends.

The Copyright Bill is a timely update to ensure that we stay in step with changes in technology, meeting the needs of a growing creative economy and the increased use of data in the form of audio, video and text in all aspects of our lives.",1,746,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00746
2021-09-13-T-015,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"The Copyright Bill seeks to establish a well-functioning copyright system that will help content to be created and attributed rightly, distributed efficiently and consumed fairly.",2,747,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00747
2021-09-13-T-015,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),I hope to raise some suggestions to ensure that Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) among us have equitable and fair access to consume and enjoy creative copyrighted content.,3,748,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00748
2021-09-13-T-015,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Many PWDs are artistically inclined and are very creative. The Copyright Bill, with provisions for default ownership as well as the right of attribution to be with the creator, will enable creators who are PWDs to have an income from their creation and that their rights are protected. Notwithstanding this, we need to also ensure that they are given the same level of access to creative works as the abled so that they can enjoy content and be inspired by it.",4,749,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00749
2021-09-13-T-015,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Firstly, PWDs should have fair and equitable access to copyrighted content in a format that they can consume, regardless of their disability. I am glad that the Copyright Bill contains exceptions intended to give persons who are print-disabled greater and more equal access to copyrighted works. These exceptions were introduced in 2015 to implement Singapore's commitments under the World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) Marrakesh Treaty. I am further heartened to know that the obligation for authorised entities to pay equitable remuneration for converting copyrighted works is removed, thus making access for the print-disabled easier.",5,750,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00750
2021-09-13-T-015,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"However, I would like to clarify why this obligation remains for Persons with Intellectual Disabilities, as stated in Division 5 of section 217(3). Intellectual and cognitive disabilities cover a wide range of disabilities that affect mental processes of a person. This includes disabilities, such as Down's syndrome, autism, learning disabilities like dyslexia, brain injuries from illness or trauma and dementia. They result in difficulty in processing complex information, requiring a transformation of the material into more easily understood forms. This transformation can include plain and simple language or high/low versions of written and audio works; changes in formatting, including pictorial illustrations and text-to-speech technology, which help people with dyslexia to access print content.",6,751,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00751
2021-09-13-T-015,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"The same considerations that apply to Persons with Print Disabilities should also apply to Persons with Intellectual Disabilities. Converting content into a form accessible by Persons with Intellectual Disabilities would likewise be expensive, time-consuming and would add to the cost incurred by effectively paying twice to consume the work.",7,752,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00752
2021-09-13-T-015,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"As such, I would like to propose to remove the obligation for authorised entities to pay equitable remuneration to copyright owners for making, distributing or making available copies of copyrighted works for Persons with Intellectual Disabilities. This will bring the treatment of copyrighted works equal for persons with print or intellectual disabilities and likewise, ensure fair and equitable access for both.",8,753,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00753
2021-09-13-T-015,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Secondly, we should also consider persons with hearing disability are not excluded in the consumption of creative works unintendedly. Many of the copyright provisions are for the print-disabled, which include those with visual impairments, perceptual or reading disabilities or physical disabilities that impede the ability to manipulate a book.",9,754,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00754
2021-09-13-T-015,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"However, technology has made creative content much more immersive, requiring both audio and visual senses to fully participate and enjoy. Content on the web is a rich visual and audio experience which can include audio-visual recordings, documentaries and video reports.",10,755,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00755
2021-09-13-T-015,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"For the hearing impaired to consume such content, it will have to be transcribed into an accessible copy that includes subtitles or sign language. Although technology and artificial intelligence tools may be able to enable auto-transcription, but there are also limitations in the quality of transcriptions and hence, the need for manual transcription, which requires access to copyrighted materials.",11,756,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00756
2021-09-13-T-015,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Hence, I would like to ask whether the current provisions for print-disabled persons can also be extended to persons with hearing disability. This would ensure that PWDs with different or multiple disabilities will have fair access to content.",12,757,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00757
2021-09-13-T-015,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Lastly, as we seek to be a more inclusive and fair society, we must make every effort for PWDs to freely participate in the cultural life of the community to enjoy the arts and its benefits. It is important then that this access for PWDs to enjoy works, regardless of the contractual agreements in place between creators and users.",13,758,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00758
2021-09-13-T-015,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"In this respect, I would like to propose for consideration that Division 4 and Division 5 of Part 5 to be included in the list of exceptions from being restricted by contracts so that the authorised entities would be able to provide accessible copies for PWDs, beyond those who are print-disabled, without having the heavy burden of verifying the contractual terms or the fear of a breach of contract. This will encourage greater participation and inclusion of PWDs in our growing arts and cultural works. Nonetheless, this should also be done and carefully applied such that it does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the creators.",14,759,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00759
2021-09-13-T-015,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"As a society, we have grown and matured in our expression and appreciation of arts, culture and creative content. Through the Copyright Bill, we are putting in place a framework to acknowledge the rights of creators and value their work, and updating the law for the digital age. We also need to recognise that PWDs can and should be able to access and participate in the cultural, arts and creative expressions like any of our fellow Singaporeans. I hope that MinLaw will consider my suggestions so that we can build a truly inclusive and fair society. Sir, notwithstanding my suggestions, I support the Copyright Bill.",15,760,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00760
2021-09-13-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Order. I propose to take a break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 4.45 pm.,1,761,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00761
2021-09-13-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Sitting accordingly suspended,2,762,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00762

2021-09-13-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Sitting resumed at 4.45 pm.,4,764,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00764
2021-09-13-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,[(proc text) Debate resumed. (proc text)],5,765,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00765
2021-09-13-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Government's move to strengthen copyright laws. I will touch on three points in my speech. My first point is on creating a culture that attributes creators. This is shown in the amendment which allows schools and students to use freely available resources from the Internet. These are for educational purposes, if they acknowledge the source and cite the access date.",1,766,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00766
2021-09-13-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"During home-based learning, some teachers face challenges with producing compelling learning content for their students. As the Internet is a gold mine of educational content, it is sensible to tap on it. This should come without encumbering teachers with the onerous requirement of getting consent, as long as the content is readily available for use. Students will, in turn, be reminded to discern the legitimacy of online sources, as well as to reference them in their assignments, when they see their teachers properly quoting their sources.",2,767,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00767
2021-09-13-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"The right to be identified and the mandatory acknowledgement of sources will help to cultivate a culture that recognises creators. Starting young also helps to inculcate the right habits of referencing and the value of honesty as they progress academically. Teachers can also inculcate the right referencing styles and the use of reference management programmes, especially as our youth become more tech-savvy. As assignments become more complex, students increasingly use online resources for their projects. Such skills will guard against plagiarism and ingrain the right values. Can the Government share on efforts to build up this culture in our schools?",3,768,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00768
2021-09-13-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mr Speaker, Sir, while granting creatives the right to be identified is a positive step forward, my next point is that the Copyright Bill should grant creatives due recognition and protect their right to commercialise their work. With the challenging employment landscape, more young Singaporeans are turning to freelance content creation, with the hope of eventually turning it into a career. The proliferation of e-commerce has led to a surge in demand for digital marketing services and consequently, visual content. The gig economy has provided increased opportunities for graphic designers and content creators to work on projects and earn an income. This is not only within Singapore, but also from an international market.",4,769,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00769
2021-09-13-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"But to do so reliably, they must be able to defend the intellectual rights to their concepts and creations, as well as to guard against unscrupulous people who may plagiarise their contents. Otherwise, how can they expect to be fairly renumerated, if their creations and ideas can be copied and used by others without repercussions? Without such safeguards, such gig economy content creators may no longer find it worthwhile to create unique content. Consequently, we may lose such local talent.",5,770,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00770
2021-09-13-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"I know of a young designer who had once pitched a logo design to a company. Eventually, the company did not engage his services. But when the company revealed their logo design, he found that it bore great resemblance to the design that he had created. He was convinced they had misappropriated his design and merely altered it slightly. However, he thought it would be too troublesome and costly to take legal action. He also lacked confidence in achieving a successful outcome, as he did not copyright his design. His story is not unique. It is a perpetual challenge for young content creators, especially those who are just starting out, to protect their works from companies preying on their inexperience.",6,771,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00771
2021-09-13-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"As such, there must be effective and affordable means of enforcement for such matters. Granting and recognising rights is one thing. But it is meaningless if creatives are unable to effectively enforce their rights in an affordable manner and to seek recourse. Mediation is probably one cost-effective way to deal with such matters. Having volunteered as a mediator in MinLaw's Community Mediation Centre, I am an advocate for mediation before litigation. I have witnessed many disputes due to a misunderstanding or a lack of awareness.",7,772,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00772
2021-09-13-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Many people are intimidated by the idea of Court proceedings. Hence, mediation is always a more approachable and affordable means for problem-solving. I note that the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) offers mediation as a formal route to settle copyright disputes. Even so, the costs can be hefty for a freelancer just starting out. The cheapest option appears to be an administrative fee of $50 per party and a mediator fee of $500 per party for a four-hour session. That, alone, may exceed the cost of a brand logo design. The victim may feel that the cost, time and effort to go through mediation are not worthwhile in pursuing the matter.",8,773,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00773
2021-09-13-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"With the rise in independent content creation, it is timely to consider a separate mediation route that is more affordable and streamlined. The goal is to make mediation more accessible to independent gig economy workers. Furthermore, if any copyright infringement has been found, the guilty party should be made to bear the entire mediation costs.",9,774,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00774
2021-09-13-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Besides mediation, there should be other mechanisms, such as tribunals and so on, that could be set up to hear such disputes. My other concern is whether these laws would have any impact, if the copyright infringement is committed by individuals or organisations overseas. This is likely to be increasingly widespread due to the borderless nature of the Internet.",10,775,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00775
2021-09-13-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mr Speaker, Sir, my last point is on the permitted sharing and copying of materials provided by the Public Service. This is for the purpose of facilitating public interest. Fake news moves very quickly these days. It is reassuring to know that we can simply forward an infographic from the Government's social media accounts to debunk myths, without fear of legal repercussions.",11,776,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00776
2021-09-13-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Many of my Yio Chu Kang residents, especially seniors, do not enjoy reading walls of texts. As such, simple-to-understand infographics and digital pamphlets from the various Government websites, are very much appreciated. The agencies' logos on the materials save us the trouble from having to determine the legitimacy of the source.",12,777,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00777
2021-09-13-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"While the Bill states that the materials can be copied, I wish to clarify whether such materials can be incorporated into an existing publication, like a pamphlet that also contains other content. In essence, can contents from different sources be combined, without the need to seek permission? I recalled previously that a grassroots volunteer wanted to produce a community event flyer that would also contain information on social distancing and mask wearing. He was unsure whether it would be legal to copy the contents from the MOH website. In the end, he abandoned the idea. Can the Minister provide some clarification on this?",13,778,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00778
2021-09-13-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, protecting intellectual property is critical for innovation, which, in turn, is critical for Singapore to thrive as a knowledge-based economy. Job losses as a result of the pandemic saw many more Singaporeans setting up their home businesses or freelancing.",14,779,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00779
2021-09-13-T-015,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Many would promote their creations and portfolios on social media, from music to visual content, source codes and so on. It is timely that we update the copyright laws accordingly. As mentioned in my speech, our copyright laws should not merely protect the rights of creatives to commercialise and prevent exploitation of their work. It should also respect the work of creatives. This will encourage more Singaporeans to share their creative works and inspire others, knowing that it is respected and protected by law. I support the Bill.",15,780,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00780
2021-09-13-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Ms Yeo Wan Ling.,1,781,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00781
2021-09-13-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Mr Speaker, the landscape of innovation and creativity in any society has always been an intricate balancing act. On one hand, placing too many restrictions on the flow of ideas and creative work and society hinders the possibility of good ideas being built upon and turned into great ideas, disallowing society from standing to collectively gain from the brilliance of individuals. On the other hand, too few restrictions discourage these individuals' expressions of brilliance, believing they will not stand to gain from their creations, in turn, dealing a fatal blow to the generation of ideas from a society.",1,782,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00782
2021-09-13-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"This is why I and the Labour Movement welcome the troubleshooting of the Copyright Act, as the Government endeavours to adapt to changing concerns and the evolving landscape of innovation and creativity. This is especially pertinent to a league of freelancers in our society  the Creatives. Creatives come in all forms, from the visual, to the literary, to the musical, even the culinary and the floral arts!",2,783,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00783
2021-09-13-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Mr Speaker, many of us would be familiar with the trope of a starving artist  dedicating their lives to their passionate pursuit of their craft, sometimes forgoing material comforts as they realise their work does not meet its proper valuation in the economic realities of the market. Most of us would be quick to diagnose that the depressed wages of creative freelancers to the harsh mechanics of the free market. However, I would like very much to raise the visible and sometimes unethical hand involved in contracting practices with our Creatives.",3,784,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00784
2021-09-13-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"While we welcome efforts to give first ownership of copyrights to authors and makers in commissioned work, the reality of transactions between Creatives and their clients runs back much further. Even before contracting, Creatives often find themselves having to pitch their work to their clients, who will, in turn, choose who to commission for the job. Let us take designers, for example.",4,785,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00785
2021-09-13-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Many think that the process goes like this  the designer offers a great idea, the client likes it, they contract with the designer and the designer goes on to make their design a success for the client. However, how transactions often go is like this  the designer still offers great design ideas, the client still falls in love with that idea, but they contract with another designer who might be willing to take a smaller cut and this designer who is willing to do it for less is given the pitch from the other designer as a ""reference"", effectively clearing themselves of all hoops presented by our laws as they stand, as long as the ""reference"" is not plagiarised wholesale.",5,786,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00786
2021-09-13-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"In the long run, Creatives are subject to a race to the bottom in terms of their compensation because it is not great ideas that are rewarded but, instead, their willingness to forsake a fair wage. Mr Speaker, we must take a full view of transactions within Creatives and their clients if we want to build a regulatory ecosystem that truly promotes innovations and their innovators. Strong and sensible contracting terms are welcomed, but an inquiry into pre-contractual interactions, such as pitching, must be also considered in this debate.",6,787,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00787
2021-09-13-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Creatives often want their work to entertain, inspire, relate, tell a story and there is, indeed, power in their creations. Yet, the power of the creative work is never far detached from the person behind the creative work. As one freelancer expressed, ""art is a reproduction of myself"". Any inquiry into the great creative works of yore never find themselves detached from their creators. Listen to the familiar tune of ""Für Elise"" and we remark, ""ah, Beethoven"". Marvel at the great paintings and we quickly call to mind ""Monet"" and ""Rembrandt"". This very intimacy between the Creative and their creation is what our copyright laws serve to protect.",7,788,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00788
2021-09-13-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"While this sacred bond is well protected when it comes to most creative mediums, an often overlooked demographic of Creatives are those who happen to express their craft visually and through their likeness. Mr Speaker, Sir, I am referring to models in Singapore.",8,789,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00789
2021-09-13-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"At this juncture, I would like to share a story of my resident, Miss Duan, who has recounted her experience to me as a model. To perfect their craft, Miss Duan tells me how Creatives do not just ""sit and look pretty"". They actually chisel out a whole entire lifestyle around their craft. The preparation for a shot is often extensive, requiring collaboration across photographers, stylists, dieticians and producers, as well as comprehensive planning, including location, dressing, equipment, amongst others. Modelling is hard work and the often-elegant final product betrays the amount of hard work that has been poured into the process.",9,790,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00790
2021-09-13-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"You could imagine my resident's dismay, however, when it was revealed that an artist had illustrated her likeness from one of her test-shoot photos and went on to commercialise and profit off her piece of work. This, certainly, was not Miss Duan's first experience with her likeness being appropriated by others. But without the firm recognition of image or personality rights in Singapore, she was fully subject to the cooperation and compliance of the other party. Unfortunately, for my resident, on this occasion, the other party was unwilling to make recourse.",10,791,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00791
2021-09-13-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"It is necessary that we have the regulatory environment shaped in such a way that our Creatives' ""rice bowls"" do not rest shakily on the goodwill of strangers. Instead, our laws must create meaningful forms of transactional safety nets among Creatives who wish to use one another's work.",11,792,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00792
2021-09-13-T-015,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"To conclude, in order to safeguard the interests of Creatives in Singapore, we must make considerations that reflect the realities of transactions between freelancers and their clients, and amongst the Creatives themselves. Accommodations must also be considered for niche creative fields, such as modelling. These concerns notwithstanding, I support the Bill.",12,793,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00793

2021-09-13-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"This Bill will be important in encouraging creativity and protecting creators and their works, carving out crucial fair use exceptions and strengthening the copyright ecosystem. That said, I have three points of clarification.",2,796,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00796
2021-09-13-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My first clarification is on the safeguards on the permitted use of materials for text and data mining for analytic purposes. Section 244 permits the copying of the works for the purposes of computational data analysis. Under section 187, creators are not allowed to restrict this by contract.",3,797,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00797
2021-09-13-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),It is not clear why we have designed such a specific carve-out. Why should creators not have the power to protect their works specifically from being the input data for some machine-learning model? What is the principle behind this special condition?,4,798,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00798
2021-09-13-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),We should note that the results of computational data analysis may be extremely profitable and it is not necessarily the case that the original creators may know or be comfortable about their work being used in this way.,5,799,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00799
2021-09-13-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Can the Ministry share how it intends to ensure a balance between allowing the use of works for computational data analysis and the interests of copyright holders?,6,800,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00800
2021-09-13-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My second point relates to enforcing the new right of attribution. Part 7 of the Bill provides a moral right for the author of a work to be identified if another person causes that work to be published.,7,801,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00801
2021-09-13-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I welcome this development as it gives creators recognition for their efforts and respects their work. However, in practice, independent or smaller creators with limited resources may not easily be able to monitor publications of their works and enforce their rights. Even if creators discover a breach of their rights, they have to bring an action in Court under section 383. In that scenario, the legal costs might be too high to make enforcement worth it. Further, the available remedies under section 385 include injunctions and damages. It may not be cost-effective for creators to seek injunctions and damages may be difficult to prove and quantify.",8,802,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00802
2021-09-13-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Can Minister share if additional measures will be taken to help these creators enforce their rights? For example, will the Ministry consider creating a special Court process or use the Copyright Tribunal for a cost-effective means of enforcement.",9,803,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00803
2021-09-13-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My third point of clarification relates to the expanded rights of creators. I support this new default position in the legislation.,10,804,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00804
2021-09-13-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Under the new Copyright Act, creators and performers have the right to be attributed when their work or performance is used. Also, creators of certain works including commissioned photographs, portraits and engravings will be granted default copyright ownership.",11,805,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00805
2021-09-13-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),These new rights are supposed to give individual freelancers and creators from small- and medium-sized enterprises greater bargaining power to negotiate better terms with commissioning parties.,12,806,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00806
2021-09-13-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"However, the contrary may also be true. These default positions can be restricted and excluded by contract. The safeguards are that the contract must be individually negotiated and the contract term purporting to restrict the exception must be deemed to be “fair and reasonable”.",13,807,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00807
2021-09-13-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"There is often a power imbalance with creators on one end and publishers and producers on the other.

Publishers and producers are likely to favour contracting with creators willing to cede copyright ownership rights to them, rather than one who wishes to retain it or negotiate better terms.",14,808,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00808
2021-09-13-T-015,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I understand that the Ministry views legislative intervention a blunt tool in addressing these issues.

2021-09-13-T-015,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong (Jurong),"On the amendments for computational data analysis, I welcome the change as we step into the world of data analytics and AI. It is relevant in the information age to enable greater freedoms on the use of information for data analysis to spur a deeper understanding of our world and the domain, which would in turn build a more vibrant and responsible data-driven ecosystem. There is a more critical need for Singapore as we need to continue to be relevant as a global business hub and evolve together with emerging trends and challenges.",4,815,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00815
2021-09-13-T-015,Shawn Huang Wei Zhong,Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong (Jurong),"However, there are scenarios where the work of a creator or collective is pivotal to the outcome of the computational data analysis, for example, if 90% of the data was from an individual or a collective, without their significant contribution, this study would not have been possible. Does the Ministry have measures to protect the rights of these individuals, given their significant contribution, to ensure that there is proper attribution and protection of their reputation and commercial interest?",5,816,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00816

2021-09-13-T-015,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"Besides pursuing artistic excellence, financial benefit is another factor that will motivate the copyright holder to produce more good work.

2021-09-13-T-015,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),The Copyright Bill provides that acts outside Singapore do not infringe the moral rights of creators or performers. Are there any other avenue which can allow a Singaporean copyright holder to sue a foreign infringer?,4,822,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00822
2021-09-13-T-015,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),The Copyright Bill appears to support a measured balance between the public interest in permitting the use of computational data analysis and the legitimate interests of copyright owners. It remains uncertain how the safeguards for copyright owners will be interpreted in light of the growing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning platforms to perform autonomous data mining.,5,823,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00823

2021-09-13-T-015,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"If my interpretation is correct, commissioners of works are to ensure appropriate assignments are entered into with the creators.

2021-09-13-T-015,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"Copyright holder needs to know that reworking of fair use into an open-ended exception is not a straightforward process as it will require determination by the Courts as to whether the potential infringer can avail itself of the new exception in any given situation on a case-by-case basis. Until the Courts have decided, infringers are likely to cite new open-ended fair use exception to defend against allegation. Do we have any mitigant here?",8,826,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00826
2021-09-13-T-015,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"Paraphrasing commonly known legal concepts into layman's language can lead to misunderstanding on the part of the public as well. For example, the introduction of the term ""permitted use"" to describe not only legal exceptions to copyright but other ""permitted uses"". It may cause confusion for a common man. It is important for the public to understand that the copyright owner is not permitting the use; in fact, in the case of a legal exception or fair use, no concurrence is required. It may be better to be precise, emphasising that a fair use is a legal exception to a copyright holder’s monopoly right, not one that has been ""permitted"" as in the case of a licensed use.",9,827,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00827
2021-09-13-T-015,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"The fifth factor to determine ""fair use"" has now been omitted from the Bill.

2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Speaker, I thank the various Members who have spoken for their support of the Bill. Their speeches illustrate some of the competing issues that we face when designing this Bill. Having more exceptions and making inroads to free use or widening fair use all mean less recognition for creators, less remuneration that they receive for their works. Conversely, too tight a framework on copyright with less exceptions, tighter fair use, might mean that public interests and access might then not be fulfilled.",1,832,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00832
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, in designing this Bill, we have had to tread a balanced path, look at all the competing interests and balance it one against the other and find a path that at once, allows public interests in content but at the same time, creates an environment where creators can be recognised and attributed for their works.",2,833,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00833

2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"For example, if we legislate that creators will always have ownership, regardless and do not allow contracts to change this position, this might not cater for situations where the creator wants to assign or sell his or her own copyright for good commercial reasons.",7,838,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00838

2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"A fundamental point is that copyright laws are territorial. They protect copyright within the territory, that is, Singapore.

2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, oral agreements can and oftentimes will present evidential difficulties when there is a dispute. The intention here is not to add on a further overlay of disputes. Consumers typically are even more vulnerable between the two parties if oral agreements are allowed.

Again, the point I made at the outset is, we strike a balance. The more inroads you create in terms of exceptions or fair use, the less likely it is that creators and content owners will be appropriately remunerated for their content.",40,871,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00871
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, here is a balance and we believe that clause 83, which defines educational institutions that can benefit from this permitted use, strikes the right balance, requiring them to be non-profit, generally covering full-time education and also includes training for adults for their profession.",41,872,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00872
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked about charitable organisations and IPCs. They can avail themselves of this permitted use if they fall within the criteria of clause 83.,42,873,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00873
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As I mentioned, this is a balanced position. Copyright owners' interests also need to be considered when we legislate. Around the world, copyright permitted uses for educational purposes only cover non-profit schools in general.",43,874,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00874
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Even if for-profit schools, charitable organisations or IPCs cannot avail themselves of this permitted use, there could be other permitted uses or exceptions which might apply, like fair use.",44,875,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00875
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I believe Assoc Prof Jamus Lim mentioned what happens in a situation where you want to use the material for non-educational but knowledge-based think tanks, if I heard him correctly. In this situation, the fair use does not prescribe restrictions to the type of organisations which might avail themselves of the fair use.",45,876,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00876
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On computational data analysis, several Members asked some questions.",46,877,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00877
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Don Wee asked about the safeguards for rights owners, particularly in light of the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Mr Shawn Huang asked whether the permitted use would treat rights owners whose work is instrumental to the outcome of the computational data analysis differently, such as requiring attribution or protecting their commercial interests. And Mr Louis Ng asked why it cannot be restricted by contract.",47,878,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00878
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Let me first highlight to Mr Don Wee that the definition of computational data analysis is broad enough to include AI and machine learning. I think I mentioned that in my initial speech. The conditions of permitted uses were developed with that in mind.,48,879,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00879
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"To answer Mr Shawn Huang, let me explain the principle behind permitted use. Computational data analysis treats the works as data points and does not make use of the expressive nature of the works, which is what copyright fundamentally seeks to protect. In short, because computational data analysis does not itself make use of the expressive nature of the works, the rights owners' reputational and commercial interests are not adversely affected.",49,880,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00880
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"To Mr Louis Ng's question, many permitted uses can be modified or excluded via reasonable contract terms. However, some permitted uses are mandatory for public policy reasons because the benefit of that particular permitted use could be drastically reduced or even non-existent if we allow contracts to modify its application. So, we protect certain categories which are necessary for public policy reasons, and computational data analysis is one such category.",50,881,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00881
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The benefit of data analysis improves as the set of underlying data used is as complete as possible. Having specific databases locked out of the analysis because of contractual restrictions would make the results less useful, or worse, create bias or inaccuracies.",51,882,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00882
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Therefore, it is important not to allow private contractual provisions to override this permitted use. It supports the development of useful applications of data analysis, which is indispensable to the current digital economy.",52,883,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00883
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In addition, this permitted use only covers materials to which a user must have had lawful access, such as by paying the subscription fee for the database. So, where the creators or publishers of the materials charge fees in order for users to access such works, that revenue would not be affected.",53,884,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00884
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Yip Hon Weng asked whether the new permitted use that allows for dissemination of materials by the Government would also allow such content to be incorporated or compiled into an existing publication.,54,885,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00885
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The short answer is yes. Copying it, whether a part of it or the entirety of the materials is allowed if done for the permitted purposes and the permitted use does not prevent any parts that are copied from being combined along with other materials.",55,886,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00886
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On fair use, Mr Don Wee, Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Ms He Ting Ru had some questions on the changes that we have made to fair use. Let me just explain the changes and then, take the Members of the House through how this is contemplated to work with the Courts.",56,887,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00887
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The question that has been asked is whether fair use has been reworked into an open-ended exception that requires the Courts to make a determination on a case-by-case basis and whether, with the fifth factor removed, the point that Mr Wee specifically bought up, we are now providing less guidance to the Courts.",57,888,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00888
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Let me assure both Mr Wee and Ms He that this provision has always been an open-ended one, requiring a case-by-case determination by the Courts, even on the existing regime in the present Copyright Act.",58,889,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00889
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I would also add that despite dropping the fifth factor, the Courts can still consider that factor when relevant. We dropped the fifth factor because there was market feedback by stakeholders that it lent itself into confusion. Because of the language and because of the way in which it was framed, users had assumed, in many cases, wrongly, that they first had to procure a licence before they could get within the rubric of the fifth factor.",59,890,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00890
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Members would also know that clause 191 requires the Court to consider ""all relevant matters"" in deciding whether a work or a performance is fairly used.",60,891,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00891
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, the removal of the fifth factor simply means that the Court only needs to consider that factor when it is of the view that that factor is relevant. So, it does not make it irrelevant. What the current Bill does is it provides for the four factors, the Court considers all four factors. But in the appropriate case or in such cases which are particularly fact-sensitive, the Courts can still consider this.",61,892,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00892
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"And in fact, this is what the Chief Justice said in a leading Court of Appeal decision in Global Yellow Pages. The Court of Appeal, without taking Members through the decision in detail, opined that looking at fair dealing as it currently is called, is overall highly fact-sensitive inquiry that has to have regard to all the circumstances. All the factors must be considered but the Court, of course, understands the facts, ascertains the context, looks at the parties' relative position and then, assigns the appropriate weight to each factor and makes an overall determination whether a dealing is fair or otherwise.",62,893,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00893
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, this approach will continue and the Court will have regard to each case, looking at the facts. And I think if you look at the construct of the fair use exceptions, this is precisely what it is intended to do – to allow the Courts, the adjudicators to look at the specific factual matrix behind each contention for exception or for use.",63,894,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00894
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Next, let me touch on the CMOs which several Members spoke about.",64,895,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00895
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked whether the Government would be regulating the amount of royalties to be paid to CMOs and what recourse users have if the amount is unreasonable. Mr Shawn Huang asked how the regulations could affect foreign CMOs. Mr Raj Joshua Thomas suggested that CMOs may need more time to adapt to the regulations and it should not be too onerous as to be prohibitive to new entrants.,65,896,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00896
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As I mentioned briefly earlier, our regulations proposed in this Bill do not control the prices which CMOs charge. The Copyright Tribunal will continue to hear disputes over reasonableness of licence fees. That was the case and will still be the case.",66,897,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00897
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Clause 459 of the Bill clarifies that the new regulations will apply to any CMO who offers licences to users in Singapore. However, foreign CMOs who represent local rights owners, but offer licences to users overseas, will not be subject to the new regulations.",67,898,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00898
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,I also mentioned the timeline for these regulations. The provisions for regulating the CMOs will only be implemented later after a further public consultation on licence conditions next year. This will give CMOs more time to make the necessary adjustments to regulation.,68,899,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00899
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We are mindful that the CMOs might need the extra time and we are continuously engaging with them and have done so since our CMO public consultations started a few years ago. So, I can assure Mr Thomas that the scheme will be a light-touch class licensing regulatory framework. And we similarly want to encourage new entrants in this area with innovative solutions.",69,900,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00900
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Regulations, as some Members have pointed out, will provide clarity to all, but at the same time, we do not intend to make it burdensome to CMOs who operate in a responsible and accountable manner.",70,901,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00901
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"To achieve the right balance in our regulations, we have considered the experience of other countries and international precedents in WIPO's Good Practice Toolkit for CMOs.",71,902,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00902
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Finally, Mr Wee had some concerns that the use of the term ""permitted uses"" to describe exceptions may lead to confusion.",72,903,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00903
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The term simply means that the user is permitted to do an act under the law. Clause 183 explains that an act that is a permitted use is not a rights infringement. This will help to prevent misunderstandings about the use of that term.,73,904,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00904
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Let me now touch on some of the suggestions raised by Members.,74,905,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00905
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Ms Ng Ling Ling suggested that persons with intellectual disabilities and audio disabilities could have similar levels of permitted uses as persons with print disabilities and also that permitted uses should all be made mandatory. Mr Patrick Tay asked whether there could be a one-stop publishing house dealing with all the IP rights. Ms Yeo Wan Ling spoke about models that need to have some form of protection as well. Assoc Prof Jamus Lim spoke about permitted use for publicly-funded research, which I believe I responded to earlier in the context of fair use. Mr Raj Joshua Thomas suggested that we consider legislation that can determine the ownership of AI-generated works. And Ms He Ting Ru had a suggestion on mandating royalties.",75,906,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00906
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,We will study these suggestions. These are all suggestions that are not covered in this Bill but we will study them and decide at the appropriate stage whether they can be implemented or they can be implemented with modifications.,76,907,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00907
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I want to tell Members of this House that our review of the copyright regime does not stop with the passing of this Bill.

2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Wee had a suggestion that went beyond this framework, on whether there could be a valuation and financing framework for collateralising copyright. I will just touch on this briefly.",78,909,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00909
2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I recently spoke at the launch of the Singapore IP Strategy 2030 during this year's IP Week @ SG event, outlining the efforts on valuation of IP. I believe this is an opportune suggestion. Singapore will be involved with an international valuation panel to develop valuation guidelines for intangible assets and IP. The guidelines will be based on internationally accepted standards that can be then widely adopted internationally and they will help rights owners commercialise and maximise the value of their IP, including through collateralisation.",79,910,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00910

2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Patrick Tay had various suggestions for freelancers and the general public. Mr Raj Joshua Thomas and Mr Lim Biow Chuan urged that there must be public education on the change in the default ownership rules for certain commissioned works.

2021-09-13-T-015,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As I mentioned earlier, we will be reaching out to the various stakeholders to help them understand their new rights and will also be working with them to make sure that the broader public is kept informed. For example, we will work with the National Arts Council and NTUC to educate creators and performers. We will work closely with MOE to ensure that teachers and students are aware of the details of the new permitted use. For changes which affect a broad spectrum of stakeholders, like the changes in default ownership of commissioned works or the new right to be identified, we will reach out through various channels, infographics, social media and public talks, to make sure that information is disseminated.",83,914,2021-09-13-T-015-S-00914

This Bill represents our commitment to ensure that balance between rights owners and the users. We continue to chart a path that is both fair and reasonable to both sides of the equation.

2021-09-13-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My first point relates to our efforts to reduce HFCs. Reducing HFC emissions, which make up about 7% of Singapore’s emissions, will contribute to our climate mitigation efforts and I wholeheartedly support this move. HFCs have nearly 12,000 times the warming potential of carbon dioxide. And Singapore is emitting such gases more than ever before, a 30% increase from 2014 to 2016, based on the latest available data. Things might be getting worse, not better.",3,988,2021-09-13-T-016-S-00988

2021-09-13-T-016,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My second clarification is about the requirements for becoming a competent person for carrying out greenhouse gas work. Training and certification are important to upskill our workforce, improve quality of services and reduce emissions by preventing leakage of greenhouse gases. However, training and tests are often conducted in English, which not all of our existing technicians may be fluent in, causing them to be disadvantaged. It is important that certification is accessible and fair so that we improve our workforce rather than cause some to be excluded. Can the Minister share the intended format of training and tests, whether they will be multilingual and what other measures will be implemented to support our existing technicians in getting certified?",6,991,2021-09-13-T-016-S-00991

In the post-COVID-19 world, more activities are taking place from the home, such as remote learning and working. Can the Minister provide an update on its review of construction noise limits and also consider whether we can have even stricter construction noise limits on Saturdays? This will give families more quiet time to rest and recover over the weekend.

In fact, we are now expected to reach this 1.5 degree celsius tipping point earlier than expected. To limit warming to 1.5 degree celsius with no or limited overshoot, net global CO2 emissions need to fall by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach ""net zero"" by 2050. Unless immediate, rapid and large-scale action is taken to reduce emissions, the average global temperature is likely to reach or cross the 1.5 degree celsius warming threshold within 20 years.",6,998,2021-09-13-T-016-S-00998
2021-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Unfortunately, however, some climate changes are already locked in. Hot extremes have become more frequent and more intense across most land regions since the 1950s, while cold extremes have become less frequent and less severe. Over the next 2,000 years, the global mean sea level will rise by about two to three metres, even if warming is limited to 1.5 degree celsius, with the effect irreversible for millennia.",7,999,2021-09-13-T-016-S-00999
2021-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"At this point in time, remaining carbon budgets for a 50% chance of limiting warming to 1.5 degree celsius and two degree celcius are estimated at 500 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (GtCO2) and 1,350 GtCO2 respectively. With global emissions currently at a little more than 40 GtCO2 a year and if continued, the budget would be exhausted in a mere 12 years.",8,1000,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01000
2021-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Singapore is certainly not spared from the effects of a higher global temperature. Even in a 1.5 degree celsius warmer world, there will an increase in the number of unprecedented weather events with disasters to become more frequent and intense. Should emissions not come down to net zero by around 2050, there will be even more punishing heatwaves, severe coastal flooding events and bouts of heavier rain. As it is, Singapore has already seen record rainfalls in January, April and August. The recent memory of flash floods in August this year is a very sombre reminder of how things are no longer the way it used to be. What does this mean for daily life in Singapore?",9,1001,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01001
2021-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Firstly, in terms of temperature, Singapore has already experienced warming higher than the global average because of the urban heat island effect. Local temperatures are 1.8 degree celsius higher than they were in 1948, as indicated in the MET Service database. In contrast, global temperatures have warmed by about 1.1 degree celsius from pre-industrial times, which ended around 1850.",10,1002,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01002
2021-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"The IPCC has identified Southeast Asia as a region experiencing severe heat waves, which used to occur once every 50 years but have become five times more frequent. Tropical cyclones are also getting stronger, severe droughts are happening 1.7 times as often and fire seasons are increasing in duration and intensity.",11,1003,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01003
2021-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Secondly, bouts of rain could become more intense and frequent with each additional degree of warming. Southeast Asia would likely experience this, resulting in flash floods if the ground is covered with concrete and if drainage systems are overwhelmed, as in Singapore’s case recently.",12,1004,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01004
2021-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Thirdly, sea level rises in Asia, especially critical to low-lying coastal regions like Singapore, are projected to increase faster than global average, alongside coastal area loss and shoreline retreat.",13,1005,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01005
2021-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"While there has been much focus on CO2, the IPCC also assessed the possibility of actively targeting and removing methane as part of the pathway to limiting warming. While methane is less prevalent than CO2, it is more than 80 times more powerful at trapping heat over the first 10 to 20 years in the atmosphere.",14,1006,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01006
2021-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I had earlier filed a Parliamentary Question on whether the Government has conducted a study to assess the amount of external methane emissions associated with natural gas imported into and consumed in Singapore, across both piped natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG). This is critical because even though methane emitted directly from Singapore is low, the use of natural gas as a source of energy could indirectly contribute significantly to methane emissions through upstream fugitive emission leakages, if these are not properly controlled. As a responsible consumer of natural gas, be it piped or LNG, it is important that we uphold strict monitoring and verification standards and promote the adoption of emission reduction technologies.",15,1007,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01007

2021-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"To begin with, I note that the Bill under section 40A provides certain definitions on GHG goods, GHG works and other interpretations of the new Part 10A. The first clarification is about sections 40A and 40B which deal with the power of the Minister, after consultation with NEA, to prescribe any class, description or type of GHG goods to be regulated.",17,1009,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01009
2021-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"To provide greater visibility to businesses and consumers, I would like to ask the Minister if there is currently a set of goods by which the Ministry and NEA plans to prescribe and regulate as GHG goods once the Bill is passed. If there is not such a list yet, would the Minister and agency consider putting a plan for such a list such that, by the time the Act comes into force, the Government may facilitate a swift recognition of such goods? How much of such goods and works that are available in our market today will now be subject to these amendments? In addition, could the Minister provide clarity on whether these GHG goods or works were originally excluded from the Carbon Pricing Act and if so, what is the assessment of the cost to measure and report these GHG goods compared to the amount of carbon tax that potentially could be collected?",18,1010,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01010
2021-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Furthermore, I would like to ask the Minister what is the Ministry’s assessment of any possible impacts this amendment and the classification of the new GHG goods or works will have on our companies, such as the air-condition, chiller and equipment manufacturers as well as industries, such as the semiconductor manufacturing industry, which uses fluorinated gases?",19,1011,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01011
2021-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Secondly, under section 40C, an importer or manufacturer has to be a registered supplier for these regulated goods. I would like to ask the Minister when will the regulation of such businesses commence; and in the future, should a new GHG good be added to the list of regulated GHG goods, what is the lead time for businesses to respond accordingly?",20,1012,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01012
2021-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Thirdly, under section 40D, there are proposed restrictions on supplies and imports of regulated goods. I would like to ask the Minister how the thresholds of global warming potential are being determined for the regulated goods, and how often would NEA or the Director-General of Environmental Protection plan to review the GWP threshold and its basis for restriction of supply? For example, according to the NEA website, the typical refrigerant used in chillers is R134a, which has a GWP of 1,300. The climate-friendly alternative is R1233zd, which has a GWP of just one. Based on what is disclosed, the NEA will, from the fourth quarter of 2022, restrict the supply of certain air-conditioning equipment with a GWP of more than 750 and certain refrigerators and chillers with GWP of more than 15. How much of a decline in the percentage or volume of GHG emissions is this restriction expected to lead to?",21,1013,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01013
2021-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Finally, my fellow Sengkang Member of Parliament He Ting Ru asked a Parliamentary Question about whether MSE has initiated a review of Singapore's ratification of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol and if so, what is the outcome of this review. To which, Minister Grace Fu shared that a review is ongoing and the decision for Singapore to ratify the Kigali Amendment will be finalised after consultation with key stakeholders.",22,1014,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01014
2021-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),I would like to ask if the current Bill amendment is a part of the process towards ratifying the Kigali Amendment and if the Minister can provide a timeline for the review as to whether Singapore will decide to join the 124 countries that have thus far already ratified the agreement.,23,1015,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01015
2021-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, I support this Bill and its introduction of legislative safeguards and controls over greenhouse gases in Singapore. Yet, this Bill is but one of the many steps that Singapore will have to take in order for us to advance our efforts in addressing climate change.",24,1016,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01016
2021-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"As I shared in my speech on the Climate Motion earlier this year, even as a small island-state, Singapore has always been daring in our vision for the future. Climate change should be no different. The science has spoken and there is no alternative except to urgently commit to reversing the trend of rising emissions. We can, should and must do more.",25,1017,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01017
2021-09-13-T-016,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"My fellow Sengkang colleague, Ms He Ting Ru, again had asked in a Parliamentary Question whether the Government plans to review Singapore's net zero emissions target and set a definitive timeline to achieve net zero emissions. Member Louis Ng too had asked in a Parliamentary Question whether the Government would review and bring forward the plans to reach net zero emissions.",26,1018,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01018

The IPCC report published last month is a sobering reminder of the disastrous outcomes we can expect in 2050 if planet-warming emissions, also known as Greenhouse Gases (GHGs), do not come down to net zero.",1,1021,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01021
2021-09-13-T-016,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"I believe that the proposed amendments have balanced both the interests of businesses and protecting the environment. For example, the methods to appeal against a Director-General's (DG) decision are not onerous, whereby aggrieved persons may simply apply to the DG by way of a written notice for reconsideration of the decision.",2,1022,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01022

2021-09-13-T-016,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),I would like to highlight three areas of the amendments and related suggestions for the Ministry's consideration. I believe that these suggestions will allow for a more calibrated approach in ensuring that businesses comply with the amendments.,4,1024,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01024
2021-09-13-T-016,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"First, on the implementation of a register of suppliers, regulated goods and registered GHG entities.",5,1025,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01025
2021-09-13-T-016,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),These provisions ensure that the Ministry retains oversight of all GHG goods and GHG-related stakeholders. This is particularly valuable where GHG goods are subsequently found to have been falsely reported as conforming to prescribed standards. The register will benefit suppliers of GHG goods in allowing them to recalibrate their business models where appropriate.,6,1026,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01026
2021-09-13-T-016,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Can we presume that similar to the prescribed regulated goods and suppliers under the Energy Conservation Act, that the register under the amendments will also be made available online?",7,1027,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01027
2021-09-13-T-016,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Second, on the offences relating to the falsification of data in the proposed section 40X. The falsification of data to the DG would render the objective of the Act nullified. For example, suppliers would be able to supply GHG goods that blatantly fall afoul of the prescribed limits of emissions. Furthermore, to ascertain the accuracy of every piece of information or data received would be operationally burdensome on the Ministry.",8,1028,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01028
2021-09-13-T-016,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"At present, a conviction for this offence attracts a fine of $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or both.",9,1029,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01029
2021-09-13-T-016,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),I have two suggestions for the Ministry's consideration. Could the Ministry impose a minimum fine for an offence under section 40X? This will encourage businesses to take extra effort to ensure the accuracy of information to be submitted to the Ministry.,10,1030,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01030
2021-09-13-T-016,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Additionally, could the Ministry adjust the maximum term of imprisonment under section 40X from three to six months? This harmonises the maximum term of imprisonment to that of section 177(1) of the Penal Code. The said section prescribes that it is an offence to give false information to a public servant if one is legally bound to do so.",11,1031,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01031
2021-09-13-T-016,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Lastly, I am concerned about the hardships SMEs and smaller businesses may face in complying with the amendments. Doing our part for climate change has a cost and the cost could be placed upon these SMEs unduly, especially in the short term. While the obligations under the proposed amendments will help to combat climate change, they will be especially onerous to smaller businesses. For example, section 40D(4)(d) obligates suppliers of GHG goods to ensure that the goods are accompanied by information relating to their environmental impact.",12,1032,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01032
2021-09-13-T-016,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"To this end, I have two suggestions to make.",13,1033,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01033
2021-09-13-T-016,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Firstly, I hope the Ministry will consider a transitionary period in relation to the new obligations under the amendments. While the impact of these obligations may not be large for individuals or larger businesses, I fear that SMEs may be adversely impacted in the short run. This is worsened by the fact that some businesses may still be suffering from the effects of the pandemic.",14,1034,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01034
2021-09-13-T-016,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),The new obligations imposed on related businesses are akin to new skillsets for their workers. An appropriately timed transitionary period will allow businesses the required time to adequately comply with the new obligations and retrain their workers.,15,1035,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01035
2021-09-13-T-016,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Secondly, I propose for the Ministry to assist SMEs in complying with the new obligations. The Ministry can explore working with the unions and trade associations in providing practical information to affected SMEs. Furthermore, while the definition of who qualifies as a competent person has yet to be published, the union stands ready to conduct training programmes to ensure affected SMEs can comply with this new obligation with ease.",16,1036,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01036
2021-09-13-T-016,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),Perhaps the Ministry can also consider making such training courses approved courses under the SkillsFuture scheme for jobseekers who wish to update their skillsets.,17,1037,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01037
2021-09-13-T-016,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Deputy Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding the above, I support the Bill.

2021-09-13-T-016,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"As policy tools to fight climate change, the setting of regulatory standards, which is a command-and-control measure, works to complement the introduction of carbon taxes, which is a price mechanism measure. When is it optimal to use the setting of regulatory standards, which target quantities directly and when is it optimal to use prices to achieve the aim of limiting greenhouse gas emissions?",5,1043,2021-09-13-T-016-S-01043

2021-09-13-T-016,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"In practice, however, compliance costs might differ across industries and even across firms in the same industry.

The waves were crashing onto the sides of the rocks near the jetty. It would probably take less than another metre of sea level rise before the seawater would flood the coastal roads. With current estimates, the sea level will rise by two to three metres if the temperature rise is limited to 1.5 degrees celsius and two to six metres if limited to two degrees celsius. At two degrees celsius and a six-metre corresponding rise in sea level, not much of Pulau Ubin would be left above water.",4,1063,2021-09-13-T-018-S-01063

2021-09-13-T-018,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Over the years, authorities have increasingly leveraged on technology to monitor noise levels at construction sites. However, feedback from residents in the vicinity remains important, as they are personally impacted and may have practical concerns. As such, there should be dedicated feedback channels for residents to relay their concerns to the contractor. There should also be clear escalation protocols to NEA as the regulator, should problems remain unresolved, despite the initial feedback to the contractor. The relevant authorities should ensure that clear service standards are in place as to when replies must be provided.",5,1084,2021-09-13-T-018-S-01084
2021-09-13-T-018,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"It should also be mandatory to provide advance notice to residents living within a 150-metre radius from the construction site. This could be in the form of information on display boards, as well as flyers distributed to nearby blocks. NEA should also consider using Municipal Services Office (MSO)'s OneService app to push out notifications to residents living near construction sites. This will give ample time to residents, whether it is to facilitate alternative arrangements, or to find ways to mitigate the noise.",6,1085,2021-09-13-T-018-S-01085
2021-09-13-T-018,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Contact details for the contractor and the relevant NEA feedback channels must also be clear and visible to residents. On my rounds, I noticed that the display of contact details was not uniform for all sites. Some constructions sites display their contact details and project information on a large board. However, for certain works, especially smaller-scale ones, the information is not always immediately visible. Some residents can therefore be surprised to see a barricaded project site appear, out of the blue. They do not know what it was for and do not know who to ask. I hope the Ministry can standardise the format and requirements for displaying relevant information and communication channels.",7,1086,2021-09-13-T-018-S-01086
2021-09-13-T-018,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Second, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there needs to be more public education with regards to no-work days. Work is allowed on weekends for projects that meet certain criteria. Nevertheless, the ground reality is that this is not publicly known. As such, members of public would lodge a complaint when they see construction works during the weekends, despite the works being permitted by NEA. With the COVID-19-related delays, I expect that more projects would seek permission to work on weekends. Therefore, there needs to be more awareness and better understanding of the regulations. This is to avoid wasting residents' time and Government's resources to manage redundant feedback.",8,1087,2021-09-13-T-018-S-01087

Can NEA provide a rough estimate on the cost of installation and maintenance of video surveillance equipment? One of the common reasons worksites contravene no-work days is because they are racing against a deadline and budget. So, my concern is if quality video surveillance equipment is costly to install and maintain, they may have some challenges setting it up within the stipulated timeline. Some errant contractors may even try to cut corners.",9,1088,2021-09-13-T-018-S-01088

2021-09-13-T-018,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Fourth, Mr Deputy Speaker, we need greater clarity on the type of construction projects covered under the new amendments. Besides construction sites, I would like to seek clarification as to whether it also covers other projects that generate noise and other possible disruptions. Are small scale infrastructure developments in the housing estates like the building of covered linkways by the Town Council, piping works by PUB, or road works by LTA covered as well? What about home renovations for HDB and condominium apartments, as well as additions and alterations for houses in landed estates?",11,1090,2021-09-13-T-018-S-01090
2021-09-13-T-018,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"The legislation ought to have a clearer definition on the projects it applies to. This could be determined by the project scale or some other measurable criteria, such as the amount of noise pollution emitted or the number of residents that would be impacted. Once the types of project sites are identified, we should also incrementally move towards having mandatory sound and dust-proof barriers for all these work sites.",12,1091,2021-09-13-T-018-S-01091
2021-09-13-T-018,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my last point is on imposing heavier penalties on construction companies that breach the no-work rule. For many Singaporeans, Sundays and public holidays are the only days in a week when they can take a break and recharge. Loud noise over prolonged periods triggers anxiety and stress. This is exacerbated by work-from-home arrangements during this pandemic period. Also, noise monitoring should not be limited to volume alone, but also frequency. Having mediated for community disputes among neighbours previously, some arising from construction noise, I can attest first-hand to the impact of unwanted noise on one’s mental well-being.",13,1092,2021-09-13-T-018-S-01092
2021-09-13-T-018,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Currently, there is a proposed penalty of a composition sum of $5,000 for construction sites that break the no-work rule for the first time. Subsequent offences lead to a Court summons with a maximum fine of $40,000. If we are to meaningfully address noise pollution as a threat to public health and not just as a mere annoyance, would these penalties be too light? As a more effective deterrent, violation of the no-work regulation ought to bear heavier consequences on the contractor’s ability to succeed at the next tender bid. We should also require such offences to be highlighted, when they next bid for projects.",14,1093,2021-09-13-T-018-S-01093
2021-09-13-T-018,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, noise pollution is a real issue on the ground. I did a check in the Hansard. Issues relating to construction noise have been consistently brought up in Parliament on several occasions over the past 10 years, despite ongoing reviews to manage disamenities. Instead of having discrete and piecemeal recommendations, we need a multifaceted and holistic approach to tackle noise pollution. As mentioned in my speech, these include better feedback management, promoting greater public awareness of no-work days and having stronger guidelines on surveillance systems. We should also have greater clarity on the type of construction projects covered under the new amendments and have more enforcement bite.",15,1094,2021-09-13-T-018-S-01094

The measures introduced today will deliver deep cuts in HFC emissions and bring us closer to our climate goals.",3,1099,2021-09-13-T-018-S-01099
2021-09-13-T-018,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,Mr Don Wee suggested delaying the measures in view of the current economic conditions caused by the pandemic.

The course is designed to meet the needs of the technicians. It will be conducted in simple spoken English. Temasek Polytechnic has ample experience in conducting other similar technical courses and trainers will tailor their delivery to suit the language competency of the technicians. Trainers will also give practical demonstrations and conduct hands-on practice to enhance understanding. To be certified, technicians have to pass an open-book test comprising multiple choice questions and a simple practical assessment. In fact, during my visit to Temasek Polytechnic, I noticed that the course will be conducted, hands-on, by technicians for the technicians themselves.

2021-09-13-T-018,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Prof Hoon Hian Teck asked whether it would be better to price HFC emissions rather than regulate these. While pricing remains an option, there are merits in adopting regulations to reduce HFC emissions. Most jurisdictions also take this approach. HFC emissions arise mainly from ownership rather than the intensity of use of RAC equipment and are locked in by technology choices. Given technical complexity and the need to balance multiple considerations in the choice of refrigerants as highlighted earlier, it is difficult for end-users to make informed choices or to influence upstream supplier decisions. Regulation offers much greater outcome certainty in abating HFC emissions. In commercial chillers, for example, regulation will effect a switch to a new generation of refrigerants with GWP close to zero, bringing HFC emissions to negligible levels when the entire stock of chillers turns over.",18,1114,2021-09-13-T-018-S-01114
2021-09-13-T-018,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Even if taxation were to be introduced, these considerations mean that regulations may still be needed. We would have to consider the cost effectiveness of the taxation regime, given the highly distributed sources of emissions. While the tax can be levied upstream on importers, this has to be coupled with the system of downstream rebates for spent refrigerants that are recovered.

2021-09-13-T-018,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Mr Yip Hon Weng asked about the types of construction projects that are covered. The current regulations state that all construction sites located less than 150 metres from any hospital, home for the aged sick or residential building must comply with the no-work rule on Sundays and public holidays. The Bill does not change the no-work rule regulation or requirement. Under this Bill, the Director-General may now impose the requirement for video surveillance on any construction site that contravenes the no-work rule. So, the site has to contravene the rule first. The requirement applies to all public and private sector construction projects, regardless of the size, if they violate the no-work rule.",23,1119,2021-09-13-T-018-S-01119
2021-09-13-T-018,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"It is important to ensure the integrity and proper functioning of the video surveillance systems, as Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Mr Yip Hon Weng and Ms Joan Pereira have pointed out.

2021-09-13-T-018,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"The new section 28A empowers the Director-General to specify requirements for the video surveillance system, including ensuring that the system's security is not compromised. For example, contractors should implement robust digital identification (ID) and password controls and restrict access to the physical components of the system. The person required to install, to operate and to maintain the video surveillance system under the new section 28A must also take all reasonable steps to ensure that no person tampers with or does anything to compromise the proper functioning of the system or any image, sound or video recorded by the system.",25,1121,2021-09-13-T-018-S-01121
2021-09-13-T-018,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Mr Don Wee asked whether phone video footages can be used to substantiate complaints on no-work rule violations in place of video surveillance. While phone video footages can be used as evidence for prosecution, they might not capture sufficient information on the construction activities being carried out to conclude that there was indeed an offence. Such footages received from the public might also not be timely enough to address ongoing construction noise infringements.",26,1122,2021-09-13-T-018-S-01122
2021-09-13-T-018,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"On the other hand, the installed video surveillance will allow NEA to remotely monitor construction worksites and deter repeat violations.

2021-09-13-T-018,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"I assure Mr Don Wee and Mr Yip Hon Weng that we are mindful of the impact of the measures on the construction industry, which is facing challenging times. The requirement will only be imposed on the very small group of construction sites that have breached the no-work rule. This is around 150 out of the 5,800 construction sites a year, or about 3% of all active sites. It will not affect the vast majority of construction sites that comply with the no-work rule.",28,1124,2021-09-13-T-018-S-01124
2021-09-13-T-018,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"The cost of installing video surveillance stands at less than 1% of total construction project cost on average. One set of closed-circuit television (CCTV), for example, can cost about $5,000.

2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),Let me now move on to the next bucket of amendments under the Bill.,36,1185,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01185
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),Part 4 of the Bill amends the Attorney-General (Additional Functions) Act to provide a statutory framework for the Attorney-General (AG) to intervene in court proceedings to fulfil his duty as guardian of the public interest.,37,1186,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01186
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),This statutory framework is based on the well-established role of the AG as the guardian of the public interest. The AG has a right and a duty to represent and safeguard the public interest.,38,1187,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01187
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"The AG does not intervene in court proceedings with a view to advancing the interests of any litigant. Rather, the AG intervenes to represent the public interest and to place before the Court, a non-partisan perspective on public interest issues. This strengthens the integrity of proceedings before the Court, especially in cases where the Court's decision may have ramifications on the wider public good.",39,1188,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01188
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),Let me touch on the framework briefly.,40,1189,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01189
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"First, the AG may apply to the Court for permission to intervene in any court proceeding, if he is of the opinion that the proceedings raise a question of public interest and the intervention is necessary in the public interest. To be clear, this will not affect the AG’s right to intervene in court proceedings under any other written law.",41,1190,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01190
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"If the Court is satisfied that the AG has adequately set out the reasons in support of the application, then the AG is made a party to the proceedings. In deciding whether to grant permission, the Court does not at that stage enquire into the merits of the AG’s application or opinion.",42,1191,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01191
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"An existing party to the proceedings may still apply thereafter to set aside the intervention on the basis that this would be in the interests of justice. But pending the resolution of the setting aside application, the AG remains a party to the proceedings. This ensures that proceedings do not come to a standstill once an application to set aside is made.",43,1192,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01192
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"The Court has the power to order costs for or against the AG, as it thinks fit.",44,1193,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01193
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Overall, the amendments in the framework that I have just outlined will provide greater clarity to the process for the AG to intervene in court proceedings and also minimise uncertainty and satellite litigation.",45,1194,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01194
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Next, let me touch on Part 5 of the Bill which deals with freestanding interim relief. This Part amends the Civil Law Act to enable the General Division of the High Court to grant interim relief in aid of foreign court proceedings, even if there are no substantive proceedings in Singapore. This is commonly known as a ""freestanding interim relief"".",46,1195,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01195
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Under these amendments, the General Division may grant any type of interim relief which it has the power to grant, in proceedings within its own jurisdiction. In other words, the Court is circumscribed by the power it already has within its jurisdiction to grant in those proceedings. For example, a Mareva injunction, which is quite typical, or a search order or an Anton Piller order. However, warrants for the arrest of property and provision for obtaining evidence are excluded.",47,1196,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01196
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"The amendments are consistent with the approach in the UK and Hong Kong, and will support our efforts to promote Singapore as a leading international dispute resolution hub.",48,1197,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01197
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Mr Deputy Speaker, let me now touch on four other proposals quickly under the Bill, which collectively aim to harmonise and enhance the court process.",49,1198,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01198
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"First, on summary dismissal. At present, the Court of Appeal and the Appellate Division have powers to summarily dismiss unmeritorious appeals. The Bill will introduce amendments to empower the General Division, the State Courts and the Family Courts to also summarily dismiss appeals that arise from the lower Courts, or from a decision of the Registrar. To avoid doubt, the Courts have the ability to exercise their powers of summary dismissal without hearing oral arguments.",50,1199,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01199
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),The summary dismissal powers are narrowly scoped and are intended to manage frivolous appeals that are a drain on judicial resources.,51,1200,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01200
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"We have also provided that the Court must consider representations made by the appellant and must also give the appellant a reasonable opportunity to show cause, before exercising its summary dismissal powers.",52,1201,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01201
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Sir, at this stage, I would like to highlight that my Ministry will be moving a Notice of Amendment during the Committee Stage to address two other issues relating to summary dismissal.",53,1202,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01202
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"First, to make drafting changes and align the phrasing of the summary dismissal provision for the Family Court at clause 25 of the Bill with the equivalent provisions that apply to the General Division and to the State Courts. These provisions are intended to have the same effect.",54,1203,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01203
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Second, to ensure that the Court has the power to summarily dismiss certain unmeritorious criminal applications on its own motion. For example, these could be applications brought without any sufficient ground or where in a particular case where the Court has no jurisdiction. This power will apply to criminal matters, such as an application for criminal revision or a criminal motion, where the existing summary dismissal provisions in the Criminal Procedure Code do not currently apply.",55,1204,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01204
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Next, Agreements not to Appeal. We will align the position across all the Courts for Agreements not to Appeal by introducing a clear and simple framework that the parties may use to restrict their right of appeal.",56,1205,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01205
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),This already exists to some extent in the State Courts Act and the Family Justice Act today.,57,1206,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01206
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Under these amendments, Agreements not to Appeal must be in writing and signed by or on behalf of all parties. This ensures that parties' attention is drawn to the implications of their agreement and minimises ensuing satellite litigation over whether there was in fact an agreement or not.",58,1207,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01207
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Third, flexibility in the size of the coram. Currently, proceedings in the General Division are usually disposed of by a single Judge. Clause 53 of the Bill introduces amendments to allow the Chief Justice to convene a coram of three or more Judges to hear any civil or criminal matter before the General Division, if he considers appropriate. This may be the case where, for example, there are novel or important questions affecting the public interest, which could benefit from the collective wisdom and insight of a larger coram.",59,1208,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01208
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),Let me now touch on one final amendment in this Bill.,60,1209,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01209
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Proceedings under the Arbitration Act and International Arbitration Act. Today, proceedings under the current Arbitration and the International Arbitration Act, are heard in open court by default, unless a party applies for the matter to be heard otherwise than in open court, in camera, for instance.",61,1210,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01210
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"We have considered feedback from various stakeholders, practitioners, that as a matter of practice, it will be common for parties involved in proceedings, involving arbitration, such as in those two Acts, to make applications, for the matter to be heard in private. Given that these applications relate to arbitrations, such applications are often allowed by the Court.",62,1211,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01211
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Hence, to better reflect the prevailing practice and streamline the process for parties, clauses 8 and 30 of the Bill will amend the Arbitration Act and the International Arbitration Act respectively, to provide that proceedings under these Acts are to be heard in private by default, unless the Court orders that the proceedings be heard in open court.",63,1212,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01212
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),This is in line with the overall confidential nature of such arbitral proceedings and will result in cost and time savings for parties who now do not have to apply for such proceedings to be heard in private.,64,1213,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01213
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, our Courts play a critical role in upholding the rule of law, through the fair administration of justice in Singapore.",65,1214,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01214
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),This Bill is the culmination of years of effort to re-design our Court system to enable it to be future-ready and well-equipped to meet the evolving needs of society. The Bill also implements the recommendations of the Civil Justice Commission and the Civil Justice Review Committee.,66,1215,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01215
2021-09-13-T-019,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"I would like to end by thanking the Judiciary, members of the Bar and all stakeholders who have worked with MinLaw, on shaping the future of the legal system.

2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Courts (Civil and Criminal Justice) Reform Bill proposes amendments to several statutes. The Workers' Party supports the Bill and the majority of the proposed amendments such as the ones related to supporting the digital transformation of the Judiciary, the simplification of court terminology, civil justice reforms and the empowerment of the High Court to grant interim relief in aid of foreign court proceedings.",1,1219,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01219

2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I seek clarification on Part 4 of the proposed Bill.

I have some questions on this part, as I alluded to earlier.",3,1221,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01221
2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I will first summarise the proposed amendments in Part 4, then discuss the current position in Singapore law and finally, briefly compare Singapore's position with those and other common law countries.",4,1222,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01222
2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"First, the proposed amendments.",5,1223,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01223
2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Bill proposes a statutory framework for the Attorney-General, or AG, to intervene in proceedings where the AG is of the opinion that the question of public interest has arisen and the AG is of the opinion that it is necessary to place information or make submissions before the Court.",6,1224,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01224
2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"A critical element of the proposed amendments is that the Court is not to examine the merits of the AG's grounds for intervention – essentially, the public interest grounds – before granting permission. The Court is only to look at whether the grounds for intervention are adequately set out with a supporting affidavit.",7,1225,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01225
2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"So, although the proposed amendment say that the AG must apply for permission to intervene, in reality, there would be very little room for the Court to deny certain application.",8,1226,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01226
2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"If the existing parties to the proceedings disagree with the AG's intervention, the proposed amendments place the onus on those existing parties to apply to set aside the permission to intervene after it has been granted to the AG.

2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),This onus placed on parties reverses the usual order of things in Court and the common law position on the AG's right to intervene where it is the party who wants something who should apply for it and justify it.,10,1228,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01228
2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The changes proposed by this Bill are extended to all civil proceedings.

They are not criminal proceedings and are proceedings to which the AG is not a party or representing any party.",11,1229,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01229
2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Clause 4A(4) spells out that the AG may intervene in proceedings such as judicial reviews, any civil proceedings, family proceedings or quasi-criminal proceedings appeals and proceedings before Judges under the Legal Profession Act and the Medical Registration Act, although clause 4A(4) is careful to point out that this list does not limit subsection 3, which as I have said, allows intervention in any proceedings.",12,1230,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01230

2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"However, in a private law dispute, the Bill before us today would allow the AG to intervene, with the Courts having no scope to assess the merits of the AG's submission as to what public interest the AG is protecting and in the event an application is made, to set aside the order granting permission for the AG to intervene.",14,1232,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01232

2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"There is already a process under common law for the AG to apply to intervene and for the Courts to consider the merits of the AG's application. It is a well-established procedure and there is no case law in Singapore to suggest that the AG is fettered from intervening in the public interest. Quite simply, the current intervention process under common law appears to work well.",16,1234,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01234

2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"First, the AG has the right to intervene where a statutory right is given. For example, section 46 of the Charities Act entitles the AG to be heard in appeals to the High Court against decisions of the Commissioner of Charities. Other statutes that give the AG the right to intervene in specific situations are the Industrial Relations Act and the Women's Charter.",19,1237,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01237
2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Second, the AG may also intervene at common law, as I intimated earlier.

2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In the ARW case, the High Court Judge stated in his judgment in 2017 that an intervener must establish his standing. He said that in public law matters, the standing of the AG to intervene is not usually in question but that in a civil suit based on private law rights, the AG's role may not be immediately apparent and must be properly established.",21,1239,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01239

2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In Australia, at common law, the AG has the right to intervene in cases affecting the prerogatives of the Crown.

For other types of cases, the Australian AG can seek leave from the court to intervene.",26,1244,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01244
2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In New Zealand, the position is similar. The AG has the right to intervene in proceedings affecting the Crown's rights, property or profits. Otherwise, the AG must seek leave from the court to intervene in other cases.",27,1245,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01245

2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Government needs to clarify the basis of the proposed amendments in part four, both because there is already a common law procedure in place and the AG's right to intervene on matters of public and even private law has not been questioned by the judiciary.",30,1248,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01248

2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),Number one  what triggered the proposed amendments? Have there been civil cases in Singapore recently that the Government wishes it could have intervened in without having the Court examine the merits of the grounds for the Attorney-General's opinion as to the public interest under the proposed amendments?,32,1250,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01250
2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Number two  are there possible cases which have not occurred in the past, which the Government is preparing for as a contingency? And if so, what are these possible scenarios?",33,1251,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01251
2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"More generally and as an extension of the above two questions  are there new areas of public interest that have hitherto not come up, which the Government is trying to protect?",34,1252,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01252
2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),Number four  how actively is the AG looking to be in applying these proposed amendments.,35,1253,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01253
2021-09-13-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Finally, the answers to the above questions do not adequately address this  why does the current procedure, which is well accepted and widely practised in common law countries, have to be changed?",36,1254,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01254

2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the general aims of the Bill which, inter alia, are to support the digital transformation of the Courts and to enable the Attorney-General to safeguard public interest in Civil Court proceedings.",1,1256,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01256
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"On the first point, one silver lining to the COVID-19 pandemic is that it has hastened the digital transformation of the administration of justice in Singapore.",2,1257,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01257
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Thanks to the efforts of MinLaw, led by the hon Minister Edwin Tong, which launched the Legal Industry Technology and Innovation Roadmap in October 2020, law firms are supported in their endeavour to develop legal tech solutions, manage and mitigate risks that come with increasing digitalisation and benefit from the eCourt model, which has enhanced functions such as system integration, speech to text technology and leverages on AI.",3,1258,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01258
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),The Courts transformed quickly to regain lost ground in terms of lost hearing days arising from the circuit breaker in April and May last year when it pivoted to remote hearings.,4,1259,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01259
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),I would like to draw from my own experience over the past year. I have attended numerous virtual Court hearings and online dispute resolutions as counsel.,5,1260,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01260
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The productivity gains and cost savings arising from the usage of digital platforms are significant and acknowledged by all Court users. Hearings nowadays are also more focused in that the parties would have made full written submissions and the Courts, at all levels, would generally take the lead in asking pointed questions of counsel before making decisions.",6,1261,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01261
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),All these translates to efficiencies in the administration of justice and provides litigants with higher value.,7,1262,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01262
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"For these reasons, I fully support the move to enact a permanent framework that will empower the Court to conduct remote hearings or even paper hearings. This will ensure that these hard-won costs savings and productivity gains will endure beyond the pandemic.",8,1263,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01263
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),One concern I have though is how to ensure that litigants-in-persons (LIPs) who may not be familiar with or do not have access to video conferencing technology or have concerns about expressing themselves in writing are not disadvantaged by remote or paper hearings.,9,1264,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01264
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The hon Chief Justice in his address in the Opening of the Legal Year this year sounded a cautionary note on the impact of technology on such persons. He said, ""As we embrace and explore the greater use of technology, we must remain keenly sensitive to the needs of Court users who are less technologically equipped or inclined and ensure that technology is an enabler rather than an impediment.""",10,1265,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01265
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In light of the Chief Justice's observations, may I please ask what measures will be put in place to help LIPs so that the interests of justice would be met?",11,1266,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01266
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"The hon Minister did mention that the raison d'etre of Court proceedings would be to ensure fairness. Clearly, at one level, the remote hearing requirement can be waived for LIPs. But I am just wondering whether there could be avenues for LIPs to learn how to have access to remote hearings, how to use the remote hearing functions or even draft submissions for paper hearings.",12,1267,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01267
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),Another associated question I have is with respect to the intention to allow accused persons to appear and give evidence remotely from prisons.,13,1268,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01268
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Again, conceptually, I have no issue. May I ask, however, how is it being proposed in such situations where they would continue to have access to their lawyers during these proceedings? How is it being proposed that conversations between the accused persons in prisons and their counsel joining in from another location in the course of remote proceedings will be kept strictly privileged and confidential?",14,1269,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01269
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),I now move to my second point on the matter of the AG's right to intervene in Civil Court proceedings.,15,1270,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01270
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),I note that the provisions dealing with the right is premised on the standing of the AG as a guardian of public interest under common law. This standing does not stem from the duties of the Attorney-General as set out in article 35 of the Constitution.,16,1271,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01271
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I am aware that the AG's standing as the guardian has been recognised by the Court of Appeal on several occasions. Notwithstanding that, it seems to me desirable that the AG' role as the guardian of public interest should be codified in our Constitution.",17,1272,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01272
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"As acknowledged by the Court of Appeal, the AG's office is a high constitutional office equal in status to the judiciary. His power over prosecution stems from a constitutional grant under article 35(8) of the Constitution. His role as the Government's legal adviser is also constitutionally entrenched.",18,1273,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01273
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"It is also important to entrench his role as the guardian of public interest so that whatever steps he may take to safeguard public interest in civil proceedings is derived from an exercise of a power that is not only independent but constitutionally protected. In this way, his power cannot be trumped by ordinary legislation.",19,1274,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01274
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),My other questions are on the mechanics of the two-step procedure that is being contemplated when the Attorney-General applies to intervene.,20,1275,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01275
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In this regard, I heard the hon Leader of the Opposition mention that the power of intervention is based on common law. Based on my understanding, that is not the case. Under common law, the AG's position as the guardian of public interest is established. But as far as the powers of intervention are concerned, they are provided for under the rules of the Court and in particular, Order 15.",21,1276,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01276
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Sir, I note that at the first instance, the AG here is proposed to be permitted to apply to the Court to intervene without notice to other parties. In the event the Court allows the AG's application, then at the second instance, parties may apply to set aside the intervention.",22,1277,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01277
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"May I please ask when the AG applies at the first instance, does he have a duty of full and frank disclosure?",23,1278,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01278
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"As the hon Minister who spent a lot of time in private practice would be aware, such responsibility is usually assumed by litigants making Court applications without notice and to some extent, it may address some of the concerns expressed by the hon Leader of the Opposition as well.",24,1279,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01279
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"On the twin threshold questions of (a) whether a question of public interest has arisen and (b) whether it is necessary in the public interest for the AG to intervene, I seek clarification as to what is meant by the words ""has arisen"".",25,1280,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01280

2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"There could also be a situation, as was discussed in the Court of Appeal case of ARW v Comptroller of Income Tax, where the core decision of the Court may not trigger a public interest issue although the issue may have been discussed but not perhaps being germane for the disposal of the case.",27,1282,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01282
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"My next question is whether it is intended that when a Court decides that it is necessary for the AG to intervene, it would still have a discretion to consider all factors which are relevant to the balance of justice in the particular case, before it makes its decision whether or not to allow the intervention.",28,1283,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01283
2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"This is the power that is provided for with the Courts under the Rules of Court when hearing the usual joinder applications. I seek the hon Minister's clarification as to whether it is intended that the same approach will apply to the AG. And in this regard, I will say that it is not unusual for AGs to apply to intervene in civil proceedings because there could be situations where, for example, in my own experience, documents may be sought and these documents may be something that is subject to state immunity. And in those circumstances, in safeguarding public interests, sometimes, the AG may wish to intervene. So, from my own experience, it is not unusual.",29,1284,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01284

2021-09-13-T-019,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"My two points may appear separate, but they are in fact, intertwined. The first relates to a key moral imperative, that in the administration of justice, the means of administration must not disadvantage any group. This speaks to the principle of fairness as put by the hon Minister. My second point is also a moral imperative, that in the administration of justice, the source of power for the guardian of public interest, the hon AG, must derive, not just from common law, but from the highest law of the land, our Constitution. This speaks to the need for legitimacy. I welcome the hon Minister's views on my suggestions. With that, I support the Bill.",31,1286,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01286

2021-09-13-T-019,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Amicable resolution, such as negotiation and mediation, work best when parties participate in good faith.

2021-09-13-T-019,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Two, what constitutes an attempt at amicable resolution? Will there be clear requirements to verify such attempts?

2021-09-13-T-019,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Three, how will the Court ensure that parties participate with good faith in attempts at amicable resolution?

2021-09-13-T-019,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My second clarification is on the new section 79, which gives legal immunity to the Court registrars and Court-appointed mediators for actions that they take as part of mediation or alternative dispute resolution for the Supreme Court. The immunity is limited to actions done in good faith and without any fraud or wilful misconduct.",12,1299,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01299

2021-09-13-T-019,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My third and final point is a proposal.

2021-09-13-T-019,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Will the Court consider implementing a protocol for proceedings conducted by way of a live video link to standardise the way video link hearings are conducted? Such protocol should address issues from the testing of the video link to the arrangements that should be in place for witnesses to give evidence remotely.,22,1309,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01309

2021-09-13-T-019,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"Mr Speaker, Sir, the Courts (Civil and Criminal Justice) Reform Bill aims to improve the accessibility of legal services for everyone. On the whole, I do support the Bill. However, I would like to bring up certain concerns and suggestions which I hope can be addressed in this debate.",1,1311,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01311
2021-09-13-T-019,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"Firstly, under paragraph 4, the amendments that will be made to section 5 is broader in scope than the existing contempt provisions for unauthorised audio or visual recordings. Anyone who makes such recordings, even if they were not the source of the original recording or was present in Court at the time, would be penalised. If this is the intention of the legislature, would educational campaigns be held to notify the general public of this substantial change in contempt laws?",2,1312,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01312
2021-09-13-T-019,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"Could I also clarify if lawyers and litigants-in-persons will also be prohibited from making their own non-official audio transcripts of court proceedings, trials and hearings? Such recordings can facilitate understanding for proceedings that may take several days and are information intensive.",3,1313,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01313
2021-09-13-T-019,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"Moreover, I would also like to welcome the amendments introduced under paragraph 6 through the new section 26A. The new amendments will allow for the presentation of evidence via video or television links. Expert witnesses from other countries can now provide testimony through live video link without having to come to Singapore. This will make litigation not only more efficient but cost-effective as well. Additionally, in the midst of a pandemic, this is a necessary amendment to navigate the new realities of border closures.",4,1314,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01314
2021-09-13-T-019,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"Secondly, I applaud the move to simplify court terminology to make our laws more accessible and understandable to the general public. Lay people would be unfamiliar with legal phrases that are often not used in everyday life. This move will improve the accessibility of legal due process for in-person litigants.",5,1315,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01315
2021-09-13-T-019,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"That said, I would also like to highlight some concerns I have. There are inconsistencies in the terminology used for the civil and criminal courts and for the Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC). Moreover, these new terms do not apply to the family division of the High Court, or Family Court, or a youth court. This inconsistency may be confusing for both laypersons and lawyers and may cause both legal practitioners and laypersons to talk at cross purposes given that similar sounding words have different meanings.",6,1316,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01316
2021-09-13-T-019,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"Also, some of the terms considered archaic and to be removed by the SICC are now used as the new simplified expressions for the civil and criminal courts.

2021-09-13-T-019,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"Lastly, paragraph 10 introduces amendments to the Attorney-General (Additional Functions) Act, which enable the AG to intervene in any proceedings, even those that are not criminal proceedings, to which the AG is neither a party nor representing a party and retrospectively, in the public interest. These include proceedings that are often personal and private in nature. Then these powers are extensive.",8,1318,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01318
2021-09-13-T-019,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"May I ask what prompted this change? May I also clarify when it would be of public interest for the AG to interfere with the legal process of matters that do not concern the AG's office?

Could the Minister also provide us with the types of scenarios contemplated that would require the exercise of the AG's new powers?",9,1319,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01319
2021-09-13-T-019,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"The above queries are rooted in real-world concerns about the implications of the AG's new powers for parties to proceedings. For example, under the new section 4A(9), once the AG is granted permission by the Courts to intervene in any proceedings, he is deemed a party to the proceedings and inter alia, has the same right of appeal in the proceedings. Who will bear the burden of cost of the appeal if neither original party to the proceedings had sought for or wanted the appeal?",10,1320,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01320
2021-09-13-T-019,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"Also, would the Minister be concerned about the chilling effect of these new powers on the rule of law and litigants given that, it is possible under the new laws, for almost every proceeding now to have an element of public interest?",11,1321,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01321
2021-09-13-T-019,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"Mr Speaker, Sir, all in all, I believe the amendments will allow the Courts to carry out their functions more effectively and therefore, I support the Bill.",12,1322,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01322
2021-09-13-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. The cornerstone of our legal system has always been access to justice for all. In pursuit of this aim, the judicial system must be constantly reviewed to remain relevant, robust and efficient.",1,1323,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01323
2021-09-13-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),Digital transformation and a citizenry increasingly aware of its legal rights necessitate our legal system to evolve accordingly. The key amendments in this Bill are in the right direction to meet these evolving trends.,2,1324,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01324
2021-09-13-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),I will highlight three key areas of the amendments along with a few clarifications.,3,1325,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01325
2021-09-13-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"First, I applaud the Ministry's efforts in advancing access to justice for all. Over the years, the Ministry has simplified complex Court processes and improved accessibility to such information. For example, the Insolvency Office's website offers a comprehensive, one-stop suite of information for bankruptcy applications. The information provided on the website is reader-friendly and tailored for laypersons.",4,1326,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01326
2021-09-13-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"I fully support the Ministry's move to simplify court terminology within the amendments. An example of such simplification is changing the expression of ""subpoena"" to ""an order to attend court"". The simplification of legal terminologies is similar to those undertaken in jurisdictions, such as Britain and Canada. Academics have also advocated for such changes. Complex legal terminology in statutes can exclude the layperson from fully exercising their right of self-representation as they are less able to be cognisant of their legal rights. As we move towards a more accessible judicial system for litigants-in-persons, we must work towards continually revising our laws to ensure that they are easily understandable by an average layperson.",5,1327,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01327
2021-09-13-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Secondly, the digital transformation wave has not spared the judicial system. COVID-19 has accelerated the use of technology and the Courts are now better prepared to leverage technology in legal proceedings. Perhaps, the most important change is that of the advent of remote hearings.",6,1328,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01328
2021-09-13-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"While remote hearings were practically unheard of in the justice system before the pandemic, it is now a ubiquitous feature in various jurisdictions. The amendments formally legislate the practice of remote hearings. This allows the judicial system greater flexibility to dispose of matters efficiently.",7,1329,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01329
2021-09-13-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Evidence may also be given via electronic means, such as live video and television links. This is beneficial for both the Court and litigants. For example, obtaining testimonies from expert witnesses, especially those of experts located out of Singapore, can be extremely costly. The admission of evidence via video links can significantly reduce the costs of calling upon experts.",8,1330,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01330
2021-09-13-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Furthermore, with crimes and civil matters becoming increasingly borderless, witnesses may sometimes be located overseas. The amendments will similarly ensure that matters at hand can be disposed of expediently and reduces costs on litigants in bringing witnesses to Singapore.",9,1331,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01331
2021-09-13-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Notwithstanding the benefits leveraging technology brings to the judicial system, I have one area of concern. As with all forms of technology, the benefits of it are followed by risks of misuse. My concern lies within the rising prevalence of Deepfake Artificial Intelligence. Deepfakes are created using artificial intelligence whereby an existing image or video is manipulated and replaced with someone else's face. While deepfakes have been primarily contained to the manipulation of pre-recorded images and videos, there has been new software, such as Avatarify. Unlike traditional deepfake software, it enables users to impose anyone else's face on their own in real-time within applications, such as Zoom.",10,1332,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01332
2021-09-13-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"I worry that such software will become increasingly sophisticated with time. This increases the likelihood of manipulation during remote hearings where witnesses, or even parties, may be impersonated. It is thus imperative to ensure the highest level of technical standards in conducting such processes to preserve the integrity of the judicial system.",11,1333,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01333
2021-09-13-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Considering the rapidly evolving forms of such disruptive technologies, how robust are the current technical safeguards within our judicial system in countering such threats? How can video links be protected such that vulnerable persons’ identities would not be revealed via hacking?",12,1334,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01334
2021-09-13-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Lastly, on the Court’s power to order parties to attempt to resolve disputes by amicable resolution under the proposed section 23 in the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, or SCJA. Alternative dispute resolution, or ADR, mechanisms are much more cost-effective in resolving disputes, compared to litigation. Parties can, more often than not, reach an amicable settlement without the need to commence litigious proceedings. It also prevents Singapore from becoming increasingly litigious.",13,1335,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01335
2021-09-13-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"However, I would like to clarify if the Court should consider the intention of parties in exercising its powers to order parties to attempt to resolve disputes by amicable resolution. There may be situations where one or both parties do not want to participate in these ADRs in good faith. In such circumstances, ordering parties to do so might be counter-productive.",14,1336,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01336
2021-09-13-T-019,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Sir, despite Singapore being consistently ranked highly in the WJP’s Rule of Law Index, we must continue to build on our efforts thus far. At its core, the Bill modernises the form of our judicial system, while retaining its substance and core objective  accessibility to justice for all. I stand in support of the Bill which ensures our judicial system remains highly receptive to the needs of its users.",15,1337,2021-09-13-T-019-S-01337

2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, last year, we delivered an Adjournment Motion in this House seeking increased protection against second-hand smoke in our homes. The answer was a no. Today, I wish I could report that the problem has been solved, that, actually, nothing needs to be done. But this is not the case. In fact, the problem has likely worsened. As the Senior Minister of State Sim Ann said recently, “Across many communities... our sense is that residential smoking has risen”.",1,1348,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01348
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Since our Motion, many Singaporeans have spoken up. On social media, in news media and in private messages, they report feeling tortured and trapped by their neighbours’ second-hand smoke. I will share the stories of these Singaporeans. I will also share that a law already exists that makes smoking near windows and at balconies illegal. We do not need a new law. And I will emphasise the power of deterrence, not just enforcement of this current law against smoking near windows and at balconies, but deterrence, a power that we have not sufficiently drawn on.",2,1349,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01349
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"First, let me provide a reminder to this House on how deadly second-hand smoke is. About one person in Singapore dies every day due to second-hand smoke. This is based on the 383 deaths in 2016 and the number of deaths has been growing each year. Let us put this in context. This is about five times the number of people who have died in motor accidents; seven times the number of people who have died from the coronavirus; and 12 times the number of people who have died from workplace injuries.",3,1350,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01350
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Let me be clear. Deaths from motor accidents, the coronavirus and workplace injuries are all serious and all need our attention. Indeed, I have regularly spoken up on these very issues in this House. My point is that second-hand smoke needs our urgent attention, too. Unlike these other causes of death, there is no preventive measure you can take against second-hand smoke at home. You cannot, for example, take a vaccine. You can install an air purifier but, as MOH has said, it does not work. You can shut your windows but, as many residents know, it does not work. You can talk to your neighbours but, again, as many residents know, more often than not, it does not work.",4,1351,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01351
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"One resident, Kim, shared with me about how she begged her neighbour, with her baby in her arms, about how his second-hand smoke was affecting her child. It did not work. You can move house like another resident, Jennifer, did. She has moved house three times in the past six years and has been unlucky enough to suffer from her neighbours’ second-hand smoke every time. She recently wrote to me at 1.30 am, saying, “Our neighbour is smoking and we are unable to sleep. We are literally dying in our sleep every day”. And honestly, how many people can afford to move house repeatedly to avoid the dangers of second-hand smoke? Is this fair for them?",5,1352,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01352
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Condominium residents do not have it any better. MCSTs have no power to fine their residents, regardless of their bylaws. A condominium resident, NC, spoke to her neighbour, who smokes throughout the day at her balcony and was told that what she was doing was legal despite the condominium bylaw prohibiting smoking at the balcony. NC is worried about the health of her two young children.",6,1353,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01353
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"So, let us focus on how this affects our children. We all become sick from second-hand smoke, but the worst is saved for our children. In a recent study published just a few months ago, researchers concluded that children exposed to second-hand smoke from pregnancy to childhood were more likely to suffer from ADHD symptoms. And it is not just ADHD. Second-hand smoke causes severe respiratory infections, triggers more frequent and more severe asthma attacks, cough, wheezing, breathlessness, ear infections and a whole slew of other illnesses among young children.",7,1354,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01354
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, these medical scenarios are not hypothetical. Parents write letters to me and they describe their lived experiences in these exact words. Their letters sometimes read like horror stories; they know something is killing their children, but they are helpless to do anything about it.",8,1355,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01355
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Take Ying Ying, a young mother with one child and another on the way. Her neighbour’s smoking has plagued her family for four years. It caused her firstborn to suffer from bronchitis. She is now terrified that her next child will suffer the same. To quote her, “Every time we want to open the windows for fresh air, we hesitate. Because we never know how much shorter our breath will become”.",9,1356,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01356
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Take another parent, Peter. His elder son is taking PSLE this year and studies at home while inhaling his neighbour’s second-hand smoke. His younger son has been coughing and sick as a result of the second-hand smoke. “It does not make sense to suffer like that,” Peter says.",10,1357,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01357
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"And it is not just children. Kelvin shared with me about how he has a family member who has cancer and they are worried that the constant exposure to second-hand smoke will be bad for her already failing health. As he puts it, “We are losing our freedom for fresh air”.",11,1358,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01358
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"We have always taken pride in being a safe nation. But for many, home is no longer a safe place. It is the place where their neighbours cause them to suffer asthma attacks, bronchitis, breathlessness, respiratory infections and they cannot do anything about it.",12,1359,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01359
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, this Government acknowledges that this is a public health concern. The Health Promotion Board states, “You wouldn't put your child in danger by letting him play with fire. So, why risk your child’s heath by exposing him or her to second-hand smoke?” I am sure many parents agree with that. So, like me, they choose not to smoke. But they have no choice when it comes to someone else’s second-hand smoke. They need the Government to step in.",13,1360,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01360
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Here, we should remember that one of the most powerful forces in Singapore is deterrence. Indeed, it is fair to say that deterrence is at the cornerstone of our law and order. It explains why we have such low crime rates. But we know that deterrence does not happen out of thin air. It is a three-tier approach and you need to build it, starting from the bottom.",14,1361,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01361
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"At the first tier, you must make clear that the bad behaviour is illegal. To be clear, the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for Sustainability and the Environment is not calling for smoking at home to be illegal. We know that it will be almost impossible to enforce a ban on smoking at home and there will be no deterrent effect of such a law as people will not be able to see people smoking inside their homes.",15,1362,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01362
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, we are calling for the Government to make clear that smoking at windows and balconies is illegal. To be clear, a law already exists. Section 43 of the Environmental Public Health Act empowers NEA to take any step necessary to remove nuisances of a public nature. These nuisances, as defined in section 44, include “the issue of any fumes, vapours, gases, heat, radiation or smells in any premises which is a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health.”",16,1363,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01363
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"That sure sounds like second-hand smoke. Why is the Government not using this law to take a clear stance that smoking near windows and at balconies is illegal? Even without doing anything else, it would already reduce the problem of second-hand smoke in homes.",17,1364,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01364
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I am sure Senior Minister of State Amy Khor would agree with me that Singapore is, generally, a nation of law abiders. Singaporeans are terrified of breaking the law. It would also help neighbours mediate, as offenders can no longer say that their behaviour is perfectly legal. It would help give more bite to NEA officers who already give advisories to those smoking near windows and at balconies. Their words would have more impact if backed by the law. Section 43 can already be used to stop smoking near windows and at balconies. In this unprecedented period of home-based learning and work from home, this needs be done urgently.",18,1365,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01365
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The second tier for deterrence is awareness. Our authorities have historically been very good at this. We have all seen signs by the Police warning against scams, thefts and molestation. Again, we can make it clear that smoking near windows and at balconies is illegal under current laws. We can then leverage the new LCD screens at HDB lobbies to start an awareness campaign. These screens are near to where offences happen and are most likely to have a significant impact. Singaporeans respond when they know something is illegal.",19,1366,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01366
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The third tier for deterrence is enforcement. This is the point Senior Minister of State Amy Khor took issue with when we raised our Motion last year. To quote her  “Cameras must capture the smokers smoking or holding a lighted cigarette as evidence for enforcement. However, a smoker can easily hide behind a pillar, frosted glass, windows or curtains to avoid detection by the cameras. Overall, this may entail deployment of significant resources without achieving effective outcomes.""",20,1367,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01367
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Let me first clarify that a smoker is unlikely to hide behind pillars, windows or curtains to smoke. As a former smoker, I can tell you that smokers smoke at open windows and balconies precisely to get the smoke out of their homes. It would defeat the purpose to hide behind some cover. If they do hide, like how Senior Minister of State Amy Khor describes, then it would be a good thing, not a bad thing, because it would help contain most of the smoke within their homes.",21,1368,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01368
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Senior Minister of State Amy Khor's concern is also about the cost and effectiveness of camera surveillance, but camera surveillance is just one of the many options. It is the last, last, last resort.",22,1369,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01369
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Let me stress again that once people are aware that smoking near windows and at balconies is illegal, the vast majority of people will comply with it. I cannot imagine a person continuing to smoke at their windows, committing an offence right in front of their neighbours in the nearby block. I am sure some neighbours will take photos of this and report the smoker or put it on social media. Deterrence, again, will kick in, before the need for enforcement.",23,1370,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01370
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"For a small number of cases where smokers continue to smoke at windows and balconies, then enforcement kicks in. We start with advisories and then nuisance orders under the Environmental Public Health Act. As I have mentioned earlier, NEA officers already issue advisories today. But they are not backed by the threat of harsher penalties. So, they accomplish little. Used in conjunction with a law, however, such low-effort enforcement may be sufficient to end bad behaviour in most cases.",24,1371,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01371
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I have no doubt that the majority of people will comply once they realise that the penalty for not complying with nuisance orders under the Environmental Public Health Act is a fine of $10,000 for first-time offenders and in the second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or to both.",25,1372,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01372
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"There will be cases where the culprit repeats the offences despite the advisories or nuisance orders and stronger enforcement is needed. To collect further evidence, we can first draw on evidence from complainants. Complainants are often very capable of collecting evidence on their own. Indeed, we already ask residents to provide evidence of their neighbours smoking, such as photos or videos, when they bring a case to the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal.",26,1373,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01373
2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Second, NEA can conduct stakeouts. It already does this for high-rise littering and bird feeders.

2021-09-13-T-022,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),These cameras are used by the authorities today to catch high-rise litterbugs.

It is not the purpose of the EPHA to deal with smoking prohibition. This is why the Smoking (Prohibition in Certain Places) Act was enacted in 1970. Part V of the EPHA addresses public nuisances that affect the public at large and not private nuisances which interfere with another person’s use or enjoyment of his property, which is the situation with smoking in homes.",7,1419,2021-09-13-T-022-S-01419

Unfortunately, NEA’s assessment is that this is not achievable with current enforcement modalities and technology. If we were to prohibit smoking at windows and balconies, we can be sure that there will be smokers who will find ways to avoid getting caught. They could smoke in balcony corners, or in toilets with windows or ventilation fans, which some already do. Smoke will inevitably seep out and can still travel to neighbouring units.

We have to catch the offender in the act of smoking at the balcony or window, or have witnesses come forward to testify that they witnessed the act.

As noted, smokers who want to evade enforcement are unlikely to stand in full view at the balcony or window. To clearly capture a person in the act of smoking at windows and balconies, cameras would have to be of a sufficient resolution and trained directly into units.

2021-09-13-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), Singapore is committed to the global fight against illegal wildlife trade. We have put in place a whole-of-Government regulatory and enforcement framework to tackle the illicit trade in CITES species, and we work closely with our regional and international partners on this front.",1,1448,2021-09-13-T-023-S-01448
2021-09-13-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Due to travel restrictions as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, NParks has observed more cases of illegal wildlife trade detected in parcel post, as consumers have turned to e-commerce and online shopping platforms. This is in contrast to cases detected in air passenger baggage, which were more common three years ago. NParks is investigating these cases and will take the necessary enforcement actions.",2,1449,2021-09-13-T-023-S-01449
2021-09-13-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In view of these trends, we have put in place measures to ensure that our enforcement regime remains robust and effective. Our officers stationed at the border checkpoints and parcel post offices are trained to screen and look out for suspicious parcels that may contain wildlife and wildlife products. NParks is also working with logistics companies and e-commerce platforms to identify such parcels upstream and to remove online listings of illegal wildlife for sale. NParks’ new K9 Unit is also being trained for deployment in different situations to help uncover illegal wildlife and wildlife products passing through our borders.",3,1450,2021-09-13-T-023-S-01450
2021-09-13-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Beyond enhancing our enforcement regime, we are also leveraging science and technology to support our investigation and prosecution efforts. For example, NParks recently opened the Centre for Wildlife Forensics, which will enhance its capabilities in wildlife forensic science and research. Through the Centre, NParks is also collaborating with international experts on studies related to ivory and pangolin scale seizures and will share the findings of these studies with the international community. This will strengthen our global expertise and enforcement efforts to tackle illegal wildlife trade.",4,1451,2021-09-13-T-023-S-01451
2021-09-13-T-023,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Lastly, we are currently reviewing the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act, to strengthen our regulatory processes and enforcement powers against illegal wildlife trade. We will share more details on this soon.",5,1452,2021-09-13-T-023-S-01452
2021-09-13-T-024,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the amount of carbon emissions three years ago during the pre-COVID-19 period in comparison to post-COVID-19, with more people working from home and reduced travelling; (b) if it is a net decrease in carbon emissions, how can this momentum be maintained, moving on; and (c) whether revisions to key targets in the Singapore Green Plan will be made following the report of UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.",1,1453,2021-09-13-T-024-S-01453
2021-09-13-T-024,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment following the latest report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), whether the Government will review and bring forward the plans to reach net zero emissions.",1,1454,2021-09-13-T-024-S-01454
2021-09-13-T-024,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment with regard to the Sixth Assessment Report of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR6) (a) what changes are required to Singapore’s carbon emission and other environmental targets; (b) whether there is a system in place to review and track Singapore’s long-term environmental commitments; and (c) whether there are urgent short-term changes to the commitments that will impact citizens and businesses.,1,1455,2021-09-13-T-024-S-01455
2021-09-13-T-024,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment given the latest report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), whether the Government plans to (i) review Singapore's net zero emissions target and set a definitive timeline to achieve net zero emissions (ii) commit the public sector to net zero emissions by 2050 and (iii) commit the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation to having a portfolio of net zero emissions.",1,1456,2021-09-13-T-024-S-01456
2021-09-13-T-024,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,The latest report from the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a sobering assessment of the grave threats posed by climate change. Singapore remains fundamentally vulnerable to the impact of climate change.,1,1457,2021-09-13-T-024-S-01457
2021-09-13-T-024,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Senior Minister Teo, who chairs the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change, outlined Singapore’s Considered, Committed and Collective approach to climate action at this year’s Committee of Supply debates. As a small city-state with limited land and alternative energy options, we face much starker trade-offs in mitigating our emissions. But we are committed to doing our full part in the global fight against climate change. Our ambitious climate goals have real impact on Singapore’s development and the lives of Singaporeans, and are made after careful and co-ordinated planning. Last year, we submitted our enhanced 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and our Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) under the Paris Agreement. Less than a year later, we launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030, our national roadmap towards sustainable development and net-zero emissions. The Green Plan builds on our enhanced NDC and LEDS and maps out ambitious targets and concrete initiatives over the next decade.",2,1458,2021-09-13-T-024-S-01458
2021-09-13-T-024,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Several Members have asked if we would review our initiatives and targets in light of the latest IPCC findings. Let me assure Members that these are not static. We are pressing ahead decisively with our initiatives and gaining experience from implementing them. Where the conditions allow, we will strengthen our suite of initiatives and push ourselves to do more. The extent to which we can realise emissions reductions will become clearer, as technology evolves and matures, and as the modalities for international cooperation and collaboration become formalised. We are making efforts on both fronts. We are investing and working with key partners on low-carbon technologies and solutions, such as hydrogen. We are also working hard on the international front to advocate for a multilateral, rules-based approach to address climate change, and to foster collaboration in areas like carbon markets and regional energy grids that will support our push for decarbonisation.",3,1459,2021-09-13-T-024-S-01459
2021-09-13-T-024,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In the meantime, we are advancing our efforts to transform our industry, economy and society to be more energy and carbon efficient. Central to this is the carbon tax, which helps to drive economy-wide emissions reduction. We are reviewing our carbon tax regime, to price carbon at a level that can spur the reduction of our carbon footprint and promote industry innovation and green growth, while maintaining Singapore’s economic competitiveness. While we will maintain the carbon tax level at $5 per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions up until 2023, the Deputy Prime Minister and then Minister for Finance stated at Budget 2021 that we are reviewing the post-2023 trajectory and level of carbon tax, as the urgency and global momentum for climate action have accelerated. This review will be done in consultation with industry and expert groups, and the outcome will be announced at Budget 2022 to give ample time for businesses to adjust.",4,1460,2021-09-13-T-024-S-01460
2021-09-13-T-024,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The carbon tax complements the comprehensive suite of measures in the Green Plan to reduce emissions across all sectors. This includes quadrupling our solar energy deployment by 2025, greening 80% of our buildings by 2030 and investing in low-carbon technologies such as carbon capture utilisation and storage and low-carbon hydrogen. The public sector will take the lead and aim to peak its emissions around 2025, five years ahead of the national target. We will review the public sector’s climate targets and strategies together with our national goals.",5,1461,2021-09-13-T-024-S-01461
2021-09-13-T-024,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"As we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, we will examine how to lock in some of the gains from the increased prevalence of telecommuting over the past year, as Dr Lim Wee Kiak has suggested. Our preliminary analysis indicates that Singapore’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 had fallen compared to 2019 levels, mainly due to lower levels of economic activity in the industry sector. It is not conclusive that telecommuting has reduced emissions as working from home may have increased demand for services such as online shopping and food deliveries that increase transport emissions. We have also observed an increase in emissions from households due to increased electricity use. When the emissions data for 2020 is available, we will provide a full update.",6,1462,2021-09-13-T-024-S-01462
2021-09-13-T-024,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"As we move towards a low-carbon economy, businesses and financial institutions have an important role to play in channelling capital towards sustainable development. Ms He Ting Ru asked if there are plans to commit the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) to having a portfolio of net zero emissions. The Minister for Finance has previously stated that the Government does not prescribe the individual investment actions of our investment entities, which make independent commercial decisions. Nonetheless, we note that GIC is already holistically integrating sustainability considerations in their investment processes so as to protect and enhance the long-term value of their portfolios.",7,1463,2021-09-13-T-024-S-01463
2021-09-13-T-024,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Miss Cheryl Chan asked whether there is a system in place to review and track Singapore’s long-term environmental commitments. We do so through the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (IMCCC), chaired by Senior Minister Teo and also regularly report the progress of our climate efforts to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Moving forward, we will provide regular updates on the progress of our broader efforts under the Singapore Green Plan. We hope that this will galvanise Singaporeans to make steady progress on these challenging and ambitious goals to create a more sustainable and climate-resilient future.",8,1464,2021-09-13-T-024-S-01464
2021-09-13-T-025,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in light of the latest report of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (a) what are the plans to mitigate the higher temperatures that will be experienced in Singapore, particularly to alleviate the impact on residents, fauna and flora; and (b) what measures will be taken to mitigate the more extreme sea level rise events especially in the low-lying regions.",1,1465,2021-09-13-T-025-S-01465
2021-09-13-T-025,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Singapore is clear-eyed about the risks of climate change and takes the recent IPCC findings seriously. The Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) has started work on the Third National Climate Change Study, which will contextualise the IPCC findings and derive localised projections for Singapore.",1,1466,2021-09-13-T-025-S-01466
2021-09-13-T-025,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The latest IPCC findings underscore the urgency to press ahead with our climate adaptation plans outlined under the ""Resilient Future"" pillar of the Singapore Green Plan 2030.",2,1467,2021-09-13-T-025-S-01467
2021-09-13-T-025,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"To address rising temperatures and the urban heat island effect, the Government has been developing a heat mitigation action plan, informed by science. This includes increasing urban greenery and green buildings and scaling up the use of cool materials. For example, HDB together with the Tampines Town Council, have launched a pilot project to paint some 130 HDB blocks with cool paint to reduce ambient temperature.",3,1468,2021-09-13-T-025-S-01468
2021-09-13-T-025,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We are also intensifying greenery in our urban environment as part of our City in Nature efforts under the Singapore Green Plan 2030. For example, as part of our OneMillionTrees movement, we are planting 170,000 more trees in our industrial estates over the next 10 years, nearly tripling the current tree population. This can help to cool these industrial estates and create a more conducive work environment.",4,1469,2021-09-13-T-025-S-01469
2021-09-13-T-025,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Climate change can also affect Singapore’s biodiversity and natural ecosystem processes. Under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise Plan 2025, NParks will lead research on the impact of climate change on terrestrial, coastal and marine ecosystems and biodiversity. Such research can guide our nature conservation efforts.",5,1470,2021-09-13-T-025-S-01470
2021-09-13-T-025,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Another key area is strengthening Singapore’s coastal protection and flood resilience. Site-specific studies to determine feasible measures for coastal protection are being carried out progressively, beginning with more critical and vulnerable regions such as the City-East Coast. PUB is also developing a Coastal-Inland Flood Model that can assess the combined flooding effects from extreme sea levels and intense rainfall.",6,1471,2021-09-13-T-025-S-01471
2021-09-13-T-025,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"To enhance flood resilience, PUB has invested almost $2 billion on drainage works in the last decade and will invest another $1.4 billion over the next five years. Drainage design standards were raised in 2011, which called for an increase in drain capacities by up to 50% to cater for more intense rainfall.",7,1472,2021-09-13-T-025-S-01472
2021-09-13-T-025,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The Government will take a science-based and proactive approach to climate adaptation. The Government will review and update Singapore’s long-term coastal protection plans based on the latest data, by adopting a flexible approach in planning protection measures and evaluating the plans across a range of scenarios. However, it will not be prudent or feasible to build infrastructure to accommodate every extreme climate scenario. The recent extreme climate events worldwide have highlighted that the collective response to such occurrences is just as important. We will seek to strengthen community resilience, in partnership with our local communities and stakeholders.",8,1473,2021-09-13-T-025-S-01473
2021-09-13-T-026,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) in light of recent global climatic changes, whether there needs to be a revision to estimated timelines of sea-level rise that may affect Singapore in future; and (b) whether he can provide an update on the plan to build polders and implementation of other measures to deal with sea-level rise.",1,1474,2021-09-13-T-026-S-01474
2021-09-13-T-026,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Ministry can provide an update on Singapore’s polder development project; and (b) how have the findings affected Singapore’s current plans and timeline to protect our coastlines from the impact of climate change.,1,1475,2021-09-13-T-026-S-01475
2021-09-13-T-026,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Sea-level rise poses an existential threat to Singapore. By 2100, sea levels are expected to rise by up to one metre in Singapore due to climate change. We have started work to protect our coastlines to ensure that Singapore remains climate-resilient.",1,1476,2021-09-13-T-026-S-01476
2021-09-13-T-026,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In developing coastal protection plans, the Government refers to the latest climate projections and risks, such as the recent findings by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). These findings will be further localised to inform Singapore’s climate adaptation plans.",2,1477,2021-09-13-T-026-S-01477
2021-09-13-T-026,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Coastal protection is a long-term and large-scale endeavour. Hence, even though there are uncertainties in climate projections, we have begun planning for coastal protection, beginning with the more vulnerable parts of our coasts. In May 2021, PUB, which is the national coastal protection agency, embarked on a site-specific study at the coastline of City-East Coast, which will consider possible protection measures, including the use of polders, seawalls as well as hybrid solutions that integrate nature-based elements such as planting mangroves. Similar studies to protect Jurong Island and the North-West coast will commence in 2022. These studies will develop coastal adaptation pathways and measures that are adaptive to climate uncertainties and the evolving climate science, drawing on international best practices.",3,1478,2021-09-13-T-026-S-01478
2021-09-13-T-026,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,HDB has also piloted a polder project at Pulau Tekong and its construction is ongoing. The learning points from this pilot will guide us on the feasibility of building polders as a coastal protection solution.,4,1479,2021-09-13-T-026-S-01479
2021-09-13-T-026,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,MSE will keep our adaptation measures nimble to account for the latest developments in climate science and projections of sea level rise. This will ensure that Singapore remains resilient to the long-term effects of climate change.,5,1480,2021-09-13-T-026-S-01480
2021-09-13-T-027,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,asked the Minister for Home Affairs what steps have been taken to shore up the emergency preparedness amongst Singaporeans and civil defence of Singapore to deal with weather phenomena arising from climatic change.,1,1481,2021-09-13-T-027-S-01481
2021-09-13-T-027,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) has been educating members of the public on emergency preparedness for the past decades. For example, how to react in situations of fire, flood, landslide, tremors, lightning (during thunderstorms), tsunami and so on. SCDF conducts training for members of the public and issues advisories that can be found in public educational materials, such as the Civil Defence Emergency Handbook and on SCDF’s website. SCDF’s Emergency Preparedness Centre also educates visitors, via interactive exhibits and video accounts, for example of Singaporean survivors of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, how to react during such emergencies.",1,1482,2021-09-13-T-027-S-01482
2021-09-13-T-027,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Climate change has resulted in drier and hotter weather in recent years, increasing the risks of wildfire and heatwave. The inter-agency Wildfire Task Force, which is led by SCDF and with members from agencies such as SLA, NEA, NParks and PUB, steps up preventive measures such as watering and trimming of overgrown vegetation at high-risk areas, ahead of dry weather, to minimise the occurrences of vegetation fire.",2,1483,2021-09-13-T-027-S-01483
2021-09-13-T-027,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Government also periodically conducts contingency planning exercises involving multiple Government agencies, to review our planning assumptions and strengthen coordination in emergency plans.",3,1484,2021-09-13-T-027-S-01484
2021-09-13-T-028,Ng Ling Ling,Ms Ng Ling Ling,"asked the Minister for National Development besides defending Singapore's shoreline against rising sea waters with a coastal defence plan, whether there will be similar efforts for the inland elevated slopes and areas with gradients to systematically identify areas where there can be risks of landslips and sinkholes and to fortify against weakening soil conditions.",1,1485,2021-09-13-T-028-S-01485
2021-09-13-T-028,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Agencies that manage public land carry out regular inspections on slopes that may pose a risk to public safety and implement appropriate mitigation measures to stabilise the slopes if required. For example, NParks inspects slopes in parks and gardens on a quarterly basis during fair weather and on a weekly or monthly basis during periods of intense wet weather.",1,1486,2021-09-13-T-028-S-01486
2021-09-13-T-028,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In addition, BCA requires all slopes that are formed as a result of building works to be assessed for risk of failure by a Qualified Person (QP) before construction commences. The QP is required to recommend slope protection measures to be put in place, such as earth retaining walls and stabilising structures, to ensure that the slope remains stable under adverse weather conditions, including extreme rainfall.",2,1487,2021-09-13-T-028-S-01487
2021-09-13-T-028,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,BCA also issues regular advisories to remind land and building owners to implement measures to manage the risk of landslips for their slopes. These include ensuring adequate drainage and proper maintenance of slope- and earth-retaining structures.,3,1488,2021-09-13-T-028-S-01488
2021-09-13-T-028,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Sinkholes in Singapore are generally caused by larger scale excavation or underground works. For such works, BCA requires a QP to conduct a site investigation and recommend measures to prevent sinkholes from occurring. BCA also requires the builder and the QP supervising the works to monitor ground and building movements during construction, and to implement additional safety measures as necessary.",4,1489,2021-09-13-T-028-S-01489
2021-09-13-T-029,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in view of the “code red for humanity” warning in the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s latest report and industries contributing to about 60% of Singapore’s greenhouse gas emissions (a) whether the Ministry will accelerate the decarbonisation of our power grids by using more imported renewable energy; and (b) whether the Ministry will impose more stringent carbon emission quotas and energy consumption targets on sectors with higher carbon footprints, such as petrochemicals, semi-conductor and data centres.",1,1490,2021-09-13-T-029-S-01490
2021-09-13-T-029,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,Singapore is committed to play our part to address global climate change. We have pledged to peak our emission at no more than 65 million tonnes of CO,1,1491,2021-09-13-T-029-S-01491
2021-09-13-T-029,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Singapore has limited capacity to generate renewable energy. We will quintuple our solar panels deployment by 2030 to generate at least two gigawatt-peak of electricity, but this will only constitute around 3% of our projected total energy consumption in 2030.",2,1492,2021-09-13-T-029-S-01492
2021-09-13-T-029,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Thus, we will need to supplement this with imported renewable energy, while we develop other low-carbon energy sources like hydrogen. The Energy Market Authority (EMA) is conducting trials of electricity imports which will pave the way for more electricity imports over the longterm. MTI will be outlining our plans for electricity imports in the near future.",3,1493,2021-09-13-T-029-S-01493
2021-09-13-T-029,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"On the demand side, we will also need to encourage our companies to be more carbon efficient. We have introduced the carbon tax to provide the price signal to encourage companies to reduce emissions and at the same time, give them the flexibility to act where it makes the most economic sense. The Government is reviewing the trajectory and level of the carbon tax, post-2023, and will announce the outcome of the review in 2022, to give businesses time to adjust to any revision in the carbon tax trajectory.",4,1494,2021-09-13-T-029-S-01494
2021-09-13-T-029,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In addition, we have used incentives such as the Resource Efficiency Grant for Energy (REG(E)) and the Energy Efficiency Fund (E2F) to help companies improve energy efficiency and adopt cleaner technologies.",5,1495,2021-09-13-T-029-S-01495

Besides criminalising acts that clearly seek to promote enmity between different racial groups and undermine our racial harmony, the Act will introduce softer, non-punitive measures that allow the offender a chance to mend relations or understand the offended party’s perspective better. This is important as there could be situations where it would be more helpful to focus on mediating and restoring relations rather than punishing the offender.",3,1523,2021-09-13-T-037-S-01523

That said, Parliament decides on where to draw the line as to what actions should be considered criminal, through the laws that it passes.

2021-09-13-T-039,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"MOE does not track the total value of the private tuition and enrichment industry, or expenditure on such services.

2021-09-13-T-039,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"MOE recognises that the reasons for taking up tuition are varied. It is important to be able to distinguish when it is desirable and when it is not. For example, tuition can benefit students who are genuinely in need of more dedicated help in coping with their studies. This is why our schools cater additional resources to students who need extra help and also partner Self-Help Groups to provide additional academic support to those who need it. We also know that, at heart, many parents send their children for tuition out of care and concern for their child, as they may worry about whether their children can cope with their studies and examinations.",2,1543,2021-09-13-T-039-S-01543
2021-09-13-T-039,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We are concerned, however, when parents send their children for tuition excessively, or to ace examinations even when their children are coping well with their school work.

2021-09-13-T-039,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Introducing regulations to the private tuition and enrichment industry to address unnecessary reliance on tuition is unlikely to be effective, if the underlying reasons why students and parents take up tuition are not addressed.

2021-09-13-T-039,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Therefore, our approach is to address the fundamental issues that drive the demand for tuition. In recent years, we have progressively introduced several policy changes under our Learn for Life movement, to nurture in our students the joy of learning, reduce the overemphasis on academic results and change the mindsets and attitudes of parents and students to adopt a broader definition of success.",5,1546,2021-09-13-T-039-S-01546
2021-09-13-T-039,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Since 2019, we have reduced school-based assessments significantly to provide students more time and space to deepen and pace out their learning. We are changing the PSLE scoring system this year to reduce fine differentiation of examination results and will roll out Full Subject-Based Banding across Secondary schools by 2024 to provide students greater flexibility to learn at a pace and rigour suited to their strengths and interests. We have also continued to broaden the definition of success by expanding Direct School Admission to Secondary schools, as well as aptitude-based admissions to ITE, Polytechnics and Universities.",6,1547,2021-09-13-T-039-S-01547

Generally, a light-touch approach is adopted for first-time offenders, while stricter enforcement actions are taken for recalcitrant cases. In deciding whether prosecution is warranted, HSA also considers whether there is evidence that consumers had been harmed or that the supplements marketed were harmful. Over the last five years, HSA has reviewed 243 advertisements relating to claims made for health supplements.

2021-09-13-T-042,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"While short-term interruptions are manageable, prolonged disruptions to NS activities will have an impact on SAF’s operational readiness. This is why the SAF resumed ICTs and physical conduct of fitness activities right after Phase Two (Heightened Alert) ended in mid-August. High vaccination rates of about 90% amongst our NSmen coming back for ICTs, coupled with stringent safe management, provide for safe conduct of NS activities. Another key enabler is frequent testing. When the SAF resumed ICTs last October, we implemented a weekly COVID-19 test regime for NSmen reporting for unit-level ICT. Going forward, the SAF will continue to monitor the national situation and adjust our COVID-19 measures according to MOH guidelines.",4,1561,2021-09-13-T-042-S-01561

2021-09-13-T-045,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"With these generous subsidies and grants, new HDB flats have remained affordable. In 2020, BTO flat prices in the non-mature estates remained at around five times or less of the median annual first-timer families’ income. The monthly instalment of these families is typically less than a quarter of their household monthly income. This means that most buyers can service their housing loans using their monthly CPF contributions, with little or no cash outlay.",2,1573,2021-09-13-T-045-S-01573
2021-09-13-T-045,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,HDB will continue to price its new flats with affordability as the key consideration and offer a wide range of flat types in various locations to cater to different budgets and needs.

2021-09-13-T-046,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The recent increase in prices can be partly attributed to a broad-based increase in demand for housing, supported by the current low interest rate environment. Nonetheless, HDB resale flats continue to remain affordable",1,1576,2021-09-13-T-046-S-01576

2021-09-13-T-048,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The global maritime industry has remained resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic which has allowed for cross border flow of goods to continue. However, the outlook remains fluid in the short to medium term as the pandemic situation worldwide is still evolving. Containment measures for COVID-19 by overseas ports to bring the COVID-19 situation under control contributed to port closures and congestion, causing further vessel delays and exacerbated the situation in many ports which are already facing tight capacity constraints.",1,1581,2021-09-13-T-048-S-01581
2021-09-13-T-048,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"As the world’s largest transhipment hub port, Singapore is affected by these global disruptions. Congestion in upstream ports resulted in vessels arriving off-schedule in Singapore. This has led to bunching and more peaks and troughs in port operations. In addition, due to changes in the connections for transhipment cargo, PSA and the shippers need to re-plan and execute additional container movements.",2,1582,2021-09-13-T-048-S-01582
2021-09-13-T-048,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The terminal closures in the Port of Shenzhen in late May to mid-June and the Port of Ningbo-Zhoushan in August this year had compounded the problems of delays and capacity for sea freight. Fortunately, the closures were time-limited and both terminals have since reopened. These two ports collectively accounted for approximately 8% of Singapore’s imports from China. Their closures did not have a significant direct impact on Singapore as our supply chains are sufficiently diversified.",3,1583,2021-09-13-T-048-S-01583
2021-09-13-T-048,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"PSA has taken firm action to minimise the impact on Singapore’s port operations and logistics. For example, with support from the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and the unions, PSA opened more berths and yards for operations and deployed more port workers to handle surges in container volumes. PSA worked with shipping lines who had to skip ports to enable them to catch up on their operations in Singapore to make up for lost time.",4,1584,2021-09-13-T-048-S-01584
2021-09-13-T-048,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"As our port is highly digitalised, stakeholders in the logistics sector and supply chain ecosystem receive real-time information about vessel arrivals and departures from PSA terminals through a system called Portnet, allowing them to quickly respond to schedule changes. PSA has also been supporting shippers and cargo owners to track their cargo closely through digital platforms and expedite connections for urgent cargo.",5,1585,2021-09-13-T-048-S-01585
2021-09-13-T-048,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Through these efforts, Singapore has not been too badly affected by the disruptions. Customers have benefited from our connectivity and reliability, which further strengthens our position as a hub port.

This helps them to make informed decisions for successful transition from school or higher education to work. Secondary and Junior College students with additional needs receive further guidance and support from teachers and other staff such as Allied Educators (Learning and Behavioural Support). At the IHLs, dedicated SEN Support Officers prepare students with SEN for employment, by partnering the community and industry to identify internship opportunities and provide pre-internship and employment workshops.

2021-09-13-T-050,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Most flat buyers continue to stay with family members or relatives, or rent on the open market, while awaiting the delivery of their BTO flats. However, the demand for PPHS flats has increased in the last year due to delays in the completion of BTO flats, more people working from home and more competition for open market rental. At the same time, the supply of PPHS flats has tightened as delays in BTO completion have stalled the return of PPHS flats to HDB and the shortage of workers has slowed down sprucing-up works for the PPHS flats before they can be rented out to new tenants.",2,1596,2021-09-13-T-050-S-01596

Of these, about 200 will be ready and progressively released for application by end-2021. Another 500 will be ready in 2022 and the remaining 100 by mid-2023. While HDB strives to maintain a steady supply of PPHS flats, the supply of PPHS flats is limited and opportunistic, as it is mainly drawn from interim sources of supply and the flats may be withdrawn if they are needed for redevelopment.",3,1597,2021-09-13-T-050-S-01597
2021-09-13-T-050,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To boost PPHS supply in the nearterm, we have explored other supply sources, such as vacant staff apartments at various Polytechnics. The Member asked about tapping into private housing stock. We are continuing to study other possible short-term options to augment PPHS supply, but note that at present the private housing stock is equally tight. To optimise our limited PPHS supply, we have therefore also recently finetuned the PPHS eligibility conditions and allocation process to give priority to families in greater need of temporary housing.",4,1598,2021-09-13-T-050-S-01598

2021-09-13-T-055,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,I will address Questions Nos 103 and 104 from the Order Paper and also address Mr Dennis Tan,1,1621,2021-09-13-T-055-S-01621
2021-09-13-T-055,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Let me start with some background. Early last year, at the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, the Government negotiated with various pharmaceutical companies to secure supply of vaccines which were still under clinical trials development. At that time, there were no ready vaccines for us to choose from.",2,1622,2021-09-13-T-055-S-01622
2021-09-13-T-055,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Subsequently, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna submitted the required data to the Health Services Authority and was approved for use under our national vaccination programme. Because of advance planning and some fortune, we were able to benefit from these two vaccines that turned out to be highly effective against the COVID-19 virus.",3,1623,2021-09-13-T-055-S-01623
2021-09-13-T-055,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Separately, the Government brought in 200,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine and allocated 170,000 of it, also for free, to 31 approved private healthcare institutions to administer under the Special Access Route to individuals who wish to take them.",4,1624,2021-09-13-T-055-S-01624
2021-09-13-T-055,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"MOH kept a portion of the Sinovac stock to cater to individuals who found out they were allergic to the mRNA vaccines after taking the first dose and indicated interest to receive the Sinovac vaccine to complete their vaccinations. There are 3,900 of these individuals to date. The various Sinovac vaccinations at public and private healthcare institutions have led to about 1.5% of our population to be vaccinated with Sinovac.",5,1625,2021-09-13-T-055-S-01625
2021-09-13-T-055,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Over time, as the stock depleted, MOH facilitated private healthcare institutions to bring in new supplies of the Sinovac vaccine. The process took a while, which was why the clinics suspended the booking of new appointments. The supplies are expected to arrive around 20 September, barring unforeseen circumstances, and should be available for sale in the private healthcare institutions a few days after.",6,1626,2021-09-13-T-055-S-01626
2021-09-13-T-055,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We have started our booster programme for seniors and individuals who are immunocompromised, using the mRNA vaccines. The EC19V is reviewing international data to consider a booster programme for younger age groups. It is also studying a heterologous strategy, that is, administering a non-mRNA booster shot that is different from the first two primary mRNA doses. If indeed we decide to proceed on such a booster strategy, the shots will also be administered free of charge to residents of Singapore.",7,1627,2021-09-13-T-055-S-01627

2021-09-13-T-056,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Section 139 of the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA) was enacted in 1966, and imposes criminal sanctions on those who promulgate false doctrines. This section was amended in 1999.",1,1629,2021-09-13-T-056-S-01629
2021-09-13-T-056,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Offences under AMLA are reviewed periodically to ensure they are consistent with broader legal policies and are effective in deterring offenders. Any attempt to apply legislation to religious matters must be carefully considered. In the case of deviant teachings, I previously shared that MUIS seeks to address these problems at the root, by adopting a multi-pronged approach of counselling individuals and inoculating the public against harmful ideologies.",2,1630,2021-09-13-T-056-S-01630
2021-09-13-T-057,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,asked the Minister for Education (a) when does the Ministry expect to conclude its review of the Primary 1 registration framework; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider using citizenship and home-school distance as a primary means of allocating vacancies for all three phases of the Primary 1 registration while retaining the existing Phases 2A and 2B criteria for determining balloting priority.,1,1631,2021-09-13-T-057-S-01631
2021-09-13-T-057,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"MOE has concluded our review of the Primary 1 Registration Framework and will be making several changes that will take effect from the 2022 P1 Registration Exercise, as announced on 9 September 2021.",1,1632,2021-09-13-T-057-S-01632
2021-09-13-T-057,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We will increase the number of reserved places in Phase 2C to ensure more children with no prior connection will be able to get a place in a school near their home. The current Phase 2A1 and 2A2 will be combined into a single Phase 2A. We have kept Phases 2A and 2B to recognise the importance of maintaining the heritage and ethos of our schools and building closer links between community and school. Where the number of applicants exceeds vacancies in a phase, balloting will continue to be based on citizenship first, then Home-School Distance categories.",2,1633,2021-09-13-T-057-S-01633
2021-09-13-T-057,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"This fine-tuning of our P1 Registration Framework seeks to strike a careful balance of many different considerations, where we are careful not to drastically affect the groups given priority under the current Framework. So, while we are now placing greater weight on giving our children access to a school near to their homes, we continue to recognise the efforts of our community, including school alumni who have contributed to the development of a school and its culture.",3,1634,2021-09-13-T-057-S-01634
2021-09-13-T-057,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"What Mr Chua has proposed is a major departure from the current system and would cause significant disruptions to parents and the community, which we should avoid.",4,1635,2021-09-13-T-057-S-01635
2021-09-13-T-057,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Nevertheless, as circumstances and our society evolve, we will continue to refine our P1 Registration Framework.",5,1636,2021-09-13-T-057-S-01636
2021-09-13-T-058,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) to date, how many persons have been unable to pay for their stays at SHN-Dedicated Facilities (SDFs) upon arrival in Singapore; (b) what proportion is this of the total number of persons who have stayed at SDFs; and (c) how has the Ministry supported those who are unable to pay the SDF and testing fees.",1,1637,2021-09-13-T-058-S-01637
2021-09-13-T-058,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Since 1 January 2021, all incoming travellers are required to pay for their stay at Stay-Home Notice (SHN) dedicated facilities (SDFs) and testing fees, as part of the cost of travel in a COVID-19 world. While the Government had borne these costs during the earlier phase of the crisis last year, we have gradually moved to a position where travellers bear the costs of their travel as a private expense, rather than relying on public funds. This is consistent with the practice in many other countries.",1,1638,2021-09-13-T-058-S-01638
2021-09-13-T-058,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,Only Singaporeans and Permanent Residents (SC/PRs) who face financial difficulties and had to travel for extenuating reasons may apply to ICA for a full cost waiver. Non-residents who wish to enter Singapore are generally required to pay for their SDF stays and testing fees before they can be granted entry into Singapore. Non-residents who have financial difficulties may be assessed for a cost waiver or refund by their respective sectoral leads on a case by case basis.,2,1639,2021-09-13-T-058-S-01639
2021-09-13-T-058,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Between January and July 2021, the Government has received around 10,000 appeals for cost waiver from SC/PRs and non-residents. This constitutes about 6% of the total number of travellers who have stayed at SDFs over the same period. In assessing these appeals, we considered the financial situation of the travellers and their ability to pay for the SDF stay and testing fees, as well as the circumstances surrounding the decision to travel. Waivers are reserved for those who have extenuating reasons to travel and genuine difficulties in meeting the cost of the SDF stay and testing, which should otherwise be considered as a private expense. About half of the appeals have been acceded to.",3,1640,2021-09-13-T-058-S-01640
2021-09-13-T-059,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal,"asked the Minister for Health with regard to fake vaccination certificates (a) whether the Ministry has conducted any assessment of (i) the current situation of forgery and how widespread it is and (ii) the likelihood of such cases happening in Singapore over the next few months and if so, what are the findings of such assessment; and (b) whether there are stricter measures put in place to ensure that vaccination certificates cannot be forged for fraudulent purposes.",1,1641,2021-09-13-T-059-S-01641
2021-09-13-T-059,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,MOH and the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO) have developed various digital solutions to assist businesses to check for valid vaccination certificates and detect fake displays.,1,1642,2021-09-13-T-059-S-01642
2021-09-13-T-059,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Businesses are strongly encouraged to use the SafeEntry (Business) App to check an individual’s vaccination status by requesting the individual to tap his or her TraceTogether (TT) App or Token against the businesses’ SafeEntry (Business) App. This would confirm the status of the individual’s vaccination status directly with MOH’s databases. It also allows individuals to concurrently and conveniently perform SafeEntry check-in.,2,1643,2021-09-13-T-059-S-01643
2021-09-13-T-059,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Businesses may also ask to see individuals’ TT App or HealthHub App for their vaccination, or test, status. There are a number of ways to verify the certificates as genuine and to ensure that what is displayed is not just a screen shot of somebody else’s TT App or HealthHub display. For example, businesses can look out for the “signal” animation on the TT App. One can also tap through icons in the App or click on the “refresh” button next to the “COVID Health Status”. Lastly the business can check the particulars on the HealthHub App against the individual’s Government-issued identification card.",3,1644,2021-09-13-T-059-S-01644
2021-09-13-T-059,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As for Singaporeans, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass Holders who received vaccination overseas, they would need to present proof of their overseas vaccination and submit themselves to a serology test at participating healthcare providers. After confirmation of a positive result for their serology test, their vaccination status would then be updated in MOH’s databases by their healthcare provider. Their vaccination status would thereafter be displayed in the TT App or the HealthHub App.",4,1645,2021-09-13-T-059-S-01645
2021-09-13-T-059,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Agencies’ enforcement teams will monitor whether establishments are indeed making appropriate checks on their patrons’ vaccination, or test, status. Individuals who are found to have deliberately misrepresented themselves and/or others, for example through the provision of false or misleading verification documents and/or information, could be subject to criminal enforcement and prosecution.",5,1646,2021-09-13-T-059-S-01646
2021-09-13-T-060,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,"asked the Prime Minister whether the Government can help organisations and businesses that need to check on the COVID-19 vaccination status of their visitors, clients and customers, to install and configure their SafeEntry (Business) Apps to allow visitors and patrons, especially the elderly who carry TraceTogether (TT) tokens, to verify their status through a quick scan.",1,1647,2021-09-13-T-060-S-01647
2021-09-13-T-060,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo (for the Prime Minister),"Businesses can use the SafeEntry (Business) App to check on the vaccination and test status of their visitors.

2021-09-13-T-060,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo (for the Prime Minister),"More than 70% of the businesses that need to implement vaccinated-differentiated safe management measures (SMMs) have already set up the SafeEntry (Business) App. For those that have not done so, we have published a step-by-step guide on the SafeEntry website. Businesses that require further help can approach Safe Distancing Ambassadors and Smart Nation Ambassadors to provide hands-on assistance. Businesses may also submit a ticket on the SafeEntry website for technical support or call the SafeEntry Gateway hotline. We will continue to render help to businesses and other organisations as needed.",2,1649,2021-09-13-T-060-S-01649
2021-09-13-T-061,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for National Development in respect of animal cruelty and abuse cases in the past five years (a) how many cases have been investigated annually; (b) how many cases have been issued warning letters; (c) how many cases have been issued compound fines; (d) how many cases have been prosecuted and fines issued; (e) how many cases have been prosecuted and jail terms issued; and (f) whether the Ministry is considering increasing the penalties for such cases.,1,1650,2021-09-13-T-061-S-01650

2021-09-13-T-061,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We take a serious view of all acts of animal cruelty and abuse. Individuals who are found guilty of committing acts of animal cruelty can be charged under the Animals and Birds Act. First-time offenders can face a maximum fine of $15,000, or a jail term of up to 18 months, or both. Repeat offenders can face a maximum fine of $30,000, or a jail term of up to three years, or both. We will continue to review the penalties under the Animals and Birds Act to ensure that they remain effective in deterring acts of animal cruelty and abuse.",2,1652,2021-09-13-T-061-S-01652

2021-09-13-T-062,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly disrupted many sectors, including our charity sector. Their operations were affected in many ways, from delivering services and programmes, engaging volunteers to organising fund-raising activities and events. They had to postpone or cancel flag days and fund-raising gala dinners. There were fewer volunteering opportunities as we had to minimise close contact to reduce the risk of COVID-19 community transmission. Yet, this was also a time where many charities, especially those in the social and health sectors, experienced greater demand for their services due to the pandemic.",1,1654,2021-09-13-T-062-S-01654
2021-09-13-T-062,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Despite these difficulties, we saw the resilience of our charity sector.

2021-09-13-T-064,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) why are only degree holders allowed to become social workers; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider developing diploma holders into social workers through short professional development courses targeted specifically at those who have a significant amount of work experience in the social sector.,1,1682,2021-09-13-T-064-S-01682
2021-09-13-T-064,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Social Work is a profession that engages people and systems to address issues and problems in life to enhance well-being. Social Workers need to have mastery of theoretical and research-based knowledge and have deep skills to make assessments and interventions  within professional standards of practice and adhere to the Social Work Profession’s code of conduct and ethical principles.,1,1683,2021-09-13-T-064-S-01683
2021-09-13-T-064,,,"The roles of Social Workers are multifaceted. These include how to conduct risk assessment and mobilising of individuals and resources to keep persons safe especially if they are vulnerable. They have the responsibility to make timely professional judgement calls and work with involuntary clients to receive help and improve their well-being. The rigour of Social Work training at the undergraduate level ensures that Social Workers are able to apply casework, work with groups and communities to solve problems, improve well-being and advocate for vulnerable clients to keep them safe. The basic entry qualification for professional Social Workers in other countries (for example, United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Indonesia, Philippines) is a Bachelor’s Degree in Social Work.",1,1684,2021-09-13-T-064-S-01684

2021-09-13-T-065,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The Member may be referring to Integrated Shield Plans (IPs), which are private and optional plans that provide additional coverage on top of MediShield Life. IP claims are assessed by the private insurers based on the contractual terms agreed between the insurer and policyholder. We do not track the number of IP claims denied due to non-disclosure of minor unrelated health conditions. Nevertheless, we expect private insurers to be fair and reasonable to policyholders. Insurers should not reject major illness claims on the basis of undeclared conditions that are minor and unrelated.",2,1688,2021-09-13-T-065-S-01688
2021-09-13-T-065,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Policyholders who feel that their claims have been unfairly rejected and are unable to reach a satisfactory resolution with the insurer may file a claim for mediation or adjudication at the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre (FIDReC).

2021-09-13-T-067,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Between January and July 2021, there were 22 reported sea robbery incidents in the Strait of Singapore, which includes the territorial waters of Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. None of these 22 cases occurred within or originated from Singapore’s territorial waters. The 22 reported incidents represent a slight increase over the 19 cases reported over the same period in 2020.",1,1695,2021-09-13-T-067-S-01695
2021-09-13-T-067,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Maritime security agencies respond swiftly and robustly to any suspicious activities within our territorial waters. For example, should a vessel encounter a sea robbery incident in Singapore territorial waters, the Police Coast Guard (PCG) will board the vessel and conduct checks onboard to search for unauthorised personnel and ensure the safety of the crew. The PCG will also do the same upon request by the ship captain if a vessel subsequently enters Singapore territorial waters after encountering such an incident.",2,1696,2021-09-13-T-067-S-01696
2021-09-13-T-067,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"To support these enforcement actions, the Singapore Maritime Crisis Centre (SMCC) maintains our overall maritime situational awareness. Through the use of data analytics and intelligence, the SMCC detects and deters maritime security threats, and coordinates responses at the national level. The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) and PCG use technology to monitor vessels around and within Singapore’s territorial waters. For example, MPA uses its Vessel Traffic Information System (VTIS) to monitor the safe navigation of ships. MPA also issues alerts to vessels passing through areas with recent piracy or armed robbery incidents, to remind them to stay vigilant. The RSN and PCG leverage on a network of cameras and coastal surveillance systems to detect and track suspicious activities within Singapore’s territorial waters.",3,1697,2021-09-13-T-067-S-01697
2021-09-13-T-067,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Piracy and sea robberies are transboundary problems that require collaboration among regional partners to combat effectively.

2021-09-13-T-067,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Singapore has also contributed actively to cooperative regional efforts to combat piracy and sea robberies. Singapore has hosted the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery (ReCAAP) Information Sharing Centre (ISC) since its inception 15 years ago. The ReCAAP ISC is a vital part of the regional anti-piracy architecture, facilitating information sharing, capacity building and cooperative arrangements between its contracting parties.",5,1699,2021-09-13-T-067-S-01699

2021-09-13-T-068,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry can consider incorporating self-defence lessons into the physical education curriculum for Primary and Secondary schools which include violence prevention strategies and strategies on risk assessment and de-escalation of conflicts to prevent assaults.,1,1701,2021-09-13-T-068-S-01701
2021-09-13-T-068,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,The safety and well-being of all our students is of paramount importance. MOE's approach towards physical confrontation is to de-escalate conflict or run to seek help. Students are therefore taught to avoid physical confrontations as an important strategy to keep themselves safe. In situations of emergency or sudden unprovoked acts of physical violence,1,1702,2021-09-13-T-068-S-01702
2021-09-13-T-068,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Self-defence lessons are currently not taught in our physical education curriculum. Teaching all students self-defence may encourage some students to physically defend themselves in response to a physical assault. In such instances, engaging in physical confrontations may potentially put students in greater risk even if they have attained some level of self-defence skills.",2,1703,2021-09-13-T-068-S-01703

The space industry is a key enabler for global connectivity, aviation and shipping. Space research can also help us better understand climate changes and weather patterns. In Singapore, space is already integral to our daily lives. The apps that we depend on for ride-hailing or deliveries tap on location data derived from a network of Global Navigation Satellite Systems or GNSS. When you log on to check your WhatsApp messages or emails during a flight or on a cruise ship, you are also tapping on connectivity provided by communications satellites.",1,1733,2021-09-13-T-072-S-01733
2021-09-13-T-072,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Given the vast potential for the future, we intend to develop our local space industry to capture opportunities using three strategies. First, we will support local space enterprises to innovate and scale up. Our national space office, the Office for Space Technology and Industry (OSTIn), has been working with our startups and SMEs to build deep technical capabilities, identify opportunities, and support their venture building and fund-raising efforts. For example, Zero Error Systems is a spin-off company from NTU which develops radiation-hardened electronics based on earlier research supported by OSTIn and they went on to raise US$1.85 million in a seed round last October. Our startups have also developed technologies that are valued by more established space players.

Instead, we have been partnering SSAs to strengthen their capabilities, which includes corporate functions and have introduced various initiatives to do so. This includes schemes to help SSAs diagnose areas for improvement and implement solutions such as the People Practice Consultancy (PPC) and Organisation Development Journey (ODJ), and schemes to help SSAs hire to expand their corporate functions and implement capability-building projects such as the Enhanced Volunteer Manager Funding Scheme (EVMFS) and Transformation Support Scheme (TSS).

In pricing new flats, HDB first establishes the market value of the flat by considering the prices of comparable resale flats nearby, as well as the individual attributes of the flat, such as its location, floor area, storey height and orientation, as well as accessibility to key transport nodes and amenities. A significant subsidy is then applied to the market value so that new flats are priced below market to ensure affordability.

2021-09-13-T-082,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The price differences between 2-room Flexi flats and 3-room flats arise mainly due to the differences in their respective floor areas.

2021-09-13-T-084,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong,asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider creating a new category of COEs for motorcycles used by riders for delivery work or increasing the quota for motorcycles.,1,1808,2021-09-13-T-084-S-01808
2021-09-13-T-084,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The recent increase in motorcycle COE prices has raised concerns amongst the public. Fundamentally, COE prices are determined by demand and supply. Due to the closure of motor vehicle showrooms and dealerships during the 2020 circuit breaker, COE bidding was suspended from April to June 2020. The accumulated COE quotas from the suspended COE bidding cycles were restored to the monthly pool over 12 months, thereby increasing COE supply by about 30% from July 2020 to July 2021. Despite the higher-than-usual number of motorcycle COEs, more than 99% of motorcycle temporary COEs (TCOEs) issued have been used to register motorcycles before they expired. For instance, from June to August 2021, only seven out of 3,188 Category D TCOEs were not utilised. This represents a 99.8% utilisation rate within the TCOEs’ six-month validity period. This high utilisation rate suggests a high demand for motorcycles.",1,1809,2021-09-13-T-084-S-01809
2021-09-13-T-084,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"As the return of earlier accumulated COEs concluded in July 2021, the COE supply dropped by 28% from August to October 2021 compared to the preceding three months. The combination of high demand for motorcycles and the drop in COE supply may have contributed to the high COE prices.",2,1810,2021-09-13-T-084-S-01810
2021-09-13-T-084,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Unlike for cars, the COE quota for motorcycles is relatively small. Dividing it further into smaller sub-categories may distort the market and result in significant volatility in COE prices. Increasing the supply of motorcycle COEs has broader ramifications for our total vehicle population and our vision of a greener and more vehicle-light environment.",3,1811,2021-09-13-T-084-S-01811
2021-09-13-T-084,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"A subsidy scheme for delivery riders will raise questions of equity and would be difficult to implement given the dynamic inflow and outflow of workers in the gig economy.

2021-09-13-T-087,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"While a longer loan tenure may increase the loan amount or lower the monthly instalment payable, flat buyers will pay more in interest over the duration of the loan.

2021-09-13-T-093,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"To reduce food wastage, SAF plans for meals at its cookhouses based on weekly consumption forecasts that take into account a unit’s training schedule and nutritional requirement. An electronic meal accounting system is also used to track actual consumption over time so that further adjustments can be made. These measures have reduced food wastage to, on average, about 1% of meals catered.",2,1854,2021-09-13-T-093-S-01854

2021-09-13-T-093,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Besides minimising wastage, SAF also makes effort to recycle. For example, 14 SAF cookhouses are currently involved in a food recycling programme, which produces biogas for energy generation. By 2024, all SAF cookhouses will be part of this programme. SAF has also set up equipment collection points at premises such as SAFRA clubhouses for National Servicemen to dispose their old uniforms, boots and other personal equipment, some of which are repurposed and recycled. In addition, SAF has put in place waste disposal contracts to repurpose and recycle scrap metals, electronic waste, chemicals and waste oil.

Cross-border travel arrangements such as the Periodic Commuting Arrangement and framework for Death and Critically Ill Emergency Visits remain in effect. The Singapore Government is also continuing discussions with the Malaysian government on the safe and gradual resumption of cross-border movement of people. This will require mutually agreed public health protocols, such as the mutual recognition of vaccine certificates, in order to preserve the public health and safety of residents on both sides.",2,1862,2021-09-13-T-094-S-01862

2021-09-13-T-106,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"To more effectively combat cryptocurrency scams and crimes, the Police established the Cryptocurrency Task Force in 2018 to monitor the cryptocurrency landscape; develop and improve operational procedures in the investigation and seizing of cryptocurrencies; and establish working relationships with overseas law enforcement agencies, industry professionals and academic experts in cryptocurrencies.",1,1917,2021-09-13-T-106-S-01917
2021-09-13-T-106,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Task Force works closely with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which regulates entities that deal in or facilitate the exchange of cryptocurrencies or Digital Payment Tokens (DPTs) in Singapore under the Payment Services Act. The Task Force also has links with the Association of Crypto Currency Enterprises and Start-ups Singapore (ACCESS), a Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Industry Association that aims to foster dialogue between Singaporean cryptocurrency and blockchain businesses and other relevant public and private sector stakeholders. The Police also work with the various cryptocurrency exchanges based locally and abroad to investigate into cryptocurrency crimes.",2,1918,2021-09-13-T-106-S-01918
2021-09-13-T-106,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Enforcement against cryptocurrency-related scams and crimes alone is insufficient. Public awareness and vigilance are key to preventing more people from falling prey to such scams. MAS has issued numerous advisories warning consumers of the risks of investing in and trading cryptocurrencies, given their highly speculative nature. MAS and the Police have also issued public advisories alerting consumers to fraudulent websites soliciting cryptocurrency investments.",3,1919,2021-09-13-T-106-S-01919

Cryptocurrency investment scams, in particular, was a key focus area for MoneySense’s recent campaign from April to June 2021. Besides highlighting the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies, the campaign featured key messages about the risks of dealing with unregulated entities, and to always “Ask, Check and Confirm” before making investments.",4,1920,2021-09-13-T-106-S-01920
2021-09-13-T-106,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Should consumers choose to invest in or trade cryptocurrencies, they are advised to check if the entities they deal with are regulated by MAS. Regulated entities have to comply with anti-money laundering and terrorism financing requirements, which means that they would have to put in place measures, such as performing customer due diligence and transaction monitoring, to reduce the risk of illicit actors transacting through them. Regulated entities are also required to put in place security measures to guard against cyber attacks. These entities would have to report any suspicious transactions to the Police.",5,1921,2021-09-13-T-106-S-01921

2021-09-13-T-112,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Singapore imports natural gas from around the world, including Piped Natural Gas (PNG) from Indonesia and Malaysia, and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) from Australia, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Oman and the United States. The amount of external methane emissions associated with piped natural gas and liquefied natural gas depends on the production, processing, transportation and distribution processes. As these differ across different sources of natural gas and given the diversified sources that Singapore draws natural gas from, the amount of external methane emissions arising from natural gas imported to Singapore varies. We have not conducted a study on the external methane emissions associated with the natural gas imported and consumed in Singapore.",1,1947,2021-09-13-T-112-S-01947

2021-09-13-T-114,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"First, the Government aims to keep the economy competitive to ensure that companies continue to create good jobs with sustained income growth. As companies are better able to sustain real wage increases if productivity improves, the Government has put in place schemes such as the Productivity Solutions Grant to help companies raise their productivity.",2,1955,2021-09-13-T-114-S-01955
2021-09-13-T-114,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Second, the Government promotes competition in markets and lowers barriers to entry where possible to ensure that Singaporeans enjoy competitive prices.

We have been working closely with the EU and other partners at international, regional and bilateral platforms to explore multi-faceted strategies in tackling climate change. At the same time, measures such as the CBAM should be consistent with WTO principles and not raise barriers to international trade. In particular, the CBAM should be applied in a non-discriminatory manner. It should also take into account existing carbon taxation or other mitigation mechanisms implemented by exporting countries.",3,1962,2021-09-13-T-115-S-01962

2021-09-13-T-121,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,MOE and our schools have a multi-pronged approach to reduce the stigma for students seeking help from School Counsellors.,1,1982,2021-09-13-T-121-S-01982
2021-09-13-T-121,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Firstly, mental health education is featured strongly in the refreshed Character and Citizenship Education curriculum. Topics include understanding common mental health issues and symptoms, knowing when and how to seek help for self and others, destigmatising help seeking and developing empathy towards people struggling with mental health issues and conditions.",2,1983,2021-09-13-T-121-S-01983
2021-09-13-T-121,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Secondly, the counselling room provides a private, quiet and safe place for students to share in confidence. To help students feel more comfortable with talking to School Counsellors, they engage students beyond the counselling room. School Counsellors proactively reach out to students during morning assembly and recess time to interact with students. They also conduct school-wide or class-based talks to raise awareness of mental health issues and encourage seeking help from trusted adults. School Counsellors also engage parents during the schools’ briefing sessions for parents on supporting their children’s well-being.",3,1984,2021-09-13-T-121-S-01984
2021-09-13-T-121,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Thirdly, for students who prefer anonymity and support outside of the school setting, there are local online portals (for example, Tinkle Friend, eC2, SOS) available. Students are informed of these portals and encouraged to access them if needed. For those who prefer face-to-face support, they can seek help from family service centres or private counselling centres with parental consent if they are below 21 years of age.",4,1985,2021-09-13-T-121-S-01985

For most part-time Nitec and Higher Nitec students from lower-income households, the annual bursary amount is sufficient to fully cover fees. For part-time diploma students and undergraduates from lower income households, the annual fees they need to pay after Government bursaries are $140 and $2,300 respectively. They can tap on the Post-Secondary Education Account or SkillsFuture Credit to pay this remaining amount. Part-time undergraduates also have the option of tapping on Government loans to pay the remaining amount.",2,1988,2021-09-13-T-122-S-01988

2021-09-13-T-124,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The lapses in IT controls were related to weaknesses in the review of privileged users’ activities and management of user accounts and access rights. Currently, many of these procedures have manual steps which are prone to human error. Agencies are implementing technical solutions to reliably automate these IT tasks. However, there will be scenarios that cannot be fully automated and may require human intervention.",4,1997,2021-09-13-T-124-S-01997
2021-09-13-T-124,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Many of the lapses in procurement and contract management were related to inadequate control and monitoring of contractors and managing agents, and lack of documentation of decisions made or work done. This is more challenging in complex construction projects where there can be hundreds of contract variations due to changing circumstances as the project progresses.",5,1998,2021-09-13-T-124-S-01998
2021-09-13-T-124,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Government takes these audit findings seriously.

2021-09-13-T-125,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,There are rules and guidelines on financial controls which govern public agencies in carrying out various finance functions including payments. Heads of agencies are responsible for ensuring that sound accounting practices and adequate internal controls are in place. Let me elaborate using some examples.,1,2006,2021-09-13-T-125-S-02006
2021-09-13-T-125,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Our payment processing cycle is automated with system controls to ensure timely and accurate payments. Invoices are received electronically from suppliers via the electronic invoicing network, thereby reducing the risks of handling paper invoices and data-entry error. Invoices are then automatically matched against the purchase order and goods or services receipt note. Prior to that, public officers are required to check supporting documents and verify that the works are completed satisfactorily. For instance, prior to certifying payments for facility management services, the officer has to verify documentation such as service records, maintenance audit reports and inspection checklists. The officer also needs to conduct test-checks to ascertain that the contractors have met the performance standards.",2,2007,2021-09-13-T-125-S-02007
2021-09-13-T-125,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Agencies can proactively monitor the status of their payments to suppliers and benchmark the timeliness of their payments via dashboards on the financial data analytics system. Such tools and practices have enabled agencies to achieve a prompt payment rate of 98% in FY2020.,3,2008,2021-09-13-T-125-S-02008
2021-09-13-T-125,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,We strengthen internal controls through ongoing efforts to develop capabilities. Some examples are,4,2009,2021-09-13-T-125-S-02009

2021-09-13-T-126,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Public officers undergo regular training and milestone programmes throughout their careers.

2021-09-13-T-137,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Of the excess fitness trackers, 120,000 remain functional. Forty-eight thousand have been used to replace faulty trackers and those with expired warranties. About 3,000 trackers have also been used to support community partners, companies and other Government agencies in their health and wellness initiatives. The remaining 69,000 functional trackers will continue to be used for similar purposes. Unfortunately, the rest of the excess fitness trackers have been disposed of, as they have exceeded the average useful life or were no longer functional.",2,2059,2021-09-13-T-137-S-02059
2021-09-13-T-137,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,HPB has conducted a full review of the matter. It has enhanced the processes for central monitoring of the movement and stocks of fitness trackers. HPB now tracks movement across and at all distribution channels closely on a daily basis to detect signs of excesses building up. Audits and physical stock checks will also be done twice a year instead of annually. Excess inventory from previous years will be counted towards providing trackers for the following year’s activity.,3,2060,2021-09-13-T-137-S-02060
2021-09-13-T-137,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Moving forward, HPB will be more conservative in its projections of the number of fitness trackers to be procured.

2021-09-13-T-140,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Singapore’s approach is to secure a diverse portfolio of vaccines to cater to the clinical needs of different segments of the population. This includes non-mRNA vaccines such as the inactivated vaccine by Sinovac and the protein-based vaccine by Novavax. The timeline for approval is dependent on the companies’ applications to HSA and the availability of data.,1,2070,2021-09-13-T-140-S-02070

2021-09-13-T-141,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The MediShield Life changes will help to slow down the increase in cost of cancer drugs, as it supports more effective negotiations with drug suppliers for better drug prices and encourages the use of clinically proven and cost-effective treatments. Hence, it is not meaningful to estimate savings assuming drug prices remain constant.",2,2074,2021-09-13-T-141-S-02074
2021-09-13-T-141,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Over the past few months, we have achieved an average price reduction of 30% and over 60% for some drugs.

For example, IMH will review staffing schedules and clinical operations including calling of patients prior to their appointment to check for any last-minute cancellations so that other patients’ appointments could be brought forward. IMH also conducts triaging of the conditions of referred patients via phone calls and suitable patients are offered therapy with psychologists over teleconference platforms. Non-urgent cases are referred to primary and community-based care to enable specialist services to focus on more urgent and complex cases.",3,2081,2021-09-13-T-143-S-02081
