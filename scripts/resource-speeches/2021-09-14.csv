2021-09-14-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Amongst these COVID-19 paediatric cases in Singapore, 13.6% or 50 cases were aged zero to one, 22.6% or 83 cases were aged two to four, 20.7% or 76 cases were aged five to six and 43.1% or 158 cases were aged seven to 12.",2,6,2021-09-14-T-001-S-00006
2021-09-14-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Global data show that a very low proportion of COVID-19 infected children experience a severe illness, as compared to adults. The percentage of infected children who experience severe illness and require intensive care is 0.7% in Israel, 0.3% in the Republic of Korea and 0.6% in France. There is evidence suggesting that children with underlying medical conditions, such as genetic, neurologic, metabolic conditions, medical complexity, congenital heart disease, obesity, diabetes, asthma, chronic lung disease, sickle cell disease, or immunosuppression might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.",3,7,2021-09-14-T-001-S-00007
2021-09-14-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Fortunately, in Singapore, no child thus far has developed severe illness requiring oxygen supplementation or ICU care. So, the percentage of infected children that experience severe illness in Singapore is zero. We are, however, mindful that the number of cases in the community is rising and there may be more children infected with COVID-19 in the future. We will ensure that these children receive appropriate care, if their illness is more severe.",4,8,2021-09-14-T-001-S-00008
2021-09-14-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"There are things parents can do to minimise the risk of their children getting infected or developing severe illnesses. All family members should maintain good hygiene and keep their home clean. When out, keep your masks on and cut back on social activities where masks are off or the interactions are prolonged, because such interactions account for the large majority of infections. When unwell, do a self-test or see a doctor immediately.",5,9,2021-09-14-T-001-S-00009
2021-09-14-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"These effective safe management and surveillance have been implemented to further keep our children safe, particularly in large settings where children congregate, such as preschools and schools. These include mask-wearing, limiting the group size, personal hygiene and requiring those children with a higher risk to take leave of absence. Family members should also get vaccinated to reduce the risks of being infected and transmitting COVID-19 to the child.",6,10,2021-09-14-T-001-S-00010

2021-09-14-T-001,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Sir, as background, a number of Clementi parents have reached out, sharing about their worries for their young children, children who are too young to be vaccinated, parents who are watching the case numbers in the community go up. Some parents have been watching what has happened overseas in some other countries  long COVID as well as the Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome in children reported in some countries where COVID-19 is widespread; some parents also look at what happens in some advanced economies —",2,15,2021-09-14-T-001-S-00015

2021-09-14-T-001,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"Yes, Sir. Let me ask the two supplementary questions. First, can the Minister share whether there have been any cases of Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome documented so far in Singapore among our paediatric COVID-19 patients?",1,17,2021-09-14-T-001-S-00017
2021-09-14-T-001,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"Secondly, given the very different experience of paediatric patients across some countries in the West, for example, in the US, there is an NBC news report on 14 August that stated ""North Texas runs out of pediatric ICU beds amidst COVID surge"", but at the same time, the British Medical Journal on 16 August mentioned that the UK experience is not as serious as what has happened in the US. So, can the Senior Minister of State also share, given the different experience on both sides of the Atlantic, what lessons can we learn from studying other countries' battles with COVID-19 to safeguard and support our children?",2,18,2021-09-14-T-001-S-00018
2021-09-14-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I thank the Member for the questions. The short answer to the first question is no. There are no paediatric cases, such as what he has described. As for the different experience overseas, indeed, the lessons learnt are something that our various expert committees and professionals in various disciplines are looking at very, very closely.",1,19,2021-09-14-T-001-S-00019
2021-09-14-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"There are a lot of lessons to be learnt but if I could summarise a few things. Our context matters. So, when we take these lessons from overseas, how they are applied here will depend, for example, on the baseline health of our population, whether it is child or adult; on access to care, and we are very fortunate that within the confines of our city, tertiary medical care is a very short distance away; on the general level of hygiene; and also, on the ability for our population to comply with various procedures or requirements, whether medical or social.",2,20,2021-09-14-T-001-S-00020
2021-09-14-T-001,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"So, context is everything and the baseline health of our population is also very, very important. We cannot just simply take the raw numbers or the raw experience from overseas and expect that exactly the same thing will happen here in Singapore. But we must learn the lessons of their experience, often hard-won, so that we can better protect our population here.",3,21,2021-09-14-T-001-S-00021

2021-09-14-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,asked the Minister for Health in light of reduced vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 variants that is of concern in other countries whether the Ministry will (i) review the speed of relaxation of measures and the opening up of borders (ii) consider the requirement for booster shots and (iii) share what are the long-term outlook and healthcare plans for an COVID-19 endemic Singapore.,1,30,2021-09-14-T-002-S-00030
2021-09-14-T-002,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry will consider subsidising regular Antigen Rapid Tests (ART) for those who are unable to take the current slate of vaccines due to medical or health reasons; and (b) what proportion of the population needs to be vaccinated before it will be possible for those who are not vaccinated due to legitimate reasons to be able to enjoy the same treatment as those who are fully vaccinated in more and higher exposure risk activities.,1,31,2021-09-14-T-002-S-00031
2021-09-14-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak,asked the Minister for Health when the COVID-19 vaccination rate of 80% is reached by September 2021 (a) what is the Ministry's plan to wind down the vaccination centres islandwide; and (b) whether there will be permanent vaccination centres and associated facilities should future booster doses be required.,1,32,2021-09-14-T-002-S-00032

2021-09-14-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, we have been experiencing an exponentially rising wave of infections in the community since 23 August. To curb the spread of infection in previous waves, we implemented circuit breaker and Heightened Alert measures, which significantly suppressed the rise of infections. The measures worked. But they were painful. They were painful to many families, workers and businesses. It is also not a sustainable way to battle the virus for the long term.",2,43,2021-09-14-T-002-S-00043

2021-09-14-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"At this point let me address Assoc Prof Jamus Lim’s question on delays in our vaccination programme. Our vaccination programme has not been slow at all. We were one of the earliest countries to secure vaccine supplies, with the first shipments of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines arriving in mid-December 2020, one of the fastest to roll out a vaccination programme, and we now have achieved a vaccination coverage that is one of the highest in the world.

I can understand the desire for transparent and pre-determined criteria. This is of great interest to all of us. But other than vaccination rates, we also need to consider case numbers, the transmission trajectory, our social behaviour in adherence to the Safe Management Measurements (SMMs) and the status of the testing regimes. So, while we have achieved our vaccination target of 80%, taking all this into account, we have decided to pause the transition plan, given the rising number of cases currently.

First, at what stage is HSA at in providing full approval to the vaccines eventually? And, under those circumstances with an expected booster regime in the works, will the Government then consider making boosters and vaccination compulsory? This is to address the concerns I raised in relation to Question No 6.",1,66,2021-09-14-T-002-S-00066

We also need to then look at our context and I imagine the Member is referring to what has happened in the US, where there has been that consideration. Our context is different. Our vaccine rates are much higher, the acceptance by our population of vaccinations has also been very different. So, well, we will look at the matter, but I think, at the moment, there is no full approval anytime soon. We will study the matter when it arises.",2,69,2021-09-14-T-002-S-00069

The first layer of defence is our integration into the international network, where variants of interest and variants of concern, the markers for that are shared through a network of professionals. The second layer of defence is our clinical staff on the ground. You have a patient in front of you and you have to make the assumption that maybe this might be COVID-19, maybe I need to send a test for this. That then allows us to activate our third layer of defence, which is laboratory surveillance when specimens are submitted, to then look for the analyses that will tell us whether it is COVID-19 and, if so, whether it is a new variant or it is a strain that we are already familiar with.",3,70,2021-09-14-T-002-S-00070

He has touched on the importance of the testing regime.

You have ART, PCR test, Rostered Regular Testing and so forth. All of these require a certain personal responsibility for an individual. They have to conduct the tests properly. They have to adhere to instructions when they are given, but we do not rely only on that. So, we have a web of processes, an ecosystem of processes. There is room in there for people to not perhaps execute some of this properly, but there is also plenty of room for people to exercise diligence and personal responsibility; and each of us then can play a part in terms of protecting ourselves, our family and our entire country.",2,75,2021-09-14-T-002-S-00075

Ultimately, it is that destination which is of importance and will protect us. At the beginning of the vaccination rollout, our pace was constrained by the supply that was made available to us from the manufacturers.

2021-09-14-T-002,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second supplementary question is, the Senior Minister of State, if I heard him correctly, replied that the Government is extending free ART testing to certain groups of employees at the workplace. Does the Government have a position on testing-related subsidies for Singaporeans who cannot take the vaccine for medical reasons and not just in workplace settings? I understand that we have got free ART kits that are being delivered to Singaporeans, but for elderly Singaporeans who still cannot take the vaccine for medical reasons or thereafter, are there going to be some subsidies for them, for additional ART kits, for example?",2,83,2021-09-14-T-002-S-00083
2021-09-14-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, the issue of not being able to take for medical reasons, unfortunately, is not an absolute cut and dry, because some of it is a continued assessment. For example, you are waiting for your chemotherapy to be completed, or as you recover from the surgery and so forth. So, it is not a fixed number. We will pay very close attention to it. It is a small number, relatively speaking.",1,84,2021-09-14-T-002-S-00084
2021-09-14-T-002,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"For the second question, individuals who are unable to take the vaccine for medical reasons have some degree of vulnerability. So, perhaps, they may need to be careful about their exposure to the wider community, because the issue of testing is not going to protect them from the vulnerability they have as a result of their medical condition. So, it is not quite the same as the circumstances where you have someone who, for some reason, is allergic to the vaccine and then cannot complete a vaccination regimen, but would like to then go out and work and is otherwise healthy, and this is the situation in which we are then providing subsidies for the ART kits.",2,85,2021-09-14-T-002-S-00085

2021-09-14-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"The tripartite partners' approach to enhancing workplace fairness has been a successful journey. Compared to the year 2006, when the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) was first formed, the HR practices of firms have improved significantly. This was the right approach. Rather than rush to legislate, the tripartite partners recognised that education to cultivate the right workplace norms and values was the foremost and more fundamental task. We did not want the process to become legalistic or confrontational. It is better if disputes can be resolved amicably.",2,95,2021-09-14-T-003-S-00095

2021-09-14-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Today, we have a set of Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices, which is familiar and well-accepted by employers and workers alike. The vast majority of employers comply with the Guidelines. If there is a complaint, TAFEP uses these Guidelines to evaluate and advise the parties concerned. About two-thirds of reported cases are not substantiated. The majority are misunderstandings which are clarified and where both parties do not pursue the matter further.",4,97,2021-09-14-T-003-S-00097
2021-09-14-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Where TAFEP finds gaps in the employer's HR practices, TAFEP would counsel the employer. Most employers accept and make amends. Very rarely does the employer dispute the assessment and refuse to correct their actions. In cases where discrimination is substantiated, TAFEP would refer the employer to MOM, which can restrict it from hiring foreign workers. Therefore, the process of mediation is, in itself, an opportunity for employers and employees to close the gaps in their understanding of the requirements. We will continue to maintain the strong emphasis on mediation even as we strengthen the legislation.",5,98,2021-09-14-T-003-S-00098

Over the last three years, about one in seven reported cases each year fell into this category.

2021-09-14-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"For workers, the remedies could give them direct redress, rather than indirectly through enforcement action against the employer. For example, such redress is available for wrongful dismissals today. Employees can claim for compensation or for reinstatement to their former employment. For employers, curtailment of their work pass privileges, which has a significant impact on their overall business operations, can, in some cases, be disproportionate to the breach. Even if there is some mitigating factor, there are no alternative penalties that could provide for a more calibrated approach. Legislation will also send a strong signal that society does not condone discrimination at the workplace and further entrench the fair employment standards that we have built up over the years.",9,102,2021-09-14-T-003-S-00102

2021-09-14-T-004,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"First, Mr Speaker, can MOM share whether MOM will consider requiring the gig platforms to report instances of injuries, when the worker is injured in the course of their gig economy work? Although the fatalities are documented, as in the Minister's answer, for every fatality, there may have been a serious injury, a near-miss, some time before. This data would be useful.",2,130,2021-09-14-T-004-S-00130
2021-09-14-T-004,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"The second question pertains to the workers who have lost their lives in the course of doing their gig economy work, as the Minister mentioned in his answer earlier. Does the Ministry have information on what compensation and support were provided to the families of these workers, who lost their lives? And was that support comparable to similar accidents taking place in delivery firms where the worker had an employee relationship with the employer?",3,131,2021-09-14-T-004-S-00131
2021-09-14-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Sir, I thank the Member for his two questions. Indeed, workplace injuries and the kind of compensation that gig workers may need to have are something that we will ask the committee to study further, relating to workplace injury compensation, for example. This is something which, today, under the Employment Act, other employees would have enjoyed. So, I think this is a serious issue, because these drivers do go around many places, sometimes many trips a day as well. They are constantly exposed to the risk on the road. Looking at how we can actually better protect them from workplace injuries and also compensation would be something that the committee would want to deliberate on.",1,132,2021-09-14-T-004-S-00132
2021-09-14-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"On the second question, of those cases of fatality as a result of gig work, whether they do enjoy the same level of compensation, I am afraid I do not have information for that. Suffice to say that, today, they are not treated as employees. So, I would imagine the amount of compensation, if there is, would not be commensurate with what employees would probably get under the Employment Act as well.",2,133,2021-09-14-T-004-S-00133
2021-09-14-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"So, again, these are issues that we will want to study further with the committee and in engagement with the platform companies as well, to see how they can also continue to function as a good employer, to be able to make their business sustainable, while ensuring a safer place but also attracting good workers to continue with them for the longer term.",3,134,2021-09-14-T-004-S-00134

The Prime Minister has announced that Workfare spending is expected to increase to $1.1 billion by 2023. This is a clear commitment that Workfare will continue to be a foundation of our policy response. The Government will release more details next year.,3,154,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00154

However, it recognised that there was a case for wage growth of lower-wage workers to outpace productivity. This is because the productivity of frontline workers is not due solely to the industriousness of the worker, but it is also dependent on the firm’s operations and methods of work. The Workgroup also recommended that for the next decade, the wages of our lower-wage workers should continue to grow faster than the median, or what we call the ""median-plus"" approach. However, when wages at the 20th percentile have gained sufficiently on median wage levels, this would no longer be necessary.

This is a policy that our businesses are already familiar with. The Workgroup studied this carefully and decided to leverage on the LQS to broaden our coverage of Progressive Wages. From September next year, firms hiring foreign workers will have to pay all local workers the LQS. This builds upon regular increases in the LQS level over the years, such as from $1,000 in 2016 to $1,400 in 2020.",16,167,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00167

But I would also like to take the opportunity to highlight that in 2020, many of our lower-wage workers were also impacted by the economic impact of COVID-19 and faced reduced work-hours and allowances. These employees work in a wide range of industries, from Food Services to Administrative and Support Services, and occupy a diverse range of jobs, from cleaners to office clerks to shop sales assistants, and we can imagine the impact of COVID-19 on these jobs in the last year or year plus. This was also why the Government provided special support of $3,000 to this segment of workers through the Workfare Special Payment and other social support schemes.",17,168,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00168

The vast majority of these businesses are very small, hiring fewer than 10 workers and include small family operations, such as hawker stalls and heartland shops. We are all familiar with these microbusinesses; they are familiar faces in our neighbourhoods and typically having family members who are spouses, children or relatives helping out. They do not have the business scale or reach, and we are mindful that sudden wage shifts to these microbusinesses can result in business failure. So, the last thing we want is for job losses for these family businesses.",19,170,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00170

The initial period beyond its introduction will be a run-in period, for which MOM will focus on educating employers on the various Progressive Wage and LQS requirements that they will need to adhere to.

The public sector will take the lead and require its suppliers to obtain the Mark.

In the Food Services and Retail sectors, where there are many firms competing and barriers to entry are not high, firms will be expected to think carefully about cost increases. It is also fair to say that we have to expect some degree of cost increase to accommodate higher salaries for our lower-wage workers.

I understand the need for LQS and the intent to uplift the wages of lower-wage workers. The Senior Minister of State did talk about the need for PWMs to complement that. I am concerned, however, and I am asking the Senior Minister of State how do we ensure that LQS does not become the maximum wage for lower-wage workers in companies that hire foreign workers.",1,191,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00191

In fact, as I have shared earlier, the main driver of wage growth in the next decade or so will really be your PWMs. It has been heartening to see how employers have come on board despite the last one year being a challenging year with COVID-19. And if you look at the PWMs that were renewed for the next six, eight years, you will see in the cleaning and landscape sectors how employers have supported us through this and grown the wage ladders at a pace that is faster than the median, in what we call the median-plus approach. If you look at the end state in 2028, where cleaning and landscape sectors will end up at about $2,400 per month, and moving on to, say, lift-and-escalator PWMs, too, going up to $3,000 a month. These are ways in which we support them and these will drive market forces, too.",1,192,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00192
2021-09-14-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Speaking to employers, I know some are also concerned that if a cleaner, for example, earns $2,400 a month in 2028, then the rest in the firm will also seek to ask, ""Why not the tea lady?"" and the tea lady asking ""Why am I not earning the same as a cleaner?"" and administrators, for example, doing so. So, these are areas in which I think will be game changers in the years ahead. But at the same time, the concern of some parts of society is whether this will also increase costs for businesses. So, that is also the other part where we will see how to balance this.",2,193,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00193

Most workers today who are in firms hiring foreign workers are already paid beyond LQS. We are down to the last 5% of workers and, actually, would have been much less, but the numbers were because of last year when we were down with the COVID-19 pandemic. So, we have seen many of them having their income drop. This is where we think, in the long term, this PWM will help them over time and in a sustainable manner because the employers are all on board with us on this.",3,194,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00194

2021-09-14-T-005,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"Last question  the Senior Minister of State mentioned that over the years 2009 to 2019, the real wage growth of the lowest quintile outperformed those of the highest. If we look at only wage growth, it does not include other incomes like investment income or rental income. So, this does not quite give us the full picture of how inequality is changing. Does MOM track similar data but in terms of total income?",3,200,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00200

So, it is a minority left  23% out of your 103,000 full-time employees. So, it is about 20%, or 20,000 or thereabouts. And as I have shared, with progressive wages, you will end up, hopefully, covering up to 94% of our lower-wage workers. You will see the long-term impact in terms of how their wages will grow over time.",1,201,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00201

Like I have shared, in heartland shops, they are people you are very familiar with and the last thing you want is to have them collapse in the short term because they do not have the scale. And many of them are uncles and aunties running stalls and I am not even sure whether the uncle pays the auntie full wages. But these are areas in which I think we have to correct over time, but you do not want to collapse them in the short term. So, this is something we are very mindful not to disrupt the whole system in such a way.",2,202,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00202

We also give you half a count for DRC if you employ at least half of the LQS rate, that is, $700 a month for part-timers. So, this is one way in which we still maintain the current system but, at the same time, provide some flexibility for part-time workers, for many of our employees. That one, employers do not have to worry too much because they are familiar with the system and the part-time mechanism still continues. It is just that we now set a $9 rate per hour for part-time workers.",3,203,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00203

With regard to firms' level of productivity, are there actually specific plans to ensure that firm-level productivity support dovetails with worker upskilling and not as two separate activities? The second supplementary question is with regard to LQS. Can the Ministry consider a predictable timeline for future adjustments so that employers can make reasonable financial projections, especially when they are entering or pricing fixed-price term tenders?",1,205,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00205

2021-09-14-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Two things  one, let me just start with the LQS. I think I have shared earlier that the Government's approach is that we will start with reaching out to firms and getting them familiar with this new LQS requirement. With this change, I think it affects many of our businesses, so it is important that we give them time to run in. Rest assured that while the LQS requirement may have kicked in, we are going to work on advising and seeing how we can get companies to comply rather than enforcement straightaway. That is why we have also given the announcement and heads up now, so that firms will be ready by 1 September next year to implement the new LQS approach.",2,207,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00207
2021-09-14-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"It will be a light touch up front. But I am quite sure firms are already quite familiar with this LQS mechanism. That is why this was an ideal framework to leverage on, because it is not something new that firms have not complied with in the past. It is just that the framework has been modified and tweaked.",3,208,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00208
2021-09-14-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"On the second question on firm level productivity and workers' productivity, that is a very good question. To some extent, the narrative with many of our firms today and the approach so far with PWM has been that workers have to upskill and improve productivity. Therefore, they have to justify productivity gains against wage gains. But moving forward, we also have to think about productivity gains very differently, too. There is the worker level productivity as you train and upskill him, but there is also that level of productivity leap that you can get when firms make the effort to transform, do job redesigns.",4,209,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00209
2021-09-14-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"I will give an example. Like the securities sector, for example, when you think of a security guard in the old days, you think of a ""jaga"" at the gate. If you just train him that way, there is only so much productivity you can gain with him as a jaga at the gate. But I have to commend the security sector. Through PWM and working with the unions in the sector, I am quite heartened today that they are using CCTVs, technologies, and you see, suddenly, the firm level productivity jumps. Therefore, if you look at the wage levels of our security officers, they have also jumped in the last five years. Therefore, that justifies productivity, not just at the worker level, but because businesses also push on with the transformation.",5,210,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00210
2021-09-14-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"I think if you look at many other sectors, including cleaning and landscape, we are seeing them make those changes, making efforts towards job redesign and transformation. That is also why firms were agreeable to the wage increases that we have seen in terms of the wage ladders in the years ahead. Because they also bear in mind how contracts will be in the near future and how we are moving towards outcome-based contracting.",6,211,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00211

It exists to ensure firms do not hire phantom local workers to meet the DRC for the purpose of hiring foreign workers. So, it is merely a coincidence that the LQS of $1,400 is similar to the average household expenditure on basic needs (AHEBN) for the bottom 20% of income earners. As such, would it not be better to peg the minimum wage to the AHEBN instead of the LQS? This will allow the minimum wage to rise in tandem with cost increases so that the low-wage workers will not lose out over time.",1,215,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00215
2021-09-14-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"To answer the Member's question, maybe it is by coincidence that the numbers are looking the same. But as I have shared, we have adjusted it four times in the last five years, from $1,000 in 2016 to $1,400 in 2020. Maybe it is by coincidence, or not. But it has been adjusted because we have got various wage benchmarks that we work on.",1,216,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00216
2021-09-14-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"The main goal of the LQS was also to ensure that Singaporeans' wages were not depressed as we hire foreign workers. Therefore, as we hire foreign workers using a Singaporean for the quota, we did not want the Singaporean worker to be left out and be depressed because you, typically, would have access to cheaper foreign labour out there. Of course, we have other obligations made on the employer, such as taking care of the worker, giving him food if he is in a dormitory and so forth, and medical expenses. But overall, I think, net-net, the objective was not to have Singaporeans lose out, as firms access foreign workers.",2,217,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00217

2021-09-14-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"This enables us to make a differentiation, but the overall concept still applies, whereby as you hire foreign workers in your firm, you want to ensure that not just those that are being counted have a fair wage, but every Singaporean worker in your firm has a fair wage too.",4,219,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00219
2021-09-14-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"On balance, maybe, perhaps, it is coincidental, but the wage levels for the LQS have been adjusted over time to ensure that we meet certain benchmarks that we manage and it has been a fair one.",5,220,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00220
2021-09-14-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"We also have to manage over time and that is why we also take guidance for our Progressive Wages from the National Wages Council moving forward as well, largely because we want to make sure that it is sustainable and not open to political auction. The last thing you want is to have a political auction on what the wage level should be. But let us pick a fair one, where a committee looks at available data projections and see what is sustainable, and the impact to inflation because that too, is a concern for many Singaporeans – cost of living over time.",6,221,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00221

2021-09-14-T-005,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"I thank the Member for the question. The short answer is that, as I have shared, the Government is studying the transition support that we will provide employers for wage increases in the next few years. One, we understand there will be some firms who are locked into contracts. Secondly, we are also recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and, therefore, firms do need time to recover and the transition support will, hopefully, help them in the short term as we balance the needs of our low-wage workers, as well as the businesses which need to recover and still cover these additional salaries.",1,225,2021-09-14-T-005-S-00225

For cleaning, security and landscape, for example, these are also contracts that run three to five years ahead. Therefore, we announce it today for a new PWM ladder that starts in 2023, for example. This is one way in which we help firms prepare and we give them advance notice. The sector also understands this, that we, typically, give them advance headway to do this.

Information on floods and road closures is communicated to the public promptly through radio broadcasts, news media, myENV Mobile App, PUB Facebook and Twitter, as well as LTA’s Expressway Monitoring Advisory System. SMS alerts are also sent to those who have registered to receive flood warnings.",3,241,2021-09-14-T-007-S-00241

In most cases, for major roadworks, such as for MRT stations, there has been close coordination of the work that is progressing and also the preventive measures that are being taken.

As an example, the remote sentencing of Punithan Genasan where he was handed the death penalty via Zoom in May 2020 was understandable at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Third, Mr Zhulkarnain asked whether there can be a fast track for the case management of paper hearings.

2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Fourth, Mr Zhulkarnain asked about paper hearings in criminal proceedings.

2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),Mr Louis Ng asked a number of questions.,39,342,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00342
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"One, on the scope of the Court's powers to order parties to attempt amicable resolution. An attempt at amicable resolution may be appropriate where strict legal remedies may not necessarily address the underlying concerns and interests of parties or where litigation is not cost effective.",40,343,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00343
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Second, where parties have gone through formal processes, such as mediation, neutral evaluation, settlement negotiations with exchange of draft settlement agreements, these are all likely to constitute clear attempts at amicable resolution.",41,344,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00344
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Third, Mr Louis Ng asked how the Court will ensure that parties will make good faith attempts at amicable resolution and what would be the consequences of non-compliance with the Court's direction to attempt such amicable resolution. Mr Desmond Choo also sought clarification on whether the Court will consider the intentions of the parties before exercising the powers.",42,345,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00345
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"The short answer to Mr Louis Ng's question is that it is not easy to ensure good faith negotiations. But in deciding whether to order parties to attempt amicable resolution, the Courts will take into account all the facts before them, including whether any of the parties have refused to attempt to resolve the dispute by amicable resolution, and why. Where necessary, the Courts may require the parties or their counsel to explain why the matter cannot be settled amicably.",43,346,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00346
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mr Louis Ng asked whether Registrars will be required to undergo training in mediation and other alternative dispute resolution processes (ADR), and whether there will be a minimum requirement that must be met and who the Court-appointed mediators will be.",44,347,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00347
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"In the State Courts, mediation may be conducted by specially-trained District Judges or Court Volunteer Mediators.

2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Lastly, on Mr Louis Ng's question on how MinLaw supports the growth of private mediation service providers, MinLaw's role is to ensure a conducive environment for our dispute resolution ecosystem to thrive. We work closely with mediation service providers, such as Singapore Mediation Centre (SMC), Singapore International Mediation Centre (SIMC) and so on, to ensure that their service offerings address the different user needs and complement the Court-based dispute resolution mechanisms.",49,352,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00352

2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim asked about security for costs in the context of an application for freestanding interim relief.

2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mr Zhulkarnain sought clarification regarding the Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC)'s jurisdiction. He asked when the action, and the counterclaim taken as a whole, would still maintain an international and commercial character. The assessment cannot be a purely quantitative one. The Court will have to consider all the relevant facts and circumstances, assess whether the counterclaim, third-party proceedings change the nature or substance of the action in such a way that the action, seen as a whole, no longer maintains an international or commercial nature.",53,356,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00356
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mr Zhulkarnain also asked about the consolidation of proceedings under SICC and whether similar considerations would apply if one proceeding is in a different Court from SICC. The consolidation of proceedings under SICC may require different considerations, as parties would have already commenced separate proceedings. If proceedings are not before the same Court, but a party believes that an application for consolidation is necessary, then a transfer application should be taken out to bring the proceedings before the same Court, before applying for any consolidation.",54,357,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00357
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mr Zhulkarnain also pointed out the joinder of a non-consenting party to SICC proceedings, and spoke about the enforcement of an SICC judgment in a foreign jurisdiction. It is possible for a party to be joined to existing proceedings before SICC without that party's consent; just like it is possible for a party to be joined to existing proceedings before the High Court or the State Courts without that party's consent. There are rules on how that takes place. But, of course, the requirements for proper service on that party will still apply.",55,358,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00358

2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"As with any judgment of the General Division of the High Court, an SICC judgment is likely to be enforceable in major commercial jurisdiction and many other regional ones.

2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mr Pritam Singh, Ms Shahira Abdullah, Mr Zhulkarnain and Mr Murali Pillai have raised a number of queries regarding the Attorney-General (AG)'s right to intervene. Let me make some broad points before addressing the specific queries.",58,361,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00361
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"First, as my colleague Minister Edwin Tong mentioned in Parliament yesterday, the statutory framework is based on the established role of the AG. He is the Guardian of the public interest. This has been recognised by our Courts as well as by Members who have spoken on this Bill and previously. The proposed amendments are consistent with that principle.",59,362,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00362
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"The Court of Appeal, for example, has noted that the AG intervenes on a non-partisan basis. He is disinterested in the interests of the parties to the litigation. The issues that he raises most logically, must have a discernible impact beyond the specific parties and the specific dispute before the Court.",60,363,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00363
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Second, it is important to understand the context in which this proposal arises. Let us say you have a civil case between two parties. Prima facie, nothing to do with the state, or the public. But in the course of the dispute or from the pleadings, or in the course of the arguments, issues arise which, potentially, are detrimental to the public interest.",61,364,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00364
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"For example, the AG has intervened on the applicable legal test for negligence in relation to the provision of medical advice, in the case of Hii Chii Kok v Ooi Peng Jin, between two parties. But the test that is laid out by the Courts on what amounts to negligence will impact on future claims on the basis of medical negligence. So, it will impact both patients and doctors, and they cannot come forward and intervene in this case. The only party who can do so in the public interest is the AG. So, this relates to the provision of medical advice.",62,365,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00365
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"To take another example, the AG has intervened on the nature and scope of professional and ethical duties. For example, in Deepak Sharma v Law Society of Singapore, on what duties are owed by lawyers in making claims for costs. In such cases, it is sensible, obvious, that the AG must have a right to intervene, to protect the public interest and put forward arguments. Ultimately, of course, it is up to the Courts to decide on the validity of the arguments.",63,366,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00366
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"So, the amendments provide for the right of the AG to intervene for that purpose but, ultimately, the Court decides on the merits of the substantive case. The AG's presence assists the Court and also informs the Court of the possible broader implications on the public interest.",64,367,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00367
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Third, the AG's application to intervene is only an intermediate step in the dispute. Broadly, there is a two-stage process. At the first stage, the Court will check to ensure that the AG has set out adequate details, the basis, grounds for his request to be added as a party. Only if the Court is satisfied that the AG has explained the reasons for his intervention sufficiently, then the Court will grant permission for the AG to intervene. Of course, that is prima facie.",65,368,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00368
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"If anyone wishes to oppose the AG's intervention, then they may apply to set aside the Court's permission.",66,369,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00369
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"This brings us to the second stage, which will involve the AG and the other parties, because the first stage is ex parte. At this stage, the parties can raise any concerns they might have about the AG's addition to the proceedings. If any party objects to the intervention, the Court will assess whether the permission that has been granted to the AG should now be reversed.",67,370,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00370
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"The Court's assessment will be made based on the interests of justice. It can take into account and balance various considerations, including the possible inconvenience, costs to a party, if AG is added; and the potential benefits if AG is allowed to join the proceedings, to add his perspectives on the matter.",68,371,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00371
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Any Court will proceed on the basis that the AG is a Guardian of the public interest, and if he comes to Court and says there is an important matter of public interest here, it is, generally, not assumed that the AG is being frivolous. There must be a serious point and it is a matter of public interest. When someone comes in, particularly the AG, to put forward the arguments, the Court knows that it will be of tremendous assistance to the Court. Ultimately, how it decides is for the Court, but the Court gets tremendous assistance from the AG.",69,372,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00372
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mr Pritam Singh asked if this is a shift in the common law position. He has asked why not we just stick with the existing position, why do we need a new framework. The common law position does allow AG to intervene. For example, in the case of ARW v Comptroller of Income Tax, the Appellant was a private company, which applied for specific discovery of internal documents belonging to IRAS. So, this is a taxpayer, I believe, who sought documents from IRAS, but it goes beyond that to a broader principle of when you can apply for documents against a Government agency. Whether it should be allowed or it should not be allowed is a matter for the Court. Whether such a principle should apply to all public departments in the context of a private civil dispute, albeit against IRAS, is a matter of public interest. The AG should be entitled to put forward his position why it is or it is not in the public interest to make a particular order. And that is for the Courts to decide.",70,373,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00373
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"So, the AG applied to intervene to make representations on the issue of public interest privilege under the Evidence Act. Application for intervention was filed in the High Court. The company resisted the application. There was dispute on the addition of the AG to the proceedings. It was resolved by the Court of Appeal 20 months later.",71,374,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00374
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"The Court of Appeal allowed the AG to intervene, affirmed the AG's position as Guardian of public interest and it further held that if the AG does not intervene despite taking the view that there are issues of the public interest, then the AG would, in fact, be in dereliction of his public duty.",72,375,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00375
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"All that is good, but 20 months have been lost. Taking into account what the Court of Appeal had said and the fact that you do not want these things to be unnecessarily delayed, I will say this to Members. As in the cases cited, parties to civil litigation are often seeking to interpret the rules in their own favour. If they succeed, sometimes, it is the man in the street who will pay the bill, ultimately, if it is against the public interest. The AG is intervening to protect the man in the street – the common man.",73,376,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00376

2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"As I have said, the addition of AG to the proceedings is a procedural step. It does not mean that either of the original parties has somehow ""lost"" or ""won"" the original lawsuit, though I can understand, they may not like what the AG is going to say. In that sense, they would prefer if the AG is not present, but that is not the way hearings and arguments should go.",75,378,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00378
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mr Pritam Singh has cited various statutes which expressly provide for the AG's right to intervene  Charities Act, Industrial Relations Act. And he is right. In those pieces of legislation, the AG has an unqualified entitlement to intervene in the specified categories of proceedings. It is broadly similar principles, but unqualified. Here, the proposal is that even the addition itself, the parties can oppose if they wish; then, the Court has got to decide after hearing both sides.",76,379,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00379
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Let me now turn to some of the specific queries. Mr Murali Pillai had a suggestion that the AG's role as Guardian of the public interest be codified in the Constitution. As mentioned, the AG's role as Guardian of the public interest has been affirmed by the Court of Appeal in a number of cases. It has also been recognised by this House yesterday by Mr Murali Pillai and Mr Pritam Singh. My Ministry will study this suggestion whether we should put it in the Constitution the AG's established role in this respect, taking into account how this area of law and the jurisprudence develop.",77,380,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00380
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),Mr Pritam Singh asked if the amendments are intended as a contingency or whether there are new areas of public interest that the Government is concerned about.,78,381,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00381
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"I am not sure what Mr Pritam Singh is concerned about; or that we always think ahead and are planning something else that he is concerned about. The short answer is, the amendments say what they say on the face of it. They are meant to lend clarity to the procedure for the AG to intervene and to minimise satellite litigation and delays. But it is not going to be possible to predict how other areas of laws in which such interventions may be required in the future, might take place. And what questions of public interest may arise, will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.",79,382,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00382
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),Mr Zhulkarnain also asked whether there will still be a need for AG to intervene if a party to the proceedings can put forth an opposing view to the Court.,80,383,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00383
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"The AG's role is not to put forward supporting or opposing views but to represent the public interest and what, in his view, is best stated in terms of the public interest, whereas the views of parties to the proceedings will obviously be influenced by their respective interests. And, sometimes, there cannot be a substitute for the non-partisan views of the AG. The parties to a civil litigation are not there to advance public interest. They are there to advance or forward their own case. Sometimes, it is necessary that somebody else is there to protect the public interest.",81,384,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00384
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mr Zhulkarnain also asked whether the Court can instead invite the AG to make submissions as an independent counsel under the Legal Profession Act. The role of an independent counsel is to address the Court on specific issues of law, at the invitation of the Court. Whereas the AG's submissions on issues of public interest may well go beyond specific issues of law. Unlike an independent counsel, the AG will be deemed a party to the proceedings if he is added on. And when he intervenes as Guardian of the public interest, like other parties, he will be able to make applications, file affidavits and will also have the right of appeal.",82,385,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00385
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mr Murali Pillai asked whether the AG has a duty of full and frank disclosure, since he will be making an ex parte application when applying for permission of the Court to intervene. The AG will have a duty to disclose properly his grounds for intervention to the Court.",83,386,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00386
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Dr Shahira asked who should bear the costs where the parties choose not to appeal the Court's decision but the AG decides to do so. These are properly matters for the Courts. The Courts, generally, understand that the AG does not act frivolously, vexatiously or egregiously in pursuing the public interest, but, ultimately, it is a matter of discretion for the Courts.",84,387,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00387
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mr Sharael Taha and Dr Shahira spoke in support of the terminology amendments. Laws must be clear and easy to understand. The new rules of Court will contain a clear list of definitions upfront. Dr Shahira had highlighted the differences in terminology amendments that will apply across the Courts and said that this might cause confusion. For the Family Justice Courts (FJC), the rules are being reviewed and will be revamped in due course. The terminology changes will be effected with the revamp and the majority of which are aligned with other Courts.",85,388,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00388
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"However, because of the unique nature of family proceedings, some terminology amendments will be specific to the FJC. For example, the terminology of parties in a divorce. The naming of parties as ""applicants"" and ""respondents"" is intended to avoid calling them ""claimants"" and ""defendants"". Calling someone a ""defendant"" sometimes could be seen as pejorative. So, this is really in line with FJC's move towards therapeutic justice.",86,389,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00389
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"For the Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC), the differences are relatively limited. They, generally, relate only to two items. These differences arise as a result of the differences in Court procedure in SICC and the General Division. The procedure in SICC is specifically tailored to facilitate international commercial litigation. We, therefore, do not think that this will give rise to confusion since the respective rules of Court will make clear the procedures that should be used.",87,390,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00390

2021-09-14-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister for addressing some aspects of the speech I made on this Bill. My fundamental interest was to try and understand whether the common law position would change with regard to the two-stage process.",1,394,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00394
2021-09-14-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I listened very carefully to Minister Edwin Tong's speech at the Second Reading and when Minister Edwin Tong went through the various clauses that pertain to Part 4 of the Bill, insofar as Part 4 section 4A(4) was concerned, it reads in the Explanatory Statement  ""In considering whether to grant permission to intervene, the Court need only be satisfied that the grounds for intervention are adequately set out in the affidavit. The Court is not to examine the merits of those grounds."" But the Minister added in his speech the words ""at that stage"", and my concerns about at what point the merits of the AG's arguments would be assessed by the Court is the subject matter of my query.",2,395,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00395
2021-09-14-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Let me go into the specific query. For example, at paragraph 56 of Deepak Sharma v Law Society of Singapore, the Court of Appeal noted that if the Court takes the view that the issues that the AG raised do not pertain to the public interest, it is open to the Court to refuse a cost order in favour of the AG, even if the AG considers his intervention and submissions were warranted in the public interest.",3,396,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00396
2021-09-14-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Although this point pertains to costs and not the subject of an order to set aside the order for the AG to intervene as envisaged by clause 488, is it not incongruous for the Court to consider the public interest rationale for the AG's grounds for intervention at one stage of the proceedings, but not at the point of application of leave to intervene as it is the case under the common law today?",4,397,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00397
2021-09-14-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"There is an expectation that you can assess the public interest grounds when you look at costs but, earlier on, for example, an opposing party applies to intervene to challenge the entry of the AG, the Court cannot look into the merits of public interest grounds. So, my suggestion, number one, is that, is that not incongruous?",5,398,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00398
2021-09-14-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To further this point, and I agree with the Minister, AG is to act in a non-partisan way and that is the expectation and it is important that we record that in the Hansard. But in Deepak Sharma v Law Society of Singapore, the Court of Appeal also notes the prospect of an adverse Court order against the AG. And it is actively contemplated, albeit exceptionally.",6,399,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00399
2021-09-14-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"And there, the Court says, ""in cases where the AG has intervened with improper motives such as to deliberately advance the interests of one of the parties to litigation, that would take the AG out of his capacity as a non-partisan advocate of the public interest and into the shoes of a de facto party to the litigation.""",7,400,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00400
2021-09-14-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),This again aligns with the earlier question I had. If the prospect of an AG acting in a partisan manner can be contemplated at one stage of the proceedings – this is the determination of costs – would the Minister not agree that the Courts should be empowered to consider the public interest grounds at the point of the AG's intervention in proceedings?,8,401,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00401
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I think both questions actually come back to one  is it two stages? Is it one stage? Just to be clear, what is being done is nothing new. It is the standard process when there is an ex parte application. When there is an ex parte application, the Courts hear the party making the ex parte application. It has got to be prima facie. And if, on the face of it, it is completely clear that there is no basis, then they will throw it out. But when it moves on to the substantive hearing, these issues will arise in much greater detail. And that is when the Court then goes into it in-depth.",1,402,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00402
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But I think this is fairly standard, it happens all the time. For example, the parties can, as I have said, oppose the AG having been added. And they can raise a number of grounds for the AG having been added. After the AG has been added ex parte, the parties can oppose that procedure and the process. The Court will then consider if such an application is made. If the Court confirms that the AG has been rightly added, then the next step is to deal with the substantive issues, the point or principle that AG makes and how it impacts one or the other parties' arguments or the outcome itself.",2,403,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00403

2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Let me explain. When the ex parte application is made, the Court makes the order for the AG to be added but the parties can then subsequently say, that should not have been done.",1,406,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00406
2021-09-14-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"So, at the stage where the party says that should not have been done, what the Bill does is to confirm that the Court cannot look into the public interest ground in assessing that application. This is the nub of my concern.",1,407,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00407
2021-09-14-T-008,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"I am suggesting that, in view of the earlier point I made about costs, if the Courts can look into the substantive arguments later on, why not just allow them to do so earlier?",2,408,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00408
2021-09-14-T-008,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I think this simply takes from the principle, Mr Singh, and Members will accept, really, that the AG is a senior Legal Officer, the Guardian of the public interest. If he says that, ""I am saying this as a matter of public interest"", we do not want an extended argument, trying to delay proceedings by the parties, by saying whether there is or there is no public interest. It should be dealt with on the more substantive points.",1,409,2021-09-14-T-008-S-00409

2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),The Minister for Finance announced in his Ministerial Statement on 26 July this year that the Government would provide an additional two weeks of direct rental support for qualifying tenants and owner-occupiers of privately-owned commercial properties. This was because the tightened safe management measures under Phase Two (Heightened Alert) imposed a number of restrictions.,2,474,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00474

2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"There were two Phase Two (Heightened Alert) periods, 16 May to 13 June and 22 July to 18 August, both this year.",5,477,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00477
2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"During these periods, dining in was not allowed. Indoor mask-off activities were restricted. Operating capacity was decreased.

2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"The Government decided to support through the Rental Support Scheme, or RSS for short. The RSS is part of a broader suite of measures put in place to address the impact of Phase Two (Heightened Alert) measures. These include the Jobs Support Scheme and the various COVID-19 grants. In total, more than $2 billion has been set aside to cushion the business impact of Phase Two (Heightened Alert).",7,479,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00479
2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),Let me now explain the key features of the Bill.,8,480,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00480
2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Eligible tenants will receive from their landlords two weeks' waiver of gross rent, including service and maintenance charges.",9,481,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00481

2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"One, they must be an SME or a specified non-profit organisation with annual revenue of not more than $100 million.",11,483,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00483
2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Two, their tenancy must have been entered into before 20 July 2021 if it is a fresh lease; if it is a renewal, then renewed before 20 July 2021.",12,484,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00484
2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Three, their tenancy must be in force from 5 August to 18 August 2021 and they must have experienced at least a 20% drop in their average monthly revenue at the specific property during both the Phase Two (Heightened Alert) periods compared to the Phase Three period from 28 December 2020 to 7 May 2021. That is the reference period.",13,485,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00485
2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"This third criterion is an additional criterion. It is not required for the two RSS payouts from the Government. Those payouts include half a month of rent for the period of 14 May to 29 May 2021, which has been disbursed starting from 6 August and half a month of rent for the period of 22 July to 18 August 2021, which will be disbursed in October.",14,486,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00486
2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"If tenants meet the first two criteria, they will receive a Notice of Rental Waiver automatically from the MinLaw in the first half of October 2021.",15,487,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00487
2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Tenants who do not receive a Notice but assess that they meet all the criteria can make a manual application. We will announce, in due course, the date on which applications open and other administrative details.",16,488,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00488
2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"If the tenant also meets the third criterion – that is, a 20% drop in revenue – then the tenant will not be liable to pay rent in respect of the period of 5 August to 18 August 2021 provided that the tenant sends a copy of the Notice and proof of the revenue drop to the immediate landlord within 28 calendar days of the date of the Notice. This can be done via email, which is preferred, to minimise potential disputes between landlords and tenants, or registered mail.",17,489,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00489

2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"In designing the framework, we also considered the interests of landlords. We recognise that some landlords have been proactive. They provided assistance to their tenants in the form of direct payments and rental waivers. These landlords can offset such assistance from the rental waiver obligations if the assistance was provided in respect of rental obligations incurred on or after 16 May 2021, which was the start of the first Phase Two (Heightened Alert) period.",19,491,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00491
2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Some landlords may themselves face financial hardship in having to provide the mandated rental waiver, for example, retirees who depend on the rental income for their day-to-day expenses. They can apply for relief to be assessed by an independent Rental Waiver Assessor who will take into account specific factors in each case. There will be objective criteria, including the annual value of their property and whether the rental income forms a substantial part of their total income. If they meet the criteria, the Assessors can exempt them from providing the rental waiver.",20,492,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00492
2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"There may be different circumstances on the part of landlords, which warrant special consideration, for example, landlords who gave their tenants flexibility and relief by providing short-term lease extensions with significantly reduced rent.",21,493,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00493
2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"It is not possible to define the criteria to account for all these circumstances in full within the legislation. Hence, the Bill includes a provision to give the Assessors greater flexibility and discretion to take into account exceptional circumstances of landlords and to determine if it is just and equitable to make appropriate adjustments to the rental waiver obligations between the landlord and tenant.",22,494,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00494
2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Finally, besides the rental waiver framework, the Bill also introduces minor amendments relating to Part 10A of the Act.",23,495,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00495
2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),Part 10A allows construction project parties to seek an assessment on the determination of adjustments to the contract sum arising from foreign manpower salary increases.,24,496,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00496
2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),These amendments are largely administrative in nature to make clear that different application fees can be prescribed for an initial application for a determination and to allow MND to charge application fees for subsequent determinations made after the initial one.,25,497,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00497
2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mr Speaker, in conclusion, I would like to take the opportunity to thank the representatives from the various industry groups, and individual landlords and tenants who engaged with my Ministry in helping us come up with this Bill.

2021-09-14-T-009,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Mr Speaker, it is clear that whenever there are some forms of safe management measures, related restrictions imposed on our dining and retail businesses, whether it is a complete ban, such as during the circuit breaker, or with fewer restrictions like those imposed under our recent Phase Two (Heightened Alert) in May and June and again in August, many in F&B or retail will suffer a drop in business.",1,501,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00501
2021-09-14-T-009,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Under today's Bill, the Government is introducing the new rental waiver framework, which will require all private commercial landlords to provide two weeks of rental waiver to qualifying tenants. This is being implemented to assist small and medium enterprises (SMEs) during the recent two rounds of Phase Two (Heightened Alert).",2,502,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00502
2021-09-14-T-009,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Under the rental waiver framework, eligible tenants will receive a total of about one and a half month's of rental support, for which a month's rental support comes from the Government's Rental Support Scheme announced earlier.",3,503,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00503
2021-09-14-T-009,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Under this framework, once the Bill is passed, eligible tenants can expect to receive a Notice of Rental Waiver and a declaration form distributed along with their second Rental Support Scheme payout in October. Tenants who wish to claim the rental waiver must, among other requirements, show that they have suffered a drop of at least 20% in their income for the two Phase Two (Heightened Alert) periods in May to June and August 2021 as compared to the Phase Three period between December 2020 and May 2021.",4,504,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00504

2021-09-14-T-009,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Mr Speaker, I have a question regarding the evidence required to show the drop in income. I am concerned whether the requirement of strict profit and loss statement may be a little bit too onerous for some of the small businesses, especially those who may not have an in-house accounting or finance department or staff. To seek external help for a claim of just half a month's rental waiver may not be cost-effective to many micro businesses.",6,506,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00506

2021-09-14-T-009,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Separately, I am also concerned with the shortness of time given for the submission of such financial statements and I would like to ask the Minister whether there can be more flexibility with the time limit of 28 days.",8,508,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00508

2021-09-14-T-009,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"I thank the Minister, for that clarification. Maybe I will read it in a slower manner. Just reading what CBRE reported that in the second quarter, select retailers were snapping up choice locations in the second quarter. And the concern I have here is  would the consolidation by the so-called ""select retailers"" or bigger players, reduce the available space of choice for the small players, the smaller retailers; in the meantime, while causing their rental to remain elevated with weaker revenues as a result of the current prevailing social distancing measures?",1,518,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00518

2021-09-14-T-009,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I just have two quick clarifications. One, basically, on those tenants who are having difficulties in terms of claiming the rental waiver. They may be the elderly tenants, they are not IT-savvy and may not understand their obligations under the Rental Waiver Framework, like having to serve the Notice of Rental Waiver within a specified time in order to claim for the rental waiver. Or they may not know what are the requisite financial documents because they do not keep proper profit and loss statements, for example.",4,525,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00525

2021-09-14-T-009,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"My second clarification is that in respect of the assessment and determination which now includes the entire PTO chain, I think it makes an efficient and holistic determination by the Assessor of all stakeholders in the chain. But may I get some clarifications on the approach to be taken if not all parties in the PTO chain had been joined to the proceedings or disclosed to be part of the PTO chain at the material time of the determination?",6,527,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00527
2021-09-14-T-009,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Those are my two quick clarifications, Minister. All in all, I stand in support of the Bill and I welcome the Rental Waiver Framework.",7,528,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00528

2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"On Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim's question on less savvy tenants and how can they navigate the framework more easily, we have considered the experience from last year and put in place some measures. Some tenants are not conversant in English. They found the framework difficult to understand. So, we made the processes as simple as possible and also the various resources to explain the scheme, including infographics; these will be translated into other languages. We also work with partner agencies and industry associations to ensure that these resources are disseminated quite widely. And webinars will be organised to explain the scheme to stakeholders and address queries.",2,530,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00530
2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"On Mr Zhulkarnain's other question, we are making it mandatory for the party making the application to inform all parties along the PTO chain. The determination may affect the rental waiver to be enjoyed by all. So the determination should be binding on all, because people can be affected.",3,531,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00531
2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Turning to the points made by the Member, Mr Dennis Tan, on the first point about tenants who may not be keeping detailed accounts, I think the starting point is that the tenants have to show that their income has gone down, business has gone down, from that specific premise. I think we can all agree on that. The question is how.",4,532,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00532
2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We accept that some tenants may not have kept detailed accounts, may not be able to show it in the way that the normal profit and loss accounts are kept. The law allows – and this is not the first piece of legislation; previous COVID-19 legislation as well – them to swear a statutory declaration that their business has gone down by the required amount and attach whatever evidence they have.",5,533,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00533
2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Of course, even if it is not a profit and loss account, what they have must be helpful to come to that conclusion. Otherwise, the question is, how did they know? If they have other material, something to show that their business has come down and that is probative, that will be accepted. It does not have to be a properly drawn up profit and loss account in the way accountants will understand.",6,534,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00534
2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Making a statutory declaration is a serious matter, but we provided for it last year and some people did do it. If the landlord refuses to accept that, then it is a matter between landlord and tenant, and they can then go for assessment, too.",7,535,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00535
2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The final question is a much broader one from Mr Dennis Tan. It is that he sees the market moving, consolidation by select retailers. I assume, by that, he means the more successful, perhaps the more high-profile retailers, and they are causing the rentals to go up and that is affecting SMEs. This is not a situation that arises only during COVID-19. The more successful ones are prepared to pay the rental and that impacts on other retailers who may not be as successful and who are then squeezed out from, say, prime locations. And sometimes, it is a cycle  if you are not in the prime location, then your business does not go up.",8,536,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00536
2021-09-14-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I sympathise with it but those are quite outside the framework of this particular piece of legislation. And that relates to really how you structure the market and what sort of approach we want for the economic structure. Does the Government or Government agencies intervene to tell landlords what they can charge, what sort of tenants they can have or they must have a certain mix of tenants, whether we can or ought to do it and how do we make sure that SMEs have a decent stake in the business? Because that is in everybody's interest. How do you get to that is something that I am sure MTI and to some extent, MOF, will have considerably more interest than MinLaw has.",9,537,2021-09-14-T-009-S-00537

2021-09-14-T-010,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Last year, around 7,600 local students enrolled in ICT courses in our Universities, Polytechnics and ITEs. Our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) are producing as many ICT graduates as they can. But you can see from the data that relying on the local pipeline alone will not be enough. We also need to balance the needs of other sectors. Because if we increase the intake of young people in ICT too sharply, we will end up with fewer people in other areas like nursing or physiotherapy. Then, the complaint will not be about foreigners in IT but foreigners in our hospitals.",41,583,2021-09-14-T-010-S-00583
2021-09-14-T-010,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),It is not just the number of jobs that has grown. Career choices have also expanded as we become more vibrant as a hub economy.,42,584,2021-09-14-T-010-S-00584
2021-09-14-T-010,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Look at the financial services sector. More than 20 years ago, the sector was smaller and the jobs available were more domestically focused than today. Most of the jobs then were in our three local retail banks  DBS, OCBC and UOB.",43,585,2021-09-14-T-010-S-00585
2021-09-14-T-010,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Today, the financial services sector has grown significantly. Our local banks now have a good overseas footprint. In addition, we have anchored major international banks like the Asia Pacific operations of Citi and the global operations of Standard Chartered, as well as a wider variety of other players, including private banks, asset managers, specialist and reinsurance firms, fintech companies and more. They serve not only the domestic market, but also the larger regional and global markets.",44,586,2021-09-14-T-010-S-00586

As we anchor more businesses here and as they expand their footprint, there will be more opportunities for Singaporeans as well.",45,587,2021-09-14-T-010-S-00587
2021-09-14-T-010,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"So, the data and evidence are clear  our economic policies have helped to raise living standards across the board, and to create many good jobs for Singaporeans. Our children – fresh graduates from our IHLs, Polys and ITEs – are benefiting. They are doing the jobs of the future, not the past, which would have disappeared in any event if we had stood still in the 1990s.",46,588,2021-09-14-T-010-S-00588

2021-09-14-T-010,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),But we know that globalisation is not an unmitigated good. Being a hub economy brings many benefits to Singapore and Singaporeans but it also comes with its share of costs. The rapid pace of change and the “creative destruction” that takes place in any vibrant economy mean that there will be people displaced from their jobs.,48,590,2021-09-14-T-010-S-00590
2021-09-14-T-010,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"But the issue is not about foreigners working here. Even if we got rid of “tens of thousands” of foreigners, locals will continue to be displaced because of technology, because of innovation, because of the changing nature of work over time. With the rise of remote work, people can work from anywhere in the world and they need not be all in the same place.",49,591,2021-09-14-T-010-S-00591
2021-09-14-T-010,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"In the face of these painful dislocations, it is easy for politicians to blame someone for them.

2021-09-14-T-010,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"So, the right approach is not to impede progress by holding on to every job even as they become obsolete, but to work hard to protect every worker and help those who are displaced. In this way, we grow the economic pie for everyone, and ensure that the cost of globalisation and openness does not fall unfairly on the displaced workers.",53,595,2021-09-14-T-010-S-00595

2021-09-14-T-010,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Second, we uphold fair employment practices and take a strong stance against discrimination at the workplace. We know that some Singaporeans have experienced this. Their foreign colleagues may not be up to scratch. They may have been unfairly passed over for a promotion. They may have been victims of discriminatory hiring practices. The Prime Minister spoke frankly about these issues at the National Day Rally (NDR). We recognise the pain and the frustration of those who feel unfairly treated by a foreign boss or a foreign colleague. When our agencies pick up problematic indicators in a firm, we place the firm on the watchlist for closer scrutiny and our agencies step in to intervene, quietly but effectively.",57,599,2021-09-14-T-010-S-00599

We were concerned that doing so would lead to a more litigious and confrontational process; it could easily sour workplace relations, harming both employers and employees.",58,600,2021-09-14-T-010-S-00600
2021-09-14-T-010,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"But after hearing from the Labour Movement and NTUC Members of Parliament, and consulting our tripartite partners, we decided we could manage these concerns and that it was time to change, to send a clear signal that we have zero tolerance of discrimination at the workplace and to give our agencies more regulatory levers to take action against errant employers.",59,601,2021-09-14-T-010-S-00601

To every person who loses his job, the unemployment rate is 100%. Losing one's job is disorienting and disabling; there are no two ways about it. We understand your concerns and will do our utmost to help you.

We are pressing ahead with our industry transformation efforts to raise wages and productivity across all sectors. We are stepping up employment and training support, especially for mid-career and mature workers to help them pivot into new growth areas. We are doing everything we can to help displaced workers get back into jobs. We want to minimise their time out of a job, help them find good job matches that build on their wealth of skills and experience, and give them an injection of skills, if needed, for the new job.

If he acknowledges that FTAs, including CECA, are not the cause of the challenges faced by our PMETs, then we can put this issue to rest once and for all. But if he continues to equivocate, or to make misleading or false claims, then we can only conclude that CECA is a cover for the PSP to stoke racist and xenophobic sentiments.",85,627,2021-09-14-T-010-S-00627

I decided to indicate on the header of my resume on each page 'Singapore Citizen', but does this help?

After all, we are responsible for our own policy.",10,649,2021-09-14-T-011-S-00649
2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),The Government has been grappling with the foreign talent policy for the last 20 years. We take the foreign talent policy to mean all the immigration and employment policies which the Government has implemented since the late 1990s for attracting foreigners.,11,650,2021-09-14-T-011-S-00650
2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Actually, there is not a foreign talent policy defined by the Government and debated in Parliament at the beginning. However, there was a concept of foreign talent, which was mooted in the late 1990s, in line with the idea of competition for global talent in the new knowledge-based economy.",12,651,2021-09-14-T-011-S-00651
2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Initially, Singaporeans largely did not react negatively to it because we are basically industrious and pragmatic and ascribed to learning from others. However, the Government opened the floodgates for relatively low-wage work pass holders instead of attracting foreign talent. While Work Permit holders like the construction workers take jobs that Singaporeans generally do not want to do, the work pass holders are the Employment Pass (EP) and the S Pass (SP) holders who are collectively known as foreign PMETs because they take up jobs as professionals, managers, executives and technicians in our job market.",13,652,2021-09-14-T-011-S-00652
2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The speed and size of the immigration due to easy immigration policies and unfair wage policies forced many Singaporeans out of jobs and then into long-term underemployment. The angst among Singaporeans reached a high in 2008 when, in that year alone, 80,000 PRs were given out to work pass holders. As a result, the last large displacement of Singaporean PMETs became a major issue in General Election 2011.",14,653,2021-09-14-T-011-S-00653
2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"It is unbecoming of this Government to have touted foreign talent as the reason for relaxing the immigration policies and bring in large numbers of average work pass holders instead. Hence, Singaporeans would like to ask the Minister for Trade and Industry to clarify further what is the definition of ""foreign talent"" and whether the hundreds of thousands of work pass holders in our country are all considered foreign talent.",15,654,2021-09-14-T-011-S-00654
2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Singaporeans welcome all foreigners to complement us for mutual benefit.

2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),The crux of the matter is that we should have been selective in taking in real foreign talent. The failure to do was a policy failure and that is why a rebalancing is required now.,17,656,2021-09-14-T-011-S-00656
2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"By the time the Population White Paper was released in January 2013, our population had already grown by 40% since the late 1990s. I quote the then-Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean at the White Paper debate on 4 February 2013, ""Singaporeans have expressed concerns over job competition, having too many foreigners and overcrowding. We face a series of unprecedented crises in the past decade – 9/11 in 2001, SARS in 2003 and the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. The responses we took threw our planning out of gear. In particular, the growth in foreign workforce, total population, infrastructure and housing were not aligned.

2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),The issue of jobs and livelihoods resurfaced as a major issue during General Election 2020 as the finances of many Singaporeans deteriorated in the severe situation because they did not have the savings to cope with an emergency like the COVID-19 pandemic since many were displaced prior to the pandemic.,22,661,2021-09-14-T-011-S-00661

2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"However, so far, the Government only talks about tackling discrimination with legislation and does not display a full appreciation of the severity of the problem.

2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Legislation may not be effective because a displaced Singaporean will be in a vulnerable position and may not want to go through a long arbitration process.

We look forward to the Government coming up with concrete measures to tackle the quality, number and concentration issues identified by the Prime Minister.",25,664,2021-09-14-T-011-S-00664
2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"To begin with, the Government must listen to the affected Singaporeans more patiently and then recognise the serious shortcomings of its current policies. PSP has listened to the people and has condensed their feedback in the following seven questions, which should provide invaluable insight into how we can craft the new policies.",26,665,2021-09-14-T-011-S-00665
2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Question one  why do so many Singaporeans have difficulties in finding good jobs when there are so many work pass holders in Singapore? There is a big imbalance in the job market. On the one hand, Singapore is hosting 400,000, maybe 350,000 now, pass holders, and 250,000 Permanent Residents, accounting for about 20% and 15% of its PMET workforce. On the other hand, Singapore has 500,000 lower-wage workers who need Government financial aid to live decently, and more than 100,000 gig workers deprived of basic employment benefits and future prospects, and hundreds of thousands of Singaporeans under the various job support schemes and many more underemployed, including the increasing number of self-employed workers. Are there not enough Singaporeans or are they not given the opportunities by employers? So, the numbers are there.",27,666,2021-09-14-T-011-S-00666
2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Question two  are there really more jobs created for Singaporeans if underemployment is a growing problem? The Government has maintained that there are more jobs created for Singaporeans than for work pass holders. However, many Singaporeans doubt whether there is net job creation for Singaporeans after stripping out the immigration effect from the employment statistics, the statistics which lump Singaporeans and PRs together in a category called ""Residents"". Hence, Singaporeans would like to clarify with the Manpower Minister whether the 380,000 PME jobs supposedly created for locals from 2005 to 2020 represent a net job creation for Singaporeans during that period. I know those numbers were given in the last Ministerial Statement on 6 July, but there are a lot of questions behind it.",28,667,2021-09-14-T-011-S-00667
2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"If there are insufficient jobs created, a portion of Singaporeans will become unemployed or underemployed. Underemployment can be defined in two ways. The first type of underemployment is when a Singaporean is doing a job that does not fully utilise his most valuable skills. For example, a displaced Senior Vice President of a bank may not be able to find the same replacement job and end up being a Grab driver. The second type of underemployment is when Singaporeans cannot find work for the number of hours or days she plans to do. For example, a Singaporean may want to work for eight hours a day, five days a week, but can only find enough work for four hours a day, two days a week. She is still considered employed, as a person is considered employed as long as she has worked for at least one hour during the reference period under our employment statistics.",29,668,2021-09-14-T-011-S-00668
2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"So, the low unemployment number that the Government is touting may be masking a deepening underemployment problem which we have to look into. New graduates and the 40- to 50-year-old local PMETs are the most vulnerable to the underemployment trap because the former does not have work experience, and the latter needs to keep working to pay the bills.",30,669,2021-09-14-T-011-S-00669
2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Hence, Singaporeans would like to confirm with the Manpower Minister again, (a) whether there are not enough Singaporeans to meet employers' demand or employers prefer work pass holders; (b) is MOM monitoring underemployment; and (c) is the objective of the Government to protect jobs for Singaporeans or just to protect jobs?",31,670,2021-09-14-T-011-S-00670
2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Question three  if there is a large pool of underemployed Singaporeans, then the shortage of talent is not due to numbers, but skills mismatch. In that case, what has happened to our education system, world-class Universities and Polytechnics? Singaporeans are disappointed that our world-class Universities and Polytechnics were not able to produce enough talent for our key industries throughout the last 20 years. Even if they are skills that Singaporeans are lacking initially, it is the responsibility of this Government to ensure that enough Singaporeans are being trained by our world-class Universities and Polytechnics. Shortage in the first five to 10 years is acceptable, but not 20 years. Hence, the Singaporeans would like to ask the Minister for Education, (a) what has gone wrong in the last 20 years in terms of not producing enough local talent for the finance, infocomm and professional services sectors especially; and b) what is the strategy to train Singaporeans to meet future industry needs?",32,671,2021-09-14-T-011-S-00671
2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Question four  by the way, what kind of skills do the average work pass holders possess that Singaporeans do not have? We have been attracting mainly the average work pass holders, judging from the low qualifying salaries for EPs and S Passes. Even with the latest revision in late 2020, the respective salaries for EPs and S Passes are at $4,500 and $3,500 only, not to mention the much lower levels in the earlier years. Many Singaporeans believe that the work pass holders are here to compete for our jobs. They do not necessarily possess unique skills, let alone create jobs for Singaporeans. Singaporeans would like to ask the Minister for Trade and Industry how the average work pass holders create jobs for Singaporeans, as claimed by the Government.",33,672,2021-09-14-T-011-S-00672
2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Question five  if the work pass holders do not possess unique skills, then why are they dominating some of our key sectors? The finance industry is a good example. Singapore has long been a financial centre of this region and we have very conducive tax policies to promote this sector. As we have grown with the sector, including myself, Singaporeans do not lack the skills to grow this sector further. Yet, the EPs occupy 57% of the senior positions in the finance sector. And even in the domestic retail banking sub-sector, which serves essentially the local customers, they occupy 30% of the senior positions. This situation is a far cry from what the Monetary Authority of Singapore has done for Singaporean PMETs prior to the 1990s when localisation was the norm. Singaporeans would like to ask the Minister for Trade and Industry again whether foreigners are still supposed to complement us, as the Government has always been saying, or are they here to take over us.",34,673,2021-09-14-T-011-S-00673
2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Question six  why has the Government allowed unfair wage competition against Singaporeans while talking about fair consideration for all? Many Singaporeans believe that we have arrived at our current predicament mainly because the Government has turned a blind eye towards unfair wage competition and then, later on, discrimination.",35,674,2021-09-14-T-011-S-00674
2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"In addition to the low qualifying salary described above, the EPs enjoy an advantage over their Singaporean counterparts because their employers do not have to pay the 17% employer's CPF contribution. On top of that, Singaporeans have to do in-camp training. Thus, overall, it is more cost-effective for an employer to hire a foreigner even with their relocation and housing costs involved.",36,675,2021-09-14-T-011-S-00675
2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The unfair wage policies are the single most important factor behind the problems we are facing today because employers, after all, are profit seekers. This has a very debilitating effect on our Singaporean Core because, with competition and wage depression, many Singaporeans make the rational decision to avoid sectors that have competition with foreigners, like the engineering and infocomm sectors. As a result, the number of Singaporeans available to work in these sectors declined significantly over time, allowing foreigners to take up even more positions in such sectors. This is a mechanism that has likely caused the rapid rise in EPs in the infocomm sector, and not because of the growth of the digital economy per se.",37,676,2021-09-14-T-011-S-00676
2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Question seven  why did the Government continue to consider discrimination confined to the minority of employers despite seeing the high concentration of EPs in certain sectors for the longest time? The ineffectiveness of the Fair Consideration Framework as a form of labour market testing is obvious as the work pass holders were seen concentrating themselves in certain sectors. When Singaporeans become a minority in certain sectors, Singaporeans will not be the first to be considered when new opportunities arise.",38,677,2021-09-14-T-011-S-00677
2021-09-14-T-011,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The infocomm sector is a case in point, where many new jobs have gone to more newly arrived work pass holders each year. Based on feedback from many Singaporeans, the number of work pass holders is large enough and they have been here long enough to have formed networks among main contractors, outsourcing vendors, recruitment agencies, HR managers and even top managers, which discriminate against Singaporean workers in their hiring practices.",39,678,2021-09-14-T-011-S-00678

2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"I would like to say a couple of things and then, ask some questions of Mr Leong Mun Wai. Mr Leong has said that CECA is not the PSP's main concern, but it has been thrust upon them by the Government. The Motion today, would you not agree, shows what he says to be untrue? It specifically refers to CECA and may I remind him of what it says?",2,704,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00704
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"I quote, ""That this Parliament calls upon the Government to take urgent and concrete action to address the widespread anxiety among Singaporeans on jobs and livelihoods caused by the foreign talent policy and the provisions on Movement of Natural Persons in some free trade agreements like CECA.""",3,705,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00705
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"And this is not something that is thrust upon the PSP or Mr Leong Mun Wai. I think you will know that, at the launch of the PSP on 3 August 2019, Dr Tan Cheng Bock made it a point to emphasise that PSP was targeting CECA. And since entering Parliament, Mr Leong, you have repeatedly commented on CECA, comments which carry clear racial undertones.",4,706,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00706
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"For example, your post on 22 June 2021, I quote, ""the most important economic policies that have affected the jobs and livelihoods of Singaporeans relate to foreign PMETs and free trade agreements, in particular, the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement with India.""",5,707,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00707
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"But today, we heard you say that you are in favour of free trade agreements. So, is it that you are in favour of free trade agreements, but specifically oppose CECA? That is what it looks like, based on what you have said so far.",6,708,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00708
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Your comments have troubled your own PSP members. They have said that your statements in Parliament on CECA were targeting the Indian community. You protested here that you are not a racist and that these statements and sentiments ascribed to you are a diversion and a distraction. But your party members are quoted as saying, that you are targeting the Indian community and they say it is totally a racial undertone.",7,709,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00709
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mr Leong, your statements have been interpreted by your own party members, as being racist. People in your party think your statements are racist. Would you accept? I do not expect that you will accept that you are racist, but would you accept that people in your party think that your statements are racist and have said so?",8,710,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00710
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"It is a simple factual statement. May I seek that clarification from Mr Leong Mun Wai, Mr Speaker?",9,711,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00711

2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Sir, in response to the Minister's clarification  one, we have included CECA in the Motion today, as I have mentioned in my speech, because FTAs and CECA are part of the equation when we talk about immigration. So, it has to be included.",1,713,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00713
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"As for CECA and FTAs, in general, we are supportive. We are supportive of FTAs and even CECA in general, but we need more information about all these FTAs. If we do not have more information, we cannot say we are wholeheartedly supporting them. It has to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.",2,714,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00714
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Two, the Minister commented on I having commented on CECA on many occasions. Can the Minister give me the examples of occasions that I have spoken about CECA? Other than starting from my Facebook post on 22 June, can the Minister give me instances that I have spoken about CECA before? Even for the 22 June Facebook post, it was after I had accepted the challenge from the Minister. So, I had started to comment a bit, to put things into perspective.",3,715,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00715
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"So, this is the second point. In this second point, the Minister also mentioned that Dr Tan Cheng Bock had mentioned at the party launch about CECA in August 2019. Yes, he talked about free movement. But he was responding to the feedback from Singaporeans and the phrases ""free movement"" and ""free flow"" are not phrases owned by PSP.",4,716,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00716
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"The Government Ministers had been talking about ""free flow"" way before Dr Tan Cheng Bock had said it. I do not think I need to quote George Yeo or about what the Prime Minister had said and all that. So, that is one point.",5,717,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00717
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"The third point was about party members. PSP is an open party. We are liberal with members. We allow them to express their views and sometimes, there are one or two members or a minority of members who have different opinions. We have told them that they cannot make their views that public. But some of them chose to do that. We cannot stop them because we are a liberal party. We are not a party which will prevent all our members from having their own opinions. So, one or two party members mentioned that what I am doing in Parliament today is racist but that does not mean I am racist.",6,718,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00718

Mr Speaker, Sir, can I ask Mr Leong to confirm that, therefore, other Singaporeans may also go away with similar views that what he says is racist? And, second, Mr Leong says, now, they have got nothing to object to CECA and other FTAs. I think it is an important statement and I would like that recorded. I think we all need to note that.",1,720,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00720

But the data provided by the Government is not conclusive. The Government only quoted one year's ICT numbers – 500 ICT in 2020, which is a COVID-19 year. The Government did not provide the data to prove its point.",2,745,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00745

I am just trying to understand whether CECA has a special place in Mr Leong's affection and mind, or is it treated the same as all the other FTAs. If it is the same as all the other FTAs, why is CECA getting special mention? That is all. A simple answer will do.",1,749,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00749

2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Some of Mr Leong's party members interpreted his statements as being racist and I quoted. One of the quotes is ""You are targeting the Indian community and it is totally a racial undertone"". My question was, if his own party members can think like that, it is entirely possible for other Singaporeans to take a similar view.",1,778,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00778
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Leong.,1,779,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00779
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Sir, for discussion on any topic, there are people who have a different view. But CECA is an economic agreement that is the concern of many Singaporeans. So, we are asking for more information.",1,780,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00780
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We have heard that. That was not my question, Sir.",1,781,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00781
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Do you have a response specifically to the Minister's question?,1,782,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00782
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Sorry, Minister. I want the Minister to repeat the question again.",1,783,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00783
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"For the third time, Minister.",1,784,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00784
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Leong, it is commonsensical, is it not, that those PSP members will not be the only ones who think that your statements are racist? If they can think like that, your own party members, then, other Singaporeans can reasonably think that your statements are racist too. It is a simple point.",1,785,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00785
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Leong.,1,786,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00786
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Yes, okay, actually just now my answer was going to that point. But it does not mean that if someone accused somebody who is trying to find out more and discuss about an economic agreement thinks that the person is racist, then we need to shut out the whole discussion.",1,787,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00787
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We are not talking about shutting out. In fact, we are having a long debate, we are going to be here for very long.",1,788,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00788
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,Correct.,1,789,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00789
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,And it will be even longer if we do not get answers. Nobody is shutting anybody out. Just a logical conclusion.,1,790,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00790

2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Thank you. With that, Sir, I want to go back to some of the questions that were raised and not answered the last time in July.",1,793,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00793
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"My colleague Ong Ye Kung said that CECA does not allow a free flow of Indians into Singapore. He made that very clear to this House and to Mr Leong. I will also remind Mr Leong that it has been explained that nothing in CECA says that Singapore must unconditionally let PMEs into Singapore, and all foreign PMEs have to meet our work pass conditions in order to come and work here.",2,794,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00794
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Just to remind Members and Mr Leong, I will repeat what Minister Ong had said. He said in this House, by reference to Chapter 9 of CECA, that it ""makes it clear that the Government's ability to regulate immigration and foreign manpower is not affected by the agreement. The Government retains full rights to decide who can enter the country to live, work, become PRs or become citizens. This is clearly set out in two clauses. They are standard clauses commonly found in all FTAs."" And then, he refers to Chapter 9.1.2 and 9.1.3.",3,795,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00795
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"He then says, ""There is a strong immigration carve-out and National Treatment is not found in Chapter 9 of CECA, nor any other corresponding Chapter in the FTAs that Singapore has entered into"", ""...nothing in this agreement implies that Singapore must unconditionally let in PMEs from India. Contrary to PSP’s claim, our ability to impose requirements for immigration and work pass has never been in question in CECA or any other FTAs that we have signed.""",4,796,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00796
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"And he made a couple of other points, if I may refer to, ""PSP pointed out that CECA listed 127 categories of professionals, hence, claimed that Indian nationals in these professions can all freely come here to work for a year. This is false because, as I explained earlier, all foreign PMEs have to meet our work pass conditions in order to come and work here"", ""The second common criticism is that intra-corporate transferees from India can also freely enter Singapore to work. Based on my explanation on how the Chapter works, this is again not true. Intra-corporate transferees also have to meet our work pass qualifying criteria."" Then, he said, ""Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope we can put a stop to all this misinformation about our FTAs in general, and CECA, in particular.""",5,797,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00797
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, bearing that in mind, Sir, can I ask, through you, for Mr Leong to respond to questions posed by Mr Ong Ye Kung that CECA does not allow a free flow of Indians into Singapore?",6,798,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00798
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Leong.,1,799,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00799
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Sir, as I have said just now, the word ""free flow"" is not the property of PSP. It has been used by the Government as well. So, let us focus on what exactly — we are just talking about the numbers of foreign nationals that have come into Singapore.",1,800,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00800
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Mr Leong, will you be coming to an answer to that question?",1,801,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00801
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Yes, yes. Mr Speaker, Sir, please give me some time.",1,802,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00802
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"You have all the time, carry on.",1,803,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00803
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"So, let us focus on the numbers. If you do not give us the numbers, how are we going to answer to Singaporeans that, really, CECA has no influence over our immigration policies? We asked for ICT numbers but only one year's number is given. Can you give all the numbers? If you give all the numbers from 2005 to 2020, and the number of ICTs who have later on become PRs and new citizens, and obtained new work passes —",1,804,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00804
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sorry, Sir, a point of order. Sir, through you, may I remind Mr Leong there are two different issues. One, what does CECA or the other FTAs allow? That is a matter of interpretation of the agreement. That is what we had been debating in July and Minister Ong said there is nothing in CECA that allows for free flow.",1,805,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00805
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The second is, within the framework of CECA or any other FTA, and I note that Mr Leong only wants to know CECA and not any other FTAs, how many have come in?",2,806,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00806
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Those are matters of numbers and details, and we can deal with that separately. Hopefully, we will not take another hour for that.",3,807,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00807
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But, first, as a matter of interpretation, the Minister who, as a civil servant, was negotiating this agreement, referred chapter and verse, and had explained how the Government applies that policy, that it is subject to our work pass rules. And that is how it has been applied for the last 15 years. So, unless Mr Leong says that Minister Ong Ye Kung lied or that the Government policies are other than what it says it is, let us just get an answer. Do you accept that there is nothing in CECA that allows for free movement of PMETs? That is all. It is a simple question.",4,808,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00808
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Leong.,1,809,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00809
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Sir, to the Minister, we are arguing not about a legal document, just a legal document, not just the letter of the word. We are arguing about economic effect.",1,810,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00810
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Minister.,1,811,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00811
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sir, first, I do not understand that answer because it says here in his Motion ""anxiety among Singaporeans on jobs and livelihoods caused by the foreign talent policy and the provisions on Movement of Natural Persons in some free trade agreements like CECA"". That is just untrue, based on what Minister Ong has said. We are arguing about your Motion which refers to the provisions of CECA. Sir, I am afraid Mr Leong does not even know what his Motion says. He did not even draft it. So, that is our first question.",1,812,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00812
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Second question  will he now, in the context of his Motion, agree that we are debating the provisions of CECA? And will he accept that there is nothing in CECA that allows for free movement of Indians into Singapore?",2,813,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00813
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Leong.,1,814,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00814
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,The provisions that we put in the Motion is actually pertaining to the economic effect of the provisions.,1,815,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00815
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Could you explain that again, please?",1,816,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00816
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,Economic effects of the provision.,1,817,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00817
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"So, the provisions are the legal agreement, as explained by the Minister. And what are your views about those provisions? They are written in black and white and we covered that quite extensively at previous Sittings. What are your views on that, please?",1,818,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00818
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,My view is that we are not arguing about a legal document today.,1,819,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00819
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"The legal documents dictate how these interactions take place with the other countries. So, unless you are doubting the validity of the agreement, or you are doubting the way in which it is implemented, I think we are seeking a view on that. If you could enlighten us, please?",1,820,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00820
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"We do not think that we can interpret, I mean, we can draw a conclusion from just the explanation given by the Minister.",1,821,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00821
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Maybe if I can help to paraphrase that. The Minister has explained what the terms are. Do you agree that those are the terms of the free trade agreement as agreed between the two countries?,1,822,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00822
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"No, as I have said, I am not arguing about a legal document. What I am arguing about is, there is a legal document, but the way you implement the legal document and the economic effect can be different. Because after the legal document —",1,823,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00823
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sir, as a point of order, let us stop at the legal document first. I wanted to get, Sir, through you, to Mr Leong, because Minister Ong specifically raised this and Mr Leong said they need more time to study this. We have had August and September to study it.",1,824,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00824
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, first of all, the English meaning, unless some other language may be different, but the English meaning of ""the provisions on Movement of Natural Persons in some free trade agreements like CECA"" means what they say, which is the legal provisions in CECA. So, let us not try and wriggle out of that. That is what it means.",2,825,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00825
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Second, before we talk about implementation, first, in terms of the legal provisions, I have read out what the Minister said, what these provisions are, does Mr Leong have any basis to contradict that or challenge that, or does he accept it?",3,826,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00826

2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, you may.",1,829,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00829
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sir, I would like Mr Leong because Motion stands in his name; he has put this Motion, he has referred to provisions. If he does not know the answer, he can say he does not know the answer. And I am not sure the answer is going to be found in the phone.",1,830,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00830

2021-09-14-T-012,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"Sir, some of these points that Minister Shanmugam has raised are in my speech. Can I suggest that we leave it here for now and we can discuss again after —",1,832,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00832
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"No, I think Mr Leong can answer them. I think they are pertinent to the issues that are at hand presently. You may raise it later or you can pass your speech to Mr Leong.",1,833,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00833
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,I would have the same answer. We went back to consider the points put up by —,1,834,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00834
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Mr Leong, before we proceed, can we just answer the questions rather than cover the same ground again?",1,835,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00835
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"As of now, we do not agree to the interpretation of the legal documents as it is now.",1,836,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00836
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"What does that mean, exactly, when you say that you do not agree with the legal documents? As in as represented by the Minister? You do not agree that that is how it was phrased or you do not agree with how it is being phrased? So that we can proceed with the argument, so that we can develop the debate further. What exactly does that mean?",1,837,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00837
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,Because we are looking at the economic effects of the —,1,838,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00838
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"No, I understand. We are talking about the provisions that are provided under the FTAs, in this case, CECA. What exactly is it about the agreements that you disagree with or whatever that might be?",1,839,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00839
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Okay, I can then say that at this point, I do not have a legal opinion of those provisions.",1,840,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00840
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Okay, then if it is not the legal opinion, what is your opinion on them? A non-legal opinion?",1,841,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00841
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"My non-legal opinion would include my interpretation of the economic effect. So, it will be a bit different from what the Minister is asking.",1,842,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00842

2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Again, Sir, that is a confusing answer. The Minister has said that there is no free movement allowed. We apply and we are entitled to apply our workforce rules and that this is how it has been operated since CECA has come into force and, likewise, for the other FTAs. Which part of that statement does he disagree with, Sir?",1,844,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00844
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,We will try one more time. Mr Leong.,1,845,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00845
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Yes, maybe he can look at these statements and say which part of it he disagrees with. Does he disagree that we have applied it this way? Does he say that the Minister was lying in Parliament? Or does he say that the interpretation that the Minister has given is inaccurate and that we should, in fact, or are obliged to give free movement of all Indians into Singapore?",1,846,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00846

2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Sir, what I am saying is that I am focusing on the economic effects of those provisions. And looking at the economic effects, there are some initial doubts whether the movement is easier than what the Government has represented or not. But we still cannot come to a conclusion yet because we need more data from the Government. And the Government is withholding the data.",1,848,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00848
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Okay, thank you. Minister, I suggest we move on. I do not think we are going to get any further clarity on this. We will just have to agree to disagree and register both points.",1,849,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00849
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I will take it, Sir, based on the answers that Mr Leong really does not know about these legal provisions, despite the wording of his Motion. And he has no understanding of the provisions of CECA. And I assume that he has the same concerns about the provisions in the US FTA, the China FTA, and the Australian FTA. And, if so, I hope to see those FTAs being referenced in future rather than CECA being singled out. If what he says is true.",1,850,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00850
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I have another clarification to seek, Sir  the PSP's claim that CECA allows the 127 categories of Indian professionals to come here freely to work.

2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sir, I want to remind the House, share with the House and Mr Leong some numbers. Over the last 10 years, the last decade, there has been an increase of 110,000 Employment Pass and S Pass holders. During the same period, the local PMETs increased by 300,000. So, local PMETs increased by 300,000. Employment Pass and S Pass holders, 110,000.",1,863,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00863
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Second, the number of PMET job vacancies have been around 30,000 over the past five years.",2,864,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00864
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Third, the size of our PR population has remained stable in the last five years. From 2016 to 2020, it is at about 520,000. In fact, it has been stable even before that, but we will just take five years.",3,865,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00865
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, with these numbers in mind – local PMETs increased by 300,000; foreign PMETs increased by 110,000, Employment Pass and S Pass holders; PR population, stable and Mr Leong agrees that we need some foreign PMETs. Today, it is 350,000.",4,866,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00866
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"If that is too much, then can he tell us what is the right number? Is it 300,000? Is it 200,000? Or is it 100,000?",5,867,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00867

2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,One question for now.,1,870,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00870
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Okay, the number of rebalancing that we need to do depends on the Government's estimate of what is the number of Singaporeans that are being displaced, which is something that I will push during the debate.",1,871,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00871
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, can I take it, Sir, through you, that Mr Leong can confirm that he does not really know how many, what should the number be?",1,872,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00872
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Leong.,1,873,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00873
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Sir, of course. The Government  is always controlling the numbers, controlling the data. I will have to refer to the Government to give me s",1,874,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00874
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sir, based on the data that is available and I have given him this data and much of it is available in public, can I take it that he is in no position, Sir, to tell us whether it should be 350,000 or whether it should be 400,000 or whether it should be less? He has got no basis.",1,875,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00875

2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"And, therefore, it  follows, logically, Sir, that Mr Leong is not able to assert here or anywhere else that we have too many foreign PMETs in Singapore. That would be right?",1,878,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00878

2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Sir,  that is not accurate because we are seeing so many underemployed Singaporeans around. The number of gig workers",1,880,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00880
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,How many unemployed Singaporeans do you see? You were saying that you see many unemployed Singaporeans?,1,881,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00881
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Underemployed. Underemployed Singaporeans have come forward to reflect to us, feedback to us. We have also seen in statistics, the number of gig workers, they are increasing. And also the number of self-employed Singaporeans is also increasing. So, there are Singaporeans that are being displaced. So, we got some rough numbers, but we want the Government to give us more accurate numbers.",1,882,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00882
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"My question was a simple one. Mr Leong agreed earlier that he does not know if 350,000 is too many or too little. So, it is a natural conclusion that he does not really know if there are too many foreign PMETs here. It is basically based on what he says.",1,883,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00883
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sir, can I ask through you, that he just be consistent with what he just said three minutes ago?",2,884,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00884
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Sir, I am not going to say what is the number in my head until the Government gives me more data. Not that I do not have an idea of how many Singaporeans are being displaced.",1,885,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00885
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Thank you, Sir. Can I ask, Sir, through you, I just mentioned there are 30,000 PMET vacancies. It is there. Perhaps Mr Leong can give us an explanation as to why there are so many vacancies which are unfilled in Singapore and have been unfilled for the last five years?",1,886,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00886
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Sir, these 30,000 PMET vacancies, again, is a number that now the Minister has brought out. Okay, but if all these vacancies and numbers are being presented in a proper time series dataset, then, we will be able to analyse the numbers better. So, at the moment, I cannot give him an answer on that. Because you always come up with single data and ask me for answers.",1,887,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00887
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The number of PMET jobs unfilled, that thousands of jobs were being unfilled, was set out in July. So, Mr Leong had said that he will study it carefully. And I think what this House is witnessing is a Motion that has been put up and Mr Leong does not know the meaning of the Motion that he has put up. Because he says ""the provisions on Movement of Natural Persons in some free trade agreements like CECA"". He has given no credible explanation on why CECA is singled out. He has no credible explanation as to why he refers to the provisions, which means legal provisions, the clauses in CECA, in his Motion and then asserts here that he does not know anything about the provisions in CECA. He has got no view on that.",1,888,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00888
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Then, he should not have referred to that. So, it is meaningless, the Motion; does not make any sense to him, let alone to us.",2,889,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00889
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"And he says, there are too many foreign PMETs. But now he says, he does not know if there are too many and he does not know what the number ought to be. He does not tell us what further data he needs.",3,890,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00890
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sir, none of this is to say that there are no Singaporeans who have lost their jobs, that there are no Singaporeans who are underemployed, that there are no Singaporeans, particularly in their 40s and 50s, who are not in a very good situation. We all know that. Those are all true. But the point is to find the right solutions.",4,891,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00891
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Displacement is taking place all over the world. We have tried to keep unemployment low, we have tried to create the jobs and many people have gotten jobs and we need to help those who have not got jobs, and the way to do it is to try to reskill them and bring in the right industries. Those are legitimate points to make.",5,892,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00892

And then come to Parliament and say, I do not know anything about the terms of CECA. That is doing serious disservice to Singaporeans. That is not the way Members should behave, I am sorry to say.",6,893,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00893
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"You got to take this seriously. You got to know what your own Motion says.

2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Thank you, Sir. Minister, you have made a lot of accusations there. One is that we go back to square one again about my Motion statement. I bring the Motion statement to this Parliament about the economic effect of the provisions in the FTAs. I am not bringing to Parliament the legal interpretation of the provision. But if you have a legal interpretation, I am fine. I am just telling you that I am concentrating on the economic effect of the provisions.",1,901,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00901

I say, or PSP says, a large part of it is not due to global forces. So, that is what we are debating about. So, do not jump the gun and come and make the conclusion now.",3,903,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00903
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Minister.,1,904,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00904
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I should address the Speaker. Looking at the Motion, Sir, Mr Leong can fulminate as much as he wants, but it says what it says. And it says, ""the provisions on Movement of Natural Persons in some free trade agreements like CECA"", and that is consistent with the position that Mr Leong put forward in July and what he has said in his Facebook post and what PSP has said, that CECA allows free movement of Indians into Singapore.",1,905,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00905
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, before we get all heated up, let me refer to what was discussed here the last time around. The Motion is consistent with what Dr Tan Cheng Bock had said on 3 August 2019, which Minister Ong referenced, and I quote Dr Tan, ""amongst the terms of CECA, it allowed the free movement of professionals in 127 sectors to enter and work in Singapore."" Mr Leong has confirmed that that is not accurate, because he says it is subject to our work pass rules, but this was what they were thinking.",2,906,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00906
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Minister Ong pointed out, on 7 July, the same; that Dr Tan said ""...CECA is an agreement between Singapore and India to bring in to allow, I think, 127 categories of professionals to come to Singapore and be given that free hand, practically free hand to come and work here"". And that is what the Motion says, ""the provisions on Movement of Natural Persons in some free trade agreements"".",3,907,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00907
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, I mean one has got to be both honest and accurate. If Mr Leong does not know what the Motion means, if it has been drafted by someone and he has put his name to it, he can say so. But this is what the Motion says. If I may move on, Sir.",4,908,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00908

2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,I disagree with what the Minister said about his interpretation of the Motion and that I do not understand the Motion and all that.,1,911,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00911
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"I already said again and again, that the Motion statement that I put up is about the economic effects of the provisions. I do not expect this Parliament to just argue about legal interpretation. This Parliament is about jobs and livelihoods of our people, about the economy. So, what we are arguing, actually is a larger part of, should be about economics, social, economic issues. We are not going to stand here and keep arguing about a legal interpretation of a clause.",2,912,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00912
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Mr Leong, if I may, the provisions are the first step, is it not? Because if the legal provisions do not provide for that, then it provides a basis for us to discuss about the economic effect. It does not preclude discussing that part because your Motion addresses that.",1,913,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00913
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"So, that is the issue at hand and we are trying to understand what is your understanding of the provision. Because it is in black and white, so, what are your views on that? We can subsequently discuss about economic effect, you can take all day if you wish. But what are your views on the legal provisions? It was spelt out in black and white, as illustrated by Minister Ong previously.",2,914,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00914
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Okay, Sir, as I have said just now, at this point, I do not have any legal opinion on the provisions provided under the agreement.",1,915,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00915

2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Yes, but then, in order to have a legal interpretation of provisions, you must look at other parts of the agreement and then you must look at other practices.",1,917,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00917
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"So, for those specific parts of the agreement, do you agree that those are in black and white, what was agreed?",1,918,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00918
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"At the moment, I have no opinion.",1,919,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00919

2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sir, that might be useful. So, through you, Sir, therefore I can confirm that if Mr Leong has no opinion, then naturally, he has no view as to whether the terms of CECA are negative for Singapore. I am not talking about actual implementation. We can discuss that. But since Mr Leong has no opinion, it must logically follow that as far as he is concerned, there are no provisions in CECA that he is concerned about. It must follow. May I ask for confirmation of that, Sir.",1,921,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00921

2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"My answer is, at the moment, in terms of the legal interpretation that this agreement does not have further implementation, implications and all that, I do not have an opinion.",1,923,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00923
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,But you do have a negative view about it? Despite the fact that you do not have a legal or otherwise opinion of it?,1,924,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00924
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"I do not have a view yet. I am trying to get a view, if the Government is prepared to release more data, about ICTs and about all that, then I will have an economic view.",1,925,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00925

2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Thank you, Sir. Sir, through you again, may I ask Mr Leong to confirm – and Members of this House would recall what he said about the CEO of DBS Bank. He professed his deep disappointment that ""DBS is still without a homegrown CEO"". Can I ask, Sir, whether Mr Leong still believes what he said, that naturalised Singapore Citizens should not hold top positions?",1,927,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00927
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Sir, that is definitely not the case. When you are citizens, naturalised or homegrown, you are citizens. I have raised the issue during my maiden speech because I was talking about the succession plan, about skills transfer, which is part of what we are going to discuss today. About DBS, when he was appointed the current CEO, he was to still a foreigner. Why was the chance not given to a homegrown Singaporean? The bank should have had a succession plan that grooms Singaporeans to take over the job. That was what I was trying to drive at.",1,928,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00928
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sir, let me make a point of clarification. None of that answers the point I made. I am quoting Mr Leong, he professed his deep disappointment when Mr Piyush Gupta was and is DBS CEO, during his maiden speech, that DBS is still without a homegrown CEO. Meaning he was disappointed that it was Mr Gupta and not a homegrown CEO. So, let us not beat about the bush. I am asking whether he continues to have those beliefs or has he changed his mind.",1,929,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00929
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Sir, if the Minister means that I am differentiating naturalised Singaporeans and homegrown Singaporeans, then I can confirm, the answer is no.",1,930,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00930
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Thank you. Therefore, Mr Leong has changed his mind, it appears, Sir, from last year.",1,931,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00931

2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Okay, what I was referring to was at the point of appointment, the year of appointment, the point when he was appointed, he was still a foreigner. But anyway, when I made that statement, I was not in any way, having Mr Piyush Gupta in mind. I was just talking about the many CEOs that DBS had got; they never had a succession plan. That was the intention. But, that is okay. Being one of the top lawyers in Singapore, maybe the Law Minister could make some interpretations and ask me in that way.",1,939,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00939
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sorry, Sir, can I ask that the natural interpretation of a statement that ""I have deep disappointment that DBS is still without a homegrown CEO"". At a time that a naturalised Singaporean is a CEO, the normal interpretation, whatever may be the workings of Mr Leong's mind, the normal interpretation would be that he is disappointed that it is Mr Gupta and not a homegrown Singaporean. Would that not be the natural interpretation, Sir?",1,940,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00940
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Mr Leong, would that be a fair interpretation of what you have said?",1,941,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00941

2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"A point of clarification, Sir. I did expressly say we leave aside whatever Mr Leong may have intended. I am simply asking whether what I have said is a fair interpretation, natural interpretation of what he said.",1,943,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00943

2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"I think the question is, whether it is fair for anyone in public to interpret it the way as Minister has put across. Because that was what was said, I remembered, I think many of us would remember that. A few of us raised our eyebrows, because we were wondering what exactly you meant.",1,946,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00946

2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker:,"So, would it be fair that that is how people would interpret it, notwithstanding whatever your intent might be? Because what we say in Parliament matters, because that is how the public will perceive it. Which is why the choice of words and phrases is important.",1,948,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00948
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,That was not my interpretation.,1,949,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00949
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,That is not the question at hand. Would that be interpreted the way it has been put across by the Minister?,1,950,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00950
2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,I would say some minority of the people might interpret it that way.,1,951,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00951

2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sir, I will just move on. I will just, for the record, set out exactly what was said by Mr Leong. He said and I quote  ""I am deeply disappointed now ..."", that these are the points that he was speaking, ""...because 22 years later after Mr –"" and I assume after Mr Wong's appointment in 1998, ""...DBS is still without a homegrown CEO"". It is open and shut. He meant 2020 and Mr Gupta was appointed in 2009. I think we can at least be honest with each other when the words are in black and white.",1,957,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00957
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I would say, Sir, to this House, it is not wrong that we welcome talent when people are committed enough to take up citizenship. It is wrong to have an issue with new citizens and PRs from specific countries because it is quite clear what Mr Leong and PSP were doing. It is race-baiting and nationality-baiting without beating about the bush. And that is what the words of this Motion suggest. None of this is to deny the legitimate concerns of Singaporeans. None of this is to deny that there are people who have lost jobs, that there are people in their 40s and 50s, in particular, who are very concerned and that we have to do everything we can to help them and we have to stand by with them.",2,958,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00958
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But I think race-baiting, nationality-baiting, putting down Motions and then coming to Parliament and saying, ""well, I don't know, I don't have a view on the legal provisions"", when your party has made it a point from day one to attack the legal provisions. I think none of those helped.",3,959,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00959
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Based on his speech, Sir, Mr Leong has painted such a dark picture of what is going on in Singapore, which really bears little resemblance to reality. Is it that locals are being pushed out of PMET jobs on a large scale? We have created over 300,000 local PMET jobs. In fact, locals take up 80% of all PMET jobs.",4,960,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00960
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Can we do better? I think we ought to do better by the people who have lost their jobs or who are underemployed.,5,961,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00961
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Is it that our Universities have produced graduates who cannot get jobs? Over the past 10 years, nine in 10 graduates have been employed within six months after graduation, with starting salaries rising steadily. I think it is demeaning and dismissive of all the good people in our Universities and Polytechnics working hard to train our students, to say that they are producing people who cannot get employed. And it is untrue.",6,962,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00962
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Would Singapore be consistently ranked highly on the UN's Human Development Index if Singaporean were oppressed in the labour market, if incomes have not risen and productivity stalled?",7,963,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00963
2021-09-14-T-012,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"What we have is not perfect. It is not perfect anywhere in the world and we have to consistently work to improve. But it is not the picture that Mr Leong is describing. And I would say Mr Leong's views have been so completely distorted by his lack of understanding of CECA and his eagerness to attack Indians and CECA. And I would say what his party and Mr Leong are doing is one of the worst types of political opportunism – using race as a bait. Thank you, Sir.",8,964,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00964

2021-09-14-T-012,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,The reason why we raised this Motion has nothing to do with race or xenophobia. We will continue to debate on why we think the situation in Singapore is far worse than what the Government has presented to Singaporeans. Okay? We will debate again.

At their core, both Motions concern the employability of the Singapore worker and PMETs.",1,970,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00970
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, our local population acutely feels the consequences of Singapore being an open economy, with a large number of foreigners working amongst us and living next to us. On this lived reality, fundamental questions that have come up in the last two decades include  where does the Singapore worker stand and what are his or her job prospects in our hub economy? These questions will continue to come up more regularly than ever, as we move into a post-COVID-19 future.",2,971,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00971
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"My colleagues, Members He Ting Ru, Leon Perera, Gerald Giam and Jamus Lim, will also participate in this debate, with perspectives on both Motions and suggestions on the way forward.",3,972,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00972
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"My speech is in three parts. First, I will set out the Workers' Party's stand on free trade agreements (FTAs) and the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA). This part will be brief. Second, I will iterate the public sentiments on job insecurity felt by Singaporeans. Third, I will make a few suggestions on what should be done to alleviate the concerns of Singaporeans and ensure that the local/foreigner employment divide does not become a permanent fault line.",4,973,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00973
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, let me first start by stating the Workers' Party's position on FTAs and CECA. First, we accept that FTAs have encouraged investments and created jobs and opportunities for both Singaporeans as well as foreigners. This is undeniable.",5,974,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00974
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Second, we note the Government's explanation that CECA does not allow Indian nationals free rein to enter Singapore and that the entry of foreigners who seek employment is regulated by the Government and, specifically, MOM's work pass policies. However, we believe that it is fair to ask whether the Government and MOM, for many years past, have failed to regulate work passes in the best way possible. I note that the Minister for Manpower recently announced that anti-discrimination legislation will be introduced. This is one of the things that the Workers' Party has called for in its manifesto.",6,975,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00975
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Third, the Workers' Party does not assume that good jobs are automatically created for Singaporeans by virtue of Singapore's pro-trade policies and a strong network of FTAs, including CECA. We believe that, for a few groups, such as the sandwiched class, workers who lack skills and lower-income Singaporeans, the opposite may well occur. These groups may see depressed wages and fewer good job opportunities.",7,976,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00976
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Our view is that the Government needs to intervene aggressively through policy or legislation to ameliorate this and ensure the availability of stronger safety nets for Singaporeans who cannot make the transition. The Government must ensure that Singaporeans are not discriminated against during their job search or at the workplace; that our education and training systems provide skills that are workplace-ready; and that skills are transferred to Singaporeans by foreign talent. Finally, the Government should proactively report on the costs and benefits of our FTAs across time, a subject Member Jamus Lim will touch on as well.",8,977,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00977
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Workers' Party also notes that there have been some elements in our society or perhaps from abroad that have used CECA as a dog-whistle, masquerading racism for genuine economic concerns. The Workers' Party accepts that genuine economic concerns exist and that it is fair to raise concerns about them. However, we abhor and denounce the racism and xenophobia that have become a part of the public narrative in some quarters. Some have gotten carried away resorting to loose and vile language online as an outlet for their frustration, something they would not do in person, or worse, extended this behaviour to the real world. This can never be right, and must also be rejected and condemned.",9,978,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00978
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I now move to the second part of my speech  public perceptions on job insecurity. Mr Speaker, the Government would accept that there have been long simmering emotions amongst a sizeable number of Singaporeans surrounding CECA and, more generally, over the perception that Singaporeans are denied fair opportunities in the job market. Some of this has resulted in highly-charged conversations and incidents, both online and offline, even without the PSP's focus on this subject.",10,979,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00979
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Immigration and the job prospects of locals are not only issues for Singaporeans. Globalisation has meant that the local populations of many countries, particularly advanced economies, share such concerns. As a young nation, these feelings of insecurity and dislocation can shake our national cohesion, with the country being unrecognisable to the one many of us grew up in.",11,980,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00980
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Job displacement is very emotionally jarring, especially when your HR department tells you that your role has been made redundant, only for you to later find out that your job has been rejigged and filled by a foreigner. It is also upsetting for Singaporeans when they learn that a foreigner has filled a job position for which a Singaporean is suitably qualified.",12,981,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00981
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The emotions that we see today, while directed differently – towards Indians in some cases – have been directed at other communities in the past. As noted by Minister for Manpower in his Ministerial Statement in July and I quote, ""In the 2000s, we experienced a similar situation when the share of PRCs in our foreign workforce increased significantly, before tapering as China's growth took off. Both then and now, the large numbers did not go unnoticed and created frictions within our communities."" An important distinction between the vitriol directed against the PRC workers was that many of them were employed in low- to middle-income sectors, while there has been an acute focus on Indian professional workers today.",13,982,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00982
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Today, the influx of employees of Indian ethnicity – not all of whom are from India, some are from the US and elsewhere – taking up competitively paying jobs has also activated emotions in a not small number of Singaporeans. Some ask, ""why can’t our people do those jobs?"" After all, our students score so well on standardised tests. Our much-vaunted education system should have put our workforce in a much better position. This is a subject Member Gerald Giam will speak more about in his speech.",14,983,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00983
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Our sense of home is also affected when some EP and S Pass holders struggle to speak, let alone communicate in our workplace lingua franca – English – which represents a fundamental basis around which we organise public affairs in Singapore. When this happens, some Singaporeans stop feeling that we are one Singapore, all rowing in the same direction.",15,984,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00984
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Those Singaporeans who ride on the opportunities created by a growing economy, or who are new immigrants doing well economically, can more readily accept the new status quo. It is a small price to pay and one can interpret the new reality as the price of progress and economic growth. But for those who lose their jobs, see their incomes stagnate and fear for their children's prospects in a competitive Singapore – and these are commonly the sandwiched class and low-income Singaporeans – strong feelings are aroused, with many feeling that the playing field is uneven and the Government is slow to protect Singaporeans in their own land.",16,985,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00985
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Ordinary Singaporeans do not delve into the intricacies of FTAs. Instead, they look around and come to conclusions based on what they perceive and experience. If Singaporeans have not for years been seeing foreigners occupying well-paying jobs while qualified Singaporeans are unemployed or underemployed, we would not be talking about this today.",17,986,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00986
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Over the last two decades, the effect of the Government's immigration and foreign talent policies has been so pervasive that former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong covered the subject in his autobiography released only a few months ago, the second part of his autobiography, and I quote, “….take PRs, for example. In the years before, the numbers rose to 50,000, then 70,000 a year. It was nearly 80,000 in 2008! I was surprised and annoyed. I told the Prime Minister so. Since then, we have kept the numbers to around 30,000 PRs every year. But even then, when you add the numbers up over the years, you will begin to feel the cumulative effects within the society and in daily living…"" Then he goes on, "" ...as a government, we needed to monitor the inflows of PRs and foreign workers as well as demographic changes more closely. No surprise that the people reacted in the way they did….the negative ground sentiment went beyond crowdedness. It also encompassed perceived job competition from foreigners and preference of some companies for foreigners over Singaporeans.” Unquote.",18,987,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00987

2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, I now move on to the third part of my speech on what needs to be done to repair the local/foreign divide.",20,989,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00989
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I make five suggestions which I will elaborate on in turn. One, policies and procedures must be introduced to more effectively promote and track skills transfers from foreigners to Singaporeans; two, fixed-term EPs tied to skills transfers should be considered; three, the problem of underemployment must be tracked and solved; four, the Government should consider setting up a Parliamentary Standing Select Committee dedicated to overseeing this issue of jobs and foreign employment; and five, the Government needs to communicate more and much better on jobs and foreign employment that it has been doing up to now.",21,990,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00990

2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),My first suggestion is that the Government should double down on how it monitors the success of skills transfer initiatives which are generously funded with taxpayers’ money. Do skills transfer initiatives work and to what extent?,23,992,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00992
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I spoke about the Capability Transfer Programme (CTP) during the Committee of Supply debates this year. This Government programme has been extended to 2024 and, in its own words, seeks to, I quote, “support pervasive innovation throughout the economy and build deep capabilities in our local workforce to support companies, associations and professional bodies to speed up the transfer of global capabilities into Singapore”, unquote. Does it do what it promises?",24,993,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00993
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"There has to be a reckoning, a balance sheet drawn up, where the successes and shortcomings of such initiatives to transfer skills to Singaporeans are properly accounted for and assessed across sectors and industries. In response to my queries in Parliament, the Government reported that $5 million has been spent over the last five years and this initiative has benefited 970 Singaporeans. Without more, this does appear underwhelming.",25,994,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00994
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I note that the CTP is only one arrow in the Government’s quiver, but this only reiterates the point that a holistic assessment and reporting of the transfer of skills from foreigners to Singaporeans is necessary. I suggest that the extent of skills transfer from foreigners to locals be publicly tracked, monitored and reported as a Key Performance Indicator, or KPI, for each sector in the revised Industry Transformation Roadmaps under ITM 2.0. As each industry is tracked, reasons should be given why skills can or cannot be transferred. It should also be clearly stated how these gaps are being plugged.",26,995,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00995
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Second suggestion  fixed-term EPs. To ease the insecurity felt by the Singaporean worker or PMET, Mr Speaker, I restate a proposal raised by my colleague Member of Parliament Leon Perera, at the Committee of Supply debates in March. He suggested fixed-term EPs that are tied to the training of, or skills transfer to Singaporean workers.",27,996,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00996
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Currently, employers expect the EP of foreigners to be routinely renewed. A fixed-term EP would be one that would only be renewed if the applicant company can prove that, under the previous EP, Singaporean workers in the company or in the industry have benefited from skills upgrading. This new category of work pass can be piloted in newer, disruptive industries, such as autonomous vehicles and AI, where there should be no reason why Singaporeans should not be the candidates of choice. I hope MOM can look into such alternative proposals to secure tangible and positive outcomes for the Singapore worker or PMET by tracking skills transfer to our people.",28,997,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00997
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Third  underemployment. The Government needs to track and solve underemployment. Workers' Party Chair Ms Sylvia Lim, in her Committee of Supply speech in 2016, suggested that underemployment should be measured. MOM said at the time that time-related underemployment is the only internationally accepted statistical definition of underemployment and since it is recommended by the International Labour Organization or ILO, Singapore follows that norm.",29,998,2021-09-14-T-012-S-00998

These workers are not undertaking work for which they were trained, for example, engineers working as private hire drivers. Some reskilling initiatives for these workers may be necessary to better align their foundational capabilities. Yet others may have made the transition out of choice. Better measurement and regularly reporting of such underemployment would also enable Singaporeans to assess the Government’s efforts in this regard. An accurate understanding of skills-based underemployment would also have the knock-on effect of ensuring that the selection criteria for work pass applicants would be more accurately scoped. The Workers’ Party suggests that there is an urgent need to publicly track underemployment amongst Singaporeans and to publish such findings.",31,1000,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01000
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"My fourth suggestion is that there should be a check and balance of a dedicated platform where the policy-makers can be questioned, and this is the suggestion of a permanent Parliamentary Standing Select Committee dedicated to the issue of jobs and foreign employment.",32,1001,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01001

2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"First, such a committee would closely monitor the Government’s efforts by tracking unemployment and underemployment and job-related data, in addition to calling witnesses to give evidence. Such a committee could also ensure that Singaporeans are getting a fair shake at the workplace and address concerns on job security and employment prospects of Singaporeans, including where training and skills upgrading opportunities lie.",34,1003,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01003
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Second, such a committee, by virtue of increased transparency and signature, compared to the current status quo, would minimise mischievous attempts at stoking xenophobia and unreasonable expectations of job protection regardless of competence.",35,1004,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01004
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In other parliamentary standing democracies, such permanent Parliamentary Standing Select Committees on fundamental national matters that are appropriately resourced and supported by a strong secretariat, are par for the course.

2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"My fifth suggestion is that the Government needs to communicate more and much better than it has been doing till now on foreign employment. And by this, I mean giving factual information so that public debate can be better informed. And this calls for a change of culture. A philosophical change. The Government should have started doing this years ago. Quite clearly, this feeling of displacement and heightened sensitivity was the order of the day well before CECA entered the public lexicon in the way it has done over the last few months. As early as August 2015, the Government fact-checking website, Factually, put out an article titled ""Does CECA allow firms to hire Indian professionals in Singapore without valid work passes, or without adhering to fair employment guidelines?"" The fact that such an article was needed and put out there suggests that the Government was fully aware that CECA was in danger of becoming a fault line many years ago.",37,1006,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01006
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In July, when Minister Ong Ye Kung and Minister Tan See Leng made their Ministerial Statements, I shared with this House that more than five years prior in 2016, my Parliamentary colleague, Workers' Party Member of Parliament Leon Perera, asked the then Minister for Manpower a straightforward Parliamentary Question on the number of Intra-Corporate Transferees (ICTs) through CECA. Specifically, Mr Leon Perera asked how many ICTs from India had been approved under CECA from its first year to the latest year for which data was available. Then Manpower Minister, Mr Lim Swee Say, replied, and I quote  “ICTs from any country, including India, would need to meet the Ministry’s work pass qualifying criteria to work in Singapore. The only difference is that ICTs from all countries are exempted from the advertisement requirement in our Jobs Bank. The Ministry does not disclose data on foreign manpower with breakdown by nationality, including data on ICTs.” Unquote.",38,1007,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01007
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),The Government simply refused to answer a question of national relevance for which data was readily available. Is this acceptable? Can Singaporeans be blamed for assuming that the numbers must have been so huge that the Government saw fit not to reveal them?,39,1008,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01008
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To say that no other government reveals information to the granularity requested ignores the fact that Singapore is sui generis – of its own class.

2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Government’s position on revealing ICT information seemed to change with Minister Tan See Leng’s speech in Parliament in July.

So, I will share some numbers to address the misconceptions and allow for a meaningful engagement of the issue.” Unquote.",41,1010,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01010
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Minister Tan See Leng revealed that the number of ICTs from India was a low figure of 500 in the year 2020. But I should point out that this was a number after the onset of COVID-19. Quite obviously, there must have been a reduction of Indian nationals entering Singapore in 2020 compared to the previous years.",42,1011,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01011
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The ICT numbers that Mr Leon Perera asked for in 2016 would allow us to make a better assessment of the impact of ICTs under CECA compared to other FTAs. Revealing the numbers would promote a fact-based conversation. The Government’s initiative to release only the ICT figures for 2020, instead of placating CECA detractors, may actually have the opposite effect  it begs the question of what the figures for the earlier years were.",43,1012,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01012
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To help us base today’s debate on facts, may I call on the Government to now answer the question asked by Mr Leon Perera in 2016  how many ICTs have come from India under CECA from 2005 to 2019?",44,1013,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01013
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"As far as the release of information from the Government is concerned, may I add that I read Minister Tan See Leng’s speech with an implicit caveat that the Government’s release of information on such matters would likely continue to be reactive and when it suits the Government, rather than proactive and when it suits the people. I would be delighted to stand corrected on this, but if I am right that the Government prefers to remain reactive, I would suggest to the Government that this approach can no longer hold water, nor should it, a point Member of Parliament He Ting Ru will make in her speech as well.",45,1014,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01014
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"This desire to interrogate facts communicated by the Government will only increase, a point that I have shared previously in this House. The Government must share detailed facts that matter to the public and not only consolidated facts that broadly support the Government’s position. For example, since July, the Government has been using the digital notice boards located at every ground floor lift lobby in HDB blocks to launch an aggressive campaign to address the concerns surrounding CECA. This is understandable. One prominent figure in the digital notices is that 97,000 Singaporeans have benefited from CECA.",46,1015,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01015
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"But where should Singaporeans go when they want more details? For example, at what wage levels were these jobs? Which industries benefited? Were these jobs part-time or full-time ones? This also invites the question of correlation and causation. Is it possible that these are net jobs created by firms since 2005 that are in India through CECA? If so, that does not necessarily mean that the advantages afforded by CECA created those jobs. Such information is not provided in the displays.",47,1016,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01016
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I do not believe such additional information is a bridge too far, if the Government wants to clear the air. Surely, it would not be too difficult to incorporate additional detailed information or have it available by way of a QR code in the digital notice display. As intimated earlier, particularly for an issue as sensitive as this, the default position of the Government should be to release more information and explain the situation.",48,1017,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01017
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, the Government remains in the most privileged position to move swiftly to assuage public concerns or misunderstanding. The Government needs to reflect on its own omissions and resistance when it comes to providing data and information, and how it ought to take some responsibility for the groundswell of misinformation about CECA.",49,1018,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01018
2021-09-14-T-012,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Many Singaporeans receive news and information through social media. Much of the racist vitriol and xenophobia directed at Indians over CECA can be found online and from anonymous posts. In 2018, the report of the Select Committee for Deliberate Online Falsehoods identified particular traits within the ecology of social media, such as confirmation bias, the illusory truth effect, and the slow drip of falsehoods. Such realities make it more important to be forthcoming and aggressive in releasing information.",50,1019,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01019

2021-09-14-T-012,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),This clause on the movement of 127 professionals in an agreement signed by the governments of two countries sends a strong message of welcome to Indian professionals. To ignore this effect and conclude that the presence or absence of this clause does not change anything since it is still subject to our manpower policies and criteria is being blinded to reality by technicalities.,14,1066,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01066
2021-09-14-T-012,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"Consider two different countries, one with whom we signed an agreement on the movement of labour and another without. The agreement imposes an obligation to grant work permissions to nationals from the first country, provided our manpower policy requirements are met, but no such obligations exist with respect to nationals from the latter country. So, the agreement forms the first gate and our manpower policies form the second gate.",15,1067,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01067

2021-09-14-T-012,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"If we impose only a minimum salary requirement and open up all jobs beyond that salary to fair competition globally, then, when our small population competes fairly with the huge global population for those jobs, mathematically speaking, we can expect a significant proportion of the jobs to go to foreigners. As the world becomes more integrated, it will only get more so.",18,1070,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01070
2021-09-14-T-012,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"So, while fair competition sounds ideal, it is neither tenable nor practical.

2021-09-14-T-012,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"While not all the 300,000 increase in citizens and PRs are holding PME jobs, it still suggests that a significant portion of the 380,000 increase in local PME jobs could have come from a change in the status of the job holders and not due to the creation of new jobs.",26,1078,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01078

I think this may be a too simplistic analysis. Tighter labour market alone, by removing all foreign PMETs, does not necessarily result in higher median wages.

PMEs are most concerned with the lack of job security amidst this outlook, and their need for more support in employment and training opportunities. This is especially so as the Singapore economy continues to experience ripple effects and challenges of the COVID-19 situation and other factors like technological advances and digitalisation. These challenges seem to impact our mature PMEs aged between 40 and 60 more, as they attributed their age as the key reason for their plight. Mature PMEs have voiced concerns about displacement, disruption and the issue of competition in a globalised and fast-changing economy.",11,1137,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01137

While we take cognisance that many measures and policies, including the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP), the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF), Triple Weak Scrutiny, tightening of requirements for S Pass and EPs, including the formation of the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) and so on, had been put in place over the years to minimise unfair hiring and workplace practices.",15,1141,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01141

HR practitioners, especially those in the recruitment functions, play a vital role in ensuring that the companies adhere to the employment legislation and regulations to improve compliance with fair employment practices. They are also the advocates for the recruitment of Singaporeans in positions within their companies. It is, therefore, important we move towards increasing certification and accreditation of HR practitioners, as well as providing shared HR services for SMEs.",21,1147,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01147

These are suggestions we have raised in the past many years and I am glad the Leader of the Opposition has also weighed in on this; and third, strengthening TAFEP to take decisive action against errant employers who pay lip service to the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF).",22,1148,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01148

For a start, employers and businesses can partner NTUC and the Labour Movement in this journey. In this age of disruption, digitalisation, transformation and the next normal, the tripartite partners need to stand even more united together to support, enable and ensure our workers stay ready, relevant and resilient  ready with the new skills, relevant to the new jobs and resilient to the new changes.

Our reliance on foreign labour, whether skilled labour or the low-wage migrants we see taking up the slack as carers in our medical and social systems, as live-in help for households, and also for building sites, may prove to be our Achilles heel if we assume that we can simply turn on the tap for these roles to be fulfilled at any time, and that the workers will come in.

Second, these phenomena have, indeed, intensified the friction between the local and foreign workers. In many ways, these problems are avoidable. The key lies in whether Singaporeans, foreign workers and even the authorities are making an effort to integrate them into the society.",40,1192,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01192
2021-09-14-T-012,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Faced with challenges brought about by globalisation, we must cast aside our prejudices and discrimination, especially in the workplace. In this respect, anti-discrimination legislation in Parliament is a right move. If we do not face these negative sentiments squarely, misunderstandings may well become deeper. In addition, the authorities and decision-makers should be more proactive in information disclosure, based on the principle of information transparency, so that we can engage in realistic discussions, avoid misunderstandings from happening or deepening and prevent social tensions from escalating unnecessarily.",41,1193,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01193
2021-09-14-T-012,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"(In English)  To conclude, immigration and foreign manpower have been heated issues in Singapore for many, many years. CECA and FTAs are but the latest iterations of the debate.",42,1194,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01194
2021-09-14-T-012,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"This is a difficult, complicated topic and an issue that many other nations continue to struggle with. We must, therefore, create a strong ecosystem for conversation, interaction and disagreement on the topics at hand. We must say no to a continued top-down approach to immigration where we are told what is good for us.",43,1195,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01195
2021-09-14-T-012,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"The danger is that, over time, resentment continues to build, and anti-immigrant sentiment spills over into nasty incidents where there is a heavy element of racism and xenophobia that also affect our Singaporeans as well, such as the unfortunate events that we have seen in recent months.",44,1196,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01196
2021-09-14-T-012,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"I hope the Government will take this as an opportunity to rethink the way these topics have been managed and discussed so far and, instead, lean more into enabling conversations on the ground to change hearts and minds rather than continue to debate what is best for Singaporeans and dictate our story for us.",45,1197,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01197
2021-09-14-T-012,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Mr Speaker, with your permission, I beg to move amendments to the Motion proposed by the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament from the PSP. [A copy of amendments handed to Mr Speaker.]",46,1198,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01198
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,The Member has moved to propose the amendment as follows,1,1199,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01199

2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"And replace them with a similar paragraph as what they have proposed earlier to the other Motion, which is ""by proactively releasing information on jobs and employment prospects of Singaporeans and the costs and benefits of free trade agreements and foreign worker policies, with a view to formulating better policies to ensure Singaporeans secure good jobs in Singapore and are not disadvantaged when seeking employment.""",3,1201,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01201
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,I am of the view that the last paragraph is similar to what you have proposed in a previous Motion and we should confine that to that Motion so that Members can vote accordingly.,4,1202,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01202
2021-09-14-T-012,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Your proposal to delete the words ""and the provisions on Movement of Natural Persons in some free trade agreements like the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement"" substantively changes the tone of what that Motion was about in the first place, which is being debated.",5,1203,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01203

2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, free trade agreements, or FTAs, are important for our economic development and, hence, the well-being of our people. FTAs are always a compromise. As in any negotiation, we give something away to get something back. Singapore has import duties on hardly any categories of physical goods. So, we have little to give away unless we open up our services sectors or our labour market further.",2,1208,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01208
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I am glad that the Government has clarified that it maintains an intent to continue maintaining close control over the granting of foreign work passes without any FTA provision diluting that and this is a commitment that this House will, I am sure, hold this Government and future governments to.",3,1209,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01209
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Because FTAs are a negotiated compromise, at any one point in time, it is necessary to review these agreements from time to time to ensure that what we have given away is not proved too much and what we are getting back is as good as what we expected. Therefore, I echo the calls made by the Leader of the Opposition and my colleague, Member of Parliament for Sengkang, Ms He Ting Ru, to regularly study the impact of our FTAs, to engage research to quantify the net economic benefit over costs.",4,1210,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01210
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Furthermore, it is vital that the Government engages our SMEs when negotiating FTAs and FTA reviews. I raised this at MTI's Committee of Supply (COS) in March 2020 and through a Parliamentary Question in March 2017. The reply stated that there were roundtables and engagements conducted but numbers were not given.",5,1211,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01211
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Anecdotally, some SMEs on the ground do not feel that their views factor substantially into FTA negotiations, which, they perceive, may be conducted more from the perspective of creating incentives for MNCs to hub in Singapore to invest abroad.",6,1212,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01212
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I believe more can be done to gather feedback from SMEs to bring into FTA negotiations, something countries like New Zealand, when defending its dairy industry in the TPP negotiations, for example, seem adept at.",7,1213,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01213
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Moreover, the Government should regularly assess local FTA utilisation rates and perceived benefits to see if the other country is delivering on its market access commitments. FTA utilisation rates by SMEs should be published to help all stakeholders assess our efforts in public debate. Many SMEs do not fully utilise FTAs when they go abroad, for reasons that range from lack of awareness to lack of administrative bandwidth. More can be done to make these FTA benefits visible and usable by our local firms, for instance, the idea of a one-stop whole-of-Government portal, which could allow SMEs to transact with the Government and utilise Government schemes that I have spoken about in this House in the past. Such a portal could be used to allow SMEs to gain visibility on FTA benefits in different countries and enable them to transact to realise those benefits online.",8,1214,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01214

2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, in the decades after Singapore's Independence, there was no mass anxiety about the role of foreigners in our economy, at least comparable to what we see now. It was widely recognised that they play a useful role. The same is not true of every country in the world. Singapore's attitude towards the presence of foreigners and fixed-term stays and those who choose to make Singapore their permanent home used to be more liberal to my mind than that you see in some Asian countries I can think of. That culture was shaped perhaps by around 200 years of history as a free port and open trading economy. The sense then was that the rising tide of liberal economics would lift all boats.",11,1217,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01217
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"This is no longer the case. There is widespread anxiety, frustration and angst about the role of foreigners in the economy, as all the Motions put forth in this House today acknowledge to some degree. I want to share, Sir, two stories about how these things came home to me.",12,1218,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01218
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, I met a Singaporean delivery rider in full uniform at a coffee shop in the Serangoon ward of Aljunied GRC who told me, at length, with tears in his eyes, that he was laid off from his job as an aerospace engineer whereas some foreigners at his company were not, and he is now struggling to keep his family afloat.",13,1219,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01219
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Secondly, I met an SME business owner who said that she cannot find Singaporeans to do trades jobs.

2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, Sir, these concerns revolve around three ""Ts"".",15,1221,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01221
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, a deficit in trust, the first T; the sense that some Singaporeans have that they face some degree of discrimination in the job market by foreign talent hiring their compatriots.",16,1222,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01222
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Secondly, a deficit in transferability, the second T; the sense that there are poor pathways for Singaporeans to learn skills from foreign talents in advance. This current mood is very different from the sense people had in the 1970s and 1980s, with foreign investments from the US, Europe and Japan. To my mind, back then, there was a palpable sense that skills and know-how were being transferred by foreign companies and foreigners to locals through in-house training and foreign-Singapore joint training institutes, for example.",17,1223,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01223
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Thirdly, a deficit in transparency, the third T; there is angst about why foreigners seemed to leapfrog Singaporeans in some contexts in spite of our much-vaunted education system, even though those foreigners sometimes come from countries with less recognised education systems.",18,1224,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01224
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I should say that a transparency deficit is also felt by another group – local business owners. They wrestle with the issue of hiring talent and often say that Singaporeans do not want to do trades jobs. So, why is the supply of foreigners for those jobs being curbed?",19,1225,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01225
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, one antidote to the trust deficit is anti-discrimination laws, something that the Workers' Party has championed in its General Election 2020 manifesto and in this House. I am glad that the Government is now moving in this direction.",20,1226,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01226
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"One antidote to the transferability deficit is fixed-term EPs, the suggestion I made in this House previously in which the Leader of the Opposition alluded to. These would be foreign work passes granted for a fixed term with the understanding that the job has to be localised in that term and the pass, as a default, would not be renewed, unless the employer can demonstrate strong extenuating circumstances to appeal for a renewal. This differs from the current EP system, where many employees assume that they can renew their EPs and there is no assumption that the EPs would definitely not be renewed as a default. Sir, to be sure, we are not arguing for all EPs to be made fixed-term, but for some of them to possess this feature. Fixed-term work passes should be one tool in our toolkit not just to advance transferability of foreigners' skills towards locals.",21,1227,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01227
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"There are other tools that can be used to advance transferability that Workers' Party Members of Parliament in this House have argued for, such as stimulating cross-border remote working internships for our students and young adults with cutting-edge multinational corporations abroad which were not present in Singapore, for example.",22,1228,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01228
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"As for the antidote to the transparency deficit, the key is not just more public dialogues and communication between Government and citizens, vital though that is; the key is to set out long-term goals and clear policies to advance those goals. Let me expand on this issue of transparency.",23,1229,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01229
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, many Singaporeans are pained and confused about our foreign talent policy because they do not understand the rationale, the mechanics, the ends and the means. One major area where this angst is being felt is when it comes to education. Singaporeans do not understand why the Government keeps praising our education system but, in some employment contexts, foreigners seem to dominate or have a large share of the better-paying jobs. Has our education system groomed us with the wrong skills and attributes? Sir, we need to interrogate the gaps in our education system that contribute to these aspects of our employment landscape and address them aggressively. My parliamentary colleague, Mr Gerald Giam, will elaborate on what needs to be done on that front.",24,1230,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01230
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"For the remainder of my speech, I will speak about two areas of Government employment policy where the public, I sense, feels angst from a lack of transparency and whether the system is working in their best interests. And these two areas actually map onto the two anecdotes that I shared earlier.",25,1231,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01231
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, the notion that hiring foreigners is necessary to create good jobs for Singaporeans, even if the foreigners constitute a high share or a significant share of the better-paying jobs. I shall call this the numerical multiplier argument. Secondly, the subject of trades jobs that SMEs perceive Singaporeans no longer want to do. I will call this the trades jobs problem.",26,1232,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01232
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, the numerical multiplier argument. Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has articulated this argument before inside and outside this House. If I were to summarise it at the risk of oversimplification, it is the view that we do not have enough Singaporeans and not of the right skills and talent to do all the cutting-edge economic activities we want to do as a global hub city. So, we need to import foreign talent and, if we do that well, this creates good jobs for Singaporeans. We try to upskill and upwage Singaporeans. But if foreigners account for a large share of the better-paid jobs, it is still okay because Singaporeans are in good jobs that they might not have if the foreigners were not here. So, Singaporeans are absolutely better off, even if, sometimes, they may feel relatively worse off in the employment hierarchy. Or to put it another way, this argument is saying if Singaporeans want to always hog all the better-paying jobs, we will end up poorer in purchasing power terms. This argument stands, by the way, on solid ground in the field of political philosophy. It reminds me of the Rawlsian theory of justice I studied as an undergraduate. According to the philosopher, John Rawls, in a seminal work ""A Theory of Justice"", inequality could be justified if that inequality causes the least well-off person in a society to become better off in absolute terms. Honestly, Sir, there is much to be said for the numerical multiplier thesis and it can be found as the subtext to employment policies in many countries and cities.",27,1233,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01233
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"But to delve deeper into the empirical reality, what is of concern to many Singaporeans about this argument are a few things. One is the pathway to skills transfer, another is fair employment practices in a foreigner-heavy workplace. I have spoken about these already. But there are deeper and more subtle problems with the numerical multiplier argument. Or I should not say problems; maybe questions. A large population of foreigners to create jobs for Singaporeans places burdens on our scarce resources of land, healthcare capacity, road capacity, public transport and so on. It also runs the risk of entrenching work cultures that disadvantage Singaporeans in the longer term, especially if the foreigners start off from a higher skills base in a new industry. Initial endowments of resources, like skills, do weigh heavily on ultimate outcomes downstream. Being very reliant on foreign labour also means that we are vulnerable to global events that may make these foreigners less willing to come and work here one day. And that day may not come so soon, but it could come in our children's time, in our grandchildren's time.",28,1234,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01234
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"So, how do we get our workforce profile towards a ratio of foreigners and locals that would better address these issues? Sir, I would like to suggest that the EDB and our economic agencies, together with our Institutes of Higher Learning, work in sync to do a few things that would optimise this ratio, that would create good well-paying jobs for Singaporeans while managing the size of the population of foreigners and, hence, overall population pressures.",29,1235,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01235
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, can we attract foreign direct investment projects that are better matched to existing skillsets of Singaporeans or skillsets that Singaporeans can easily acquire?",30,1236,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01236
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Secondly, can we catalyse continuous education and training platforms to train Singaporeans in new skills ahead of demand? By ""ahead of demand"", I mean to attract Singaporeans to train for skills in industries that are nascent, that are newly emerging, confident that the Government is working with investors to groom and build those industries using all the tools in the toolkit. JTC and EDB building physical infrastructure ahead of demand was a key factor in our industrial success in the 1960s. The key to our Industry 4.0 success in the 21st century would be catalysing soft infrastructure, that is, skills, ahead of demand.",31,1237,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01237
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Thirdly, tie foreign direct investment incentives to a number of fixed-term EPs to ensure Singaporeans' pathway into new industries, as discussed earlier.",32,1238,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01238
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Fourthly, can we examine if we need to expand University education places for locals in disciplines necessary for future industries, thus managing the need to import foreign manpower with degrees from, in some cases, less highly ranked universities than our local ones? This ties to another Workers' Party manifesto point on expanding University capacity to 50% of the cohort size.",33,1239,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01239
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to speak about trades jobs, that it is said, Singaporeans do not want. By ""trades jobs"", I mean carpenters, plumbers, highly-skilled construction workmen and supervisors, air-conditioner technicians and so on and so forth. There is a huge transparency deficit here with our local business owners.",34,1240,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01240
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In the decades after Independence, many of these trades jobs were done by Singaporeans. But now, many SME owners believe that Singaporeans simply do not want such jobs. If this is true, it could be due to the overall growth of the economy and population base coupled with our low total fertility rate. It could also be due to the expansion of other more attractive jobs in other sectors. There is also the fact that many of our Polytechnic and ITE graduates as well as older PMETs are going into gig work rather than a trade. Many SME owners are adamant that even if they paid more for these jobs, Singaporeans do not want to do them.",35,1241,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01241
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"No ifs, no buts. One of them told me that when he attends construction training courses as a guest speaker, the only Singaporean trainees there are those with white hair. Yet, on the other hand, from a totally opposite perspective, another older gentleman I met on a market walkabout said that he was gainfully employed in the construction industry as a supervisor in his 20s and 30s. But now, all the jobs in this line have gone to foreigners. And even though he is willing to take a 50% pay cut from his last drawn construction industry pay, he cannot get a job. So, he became a private hire car driver. How do we reconcile these two different and seemingly contradictory perspectives?",36,1242,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01242
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, the Workers' Party has supported moves, such as the past tightening of DRC quotas, to curb over-reliance on foreign manpower. However, that cannot be the only solution. We need to deeply address the reasons why SME business owners say Singaporeans do not want to take up trades jobs. Quotas alone should not be the solution. To move more Singaporeans into trades job sustainably needs us to go beyond quotas to tackle a few things deeply. And here I move to my suggestions.",37,1243,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01243
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I have about six suggestions. I am not saying that these ideas are not already being looked at or have not been attempted. But, clearly, the results are not yet there and we are far away from success in outcomes rather than just success in efforts.",38,1244,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01244
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, let us implement an across-the-board minimum wage, as we have called for, and PWMs to ladder and upgrade wages on top of that. We do need to accept that prices have to rise as a result to ensure that businesses can survive.",39,1245,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01245
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Secondly, implement job redesign to upskill these jobs with state support for productivity-enhancing investments in a more ambitious way than has been done thus far, with both carrots and sticks. For example, can we introduce harder productivity conditions for Government contracts? And there should be clear long-term timelines for phasing out low productivity work, not ad hoc short-term changes to foreign manpower quotas done in an unpredictable fashion. Sir, our low construction productivity, to take one sector as an example, has not brought low construction costs. So, Workers' Party has argued before, with the right policies, there is no reason why we cannot attain developed country productivity in trades jobs to justify higher pay for those jobs.",40,1246,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01246
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Thirdly, investigate and fix negative non-wage characteristics of these trades shops. For example, do employers provide adequate equipment to ameliorate the physical downsides of such jobs, like proper gloves, boots, tools? Are trades jobs persons given proper break times and reasonable expectations on hours and working at short notice? Are they treated by bosses with respect? Are they given enough paid leave? These should all be studied and addressed. As I argued in this House a few months ago, no Singaporean will take a trades job at high pay if he or she knows that they will be treated with disrespect and have to put up with awful conditions. They may prefer to do gig work or a lowly-paid office job that attracts less pay with all the attendant dangers of obsolescence from technology that those kinds of jobs bring.",41,1247,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01247
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Fourthly, we need to enhance the prestige and standing of trades jobs. I do not have the luxury of time to elaborate on this particular point during this speech, but more can be done to try to shift expectations and attitudes. It is worth bearing in mind that trades jobs are highly respected in many countries around the world. I think continental European countries and Japan are examples that spring to mind.",42,1248,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01248
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Fifthly, we need to create pathways for some good trades persons who are foreigners to become citizens in small enough numbers, not to suppress but to supplement locals moving into these sectors, and then nudge those new citizens to transfer skills to more locals in the ways we have spoken about. Are such trades persons given the opportunity to become citizens now even if they have no university degree?",43,1249,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01249
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"And sixth – and this is another call the Workers' Party has made and the Leader of the Opposition has alluded to – we need to measure underemployment so that we can tackle it. This was a theme of a speech made by my party Chair Ms Sylvia Lim some years ago. Some gig jobs face long-term risk from technology. Today's underemployment can be tomorrow's unemployment. Can we shift local Singaporeans from some of these at-risk gig jobs to redesigned, revamped trades jobs?",44,1250,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01250
2021-09-14-T-012,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In conclusion, Sir, every country struggles to find the right balance between foreigners and locals in their economy and that balance changes from one era to another. In other developed countries, one often finds a more relaxed and liberal attitude towards foreign talent in big cities like London and New York, where even those in relatively lower-income trades jobs, like taxi drivers and restaurant staff, have often benefited from the rising tide that foreigners contribute to. But go to the towns and cities where living standards have stagnated or nosedived, like some of the opioid-ravaged midwestern towns in the US, and you sometimes find bitterness towards foreigners and the cancer of racism, together with the far-right, nativist politics that go along with that.",45,1251,2021-09-14-T-012-S-01251

Parliamentary rules made it clear that a PQ should not ask for information that is already publicly available. Nevertheless, in my reply to Ms Hazel Poa, I told her where to look for such data.

Many of our PRs either share family ties with Singaporeans or have studied, worked or lived here for some time. They contribute to our strengths as a society and our economy.

One group, in particular, concerns me – our older local PMETs. They have contributed to society and they are still able and willing to work. Yet, some amongst them have lost their jobs.

That was the year that big data and machine learning hit the mass market very rapidly. Companies were racing to build up digital teams. It created new roles which required new skills sets, while disrupting some existing roles and skills. Against this backdrop, our older PMETs faced competition, not so much from foreigners, but from technology and, possibly, also from younger Singaporeans who had the necessary skills.",16,1291,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01291

What he and his party spew, attacking CECA and FTAs and foreigners in general, has had an effect on IMD's assessment and on business sentiments, both here and overseas.

2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"I know that, by and large, Singaporeans are pragmatic and they understand that we need to remain open to global talents and stay connected. Some of them feel frustrated when they see a foreigner being hired, though he may not be able to do the job as well as a Singaporean, or simply because he has links with the hiring manager.",53,1328,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01328
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"We know these sorts of things happen.

2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yet, in spite of our work, the PSP continues to criticise our foreign workforce policies as being too lax. Today, we hear some ideas from them. They characterised our ""foreign talent policy"" as a conduit for quick immigration and a source of cheap labour and claimed that the qualifying salaries of S Passes and EPs are too low. They said that there is an unfair wage competition because employers do not have to pay the 17% CPF contribution for foreigners.",55,1330,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01330
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"They have asked us to raise the EP qualifying salary to $10,000 and the S Pass qualifying salary to $4,500. They have asked us to impose a $1,200 EP levy, to impose a 25% to 30% cap on work pass holders and PRs and to impose a hard nationality cap of 10% in each firm.",56,1331,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01331
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Mr Leong Mun Wai also laments that we do not have enough Singaporeans in leadership positions and elsewhere, he has suggested greater protection for top leadership roles.",57,1332,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01332
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Let me take each point in turn.,58,1333,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01333
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"First, on Mr Leong Mun Wai's claim that our qualifying salaries are too low and that there is unfair wage competition. I wonder whether Mr Leong is aware that the numbers he cited are the minimum qualifying salaries for EP and S Pass holders at the youngest ages. Does he know that our qualifying salaries rise with age to maintain a level playing field for our mature PMETs? For example, the EP qualifying salary for those in their 40s is around double the minimum qualifying salary.",59,1334,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01334
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,I would like to ask  has the PSP actually consulted businesses on what they think of our current policy?,60,1335,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01335
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Many businesses, including SMEs, are already crying out that they are not able to access the foreign PMETs that they need. We listen to them, we engage them, we help them transform and we help them find suitable Singaporeans. But, ultimately, we explain to them why we have to hold the line.",61,1336,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01336
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Leong Mun Wai has also repeated the point that foreign EP holders are cheaper to hire than locals because their employers do not make CPF contributions.,62,1337,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01337
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,I have already clarified this point on 6 July but let me do so again. The CPF is set aside for our retirement needs and it can also be used for housing. Foreign PMETs are not working in Singapore on a permanent basis and we are not responsible for their retirement adequacy or their home ownership needs. It does not make sense for us to extend the CPF coverage and benefits to them.,63,1338,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01338
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"I think everyone in this House knows the interest rate that we pay on our CPF contributions. I would not elaborate further. Fundamentally, our CPF system is designed to benefit our resident workers, not to help attract or deter foreigners.",64,1339,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01339
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"So, how do we maintain a level playing field? When reviewing the qualifying salary to maintain a level playing field, we take into account the CPF contributions as part of the cost to employers.",65,1340,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01340
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Ms Hazel Poa also highlighted the issue of false salary declarations and kickbacks as ways for employers to get around our work pass framework.,66,1341,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01341
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"MOM takes firm measures to safeguard the integrity of the work pass framework. False declarations of any sorts are an offence under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA). It carries a fine of up to $20,000, up to two years' imprisonment or both.",67,1342,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01342
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"The fact that Ms Hazel Poa is aware of this means she is also aware that MOM has been enforcing this and publicising our efforts to stamp out these illegal practices. At the same time, the PSP's solution is to raise the salary criteria for EP and S Pass holders significantly. Does the PSP think that this underlying problem will get better with their suggestion?",68,1343,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01343
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Second, imposing, a levy of $1,200 on all EP holders. This is easy enough for the Government to do. It also generates revenue. So, why do we not go down this route? Because at the EP level, our primary focus is on regulating quality. A levy would have the opposite effect. Employers have finite budgets for manpower.",69,1344,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01344
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Suppose an employer has set aside $10,000 a month for a new EP hire, a levy of $1,200 effectively reduces his budget to $8,800. This immediately narrows the pool of EP candidates from those willing to consider a salary of $10,000 and below to those willing to consider a salary of $8,800 and below. How would this benefit the employer or his Singaporean employees if the intention is to seek the best talents available?",70,1345,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01345
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"We would also be sending contradictory signals if we say that we welcome high-calibre global professionals to Singapore on the one hand and impose a levy on them on the other. So, instead of a levy, we focus on regulating quality through the EP salary criterion and this sets a high bar that EP holders must reach to work in Singapore and it raises their quality over time.",71,1346,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01346
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Third, imposing a 25% to 30% cap on work pass holders and Permanent Residents in the long run. First, I think PSP should know that we have quotas at the S Pass level. We have already been reducing the S Pass Sub-Dependency Ratio Ceiling over the past decade for the services sector. The services sector is currently at 10%, down from 25%, and there are ongoing cuts still taking place in all the other sectors.",72,1347,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01347
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"I have also explained why we do not set quotas at the EP level because there is fierce competition for global talent and worldwide shortages in areas, such as technology and digital skills. And doing so would send the wrong signal that we are not welcoming to such talent. Let me give a concrete example.",73,1348,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01348
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Take, for example, infrastructure financing. Since the 2000s, MAS has been promoting this because there is a huge infrastructure opportunity in Asia in the yawning financing gap. However, working in this area requires significant expertise, given the complex risk profile of infrastructure projects. In the early days, we did not have enough local talent to work in this area. Global banks, especially Japanese and European Banks, were the most active players in the initial phase and had the talent and the expertise. Mizuho Bank was one such bank that chose to set up a project financing team in Singapore. In 2003, Singaporeans accounted for 40% of its project financing team. Now, Singaporeans occupy 70% of a much larger office.",74,1349,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01349
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"If we have imposed the quotas up front, I doubt this would have happened.",75,1350,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01350
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"If PSP insists on the 30% quota, then I would like to ask, would you turn away a company that creates 69 high-end jobs for locals because it needs 31 foreigners from abroad? If PSP's prevailing assumption is that less foreigners means more jobs for locals, what would stop it from lowering this quota further to 20% or 10% or 0%?",76,1351,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01351
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Mr Leong Mun Wai had previously suggested that it is not good enough for Singaporeans to make up 70% of the workforce in the financial sector, but that it should be even higher at 80% or 90%. In which case, how do we remain and maintain our status as an International Financial Centre?",77,1352,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01352
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Fourth, imposing a hard nationality cap of 10% within each firm. Once you stack up a 30% cap on top of another 10% cap, it becomes clear that Mr Leong Mun Wai's policy can only make the environment so hostile that very few foreign investors will consider Singapore when building any business. Maybe no foreign investor will consider. To use the example of Mizuho Bank, the effect of Mr Leong's proposal is to tell a Japanese bank that only 10% of their workers can be Japanese nationals.",78,1353,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01353
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Nevertheless, as I have shared in my 6 July Ministerial Statement, we understand the tensions that can arise when a foreign nationality dominates and we have levers today to address this. The Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) watchlist identifies firms with high concentration of a single nationality. Their work pass applications are scrutinised for potential discriminatory hiring and the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) engages them.",79,1354,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01354
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"And as I had also shared, we are exploring further refinements to our EP framework to help us achieve our objectives of a strong Singaporean Core complemented by a diverse foreign workforce.",80,1355,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01355
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Finally, on Mr Leong Mun Wai's calls to ring-fence positions in top management for Singaporeans. Let me state simply that we helped Singaporeans rise to the top, not by protecting them, but by enabling them. Many companies have programmes in place to groom talent for leadership positions. Take Asia Pacific Breweries, for example. Their staff can participate in their Management Team and Beyond Fast Track programme, be rotated into positions globally and expand their skill sets.",81,1356,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01356
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"When companies first set up here, it is understandable that they will need to bring in many of their senior management to oversee the business here. If we protect the top management jobs for Singaporeans alone and companies decide not to invest here because of that, we would lose good jobs for our locals and the opportunity for them to take on the higher level positions in the future would also diminish. I worry that the PSP is calling for policies that are not only short-sighted but protectionist and this will do grave harm to Singaporeans.",82,1357,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01357
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"I would also like to address Mr Pritam Singh's idea of a time-limited EP to facilitate skills transfer. I should point out to Mr Singh that no work pass is issued indefinitely. At the point of renewal, employers must meet our prevailing criteria. The idea of a skills transfer requirement sounds good in theory but, in practice, it is not as straightforward to implement. The process of skills transfer is rarely linear or one-to-one. So, I do not think it makes sense for MOM to be the judge to set a fixed duration and force employers to let go of experienced work pass holders once their fixed term is up.",83,1358,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01358
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"I want to finally address our efforts to stamp out discrimination. Minister Lawrence Wong touched on the anti-discrimination legislation earlier, but I would like to address the PSP's claim that because FCF was introduced in 2014, fair consideration for our locals was not a priority before that. In fact, the tripartite partners have been issuing guidelines on fair employment practices over the past two decades, having introduced the tripartite guidelines on non-discriminatory job advertisements as early as 1999.",84,1359,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01359

2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"In 2014, the introduction of the FCF took these efforts one step further by introducing the job advertising requirement and we have been progressively strengthening the FCF ever since. We introduced the FCF watchlist in 2016, as a systematic framework for engaging firms, with outlier, workforce profiles and scrutinising them for potential discrimination.",89,1364,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01364
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"In 2020, we strengthened the penalties against firms found to have discriminatory hiring practices. In the same year, we extended the coverage of the FCF job advertising requirement to S Passes and doubled the minimum job advertising period from 14 to 28 days.",90,1365,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01365
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Ensuring responsible and fair employment practices has always been our priority. At the National Day Rally 2021 recently, Prime Minister Lee announced we are taking the next step of strengthening our enforcement against workplace discrimination through legislation. Members of the House, this is a major step, both philosophically and legally. This will cover discrimination on the grounds of nationality, in addition to other kinds of discrimination covered by the TGFEP and it sends a clear signal that discrimination of any kind is not tolerated.",91,1366,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01366
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"When you consider all the policies we have put in place, it is quite clear that we are providing strong support for the employment of local PMETs. Even Ms He Ting Ru has noticed and acknowledged our plans to legislate TAFEP guidelines.",92,1367,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01367
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Indeed, many companies tell us that they prefer to hire locals over foreigners, so long as they can find the skill sets here. Even if there is initially a shortage of skills, many are willing to develop local talent to fill these roles. Take, for example, PayPal. When it first started, it had to rely more heavily on global talent for specialised technical skills and more senior roles that required managing regional teams. However, PayPal committed to hire and train 150 Singaporeans across tech and business roles over three years.",93,1368,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01368
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,I acknowledge  there will always be more work to be done. I have said before in my past Statements that we are always a work-in-progress because we continue to refine and tweak and improve. We will always continuously refine our policies to secure the well-being and the livelihoods of Singaporeans in a post-pandemic world.,94,1369,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01369

2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Recently, the President of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr Roland Ng, wrote in a Lianhe Zaobao column that, “The business community agrees with the Government that it is important to secure good employment opportunities and outcomes for locals.

2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"I can understand their anxiety. Mature PMETs face challenges from multiple fronts. For example, the digitalisation and technological shifts have led to structural changes to the global economy. Companies require their employees to be equipped with related skill sets, but these could be different from what our mature PMETs were trained in. In addition, mature PMETs face competition not only from foreign workers in Singapore, but also younger Singaporeans who have received higher education.",99,1374,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01374

Confucius once said, ""At the age of 50, you know what fate has in store for you"". I find it very enlightening. As one approaches middle age, one would have gone through many ups and downs in life and acquired precious experiences along the way. At this age, one should be more adaptable to circumstances and not rigidly follow the rules, or be unwilling to consider new ideas. One should face all challenges calmly. Therefore, I urge everybody to continually upskill and reskill to adapt to new working environments. Only then, can we build a better future for ourselves and our families.",100,1375,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01375

But today, we are happy that we are here, that all of us recognise that there is a problem. But, of course, before I come to this debate, I know the problem is we cannot agree on the causes of the problem and the severity of the problem. As a result, our solutions will be very different.",2,1388,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01388

We also want an open society. How we maintain an open society, how we send the message to foreigners, it depends on how we Singaporeans get united and speak with one voice. Now, we have two voices  one from the Government, one from PSP; and maybe the other alternative parties as well because we got the feedback from the ground.",3,1389,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01389

So, we are here to discuss how to solve the problems. I did not say I agree with your policies. In fact, one of the reasons why we differ on our assessment of the situation is because I think for some of the basic assumptions, there is a big difference. But we will discuss again on that.

When we have time, I can actually segregate and explain to you the difference between PMETs, which are the equivalent of the EPs and S Passes; and PMEs, which are just the equivalent of the EPs. So, today, the statistics quoted to you are for 10 years, from 2010 to 2020. And it is about PMETs and the EPs and S Passes. So, I hope that clears it up.

That is more than 50%. So, I would urge Ms Hazel Poa not to drive this kind of separation and segregation.

We regularly publish unemployment rates for PRs and citizens. The unemployment rate of citizens has remained stable and low. Secondly, the PR population has also remained stable over the past decade at around 500,000 or half a million. So it is not, and it cannot be the case that most of the employment growth went to PRs.",2,1425,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01425
2021-09-14-T-015,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa,"Yes, but the PRs become citizens. So, there is a drop in the PRs and then the new foreigners go in to fill up the PR numbers. So, as a whole, the number of citizens plus PRs actually increases. That base increases, and, therefore, leading to an increase in the number of local PME jobs purely due to reclassification, not job creation. That is my point.

I also oppose the Motion proposed by Mr Leong Mun Wai to the extent that it states free trade agreements like CECA are responsible for the anxieties created for Singaporeans in relation to jobs.

As advisor to the Metal Industries Workers' Union, I have seen retrenchments take place and I have seen how businesses cope with difficulties. The usual cause of retrenchments is usually business difficulties or restructuring. This has nothing to do with free trade agreements. These are business realities.",2,1434,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01434

Global businesses are such that business cycles have become much smaller, there is a lot more volatility and people may need to change jobs because the world changes. Industries become redundant very quickly. Typically, in situations where redundancies take place, the reality is that it is usually the foreigners who lose their jobs first as work passes are not renewed.",4,1436,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01436

So, this is how we try to work with Singaporeans with job anxieties. And right now, the job anxieties are only going to get more. For those who retain jobs, especially in this current climate, there are many people who feel pressured working from home as well, because they fear potential redundancies. Maybe the bosses do not know that they are working, so they work longer hours. And I think all of this adds to Singaporeans' anxieties about jobs.",5,1437,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01437

Generally, the higher the tariffs, the less trade takes place as the cost of trading goes up. Reduction of tariffs encourages trade by reducing transaction costs. Free trade agreements also usually have provisions to facilitate the transfer of services to flow freely between countries. Consumers and businesses will, therefore, have choices to purchase goods and services from all over the world while producers of services can, likewise, look at more countries for a potential market place.",10,1442,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01442

Typically, these are a different species of agreements. These agreements usually permit countries to invest in each other and the host country would provide protections for such investments such as not to expropriate them. For those of you who have read about a more tumultuous past, there are many situations where foreign investors go into a country, and, because of political turmoil, those investments may get expropriated. So multilateral investment treaties provide that kind of minimum protection.",11,1443,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01443

There is language here on the free movement of persons. But what it allows is the free movement of persons for temporary purposes. This is primarily to facilitate people wishing to visit one country or another for business purposes. I am part of Rajah and Tann’s South Asia Desk and I have a number of clients from India. Generally, if any of them wishes to visit Singapore, they will need a sponsor from Singapore to indicate they are visiting for business purposes when they apply for a visa. And on this basis, they may be granted a visa to visit. The same applies for people who wish to visit for investments and the same thing applies to Singaporeans who wish to visit India. So, this facilitates the free movement of people to do business.",14,1446,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01446

The drivers for our long-term employment policies are our needs, as Dr Tan See Leng has explained very clearly in his Ministerial Statement. If it is felt we do not need that many people in a particular sector, or that Singaporeans can do the jobs, it is already within our power to do this and CECA does not change this.",16,1448,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01448

2021-09-14-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"At the same time, CECA potentially helps to create jobs for people by facilitating investments and trade. According to MTI, some 97,000 locals were employed in 2019 by organisations that invested in India.",18,1450,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01450
2021-09-14-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"If people in this House who have the ability and should research and look into things before coming, do their homework, I think we will probably be in a situation where we have clarity on these issues. I have heard feedback from many people in the Indian community about the discomfort they are feeling with the current anti-CECA stance being perpetuated, which is a thinly-veiled attack against Indians. Even the Leader of the Opposition has acknowledged it is a dog-whistle in some corners. Many in Singapore’s Indian community also get caught up and mistaken in this anti-foreigner torrent.",19,1451,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01451
2021-09-14-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"In some ways, I can understand why members of the public may have mistaken beliefs that treaties like CECA are causing foreigners to take their jobs. Essentially, they may be feeling job pressures and job losses, particularly during the pandemic. At the same time, they may see many foreigners, including Indian nationals, having jobs. But these jobs are in different sectors and these jobs, if the Singaporeans are eligible for them, they should apply for them. And if they are not given fair consideration, they can report to MOM and MOM will take action against the employers.",20,1452,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01452
2021-09-14-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"So, I think it is important for us to help solve misunderstandings and make it clear that even though there are foreigners who have jobs, they are not getting it by virtue of free trade agreements like CECA.",21,1453,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01453
2021-09-14-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"But Mr Leong Mun Wai also talked about the Population White Paper and said that this was a White Paper that proposed allowing foreigners to come into Singapore. I was actually in this House when the White Paper was being debated. And again, if you read the White Paper, it says very expressly, we cannot allow in an unlimited number of foreign workers. We do not want to be overwhelmed by more foreign workers than we can absorb or to expand our total population beyond what our island is able to accommodate.",22,1454,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01454
2021-09-14-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"So, if you look at the White Paper properly, it is really a very balanced Paper that looks at Singapore's long-term needs and how many foreigners we can accommodate within that framework.",23,1455,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01455
2021-09-14-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Against this backdrop, I think, to me, it is very clear that CECA and free trade agreements really have nothing to do with the anxieties Singaporeans face about jobs. There are very real anxieties Singaporeans face and the way to address those is to make sure we continue to create new jobs and be an attractive place for investments to come in.",24,1456,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01456

2021-09-14-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Currently, MOM already has the power to take away work passes for foreign workers for employers who engage in discriminatory practices. What potential anti-discrimination laws would do is also give the aggrieved individual a personal right, a personal remedy.

2021-09-14-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),I am glad that the Workers' Party does seem to have a lot of common ground with us.

2021-09-14-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"But I will have to stop short of supporting the amendments. I would actually be objecting to them. The main reason I am objecting to the amendments is firstly, they change the substance of the Motion.",29,1461,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01461
2021-09-14-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),This Motion is a very clear one. There are two Motions before this House. Mr Leong Mun Wai's Motion claims that Singaporeans' job anxieties are caused by free trade agreements like CECA. The Minister's Motion is quite different. It focuses on the measures we need to take to deal with Singaporeans' anxieties and denounces the link to CECA and free trade agreements.,30,1462,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01462
2021-09-14-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I think what Mr Pritam Singh is really trying to do is to include one of his pet topics – a request for more information – into this debate, which is really quite different from what the core of this debate is.",31,1463,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01463
2021-09-14-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The first amendment, of course, where he is changing the word ""supports Government action"" to ""calls for stronger Government action"" also has an insinuation that the Government is not doing enough. I personally do not think this is fair to the hard work done by people in MOM who I know are bending over backwards to enforce and take measures to support local employment. So, I do not agree with that amendment.",32,1464,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01464
2021-09-14-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The second amendment to proactively release information on jobs and employment prospects of Singaporeans. There is, actually, a great deal of information out there already. There is quarterly labour market data, advanced market data coming out with breakdowns of Singaporeans and foreigners employed.

But that information is out there. There is information on the MTI website that simplifies the benefits of free trade agreements for people and, of course, if more information is needed, if a debate is needed on the cost and benefits, we can always have Motions in Parliament.",34,1466,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01466
2021-09-14-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"So, in my view, I do not think the amendment is necessary because it insinuates that there is not enough information out there and we cannot make sensible decisions with the available information.

Local employees would naturally feel particularly aggrieved if they were being treated unfairly by foreigners, on our own land. Since the whole rationale of allowing foreign manpower in is to help make good jobs available to Singaporeans, the Government will certainly not condone this.

India and China produce the largest number of skilled manpower in the world for the IT industry. Indian ICT professionals are not only numerous, but also well-versed in English.

In the finance sector, there were 85,000 jobs created for local PMETs, compared to a 20,000 increase in EP holders – four times as many.",65,1573,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01573
2021-09-14-T-015,Sim Ann,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Ms Sim Ann),"Then, do our companies really need to hire so many Indian PMETs? I have mentioned that India is a major exporter of skilled manpower in finance and ICT. IT students enrolled across various tertiary settings in Singapore were 7,600 in 2020. According to an OECD report, India produced 585,000 ICT graduates in 2015, which also outnumber those in many other countries.",66,1574,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01574

2021-09-14-T-015,Sim Ann,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Ms Sim Ann),"It is clear that the growing presence of Indian PMETs in Singapore has nothing to do with CECA, nor any special affinity that the Government has for Indians. It has to do with our economic strategy to grow as a financial hub and an IT hub, which we have no reason to abandon. These are among the world’s fastest growing industries and can bring good jobs for Singaporeans.",68,1576,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01576
2021-09-14-T-015,Sim Ann,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Ms Sim Ann),"While there is no special affinity, we certainly have nothing against Indian PMETs either. Approval of EPs should be based primarily on the needs of companies. We pay attention to overall numbers and whether Singaporeans are treated fairly, rather than focus on any particular nationality. The Government will also continue to pursue integration efforts, and encourage foreign professionals working and living here to respect local culture and integrate well. Indian EP holders have to clear the same bar as those from other sources and checks are in place for all sources to guard against letting in under-qualified EPs.",69,1577,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01577

Undoubtedly, we should care about middle-agers. However, old age comes after middle-age, which means significant expenses for both the individual and society in terms of retirement adequacy and healthcare needs. If our economy does not do well, our people will have little purchasing power and the state cannot afford more subsidies.

We are sought after in regions of growth, such as China, India, the Middle East, Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia and many more countries, I am sure, because of our skills and bilingualism. That is also because our Government has invested in some of these regions and has kept a relatively comfortable stance on foreign talent as a key hub for many sectors. We have to be mindful that any change in stance to foreign talent or signs of xenophobia creeping into our policies will signal to other countries this shift in the markets and, inevitably, in the long run, also have an impact on our future Singaporean workers venturing abroad.",13,1602,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01602

The Singapore resident works in an international petroleum trading company in Singapore which trades across Asia, Australia and the Middle East. She said that when the pandemic broke out, the Singapore office was literally the only office that was getting things done. And because of Singapore's multicultural and multilingual characteristics, the multinational staff here were able to help fill the gaps in communications between the other offices.

This is not because they do not want to pick up new skills. In fact, most Singaporeans recognise that learning digital skills is the only way forward.

So, for those who are in this age group, there are ample opportunities to upgrade your skills set, acquire new skills and help you rise up to meet the challenges.

And in taking up side projects and gigs online, they may also find themselves coming up against competition from overseas. Globalisation or its association with foreign talent flows cannot be faulted for this. Rather, the situation arises because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Therefore, to ensure that at all levels of the bank, the locals will eventually be the majority, may not be possible, given the global nature of these decisions.",35,1624,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01624

I, for one, know, and even if you do a quick search on Google and LinkedIn, it will show Singaporeans heading the business units or are in very senior positions in the Union Bank of Switzerland or UBS – I will not mention the names – even in Julius Baer, Deutsche Bank private banking, HSBC private banking and Pictet, and also Singaporeans holding front office positions, such as the Global Head of Treasury Markets at Standard Chartered Bank.

2021-09-14-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I understand that I have been very persistent in this, but I believe it will bring about several benefits. Fewer companies are sending Singaporeans overseas for training in this climate. So, why not redeploy the funds to support the costs for employers to have their new and existing local hires receive training and mentorship under a more experienced and skilled foreign employee in the company? In the long run, this helps to build up the local talent core. It helps to reinforce the main purpose of having foreign talent in the first place, which is to help companies, including local employees, improve as a whole, not to steal our jobs. The foreign employee would receive a boost to his CV. It is a winning situation for all.",39,1628,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01628
2021-09-14-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Speaker, as we debate the issues of foreign talent policy and jobs, be mindful that globalisation of labour and talent has always been much slower to globalise, compared to via the movements of material goods and financial capital across countries. This is due to the complex nature of talent, the apprehension of domestic populations on attracting labour inputs from abroad and host the individual, either temporarily or permanently, near the location of the work to be performed.",40,1629,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01629
2021-09-14-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"For a variety of reasons, this has proven politically unpopular and nearly all countries place restrictions on migrations, Singapore included. But ongoing trends by MNCs and companies globally, via offshoring before and still now, build-up of ""digital labour markets"" have the potential to radically alter the global labour market, thus overshooting in foreign talent policy responses by any country may lead to more negative outcomes and, worse, it supports xenophobic and racist behaviours that can worsen domestically. These digital labour market platforms can connect workers worldwide with companies seeking to have tasks completed and, with technology, this can go beyond data entry and programming roles only. Worse, if the MNCs see Singapore’s hub status eroded because of too tight foreign talent policies or any signalling thereof in that direction.",41,1630,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01630

I just want to highlight that – and I think some of the previous speakers have mentioned this – the debate today is mainly about foreign manpower vis-a-vis our economic strategy. Immigration is a separate topic which covers a much broader range of imperatives. Immigration and work passes are separate regimes with different considerations. Immigration policy is very carefully calibrated. Potential applicants know that we are very strict in Singapore.",42,1631,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01631

2021-09-14-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"So, let me give an example from the ground. A 40-year-old resident, who is a Singaporean Citizen, works hard as a private hire car driver, has a Malaysian wife and children who want to be PRs. The question is, how long does Mr Leong want her and the children to wait before they can be granted PR status?",46,1635,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01635

2021-09-14-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"And to go on, I urge all, in Singapore, we need to channel our efforts positively towards building back better, which begins with an understanding that our challenges are complex and cannot be resolved by narrow ideology on globalisation and foreign talent policy. Understanding the complexity of modern society, the working relationship of democracy and capitalism, and recognising the prevalence of externalities are the first steps towards genuinely healing our social, economic and financial issues amid this current crisis.",48,1637,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01637

I support the Motion in the name of the Minister for Finance, as it affirms that Singapore needs to stay open and connected to the world; it acknowledges the anxieties whilst, at the same time, laying out the existing calls for enhancements needed for policies to secure the livelihoods of Singaporeans in the long run.

As far back as in February 1972, our then-Foreign Minister S Rajaratnam visualised embracing the world as our hinterland. We were faced with many challenges but, instead of crying foul, we came up with new ideas and bravely ventured ahead. We had to change our mindset from being an entrepot centre to looking globally. We were put on the path to be a Global City.",1,1640,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01640
2021-09-14-T-015,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"That vision, that wisdom, has helped to put us where we are today. I quote the late Mr Rajaratnam in his speech saying  ""But the Global City, now in its infancy, is the child of modern technology. It is the city that electronic communications, supersonic planes, giant tankers and modern economic and industrial organisation have made inevitable. Whether the Global City would be a happier place than the megalopolis out of whose crumbling ruins it is emerging will depend on how wisely and boldly we shape its direction and growth.""",2,1641,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01641

The Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector has grown more than three-fold over the last two decades and employs well over 150,000 people. It has one of the highest proportions of PMET vacancies that employers say they are unable to fill with locals. Consequently, the industry also employs among the highest proportion of foreign professionals.",1,1644,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01644

My speech will focus on skills and employment issues surrounding this industry, although some of these issues will be similar to those faced in other industries. I will analyse the reasons for the skills gaps and manpower shortage in the ICT sector; suggest ways in which the education system can be re-orientated to play a greater part in narrowing this gap; and propose ways the Government can address some of the imbalances that Singaporean professionals encounter in the workplace vis-à-vis foreign professionals.",3,1646,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01646

Any Singaporean starting out as a software developer would be competing with many similarly skilled foreigners for jobs and promotions. This, coupled with the perception of crony hiring and discrimination against locals, prompted many Singaporeans over the past two decades to veer away from the ICT industry in favour of other sectors, leading to an even greater dearth of talent in this industry.",6,1649,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01649

Companies are now willing to pay top dollar for data scientists and cybersecurity specialists. The NUS Graduate Employment Survey found that fresh graduates from the School of Computing have the highest gross monthly salary among all graduates, with the 75th percentile earning $6,316, higher than doctors, lawyers and business graduates.

With 3,100 graduates and 20,000 new tech jobs created a year, our local graduates would not be able to fill a fifth of these roles. This will lead to a greater demand for foreigners to make up for the shortfall. The pattern of overdependence on foreign professionals will continue. While it is laudable that so many tech jobs are being created, how much does this benefit Singaporean workers if our people are not equipped with the skills to fill them? It will lead to disappointment by both the companies investing in Singapore and our own people.

I doubt tech companies really need students who aced all four content subjects in Junior College.

Companies must provide a reasonable justification if they cannot adhere to this threshold.,32,1675,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01675

They just need to run a simple query against their employee database to come up with the numbers. It will not be a deterrent to invest or set up business in Singapore, since we are not imposing any hard quotas on them or preventing them from hiring foreigners. Yet, this level of transparency will nudge companies to relook their HR policies and expand the opportunities they provide for the hiring and advancement of local talent.",33,1676,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01676

2021-09-14-T-015,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"First, the lump of labour fallacy. It is a fact that even as the size of Singapore's labour force has expanded over the decades since Independence so that there are more people looking for jobs, the number of job vacancies to be filled has increased. The pace of job creation over the decades reflects the changing comparative advantage of the economy.",6,1685,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01685

In the 1990s to the present decade, the financial sector expanded and also created new job vacancies. Moreover, real wages were, on the whole, rising even though the economy faced adverse economic shocks that caused recessions in successive decades since 1965.",7,1686,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01686
2021-09-14-T-015,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"It should be acknowledged that the Global Financial Crisis that started in 2008 most likely had lingering effects on pulling down the wage growth in the years 2009 and 2010. But other than that, over the decade as a whole, it is the case that as standard of living has risen, real wages, by and large, have gone up. Certainly, from the year 2000 onwards, there came to be some divergence. The better-skilled workers continued to see rising wages whereas in the 10 years since 2000, the low-wage workers have seen their wages somewhat decline. But the country has dealt with that and our focus today is on foreign talent policy.",8,1687,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01687
2021-09-14-T-015,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"So, overall, with technological diffusion, because we have stayed connected to the global economy, we have been able to catch up with the US standard of living, starting from less than a third of the level of US purchasing-power-parity-adjusted GDP per capita in 1965.",9,1688,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01688
2021-09-14-T-015,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"Second, the role of foreign direct investment in job creation. I find it useful, in my own effort to understand the Singapore Story, to note that even as our total labour force increased by more than three times from less than a million in 1978 to over three million in 2013, the stock of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) per worker in real terms, adjusted for inflation, increased by more than 10 times. So, from 1978 to 2013, the year when I was looking at the trend, total labour force increased three times but total FDI stock increased by more than 10 times. So, the stock of Foreign Direct Investment per worker more than increased.",10,1689,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01689
2021-09-14-T-015,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"Then, from 2013 to 2017, just to check the more recent data, 2017 is the latest year that I have found publicly available data on the stock of FDI. That is in the Singapore Yearbook of Statistics 2019. The latest year of the data on the stock of FDI is for 2017. You would find that the growth of the FDI stock just over this period, 2013 to 2017, again far exceeded the growth rate of the foreign workforce in Singapore.",11,1690,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01690
2021-09-14-T-015,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"Overall then, total FDI has grown much faster than total labour force. Moreover, you would find that the services sector share of the total FDI stock – because we have data as well of FDI stock divided across industry, manufacturing, services, and broken down – has been increasing over the years. In 2017, more than 50% of the total FDI stock went to financial and insurance services, one of the industries in there. So, manufacturing has been shrinking in terms of its command of the total share of FDI, even as total FDI has gone up, which means disproportionately more of it has gone into the services sector and, in particular, the financial and insurance services, where many of our PMEs find their employment.",12,1691,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01691
2021-09-14-T-015,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"A direct benefit of the strong presence of multinational corporations (MNCs) that undertake the FDI in the Singapore economy comes from what is known as the employer-size wage effect. Large firms, which many MNCs tend to be, are more productive and they pay more for observationally identical workers. So, two persons who graduated from the same university, the one who works at the MNC, holding everything constant, tends to be paid more than at a smaller firm. That is empirical fact widely acknowledged now in the labour economics literature.",13,1692,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01692
2021-09-14-T-015,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"It is true that in the early stages of recovery from a recession, small firms provide a more rapid pace of job creation than large firms in the early stage of an economic recovery. However, in the later stages of economic recovery, the pace of job creation tends to be more rapid at large firms and workers enjoy pay rises when they join these large firms.",14,1693,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01693
2021-09-14-T-015,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"So, that is a huge advantage that we have got, that even as we have expanded our labour force, the number showed that the increase in the stock of FDI really has been huge. And that has been a great help in both creating good jobs and overall providing better wages.",15,1694,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01694
2021-09-14-T-015,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"My final point – the Mozart effect in the face of a declining citizen workforce because of the below replacement total fertility rate. In the next phase of Singapore’s economic development, it is not enough to rely on technologies developed abroad. We must move from imitation to innovation just to maintain trend growth. Much of the catch-up phase in the technological diffusion is probably nearly over. So, in the next stage, innovation will have to drive productivity growth.",16,1695,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01695
2021-09-14-T-015,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"While MNCs still play an important part in creating new technologies, we need them both for the jobs with better pay and also their part in creating new technology because they also do R&D. A bigger share of the source of growth would have to come from productivity gains achieved by SMEs that are successful in their innovations. Working in an MNC might be a prelude to stepping out to launch a new business venture since moving between departments in an MNC exposes a worker to different facets of running a business.",17,1696,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01696

2021-09-14-T-015,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"Given the high probability of failure in any innovative activity, having a large supply of workers who turn into entrepreneurs is necessary to ensure a sufficiently high aggregate rate of innovation that would need to drive the productivity growth, to allow us to attain trend growth as a mature economy.",20,1699,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01699
2021-09-14-T-015,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"The demographic transition, however, to a declining citizen workforce carries the implication that it will be difficult to sustain the pace of indigenous innovation necessary to maintain the trend growth. Since it is people who create ideas, a declining workforce ultimately leads to slower productivity growth. It would appear then, just to maintain the trend growth, keeping the size of the labour force from declining is of paramount importance.",21,1700,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01700
2021-09-14-T-015,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck (Nominated Member),"In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore overcame the odds against it when it attained Independence by developing the right mindset and economic institutions capable of riding on the opportunities provided by the world. Even as it now faces the challenges of a growth transition, a demographic transition, technological disruptions and higher worker aspirations, it will be the ability to develop political consensus and supporting social and economic institutions to continue to embrace economic openness, not only to goods and capital but also to people, that will assure it of a future with a supply of good jobs and wages.",22,1701,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01701

2021-09-14-T-015,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"The proposition that free trade is a net positive for national welfare has long and illustrious roots, dating back to the 18th and early 19th century. In my courses, I teach this idea in my very first lecture  that countries are better off when they specialise and trade, instead of trying to take on the burden of producing everything within its own borders. This is the case even for an advanced economy, in possession of technological capabilities to produce all manner of goods more efficiently than others can. The conclusion is counter-intuitive, but once one embraces the logic, it is incontrovertible, and the insight deeply satisfying. Indeed, this insight has been characterised as both non-trivial and elusive.",4,1707,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01707
2021-09-14-T-015,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"In my second lecture, however, my students quickly learn that free trade is not an unadorned good. Even in the simplest of models, trading relationships between two countries will throw up both winners and losers. In general, for capital-rich, advanced economies, the gainers will, unsurprisingly, be industry, leaving the lot of workers worse off. By a similar token, higher-skilled labour in developed countries tend to benefit from trade opening, while the lower-skilled ones are often left behind.",5,1708,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01708
2021-09-14-T-015,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"But this unequal outcome need not be the death knell for free trade. In the longer run, as workers displaced by trade find new jobs and reallocate to in-demand sectors, wages and employment would even out. Furthermore, since the gains outweigh the losses, it is entirely possible for winners – in this example, capitalists or higher-skilled professionals – to compensate the losers, the workers, at least, in part. Doing so leaves everyone better off and helps ease the transition to a more liberal trading regime.",6,1709,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01709

Thus, as long as we keep in mind the pressing need to ease the distributional consequences, we can always build a national consensus in support of trade liberalisation.",7,1710,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01710
2021-09-14-T-015,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Alas, in the real world that we inhabit, many policymakers have often forgotten this important imperative.

2021-09-14-T-015,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"When Singapore was a relatively poor, underdeveloped economy, this mattered a lot less.

With so many with so little to lose, it was straightforward to build a large coalition in support of free trade.",9,1712,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01712
2021-09-14-T-015,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"But we are no longer poor, and this complicates matters. Today, the major gainers in our nation’s stance on free trade are the high-skilled and those with access to capital. These groups benefit disproportionately well from our open trading regime, leaving our less well-off working class – now, decidedly, the minority – in an even worse position. It should, therefore, be of little surprise that, all over the world, we have witnessed populist challenges to globalisation  from the 1999 Seattle WTO protests, to the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement, to the more recent Gilets Jaunes in France.",10,1713,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01713
2021-09-14-T-015,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"And, Mr Speaker, may I venture that the backlash against CECA also has its roots in the perceived inequality of the deal for our local workers. After all, this all comes down to the recognition that free trade and free trade agreements are hardly the same thing. Many of these agreements have been concluded with insufficient attention to the distributional consequences for the minority that has been hard done by the deal. As a result, we have ventured from the rules of thumb on compensation that economists have routinely advocated to secure support for free trade.",11,1714,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01714
2021-09-14-T-015,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"To be completely fair to governments worldwide, including this one, the standard prescription for compensation has not been completely ignored.

2021-09-14-T-015,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Importantly, some adjustment of this nature will occur even if foreign workers do not relocate to local shores. The upshot of trade opening is that minimum salary floors for foreign employment pass holders will only offer limited succour, and the growth of local wages for those in the same sector will still be reduced, so long as we begin from a relatively higher starting point. Hence, even for Singaporeans who do not lose their jobs outright as a result of CECA, or any other FTA, there is still a chance that their salaries could face a significant hit, if they happen to work in sectors more exposed to trade liberalisation.

While this is important, unless the winners from trade are definitively contributing a share consistent with their boosted incomes, this will end up shifting the burden of supporting displaced workers back to the Singaporean taxpayer.",27,1730,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01730

I would like to suggest that existing Government schemes that support local employers to appoint consultancies, especially for business transformation, require the consultant to include relevant training for the employees in support of the identified strategies. By ensuring direct connectivity between employers' transformation and their employees' upskilling, rather than two separate activities, it maximises the return on investments for our grant schemes. There will be many details that need to be sorted out to make this happen.

Some of the MNCs include ExxonMobil, Katoen Natie, NEC and we are currently working with some Chinese MNCs like Yonyou for collaboration. Such collaboration allows Tunity to develop more IPs to serve them and their clients which, in turn, strengthens our expertise, experience and capabilities. Some of the collaborations bring Tunity's solutions beyond Singapore which, by ourselves, would not have been made possible.

Moreover, they have worked closely with IMDA under the Company Led Training Programme to provide upskilling, training and employment to mature PMEs.

Wealth management continues to grow strongly, with family offices flocking here, on whose heels highly sophisticated legal practices are also coming. So, many PMET jobs have been created, for locals and foreigners, within the sector and in adjacent sectors. Jobs that a lot of Singaporeans want, not only for the good pay but also for a multinational corporation work environment that is seen to be more progressive, dynamic and diverse.

They bring with them high-paying jobs, stock options and a startup culture that attracts some of our brightest young Singaporeans.

This granularity will also allow MOM to be more circumspect and discerning when employers come claiming that they cannot find any Singaporeans with the skills and to ensure that reskilling programmes supported by public funds will have a better track record of outplacement.,1,1848,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01848
2021-09-14-T-015,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar,"Sir, there are a number of proposals I do have, including extending SkillsFuture Credits to our tertiary students below 25 years old, supporting longer-term reskilling and professional development programmes than the current six to 12 month traineeships, especially for the sandwiched class, and removing frictions for Singaporeans to take on overseas postings.",2,1849,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01849
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Thank you.,1,1850,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01850
2021-09-14-T-015,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar,"Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister articulated clearly the need for us to remain open—",1,1851,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01851
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,But you do need to wrap up.,1,1852,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01852
2021-09-14-T-015,Mariam Jaafar,Ms Mariam Jaafar,"—while investing in the Singaporean Core. This Motion proposed by the Minister for Finance reiterates this. It is critical we get this balance right. Notwithstanding my suggestions in this speech, I support the Motion. [",1,1853,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01853
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"We will now call the Minister for Finance to make his reply on his Motion on Securing Singaporeans' Jobs and Livelihoods, followed by Mr Leong Mun Wai for his reply on his Motion on Foreign Talent Policy. Thereafter, I will put the question in respect of each Motion to the House for voting. Minister for Finance.",1,1854,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01854
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, I thank Members for speaking in this debate.",1,1855,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01855
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We all know that change is the only constant. COVID-19 has accelerated change further with digital transformation, new business models and new ways of working.",2,1856,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01856
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In the coming years, we will see more disruptions and volatility in the global economy. As entire industries adapt to these changes, many jobs will be transformed. The skillsets needed will change. New jobs will be created but some jobs will become obsolete. This is the reality of the globalised world we live in and this is the inevitable price of human progress.",3,1857,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01857
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Sentiments towards these changes are understandably mixed. Some foresee limitless new opportunities. Others fear massive dislocation of jobs. How Singapore capitalises on these opportunities while addressing the anxieties around jobs will determine our success and whether we remain cohesive and intact as one people.,4,1858,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01858
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,I am glad that Members who have spoken acknowledged that this is a complex issue requiring a delicate balancing act. We need to deliberate our options carefully and work hard to find solutions that balance the different interests and the needs of our stakeholders. There are no easy answers.,5,1859,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01859
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sir, I have listened carefully to the points that Mr Leong Mun Wai and Ms Hazel Poa made just now. If I may summarise the basic thrust of their argument  we have too many foreigners in Singapore; let us squeeze them out of Singapore; and these jobs will go to Singaporeans; even better, our wages will go up. But this is simplistic and wishful thinking. Let me explain why.",6,1860,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01860
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"First, when we squeeze foreign PMETs, the jobs will not automatically go to Singaporeans. Just think about this. Global businesses are here – international consultancies and private banks. They are here, as Ms Mariam Jaafar said just now, to play the global game. They are not here to serve the Singapore market. They are here to serve the region and the world.",7,1861,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01861
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Here, in Singapore, they want to bring together an international team. That is our value proposition to them. That is why they find Singapore attractive. Imagine if you tell them, ""Look, you can only be here if you fulfil 90% of your staff being locals. That is the condition."" Why would they find that attractive anymore?",8,1862,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01862
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"To assume that by squeezing the foreigners, all these jobs will go to Singaporeans, I think that is just being very simplistic about the argument. But Mr Leong Mun Wai goes further than that. He says, ""Look, if foreigners go and Singaporeans cannot take the jobs, that is the failure of the education system."" Really? I think that argument is completely disingenuous and does a great disservice to our educators and teachers in our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning.",9,1863,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01863
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Leon Perera and Mr Gerald Giam did not go as far as Mr Leong Mun Wai, but they had variations of the same argument. If only you did better with training. If only you taught all the kids coding from a young age 20 years ago. If only.",10,1864,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01864
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sir, we will continue to improve our education system. But I think all of these arguments miss out on the most important point. And, that is, the stark reality that Singaporeans are great as a workforce, but there are just not enough of us.",11,1865,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01865
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We have needs in IT. We have tremendous need in engineering. Look at the services sector, healthcare is growing, we need more people to look after our elderly population. We need more doctors, nurses. We need more physiotherapists. Oh, by the way, low-income issues are a problem, do we not need more social workers, too? And did some Members of the PSP not ask earlier when I was in MOE, they certainly did, let us recruit more teachers?",12,1866,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01866
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Where are we going to find all the Singaporeans? Everybody wants more.,13,1867,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01867
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Indeed, if you go to any of our faculties or maybe most of the faculties in our Universities, Polytechnics and ITEs, they will tell you, when they talk to industries, the industries and employers are saying, ""Look, we want your graduates but produce more of them."" And how are we going to produce more Singaporean graduates? If we move to one area, the other will say that there is a shortage. That is just the stark reality.",14,1868,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01868
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Then, there is another argument that says, ""Look, so many mid-careers underemployed. Let us train them."" Yes, we are doing our best to train all the mid-career PMETs, but this does not happen overnight. All of us know, it is very hard for someone in his 40s and 50s to make a career change to transit from one industry that they have been working in for years to another industry. It takes tremendous effort. And that is why, as I have mentioned earlier, the Government is going all out to help our mid-careers. We are investing more heavily in SkillsFuture, in lifelong learning, we are working with our tripartite partners, and especially with NTUC and the Labour Movement. But individuals also do have to make the effort in order to make these transitions. So, that is my first point. It is hard work getting this reskilling done and we should not just automatically assume that squeezing foreigners means jobs will go to Singaporeans.",15,1869,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01869
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Second, Ms Hazel Poa also showed the chart that suggested there was an association between tight labour markets and wage growth. Yes, perhaps there was; the data is quite clear, based on the last 10 years. But I would say be careful about drawing simplistic policy conclusions from that data. It will potentially lead to bad outcomes. What happened in the last 10 years? We had the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. After that, we waited for a while to make sure that the economy has stabilised. And if you recall, we tightened our foreign worker policies, levies and quotas. At the same time, the economy bounced back very sharply, much, much more strongly than we expected.",16,1870,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01870
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In fact, I remember after 2011 and entering politics, we were discussing this issue, having dialogues. Many businesses and employers were literally scolding us for tightening foreign worker policies. They said, ""Look, there's so much growth. Why are you holding us back?"" They were very upset with us. But it was that combination of factors – tightening of foreign worker policies, the very strong economic growth during that period – that resulted in a wage growth.",17,1871,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01871
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"If we make that simplistic conclusion, that tight labour markets – just tighten, just tighten – wages will automatically rise, I think we may be going down a very dangerous path, because, beyond a point, if wage increases are not matched by productivity increases, we will lose our competitiveness. When that happens, we are not just squeezing out foreigners, we will be squeezing out investments, and jobs will go with them.",18,1872,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01872
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"That leads me to my third point, which is that this thinking is not just simplistic or wishful; it is fatally flawed. If we were to take such a short-sighted approach, companies will leave and jobs will leave with them. Over time, Singapore's reputation as a business hub will surely be impacted. Our economy will decline and Singaporeans will suffer.",19,1873,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01873
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"There is another thing about the PSP's approach that worries me. And that is the complacent assumption in their thinking that Singapore has arrived and companies just want to be here. So, the Government can set tougher rules and the companies will have to put up with them because they had no choice.",20,1874,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01874
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,But let us get real. No one owes us a living. Global competition for investments is relentless and more intense than ever. It took many decades of hard work to get to where we are today. Please have a care about what we say or do because things can fall apart very easily.,21,1875,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01875
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I have set out in my opening speech the Government's approach. We keep Singapore open and connected to the world because that is the best, indeed, the only way to secure our future.",22,1876,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01876
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"At the same time, we know that there are downsides to being an open economy. So, we will deal with these downsides proactively. Assoc Prof Jamus Lim just now talked about the concern about an ""India shock"". And I think he also suggested that perhaps our FTA with CECA might make us more vulnerable to this India shock. But, again, CECA is not relevant here. CECA or not, if India liberalises and opens up, just based on WTO, there will be an India shock, which we will have to deal with and adjust to as we had to do when China joined the WTO.",23,1877,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01877
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, there are downsides to trade. I said that in my speech. There are downsides to being an open economy. That is why we work very hard to deal with these downsides by managing the flow of foreign work pass holders, upholding fair employment at workplaces and helping every displaced worker to get back into jobs. We know that the speed at which technology has developed and the way the global economy is shifting are, indeed, disorienting and difficult, especially for our older PMETs. Some have been knocked down by the winds of change and it is not simply a matter of bouncing back on your feet again, especially when you are older. But the world will not stop and the economy will continue to change.",24,1878,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01878
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Government will provide the best possible support we can give to those who have been knocked back. We cannot go back or hesitate in embracing change. Our children now have opportunities today that we would only dream of in the past. They get to work in the most cutting-edge industries and companies; they work alongside the world's best without having to leave Singapore. This is not just for the few as it was for an older generation, but also for the many amongst the young, and all these have been made possible because we kept ourselves open to the world, even as many other countries caved in to domestic pressures and turned inward. There is no reason why, as fathers and mothers, we cannot walk tall, knowing that we are doing our best for our children and our next generation.",25,1879,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01879
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Several Members have also given specific suggestions on what more we can do in various areas. We will study all suggestions carefully and continue to finetune and improve our policies.,26,1880,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01880
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I have also presented evidence of what we have achieved with our policies  more jobs created, incomes rising over the years and more opportunities for our children. These are all based on published data and facts. There is a lot of data out there – more than enough for any serious analyst to dive in, understand better what is happening in the labour market, what is happening with employment trends and unemployment trends – and Prof Hoon Hian Teck just now demonstrated that with his excellent economic exposition based on published data. So, look at the evidence and see for yourself how our policies have benefited Singaporeans.",27,1881,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01881
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But at the end of the day, I recognise that this strategy that I have set out that the Government is pursuing is not something that is easy to implement politically. While the vast majority benefit from an open economy, there will be some whose lived experiences are not so rosy. For everyone who suffers a negative experience, it is painful, it is very difficult and it is emotional.",28,1882,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01882
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In other countries, populist parties have no compunction about tapping into people's anxieties, appealing to fear, appealing to tribal instincts, pitting one group against another. They blame immigrants and foreigners and make them scapegoats for their country's problems and this results in the countries turning inward and becoming more protectionist. We cannot afford any of this to happen in Singapore.",29,1883,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01883
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"First, as a small city-state, staying open is not just essential; it is existential. Second, if we start having racial or xenophobic undertones in our politics, we will be going down a very slippery slope. It will start with seemingly innocent comments and questions being raised, or dog-whistles, coded phrases. But, over time, the comments become normalised, and racist and xenophobic sentiments become more prevalent. When that happens, our society will fracture and Singapore will fall apart.",30,1884,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01884
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Indeed, many Members have also spoken strongly against racism and xenophobia. I thank them for their statements and I fully agree with them that there is no place for such sentiments in this House and in Singapore.",31,1885,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01885
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Leong Mun Wai himself now claims that his Motion has got nothing to do with racism or xenophobia. But the fact is that, over the past few months, the PSP has been raging against FTAs and CECA, and for reasons that I genuinely cannot fathom. Despite all the clarifications we have made, his Motion today continues to attribute the cause of job anxieties to FTAs and CECA.",32,1886,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01886
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Leong Mun Wai takes issue with the Government calling him out on this. But it is not just us. Others can see what the PSP is doing. In my opening speech earlier, I read an email from someone that various Ministers received the email from. Mr Leong says the PSP listens to the people. Is he listening to feedback like this?",33,1887,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01887
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Ms Hazel Poa said, in response to my email sharing about this Singaporean who was not happy with the PSP's campaign against CECA, that we should assure him, that do not worry, the PSP's approach will give him more assurance of getting a job. But I have already highlighted that the PSP's approach is not going to work any better. It will be worse.",34,1888,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01888
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Second, Ms Hazel Poa misses the point because this gentleman who emailed to us, his concern was not just about jobs. He said, and I repeat what he said again  ""The PSP's campaign is truly racist and it is hurting Singapore Indians and we are splitting Singaporeans along racial lines."" It is not just a jobs concern, which the Member has not addressed.",35,1889,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01889
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The PSP's own members have expressed this concern, which my colleague, Minister Shanmugam, said just now. According to media reports, one senior PSP member said that focusing on CECA is, ""cheap politics"". Another member said that there are racial undertones with how the CECA issue is being raised in Parliament, and the ""real problem is not about CECA"".",36,1890,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01890
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, these are voices that the PSP's own Members have said that Singaporeans have highlighted. Mr Leong Mun Wai and Ms Hazel Poa keep saying, ""No, no, no, we are not racist. We are not stirring racist sentiments"". But, look, if it looks like a duck, if it walks like a duck, if it quacks like a duck, it is a duck. [Laughter.]",37,1891,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01891

2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Leong Mun Wai also asked for more data. Dr Tan See Leng had given a whole range of data just now and, as I have said, there is more than enough public data out there to show that the job challenges we face do not arise from FTAs, let alone CECA. And I cannot help but feel that the persistent data requests are red herrings to continue this campaign of casting aspersions and creating disaffection towards the Government.",39,1893,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01893
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I hope Mr Leong Mun Wai and Ms Hazel Poa will have the open-mindedness to look at the data and evidence again. Listen to what Prof Hoon Hian Teck has said just now, or any other serious analyst that is looking at the data, and review the PSP's position objectively and be gracious enough to accept that the allegations are baseless and put a stop to the false claims that they have been perpetrating about CECA and FTAs, both in and out of this House.",40,1894,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01894
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Next, let us consider the policy issues that Mr Leong Mun Wai raised. He suggested tightening immigration policies. But as several of my colleagues have said just now, this is really a separate topic from manpower policy. In any case, the evidence is clear  population growth over the last decade has been the lowest since our Independence. So, there should be no doubt that we have already been very tight at the overall level. We have also emphasised that our immigration policies will continue to ensure that the ethnic balance remains stable for our citizen population. And you can see for yourself in the latest census reports how we have maintained this balance over the decades.",41,1895,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01895
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As far as foreign manpower policy is concerned, after all the fire and brimstone from Mr Leong Mun Wai, all that he has asked for are three adjustments to our policies  raising EPs and S Pass qualifying salaries, imposing a levy on EPs and imposing a cap of 10% per nationality in any company. These proposals have nothing to do with CECA and FTAs.",42,1896,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01896
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, these are the three specific policy issues that Mr Leong Mun Wai was concerned about. Why did PSP not raise them in the first place? Why does his Motion harp upon the Foreign Talent Policy, Movement of Natural Persons in FTAs and, specifically, CECA? Why is he continuing the PSP's sustained negative campaign against CECA, a move which even his own party members say is cheap politics? Why pin the blame on Indian nationals and stir racial unhappiness in our own community?",43,1897,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01897
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"These are questions that I doubt I will get direct answers from Mr Leong Mun Wai, but only he, Ms Hazel Poa and the PSP know the real answers to. But I hope that, having had the benefit of this debate, Mr Leong Mun Wai, Ms Hazel Poa and the PSP will seriously reflect on their actions and conduct and abandon such irresponsible politics that will divide our society and be disastrous for Singapore. By all means, let us talk about manpower policies; let us debate them; let us talk about the pros and cons of different settings, but they have nothing to do with CECA and FTAs. The more you persist with this line of questioning and the more you persist with your campaign, the more you obfuscate the matter and make problems worse.",44,1898,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01898
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Next, let me address some of the questions and points that Members from the Workers' Party have raised. If I can summarise the Workers' Party position on my Motion, it is this  the Workers' Party agrees with the Government's overall strategy to stay open and connected to the world and deal with the downsides of an open economy, but we would like the Government to do more to help Singaporeans.",45,1899,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01899
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"First, I thank the Workers' Party for supporting our strategy. That is very important, that there is alignment and common ground on this basic strategy for Singapore. As for the ""do more"" part, well, I have already said that the Government will do our utmost to deal with all the downsides. Where there are specific policy suggestions – and a few were raised just now – we will consider them. We will weigh the pros and cons and consider carefully also – wearing my MOF hat – how we should pay for them. And I am sure there will be opportunities in the future for such meaningful debates, including during the Budget next year.",46,1900,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01900
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Workers' Party also had another line of argument, which was about information, data and communications. The Government's communication is not perfect, we will always work to improve our communication strategy. But where data is concerned, as I have said, there is already a lot of data that we have released to the public. Data on the labour markets, data that has been requested. We have put out more than enough data for anyone looking at the matter to examine the facts carefully.",47,1901,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01901
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Workers' Party's line is that more data is better. In fact, why not go all the way and have freedom of information, a proposal which the Workers' Party has made before. I would say, the Government has a different view. We see data and transparency as a means to better governance and it is not always the case that data is necessarily an unmitigated good.",48,1902,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01902

2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For example, people ask for more data with breakdown by nationality. Where it is possible, we have released those data, but is it such a good thing to let the whole world know our dependence on foreign workers and from which particular country? Really, do we want to let everyone know that?",52,1906,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01906
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I think it was one of the Workers' Party Members who also said that one has to be careful about hostile actors that may exploit our social fault lines to disrupt our society. Indeed, we live in a dangerous world. So, should we not be careful about external parties that may hold us to ransom by threatening to disrupt or terminate our labour flows, especially in certain key Industries? So, that weighs on our mind when we think about data release. We should, therefore, think through carefully these broader considerations when we talk about data release and information policy.",53,1907,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01907
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,This is why the Government cannot accept the Workers' Party's amendments to this Motion.,54,1908,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01908
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The first amendment, drops the word ""support"" and talks about calling for stronger actions. But this leaves it too open-ended and changes the meaning of the limb of the Motion that we originally had. The second limb, limb (f), talks about data and information, but that is really about, as I have said, information policy. Nothing to do with the debate we are having now about jobs, and there is no shortage of data, as I have emphasised earlier. There is a lot of data today already that allows anyone to study the facts and evidence to decide how our policies have worked and impacted Singaporeans and make an informed decision about this matter. If the Workers' Party would like to have a separate debate on information, data provision or even what the Workers' Party has proposed, which is, to have a Freedom of Information Act, we can do so separately. But let us not conflate the issues.",55,1909,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01909
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Finally, we talk about racism and xenophobia, which are the important issues we are dealing with today in this debate. I note that the Workers' Party has tried to disassociate itself from the PSP Motion. It suggested some amendments to the Motion, which Speaker has ruled were not acceptable, because they changed the substance of the Motion. But it is quite clear from the speeches made by the Leader of the Opposition and Members of the Workers' Party where they stand on this matter. And I thank Mr Pritam Singh and Workers' Party Members for your very strong stand against racism and xenophobia.",56,1910,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01910
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Pritam Singh himself quoted from a speech he made, I believe, at the Opening of Parliament, where he talked about ""foreigners in our economy; giving Singapore vitality"", that we must ""maintain that openness and friendly attitude towards them."" In the debate in July, he made very clear his stand again, that when it comes to racism and xenophobia, we have to reject them and there can be no ""ifs and buts"". And I believe that he also agrees that FTAs, including CECA, are fundamental to our economic survival. That was in the debate in July.",57,1911,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01911
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Again, today, I think he was quite clear where he stood and he, I believe, also mentioned that he was concerned about the racial undertones that have entered into the present debate on FTAs and CECA. And we should be very clear that the Workers' Party does not stand for any of this. Those were, I believe, statements that he made earlier. So, I thank the Leader of the Opposition for making very clear where the Workers' Party stands on this important matter.",58,1912,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01912
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In that spirit, I hope he will confirm that we cannot give credence to negative racial undertones in our political debates, that we must never allow such politics to take root in this House and in Singapore, and that the Workers' Party will reject the PSP's Motion.",59,1913,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01913
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sir, in this pandemic, we have been talking about vaccines and the antibodies they provide against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There are other viruses we should worry about  the dark forces of fear and anger of racism and xenophobia. They are no less infectious or deadly. As a society, we need our antibodies to kick in, too, against these viruses, against these other threats, to defend against and defeat the bigots, the racists and the fear-mongers.",60,1914,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01914
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Finally, Mr Pritam Singh and Mr Leong Mun Wai suggested having parliamentary committees to discuss the issue of jobs and skills. Sir, we have no shortage of opportunities to debate these issues in Parliament. The Government will provide data when it is asked for. Where we think it is in the national interest to provide such data, we will certainly do. We will consult widely with our stakeholders, especially with our tripartite partners. We will take all ideas and views seriously.",61,1915,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01915
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Often, there will be differing perspectives and it will not be possible to take on board every suggestion. So, in the end, the Government has the responsibility to govern and to make policy decisions in the best interest of all Singaporeans. Some decisions will not be so popular, even though we are convinced they are necessary and must proceed for the good of all. When that happens, we may see opposition parties finding ways to stir up disquiet and disagreement. That is the nature of politics.",62,1916,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01916
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sometimes, the Government decides it is an urgent matter and we need to move quickly. Then we will be criticised for not consulting and being too high-handed. On other occasions, we think it is better to take time to deliberate and get everyone on board. Then, we will be criticised for moving too slowly.",63,1917,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01917
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"That is our karma. We have accepted that in Government. At least, I have accepted that. But we will not be shaken from our conviction to do what is right for Singapore and Singaporeans.",64,1918,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01918
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We will not sugar coat realities or shirk away from our responsibilities in tackling difficult issues. We will make the tough calls where necessary. At the end of the term, we will present our report card to Singaporeans and they will judge us on our performance. That is how our system has worked and will continue to work and that is why the PAP Government will always be on the side of Singaporeans, working with you and for you.",65,1919,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01919
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We know our policies are delivering results and Singaporeans are seeing improvements in their quality of life. But we also recognise that there are segments who are more vulnerable and who struggle to keep up. So, we are fully committed to do more to ensure the fruits of progress are shared by every Singaporean. Our priority is to build a fairer, more equal and more inclusive society as we emerge from this crisis and enter a more uncertain and volatile post-pandemic world.",66,1920,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01920
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, we have had a long debate on important issues. I am mindful of the time. But it is an important debate.

2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sir, I entered politics 10 years ago in 2011. My first posting was as Minister of State in Education. When I visited schools, one of the questions I liked to ask our students then was  what would you like to be when you grow up? At that time, I received many traditional answers  to be a doctor, be a lawyer, be a soldier, be a teacher. When I returned to MOE last year, I went around asking the same question in my school visits. And, this time, I heard many more diverse aspirations. Kids said that they would like to be a video game designer, data scientist, startup founder, pursuing careers in companies like Amazon and Google. These aspirations are possible because we have defied the odds to build something special here in Singapore  a vibrant city connected to the world, brimming with life, energy and excitement, full of opportunities for our people.",72,1926,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01926
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"By continuing on this path, we give ourselves the best chance of helping our children realise their aspirations. This is what is at stake for all of us. We know it is not easy to thrive as a little red dot in this big ocean of globalisation. We will encounter many bouts of stormy weather along the way for sure. But we are all on the same boat together and we will get through these storms as one people.",73,1927,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01927
2021-09-14-T-015,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"That is what we have been doing for the past 20 months, dealing with the COVID-19 crisis. It has been difficult for all of us. It has added to the stresses and strains felt by people who are suffering the negative experiences of trade and globalisation. But we have also seen throughout this period that we are strongest when we stand together. We have demonstrated we have the never-say-die spirit. We have the ability and drive to work as one people. And we have the guts and gumption to meet every problem head-on. So, together, we can build our best home in Singapore and create a brighter future for ourselves and our families, and for all Singaporeans young and old. Thank you, Sir.

2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"I come to this House to respond to a challenge by Minister K Shanmugam to debate on CECA. He has been puzzling me because it was in reference to his remarks made on a racial incident, which has nothing to do with CECA. The very fact that he linked the incident to CECA was both disingenuous and troubling.",2,1931,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01931
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"The Prime Minister also, in his National Day Rally speech, claimed that those who question CECA, wanting to put Singaporeans first, had a strong racial undertone.

He went on to ask me a few other questions but he did not reply to me. So, these are clearly attempts by this Government to put a label on those seeking more information disclosure and more objective discussion on CECA as racist and xenophobic. I think I will leave that issue as it is. We have done all our explanation that we are not racist or xenophobic. At the end of the day, justice is in the heart of the people. The people will decide.",4,1933,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01933
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Political labels are convenient to use to discredit someone but they are not helpful for an open and objective discussion. By the way, I will also have to object to Minister Tan See Leng's words just now saying that PSP is attacking foreigners. Maybe it is a slip of his tongue, but I have to correct that.",5,1934,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01934
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"All of us here today have one common objective and, that is, to improve the job prospects and livelihoods of Singaporeans. And I have stayed focused on that objective.",6,1935,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01935
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"So, let me reiterate that we are neither racist nor xenophobic, and this debate is squarely about jobs and livelihoods of our PMETs, who are adversely affected by the foreign talent policy. The provisions on people movement in FTAs like CECA are only a small part of a much larger problem. To be clear, we need foreign talent. They play an important role in complementing, transferring skills and knowledge, as well as providing opportunities for cross-fertilisation of ideas.",7,1936,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01936
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"But those that are brought in and masked under the EP and SP schemes are not, by definition, really foreign talent. They are foreign professionals let in without quota, resulting in displacement of our own workforce. By drawing on Mr Goh Chok Tong's definition of mediocrity, a foreign talent should be one who earns more than $500,000 a year, or $40,000 a month.",8,1937,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01937
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"While we do need foreign talent, more importantly, we need to protect our Singaporean Core. And what is the Singaporean Core? It is simply our citizens, natural or new, who recite our Singapore Pledge, and whose interest the Government has the prime responsibility to look after.",9,1938,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01938
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"The current policies have seriously hollowed out our core. In many key industries, our PMET core is no longer the dominant force that we can rely on for long-term growth.

2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"It has been a long debate and we have covered a lot of ground. However, as expected, the Government's stance on the causes and the severity of the problem Singaporeans are facing is very different from ours. As a result, probably the new policies that the Government is going to come up with will not solve the problems thoroughly and Singaporean sufferings may have to go on. We might have to come back one year later again and debate on the same problem. Singaporeans would note that PSP has done our best to convince this Government.",11,1940,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01940
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,Let me go through the differences between the Government position and PSP position.,12,1941,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01941
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"First, the Government says displacement is due to globalised and fast-changing world. PSP says a large part is due to work pass holders.",13,1942,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01942
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Two, the displacement problem is not serious, the Government says. PSP says probably a lot more serious. Coming back to the 380,000 PME jobs that the Manpower Minister had presented to us in the 6 July Ministerial Statement, we are trying to ask him if he is sure that this number represents a net job creation for Singaporeans. So, there were some exchanges just now with my colleague, Hazel Poa, as well. There was no conclusion.",14,1943,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01943
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"But let me just share some numbers with you. Three hundred and eighty thousand PME jobs created for locals, and that is for both Singaporeans and PRs, from 2005 to 2020. But during the same period, 600,000 PRs had been awarded to work pass holders. So, the reclassification is likely to be a significant factor. But we do not know what is the number because we do not have the number from the Government.",15,1944,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01944
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"On top of that, there were 400,000 University and Polytechnic graduates during that period. So, a million people seeking jobs versus 380,000 jobs created. So, I do not know how to reconcile the numbers, but maybe in other future forums, we can continue to discuss that.",16,1945,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01945
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Third, the Government says emphasis is on training and retraining Singaporeans; PSP says better prevent job displacement first. Let the foreigners do the skills transfer because once a person is displaced, it is difficult for him to find a new job. It is so easy to say ""train again, take up the challenge"" and all that. The examples you quoted, I am sure, is a small minority of those Singaporeans who can really change to a new industry and learn new skills.",17,1946,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01946
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Fourth, the Government says discrimination is sporadic; PSP says probably it is structural, we have to look at it because the foreign work pass holders have been in Singapore in large numbers for the last 20 years and they are a very influential force in the job market. So, if you want to rectify the discriminative situation in the job market, legislation may be too slow.",18,1947,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01947
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Fifth, foreign talent creates jobs, says the Government; but PSP says the work pass holders we are attracting are all average work pass holders. Where do they have the ability to create jobs? So, they are just here to share our jobs. The jobs done by them, most of them can be done by Singaporeans as well. In that sense, Prof Hoon Hian Teck's lump of labour fallacy may not apply.",19,1948,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01948
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Sixth, Member Mr Patrick Tay also mentioned this, that there is a lot of resistance from employers if you want to change the foreigners policy. Of course, that is expected because, after all, they are profit seekers. But PSP says  how long can we kick the can down the road? At some point, we have to change and this is a golden opportunity because now we can tell the employers work harder, ""We can give you the quota now, but make sure you promise to scale down your people in three years' time."" This is the opportunity to convince the employers to work together and we change the course of our economy. If not, our economy will continue to be stuck in a low value-add position.",20,1949,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01949
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Lastly, the Government says you send wrong signal to foreigners; PSP says as long as we Singaporeans are united, Government and alternative parties all united and say we have to change course, I do not think foreigners can say much because that is the way we have chosen.",21,1950,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01950
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"And I do not think the foreigners are here just because we give them work passes. They are here, they have made a business decision and a strategy. There are many factors involved. Work passes are just one of the factors. In fact – afterwards I will elaborate on our policy recommendations – we are not saying that you do not allow the foreign companies to come in with the number of work passes they want initially. But it must be transitional. There must be localisation over time.",22,1951,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01951
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"We cannot allow them to continue to keep the same number of foreigners from the very day they come in. So, as long as we are united, I think we can put the message nicely to the foreigners. After all, we can set up a fair consideration framework for foreigners. Why the fair consideration framework for Singaporeans? That is something, as a Singaporean, I feel very puzzled about.",23,1952,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01952
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"An interesting point was brought up by Ms Janet Ang. I respect Janet as a senior executive in the private sector. She mentioned that Singaporeans did not have the relevant skills, work knowledge and global experience. But I would like to say that if Singaporeans continue to be uprooted from their jobs, where do we get the opportunity to accumulate the skills and know-how over time?",24,1953,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01953
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Like I said just now, you cannot expect the Singaporeans to pick up new skills all the time. Are you going to say that if foreigners come in and replace the Singaporeans because it is low-cost, the Singaporeans lost the job and then he has to go and acquire a new skill again? No. Skills and know-how – that comes to the capabilities of our economy. The whole foreign talent policy, as far as we can see up to now, contributes little to our capability building, partly because our Singaporean Core are being affected. Our Singaporean Core are no longer learning over time in the same job. They have been displaced.",25,1954,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01954
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Another thing I want to point out to Ms Janet Ang is that we hope the top managers in Singapore would also understand that and support Singaporeans and not keep saying ""Singaporeans don't have this, don't have that"", because they are now under a system that does not have the incentive to make them work hard, to make them work in the way we want them to take up the challenge and all that.",26,1955,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01955
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Those prospects existed in our generation, Ms Janet Ang. In this generation, it is more challenging. And, now, the leadership of the country has brought in an additional trouble for them and, that is, competition from foreigners. Not that we want to avoid competition. But, as I have said before in my speech, the competition was not really fair, to start with.",27,1956,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01956
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"So, other than the discriminative structure that we have talked about in the job market, actually, our economy now is also in a very different operating structure, thanks to the 20 years of foreign talent policy. It will not be easy to transform. We know that. Like a GLC senior manager, who is a very close friend, recently shared with me, ""Ah, if you want me to overhaul my whole system now, it will be very high cost because it's totally dependent on foreigners now."" But I think we still have to make the change. If, together, we have a consensus, we can rope in a lot of initiatives, a lot of resources. We can give each other time – employers, workers – but I think we need to make the change.",28,1957,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01957
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Next, what I want to comment about is from Mr Saktiandi Supaat who mentioned that Singaporeans are now very active in the global financial market. I like to hear that. But I would also like to remind him we Singaporeans have been in the forefront of the financial market since the 1980s. I started work in GIC in 1986. Before that, many of my seniors, not just in GIC, but seniors in the financial sector in Singapore were already pioneers in financial innovations in New York. They go to New York and they make the innovation. Some of the innovations were interest rate swaps and all the equity and bond derivatives. I am not so capable. But I set up one of the first equity derivative desks in Tokyo in 1987.",29,1958,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01958
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Saktiandi Supaat mentioned about my PR recommendation. I recommend to control the number, manage the number down. But he did not read my recommendation correctly. I actually said the recommendation is for work pass holders. So, I am in support of Singaporeans with foreign spouses and giving the PR to the foreign spouses. I am in support of that. But for this recommendation, I am referring to PR and citizenship to the work pass holders.",30,1959,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01959
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"So, to reiterate PSP's position  one, we think the foreign talent is not a silver bullet to solve all our problems; two, the foreign talent policy is the root cause of the influx of foreigners and that has caused a significant number of displacement of Singaporeans; three, unfair wage competition is the main economic driver of the displacement; four, decisive and concrete measures are now needed to rebalance our job market; five, and lastly, the FTAs and CECA are part of the equation when we consider immigration and employment policies.",31,1960,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01960
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"And unless the Government can provide new information to prove otherwise, unfortunately, as of today, we still cannot agree that CECA is net beneficial to Singapore.",32,1961,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01961
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Next, I would like to address the policy recommendations that I have made in reply to Minister Lawrence Wong and also Minister Tan See Leng.",33,1962,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01962
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"First of all, PSP is for an open economy and society. So, our policy recommendations are not meant to make Singapore a closed society or economy and our policy recommendations are meant to make a point – a point that all of us agree upon that we change course. We have to change course. But after we have agreed to that, I would think that we can throw in or rope in a lot of other things and provide the leeway for us to implement those policies. They need not be cast in stone. And among the policies that I have recommended, only the price-related policies or what I call price-control policies, have got a timeframe.",34,1963,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01963
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"For the quota policies, I have purposely made it no time constraint. I hope you have noticed that. Okay, in terms of the policy  firstly, I think you really need to eliminate the wage disadvantage against Singaporeans. Hence, the EP levy. I do not think Minister Tan See Leng's two attempts to reply to my EP levy as a necessity to equalise the compensation package of the EPs and Singaporeans really answered the question, because the 17% employer's CPF contribution is a direct differential. You cannot avoid that. And being an employer, that will go into his decision-making.",35,1964,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01964
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Second, in order to attract more foreign talent, the Government also agrees that the qualifying salaries should go up. So, it is just a matter of how fast. My policy may be a bit faster.",36,1965,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01965
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Third, I did not put any time limit to reduce the headcount of work pass holders although I would like actually today if we can come to some conclusion as to what is the number of displaced Singaporeans. So, that becomes a target that we can work on.",37,1966,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01966
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"But since the Government claims there are very few displacements, then we will not discuss that anymore. But I did not put any time limit to reducing the headcount. I also did not put any time limit to reducing the single nationality number. But for all these, there is an aspirational or planning target, and maybe, we should put a 10% cap on the single nationality on that.",38,1967,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01967
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"What I am trying to say is on the policies that PSP has recommended, actually, we are very mindful of the effect that the implementation has on the job market and also, indirectly, what kind of messages we are sending to foreigners.",39,1968,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01968
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Next, we also have to reflect on how the problems of the foreign talent policy have been allowed to fester, develop and exist for the last 20 years. It tells us a lot about the checks and balances in our governance system.",40,1969,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01969

2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"First, freedom of information. Throughout this long-running saga on the foreign talent policy, accurate data has been lacking, which has contributed to the large amount of fake news and speculation floating around. In my own experience of preparing for this debate, I cannot find the figures of intra-corporate transferees.",42,1971,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01971
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Of course, today, the Minister provided a few more years but the thing is  why give it out piecemeal? You are the one who is generating the data. You should be putting the data in an organised format. Yes, we agree that some data may be sensitive but, please, put it in an organised format for people to analyse. There are so many people in Singapore who will be able to analyse the data if the data is presented regularly and in an organised manner.",43,1972,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01972
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Today, Minister Tan See Leng provided, I would say, quite a lot of new data but the new data was not actually available for us to analyse without him telling us. So, the Government is doing what I call guerilla data. Whenever they want to prove a point, they give you a little more data. Look at the chart that Minister Tan See Leng has given us. Below the chart, it is stated Labour Survey Report. That is available. After that, ""administrative data from the Research Department of MOM"". Without the administrative data, we do not have the whole picture.",44,1973,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01973
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Dr Tan Cheng Bock has called for transparency, accountability and independence in matters of national governance. Singaporeans have the right to information in order to make informed opinions and judgement. We urge the Government to introduce the Freedom of Information Act as soon as possible, although we are not the first one to raise this.

2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"The second point I want to make is tripartism. Tripartism has been practised since Independence. However, in my opinion, the weak NTUC link in the tripartite partnership has become obvious during the foreign talent policy saga.",49,1978,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01978
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"I believe Mr Patrick Tay and all the NTUC leadership and the NTUC staff are working very hard. But if the overall policy is pointing at a different direction, the results that come out of their hard work speak for itself  lowly-paid workers constantly needing governmental financial support to get by despite working full-time; PMETs in their 40s and 50s finding themselves extremely vulnerable to discrimination; and now, underemployment.",50,1979,2021-09-14-T-015-S-01979

They will have the most to lose in the long term, if the current situation leads to a radical change of our business culture and mode of operation without a robust Singaporean Core.

Whether he also remembered the Asian Financial Crisis, when the Labour Movement worked with the Government and the people of Singapore to go through a difficult period of time?

2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"I thank the Member Desmond Choo for the clarification. I appreciate all the work that NTUC has done for Singaporeans. In fact, NTUC was formed, no, FairPrice was formed around the time of the oil shock, the oil crisis, right? I was still a small boy. I remember going to the Community Centre to collect rice from NTUC FairPrice. I do not think it was called FairPrice at that time.",1,2027,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02027
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"So, yes, the things done by NTUC, we Singaporeans, we all know. In fact, in this House, we are all for Singapore. We all know. We are just trying to say what is the right direction forward.",2,2028,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02028
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"When it comes to talking about general welfare for workers and all that, I think NTUC has done a tremendous job as well. But when it comes to wage policy, I think there is some room for improvement. Sometimes, it is not because of NTUC. There is an overall national policy called foreign talent policy. And then, there is some preference to make sure the businesses do well before the workers. Okay, I mean, that may lead to another debate. But maybe suffice to say that, okay, we think that there is some room for improvement as far as wage policy is concerned.",3,2029,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02029
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,I hope that answers the question.,4,2030,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02030
2021-09-14-T-015,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Members will be glad to know that I have prepared breakfast. I did not mean that seriously though. Mr Desmond Choo.,1,2031,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02031
2021-09-14-T-015,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I just have one last point, just to clarify what Mr Leong Mun Wai has said.",1,2032,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02032
2021-09-14-T-015,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,"He said that we ought to do better. Of course, we definitely want to do better for workers. And that, perhaps in the wages side of the house, we can do better. I think this is something that we always strive to do our best. We do not want to overstate the work that we have done for the Progressive Wage Model, but it is precisely a way that we can implement good wages for workers by making sure that it is sustainable. So to say that NTUC and the Labour Movement are not doing their part on wage policies, I am sure we are as confused as he is in the last eight hours of not doing homework. I think that is important.",2,2033,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02033
2021-09-14-T-015,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,"The second thing that we must note is that NTUC and the Labour Movement have been an important part of the National Wages Council. Year after year, we deliberate, trying to find out what are the best wage policies for our workers across different segments. It is a difficult thing to do. We have fierce exchanges with our employers, with our Government side of the house, but we need to do that because we need wage increases to be sustainable, create a pie, so that our workers can go home and come back to work tomorrow again with their job intact.",3,2034,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02034
2021-09-14-T-015,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo,"So, I do appreciate what Mr Leong Mun Wai has done in the financial sector, but I do not want what he has said today to stand as the record for the generations of unionists before me, who have dedicated their time, their blood, their sweat, to better the lot of workers in Singapore.

In healthcare, we actually have problems finding nurses, clinic assistants and radiographers for these trained jobs.

I would like to ask the PSP, what do you think of Singaporeans working overseas? In a global economy, I would think that there will always be flow of people, crossing nations for jobs, so would our Singaporeans working overseas then be discriminated against as foreigners?",2,2038,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02038

2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"One on the lack of manpower in certain sectors, as we have said, we are not saying that we clamp down on foreigners immediately. We are saying that we have to chart a path. Because this path going down, does it mean that we need more and more foreigners? That cannot be the case, right? Because that is not something that Singaporeans want.",2,2041,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02041

2021-09-14-T-015,Abdul Samad,Mr Abdul Samad,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not so sure what is the right word to use. When Mr Leong Mun Wai spoke about NTUC, he is not doing justice; I took it very badly because I am a walking union leader. My job is not full-time working for the union. It is a mixture of sacrifices I have to make.",1,2044,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02044
2021-09-14-T-015,Abdul Samad,Mr Abdul Samad,"When you said that wages can be better, I would like to share with this House what you have seen and what you have heard based on just the Progressive Wage Model (PMW) is not very reflective. Every union, through the branches that they represent, every time when we renew a collective agreement, we make sure the workers are benchmarked to the type of work that they do. We review their job scope, pay them accordingly.",2,2045,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02045
2021-09-14-T-015,Abdul Samad,Mr Abdul Samad,"As we know, recently, when NTUC launched Worker 4.0, we talked about the three Ws  wages, welfare and work prospect. Wages is always on our mind. So, it is not right to say that NTUC has not done our part. We have been doing it since it was founded. I am a beneficiary of past great union leaders. Some might have been Nominated Members of Parliament like the late A Nithiah Nandan. We go to the table, we quarrel over wages, even though we know at the end of the day, there would be some sacrifices to be made.",3,2046,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02046
2021-09-14-T-015,Abdul Samad,Mr Abdul Samad,"But I want to make it clear. NTUC is here for the workers. Their wages, their welfare, their work prospect will continue to be our main aim. When we talk about NTUC FairPrice, we are talking about mitigating the cost of living compared to other merchants.",4,2047,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02047

2021-09-14-T-015,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang,"He mentioned the data that I shared in my speech that came from the survey of American companies, a preview of the survey that the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) shared with me. They are real employers who are hiring and they have found the gaps they found. So, I am not sure what Mr Leong is disagreeing with me about. It is from a survey. They are real employers. They have found those gaps.",2,2051,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02051
2021-09-14-T-015,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang,"We can do a couple of things. One is engage these employers and really, like I said in my speech, understand what those relevant skills that our people are missing are, what are the relevant experience that is missing, and then we go figure out how to get the right approach.",3,2052,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02052
2021-09-14-T-015,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang,"But since I have managed ""United Nations"" employees in IBM before, I will share with Members – which is what I said in my speech – one tip that Singaporean workers need to recognise. We have to be brave to speak up. We will always have all our things in our heads  ""I am so good at all these. That guy is not so good. Why is he taking the job?""",4,2053,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02053
2021-09-14-T-015,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang,"But if you do not speak up and you do not tell anybody why you deserve that job, you will not get that job. Because of the competition, Mr Leong, which is my second point. I was going to ask you because you did say that the paradigm has shifted from our time. I am 62 years old. I do not know how old you are. But, yes, the paradigm has definitely shifted. So, do you not agree that competition for most jobs is not just among the talent that are onshore in Singapore, whether local or foreign, but, really, a global one?",5,2054,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02054
2021-09-14-T-015,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang,"Again, back to my point. If, as Singaporean PMETs, we do not speak up, we do not ask for the job, we do not show hunger for our jobs, then, of course, those who speak louder, those who are more enthusiastic, those who appear more hungry, will get the job.",6,2055,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02055
2021-09-14-T-015,Janet Ang,Ms Janet Ang,"So, my point is, Mr Leong, you have been a private sector executive yourself. Do you give the job to the individual who is entitled to the job, almost like – and this one, a little bit scary to say it – Malaysia's bumiputra policy, perhaps? Or do you give the job to the guy who has the skills to do the job and, better yet, has the added characteristics of passion for the business, hunger for the business and a willingness to go the extra mile?",7,2056,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02056

So, that is why I know we are from the same generation. That is why I related the example.",1,2059,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02059
2021-09-14-T-015,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,But I do not think we want to go further into explaining what you just said because it will enter another debate.

2021-09-14-T-015,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck,"I think, first, with reference to what Member Desmond Choo illustrated, the understanding that the lump of labour fallacy – which is that there are only 100 jobs and, so, if you have more people than that, some other people take the jobs, the others would not have it. In fact, that does not apply, first, in a setting when the economy is itself subject to adverse shocks, recessions.",2,2064,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02064
2021-09-14-T-015,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck,"Mr Desmond Choo pointed very well to the episode in 1984 to 1985. In the face of a sharp recession, in fact, the number of jobs substantially decreased. Unemployment sharply went up. There were major retrenchments. Job destruction was very high.",3,2065,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02065
2021-09-14-T-015,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck,I think the remarkable thing about Singapore when you look at how it faced its challenges over the decades is the ability to demonstrate the lump of labour fallacy does not apply even in an adverse situation.,4,2066,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02066
2021-09-14-T-015,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck,"In 1984, I was an Honours year student graduating from NUS. Prime Minister Lee was then actually directing the economic committee that came out with the report. The remarkable thing that came out of that episode – really remarkable, because it was the sharpest recession since 1965 – was the ability to bring together union leaders, employers and the Government to convince the people that you will accept a 15-percentage-point cut in your CPF. That amounts to 12% of your wages, really.",5,2067,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02067

Paul had, for some years before he won the Nobel, been very interested to visit various countries to talk about policy. He was in Singapore. He was in the International Advisory Panel with the University at that time. He came to me and said, at Prof Phelps' suggestion, ""Would you like to take a trip with me to South Africa?"" It was a one-day conference, where they were going to bring together their business leaders and their trade union leaders to talk about the fact that the unemployment rate among the young people was close to 50%.",6,2068,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02068

2021-09-14-T-015,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck,"The challenge ahead for Singapore is understanding that the lump of labour fallacy still does not apply over the long term. The challenge for Singapore, really, is to recognise that the sources of growth going forward have to come with a continued integration into the global economy. I think Minister Lawrence Wong has demonstrated and illustrated that very well. It is a view that I share.",8,2070,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02070
2021-09-14-T-015,Hoon Hian Teck,Prof Hoon Hian Teck,"The challenge for Singapore is, in the next stage, to demonstrate this. Because we have had five decades of being able to find a new way to reinvent ourselves, I think there is a great reason to have great optimism to show that the lump of labour fallacy will not apply.",9,2071,2021-09-14-T-015-S-02071

2021-09-14-T-017,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the flood management measures for our public transport systems; (b) how often are our public transport infrastructure inspected to ensure they are able to withstand increasing erratic weather conditions; and (c) whether there are concrete emergency and evacuation plans in case passengers are stranded onboard vehicles due to bad weather.,1,2104,2021-09-14-T-017-S-02104
2021-09-14-T-017,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the flood adaptation plans for Singapore’s transport infrastructure; (b) what improvement efforts are planned to prevent episodes of flooding on major roads; (c) whether the Ministry has conducted studies examining the impact of intense rainfall events on commuter behaviour and how it affects our public transport targets; and (d) whether a standardised climate change impact assessment approach is used for transport infrastructure and, if so, what is the approach.",1,2105,2021-09-14-T-017-S-02105
2021-09-14-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"All existing transport infrastructure are required to conform to minimum platform and crest levels stipulated under PUB’s Code of Practice (COP) on Surface Water Drainage, which sets out drainage and flood protection requirements for all developments. The COP is reviewed regularly to ensure that the drainage system remains robust in light of urbanisation and changing weather patterns.",1,2106,2021-09-14-T-017-S-02106
2021-09-14-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"To address the impact of climate change, PUB raised drainage design standards in 2011, which required an increase in drain capacities by up to 50% to cater for more intense rainfall events. LTA has ensured that all rail, road tunnels and bus infrastructure meet the enhanced flood protection requirements to mitigate flood risks. These include designing the platform level for bus interchanges and depots to be 0.6 metres above the adjacent road, and the minimum crest level for underground MRT stations to be 1.3 metres above adjacent road or ground level. Similarly, the entrances to all developments which are linked to underground MRT stations are required to be built at least 1.3 metres above the adjacent road or ground level.",2,2107,2021-09-14-T-017-S-02107
2021-09-14-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"For stations built before 2011 where crest levels do not meet the latest requirement, LTA has enhanced the flood protection of these stations by putting in place mitigation measures, such as flood barriers, to reduce the flood risk. These flood barriers are inspected on an annual basis to ensure their structural integrity. LTA will continue to work together with agencies and rail operators to review flood protection measures to ensure that they remain effective amidst increasing weather uncertainties.",3,2108,2021-09-14-T-017-S-02108
2021-09-14-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"As climate change will bring about more frequent and intense storms, LTA and PUB are currently reviewing the flood risk of MRT stations and depots. The preliminary assessment showed that the existing crest protection levels for MRT stations are sufficient against more intense rainfall under the future projected climate change scenario. Site checks are currently being conducted and the full study is expected to be completed by 3Q 2022.",4,2109,2021-09-14-T-017-S-02109
2021-09-14-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Beyond designing infrastructure to mitigate the risk of flooding, Operation Control Centres (OCCs) for MRT lines monitor water level and the frequency of pump operations. Drainage equipment at these underground facilities, such as pumps and flood protection barriers, are maintained regularly and inspected annually, in line with equipment manufacturers’ recommendations. During rainy seasons, the maintenance teams also step up their frequency of physical checks as an additional layer of assurance. Emergency flood response plans are also exercised regularly by agencies and operators, such as flood barrier installation refresher training for MRT station staff twice a year, to maintain staff currency.",5,2110,2021-09-14-T-017-S-02110
2021-09-14-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"To minimise obstruction to traffic flow during intense rainfall, PUB will identify low lying areas and roads which will have to be raised. In the event of bad weather causing passengers to be stranded on board vehicles, SCDF will lead evacuation efforts, with the safety of passengers as its top priority. If roads need to be partially or fully closed depending on the severity and extent of the flood, LTA will work with the SPF to minimise impact to traffic. This includes disseminating real-time traffic and road closure information to the public.",6,2111,2021-09-14-T-017-S-02111
2021-09-14-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,We will continue to invest in our public transport infrastructure to strengthen the resilience of our rail network and make journeys more convenient and seamless for commuters.,7,2112,2021-09-14-T-017-S-02112
2021-09-14-T-018,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in view of the “code red for humanity” warning in the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s latest report (a) whether the Government will bring forward the targets in the Singapore Green Plan 2030; and (b) whether there will be an introduction of more incentives for electric vehicles ahead of schedule.,1,2113,2021-09-14-T-018-S-02113
2021-09-14-T-018,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,The latest report from the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a sobering assessment of the grave threats posed by climate change. Singapore remains fundamentally vulnerable to the impact of climate change.,1,2114,2021-09-14-T-018-S-02114
2021-09-14-T-018,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Senior Minister Teo, who chairs the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change, outlined Singapore’s Considered, Committed and Collective approach to climate action at this year’s Committee of Supply debates. As a small city-state with limited land and alternative energy options, we face much starker trade-offs in mitigating our emissions. But we are committed to doing our full part in the global fight against climate change.",2,2115,2021-09-14-T-018-S-02115
2021-09-14-T-018,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Our ambitious climate goals have real impact on Singapore’s development and the lives of Singaporeans and are made after careful and coordinated planning. Last year, we submitted our enhanced 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and our Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) under the Paris Agreement. Less than a year later, we launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030, our national roadmap towards sustainable development and net-zero emissions. The Green Plan builds on our enhanced NDC and LEDS and maps out ambitious targets and concrete initiatives over the next decade.",3,2116,2021-09-14-T-018-S-02116
2021-09-14-T-018,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The Member has asked if we would review our initiatives and targets in light of the latest IPCC findings. Our initiatives and targets are not static. We are pressing ahead decisively and gaining experience from implementing them. Where the conditions allow, we will strengthen our suite of initiatives and push ourselves to do more. The extent to which we can realise emissions reductions will become clearer, as technology evolves and matures, and as the modalities for international cooperation and collaboration become formalised. We are making efforts on both fronts. We are investing and working with key partners on low-carbon technologies and solutions, such as hydrogen. We are also working hard on the international front to advocate for a multilateral, rules-based approach to address climate change and to foster collaboration in areas like carbon markets and regional energy grids that will support our push for decarbonisation.",4,2117,2021-09-14-T-018-S-02117

2021-09-14-T-018,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"For the transport sector, we will tackle emissions systematically by limiting our vehicle population, reducing traffic congestion and promoting the switch from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to cleaner vehicles, such as electric vehicles (EVs). Today, there are several schemes, including the enhanced Vehicular Emission Scheme (VES) and early adoption incentives, to narrow the cost differential between ICE vehicles and EVs. We have seen early signs of increased adoption of EVs and will monitor whether further incentives are necessary. We have accelerated plans for the nationwide deployment of charging infrastructure and set a target of 60,000 charging points by 2030. LTA recently launched an EV Common Charger Grant to co-fund charger installation costs at non-landed private residences, as an early adoption incentive. As explained earlier, we will review our schemes and programmes regularly.",6,2119,2021-09-14-T-018-S-02119
2021-09-14-T-019,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what training is provided to safe distancing enforcement officers operating under the auspices of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act before deployment; (b) whether this pre-deployment training includes calibrating their response to unverified reports of safe distancing infractions; and (c) to date, how many complaints or feedback has the Government received about the conduct of (i) safe distancing ambassadors and (ii) safe distancing enforcement officers, respectively.",1,2120,2021-09-14-T-019-S-02120

2021-09-14-T-019,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what are the operating procedures and protocols that the Safe Distancing Enforcement Officers observe when they enter and inspect residential premises; and (b) what are the feedback received from the public on the conduct of safe distancing enforcements.,1,2122,2021-09-14-T-019-S-02122
2021-09-14-T-019,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Safe Distancing Enforcement Officers (EOs) are empowered under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act and Infectious Diseases Act to enter premises, including residential homes, shops, food and beverage establishments and offices without a warrant to check for possible COVID-19-related infringements. Only EOs have enforcement powers and are authorised to enter premises; and Safe Distancing Ambassadors (SDAs) do not have such powers. For residences, EOs do not randomly or proactively enter and check for potential breaches, given the sensitivities. They adhere to a set of protocols to guide them in deciding whether to enter homes and check for potential breaches.",1,2123,2021-09-14-T-019-S-02123
2021-09-14-T-019,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Entry into homes is not necessary most of the time. EOs, typically, engage occupants at home entrances and can identify tell-tale signs of possible breaches from outside. For larger residences, EOs will request to enter for checks, based on a reasonable level of suspicion or repeated feedback that COVID-19 regulations may have been breached. From April 2020 to August 2021, out of more than 5,100 cases of feedback received for potential breaches in homes, EOs entered residences on less than 30 occasions. There have been 16 cases of enforcement action involving breaches in homes, and two cases pending further investigation.",2,2124,2021-09-14-T-019-S-02124
2021-09-14-T-019,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"EOs will request to enter residences if there are repeated or substantiated feedback, or by the presence of tell-tale signs from outside the residence. EOs will engage the occupants and identify themselves with both their EO and corporate staff passes and explain their intent. To verify their identities, residents may request to see their Letters of Appointment from MOH, which authorise them to perform their roles as EOs. To provide greater assurance and prevent impersonation, all EOs will wear a photo identification card, which will include new features like a serial number, name of officer, the officer’s organisation and its contact details.",3,2125,2021-09-14-T-019-S-02125
2021-09-14-T-019,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"All EOs are trained on the code of conduct and rules of engagement when dealing with members of the public. This includes pre-deployment training, on-the-job training, where new officers are paired with experienced officers, as well as regular updates in protocols and processes. When performing home checks, EOs follow strict protocols. EOs will follow the lead of the occupants and avoid physical contact with them. At least two EOs are deployed to perform the checks and may also be accompanied by Police officers during joint operations or if law and order issues are encountered. If there appears to be a sole occupant who is a woman, child or a person with disability, EOs will exercise reasonable measures to ensure the well-being and safety of the occupant, such as to ensure that a female EO is involved in the checks.",4,2126,2021-09-14-T-019-S-02126
2021-09-14-T-019,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,EOs will also be equipped with body-worn cameras progressively. These cameras will be activated prior to entering the residence to capture the inspection process. Only authorised personnel will be allowed to access the footage for investigation and the footage may be used in Court as evidence.,5,2127,2021-09-14-T-019-S-02127
2021-09-14-T-019,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"From January to August 2021, we received 75 and 17 cases of feedback related to the conduct of SDAs and EOs respectively, of which 20 and two cases were found to be substantiated, mostly for rude or unprofessional behaviour.

2021-09-14-T-020,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what caused the recent COVID-19 outbreak in foreign worker dormitories, such as North Coast Lodge; (b) how are workers monitored to ensure that they leave the dormitories only for approved purposes; and (c) whether locking down dormitories continues to be justified in the light of the Government’s strategy to treat COVID-19 as endemic.",1,2130,2021-09-14-T-020-S-02130
2021-09-14-T-020,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah,asked the Minister for Manpower with regard to the status of mental wellness of migrant workers in dormitories (a) what is the expected timeline in which the movement restriction orders on migrant workers in dormitories can be relaxed; and (b) what are the future plans to manage the mental wellness of these workers.,1,2131,2021-09-14-T-020-S-02131
2021-09-14-T-020,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,asked the Minister for Manpower when will foreign workers who are currently isolated in dormitories be reintegrated with the wider society.,1,2132,2021-09-14-T-020-S-02132
2021-09-14-T-020,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,Many Members have filed questions related to the easing of restrictions for migrant workers. I would like to take these questions together.,1,2133,2021-09-14-T-020-S-02133
2021-09-14-T-020,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Over the past few months, there have been several active clusters in the community and in the dormitories, such as North Coast Lodge, attributable to the more infectious Delta variant. Based on phylogenetics analysis, we understand that the SARS-CoV-2 strain at North Coast Lodge is similar to that of the cluster at Jurong Fishery Port, which has resulted in other clusters seen in the community.",2,2134,2021-09-14-T-020-S-02134
2021-09-14-T-020,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,Most of the infections amongst fully vaccinated persons have been mild or asymptomatic. The evidence suggests that fully vaccinated individuals recover faster and are protected against serious disease. There continues to be strong evidence that vaccination is protective against severe illness. We are thus in a better position to manage outbreaks as dormitories are now more resilient in a few ways.,3,2135,2021-09-14-T-020-S-02135
2021-09-14-T-020,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"First, over 90% of migrant workers residing in dormitories are fully vaccinated, similar to that of the adult population in the general community. Second, we have instituted a multi-layer strategy to quickly detect, isolate and contain the spread of COVID-19 within dormitories. This includes surveillance using wastewater testing, ensuring compliance to Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) and surveillance on workers with acute respiratory illness (ARI) symptoms. Third, we have implemented Safe Living Measures (SLM) and Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) audits to ensure that preventive measures are well adhered to.",4,2136,2021-09-14-T-020-S-02136
2021-09-14-T-020,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"These measures have effectively limited the risks of transmission and allowed us to quickly detect COVID-19 cases which are mostly mild and asymptomatic. We have also provided workers assurance and care regarding their protection from COVID-19 and healthcare even if they do get infected. This helps to provide the workers with relief from worry, fear and stress from the disease.",5,2137,2021-09-14-T-020-S-02137
2021-09-14-T-020,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Since August last year, migrant workers residing in dormitories have been able to work, visit the Recreation Centres (RCs) for leisure and supplies. Migrant workers are required to apply for an exit pass via their SGWorkPass App to visit the RCs. For essential errands, employers will submit a request to MOM for approval. These requirements are clearly spelt out to both migrant workers and employers. Dormitory operators are also required to conduct checks when migrant workers leave the dormitories. MOM conducts checks for compliance.",6,2138,2021-09-14-T-020-S-02138
2021-09-14-T-020,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"As we transit towards a COVID-resilient nation, we must not lift these restrictions too quickly and risk unwinding the gains we have so painstakingly made in the last one year. We are also concerned that high vaccination rates and earlier low infections in the dormitories could result in complacency and a re-ignition of cases. MOM’s strategy is, therefore, to take a careful and calibrated approach to the easing of movement restrictions for migrant workers. We are very mindful of the well-being of migrant workers, but are also responsible for safeguarding their health. First, we have substantially eased restrictions within the dormitories and have allowed a range of social activities, subject to group size restrictions and Safe Management Measures. Second, we will also increase the frequency for workers to visit RCs. Concurrently, we are working with RC operators and community partners to introduce programmes and new offerings to make RC visits more engaging. Third, we will pilot community visits with guided itinerary for vaccinated workers to places of interest. We will monitor and adjust the frequency and scope of these community visits.",7,2139,2021-09-14-T-020-S-02139
2021-09-14-T-021,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what have been the modes of transmission of COVID-19 infections at bus interchanges; (b) whether any commuters have been infected at bus interchanges or while on buses with infected bus captains; and (c) whether public transport companies will be requiring all their bus captains to be vaccinated.,1,2140,2021-09-14-T-021-S-02140
2021-09-14-T-021,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,Ensuring the safety of our public transport workers and commuters has been our top priority. One way to achieve this is through a high vaccination rate to keep frontline staff and commuters safe. Our public transport workers were one of the first groups to be offered vaccinations early this year. More than 96% of them have been fully vaccinated.,1,2141,2021-09-14-T-021-S-02141
2021-09-14-T-021,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Since the start of the circuit breaker period last year, we have enhanced safe management measures and the cleaning regimes of our buses, trains and public transport nodes, especially high contact areas. These have enabled public transport operations to run smoothly and safely over the past 18 months. As the virus mutates, we have continually reviewed the adequacy of our measures in consultation with public health experts.",2,2142,2021-09-14-T-021-S-02142
2021-09-14-T-021,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"MOH's preliminary investigations indicate that, given the high number of cases in the community, it is likely that the infections amongst bus workers originated from the community. When community cases rose sharply in July, the public transport operators implemented regular testing for their employees working near COVID-19 clusters, to pick up and isolate COVID-19 positive cases early. This proactive testing, coupled with community surveillance testing by MOH, helped to quickly detect and isolate about half of the current bus frontline workers who tested positive for COVID-19. In addition to the seven-day Fast and Easy Test (FET) Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) regime which commenced on 1 September, we are also conducting swab tests at interchanges with a higher number of cases to detect cases and quickly contain further spread.",3,2143,2021-09-14-T-021-S-02143

2021-09-14-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Gun parts and other dangerous items, such as explosives, are regulated under the Arms and Explosives Act (AEA). Suppliers or buyers have to obtain relevant licences from the Police to handle these items.",1,2147,2021-09-14-T-023-S-02147
2021-09-14-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"E-commerce platforms are currently not regulated by the Police for the sale of gun parts and other dangerous items. However, MHA has introduced the Guns, Explosives and Weapons Control Act (GEWCA), which will replace the AEA when it comes into force in end 2021. Under the GEWCA, e-commerce platforms will be regulated for the sale of these items. MHA is developing the regulatory framework and consulting the industry.",2,2148,2021-09-14-T-023-S-02148
2021-09-14-T-024,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Minister for Transport in light of the recent incident where an MRT commuter had climbed over the station platform door to access the train tracks (a) how are safety protocols enhanced to prevent similar incidences from occurring in future; and (b) whether there are plans to raise the height of the station platform doors for above-ground stations.,1,2149,2021-09-14-T-024-S-02149
2021-09-14-T-024,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"On 2 August 2021, train services between Ang Mo Kio and Yishun stations were disrupted as a commuter had climbed over the Platform Screen Doors (PSDs) onto the tracks at Yio Chu Kang station. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the fellow commuters and SMRT staff for their quick and effective response which brought the commuter to safety.",1,2150,2021-09-14-T-024-S-02150
2021-09-14-T-024,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Safety of commuters and public transport workers is our utmost priority. In particular, there are safety features and established procedures to ensure the safety of commuters. At all our MRT stations, we have PSDs to prevent commuters from falling accidentally onto the tracks, emergency telephones for commuters to communicate with station staff, and Emergency Stop Plungers (ESP) to stop the trains in times of emergencies. In the recent incident, commuters activated the ESP and emergency protocols were immediately put into action. After assessing the situation, the Operations Control Centre stopped train service and switched off the power supply along the railway tracks. Station staff responded quickly and persuaded the commuter to return to the station platform safely.",2,2151,2021-09-14-T-024-S-02151
2021-09-14-T-024,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"For passenger safety and comfort, the height of our PSDs at the above-ground MRT stations have been designed to cater for sufficient airflow. The height of our PSDs is also comparable to those used in other cities, such as Taipei and Hong Kong. There are no plans to raise the height of the PSDs at above-ground stations.",3,2152,2021-09-14-T-024-S-02152

2021-09-14-T-028,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"First, relaxation of border measures for vaccinated travellers. As a small and open economy, Singapore’s survival depends on being open and connected to the world. In our transition towards becoming a COVID-19 resilient nation, we need to reopen general travel safely in a carefully calibrated manner.",2,2168,2021-09-14-T-028-S-02168
2021-09-14-T-028,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"A year ago, we began to open unilaterally to general travellers from very low-risk places. More than 35,000 travellers have entered via this scheme over the past year and it has not resulted in any community spread. The list of places has changed in response to the COVID-19 situation around the world; today only Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan are on the list of Category I places that we have unilaterally opened to. Travellers from these Category I places take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on arrival at Changi airport, and self-isolate until their on-arrival PCR test results are known. They are free to move about if their PCR test results are negative, and they do not need to serve Stay-Home Notice (SHN).",3,2169,2021-09-14-T-028-S-02169

Now that more than 80% of our population in Singapore is fully vaccinated, we have decided to pilot a new VTL, starting with Germany and Brunei. Since last week, that is, 8 September 2021, fully vaccinated travellers from Germany and Brunei have been able to enter Singapore without the need to serve SHN. Instead, travellers take pre-departure, on-arrival and two post-arrival PCR tests. In response to Ms Ang, we do not require serology testing under the VTL.",4,2170,2021-09-14-T-028-S-02170

Since 18 August 2021, MOH has extended the COVID-19 National Vaccination Programme to short-term pass holders who have been in Singapore for at least 60 days continuously. This further improves the protection of our domestic population. Short-term visitors may also visit private healthcare providers offering World Health Organization Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) vaccines under the Special Access Route (SAR) framework. MOH does not track the number of short-term visitors vaccinated under the SAR framework.",5,2171,2021-09-14-T-028-S-02171

The vaccination status is verified by the airlines before boarding, as well as by Singapore authorities as part of the entry process. Digitally-verifiable vaccination certificates may be read and verified by scanning the QR code with a suitable application to determine if the certificate is valid and authentic. Non digitally-verifiable vaccination certificates will need to contain a standardised set of fields, which will be manually checked to determine if the certificate meets Singapore’s entry requirements.",7,2173,2021-09-14-T-028-S-02173

2021-09-14-T-028,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"This is a matter that the inter-agency team considered very carefully when we were designing the VTL. All travellers to Singapore today are required to declare their travel history via the electronic Health Declaration Card (eHDC). This declaration is not unique to the VTL and has been in place since March 2020. False declarations of travel history are criminal offences under Singapore law and may be punishable upon conviction by a fine and/or imprisonment. Foreigners may face additional administrative measures, such as the shortening or revocation of their visit pass to remain in Singapore. Conviction may also affect their ability to obtain or sponsor immigration facilities in the future. In addition, travellers entering Singapore under the VTL pilot with Germany must also present proof of their vaccination in either Germany or Singapore. Vaccination certificates issued in other places will not be accepted.",11,2177,2021-09-14-T-028-S-02177
2021-09-14-T-028,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"All travellers should be responsible when travelling on the VTL and diligent in complying with its requirements. In particular, they should strictly abide by the travel history and testing requirements, including the Day 3 and Day 7 tests in Singapore. These safeguards have been put in place to reduce the likelihood of imported cases and quickly identify and isolate those who do test positive, to minimise the risk of community spread. Irresponsible behaviour, such as false declarations or missing the post-arrival tests, puts the traveller and the community at risk and undermines our ability to expand the VTL to new places.",12,2178,2021-09-14-T-028-S-02178
2021-09-14-T-028,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Finally, further reopening. MOT and CAAS are working closely with MOH and the Multi-Ministry Task Force to monitor the outcomes of the VTL.

2021-09-14-T-028,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"As a small and open economy, our connectivity with the rest of the world is existential. The longer our borders remain closed, the greater the risk of lasting damage to our economy, our livelihoods and our status as an aviation hub. Cross-border travel is also important for many Singaporeans, who have to travel for work or study, or would like to reconnect with loved ones overseas. To safeguard Singaporeans’ lives and livelihoods, we will, therefore, take a careful, calibrated and science-based approach in reopening our borders, adjusting the safeguards when necessary as the COVID-19 situation evolves.",14,2180,2021-09-14-T-028-S-02180

We will not take enforcement action against diners who are clearly unable to carry their food to the table, such as the elderly who have difficulty moving about, young children and persons with disabilities. We urge their family members, dining companions and members of public to help them return their trays and dirty crockery. Moving towards a full self-service model where diners return their dirty trays and crockery after their meals is also a kind gesture to make it less laborious for our ageing cleaning workforce.

2021-09-14-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Hence, all teachers are trained in basic counselling skills and mental health literacy, which include the key elements of mental health first aid training. They learn about common mental illnesses and their symptoms, facilitating help-seeking, addressing the issue of stigma and how to support students with mental health issues. These equip our educators in schools to detect signs of distress in students and take timely action to refer them to the school or other professional counsellors when necessary. With these basic skills and knowledge, they can also create a supportive environment in class and CCAs. In the IHLs, students also have access to pastoral support and our IHLs continue to strengthen their staff’s capabilities to support students’ mental well-being, such as by providing training to identify early signs of distress in their students.",4,2216,2021-09-14-T-035-S-02216
2021-09-14-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Through the Mental Health Education lessons in our revised Character and Citizenship Education curriculum, students also learn elements similar to mental health first aid training, including recognising signs of distress, when and how to seek help for self and peers, as well as developing empathy and care towards people struggling with mental health conditions. Similarly, mental health programmes and activities for students in the IHLs seek to raise awareness on mental health issues and build their resilience. These include self-care and stress management workshops as well as a compulsory mental wellness literacy curriculum for all Year 1 students in the Polytechnics and Institute of Technical Education (ITE).",5,2217,2021-09-14-T-035-S-02217
2021-09-14-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Besides teachers providing the first-line support, teacher counsellors, who have additional counselling training, have been deployed in schools since 1996. They help to counsel students on school-related issues, such as friendship issues, emotion regulation, learning difficulties and stress management. They can also take on more complex issues, such as coping with grief and loss. To support teacher counsellors, schools have the flexibility to reduce their teaching or CCA duties to provide them with more time to spend with students. We will continue to monitor the workload of teacher counsellors to ensure that teachers are well supported.",6,2218,2021-09-14-T-035-S-02218
2021-09-14-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Ms Carrie Tan also asked whether the Ministry would set up an allied unit of specially-trained mental health staff to support educators in their mental healthcare for students. MOE has a team of Counselling and Education Psychologists, Specialist Officers and experienced Lead School Counsellors. They work closely with school personnel, including educators and school counsellors, providing consultation, case assessment, training and resources in the areas of mental health and student well-being.",7,2219,2021-09-14-T-035-S-02219
2021-09-14-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,Dr Shahira Abdullah asked about the issue of certification of MOE’s school counsellors by Singapore Counselling Association (SAC). MOE recruits both trained and untrained applicants for School Counsellors (SC). Untrained applicants undergo the Diploma in School Counselling (DSC) programme conducted by the National Institute of Education (NIE) before they are deployed as SCs in the schools. The DSC programme is specially designed for school counselling to equip the trainees to work effectively and meet the needs of our children and youths in the educational setting.,8,2220,2021-09-14-T-035-S-02220
2021-09-14-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"NIE has a wealth of knowledge and experience in research and training in counselling psychology within the school context. They have been offering the Master of Arts (Counselling and Guidance) programme since early 2000, which is recognised by professionals and the Singapore Association for Counselling (SAC).",9,2221,2021-09-14-T-035-S-02221
2021-09-14-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,Counsellors in Singapore are not required to register with SAC as it is not an accreditation or licensure body. MOE too does not require School Counsellors to register with SAC. Registration is voluntary.,10,2222,2021-09-14-T-035-S-02222
2021-09-14-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The next set of issues concerns educators’ well-being, which Ms He Ting Ru touched on. The well-being of our school staff has always been of paramount importance and, even before the tripartite advisory on mental well-being was issued in 2020, measures that were contextualised for schools and well-aligned with the advisory, were already in place to support their well-being.",11,2223,2021-09-14-T-035-S-02223
2021-09-14-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"First, counselling services are available for school staff when needed. As part of the Civil Service medical benefits scheme, school staff are eligible for subsidised medical treatment, including mental health consultations and treatment. MOE provides in-house counselling services by trained professionals and there is also a whole-of-Government counselling hotline for our teachers. These sessions are confidential and free for all staff. Our counsellors also organise workshops for staff in areas, such as managing difficult conversations and stress management.",12,2224,2021-09-14-T-035-S-02224
2021-09-14-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Second, MOE has structures in schools to support the well-being of our staff. School Leaders are guided by the Teacher Work Management Framework on staff deployment and measures to support staff well-being, including ensuring protected vacation time for staff to rest. In every school, the Staff Well-being Committee looks into staff welfare and bonding. MOE HQ supports these committees by offering professional knowledge, resources and sharing platforms for them to share their best practices and to learn from one another.",13,2225,2021-09-14-T-035-S-02225
2021-09-14-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We recognise that ground practices may vary. Leadership is thus crucial in setting the tone, and our school leaders are committed to supporting the well-being of our school staff by building a culture of care and openness. In addition, MOE also obtains feedback through various sensing platforms, such as engagement surveys and platforms, and school visits by MOE senior management. We take steps to provide support where needed, such as working with schools to review teacher workload, and organising workshops to address the well-being needs of staff. Key indicators are also shared with schools so they can implement interventions and adjust their systems to support their staff.",14,2226,2021-09-14-T-035-S-02226
2021-09-14-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"MOE is committed to ensuring the well-being and building the capacity of our educators and staff so that they can rise to the demands and challenges, as they educate and support our students, especially in the context of the on-going pandemic situation.

2021-09-14-T-036,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The Government’s intent is to ensure a stable and sustainable property market, where prices move broadly in line with economic fundamentals. Where necessary, we have implemented measures to achieve this and to ensure that households do not overextend themselves when making property purchases.",1,2229,2021-09-14-T-036-S-02229
2021-09-14-T-036,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"These measures have been effective. For instance, the property cooling measures in July 2018 significantly slowed the increase in property prices to 1.2% between 3Q2018 and 2Q2019, from 9.1% between 3Q2017 and 2Q2018.",2,2230,2021-09-14-T-036-S-02230
2021-09-14-T-036,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The Government remains highly vigilant and will continue to monitor developments in the property market closely.

2021-09-14-T-037,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) which countries has Singapore donated COVID-19 vaccines to; (b) how many doses have been donated to each of these countries; (c) what is the total cost of these donations; and (d) what are the considerations for donations to higher income countries like Brunei which have the financial means to purchase their own vaccines.,1,2232,2021-09-14-T-037-S-02232
2021-09-14-T-037,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"I would like to emphasise that we conducted a comprehensive assessment of the progress of our National Vaccination Programme and made the decision to contribute our vaccines only when we were sure that we had, and will continue to have, enough vaccines for our people.",1,2233,2021-09-14-T-037-S-02233
2021-09-14-T-037,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"We had contributed 100,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine to Brunei on 20 August 2021. We had also contributed 20,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccines to Johor on 29 June 2021 and are working towards a further donation of around 100,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines to Johor. Due to contractual obligations with the vaccine manufacturers, we are not able to disclose the cost of vaccines.",2,2234,2021-09-14-T-037-S-02234
2021-09-14-T-037,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Mr Gerald Giam has asked about the considerations behind contributing vaccines to our neighbours, including higher-income countries.

I would like to express our gratitude to our vaccine procurement team for securing sufficient vaccines for our people at such an early stage.",3,2235,2021-09-14-T-037-S-02235
2021-09-14-T-037,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"In combatting a pandemic that knows no boundaries, no one is safe until everyone is safe, and it is, therefore, in our collective interest to help one another. One such example is the swap arrangement with Australia. We sent 500,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines to Australia recently and we will receive the same quantity from Australia at a later date. This arrangement is mutually beneficial as it enables both countries to support each other in optimising our respective schedules for vaccinating our populations against COVID-19.",4,2236,2021-09-14-T-037-S-02236
2021-09-14-T-037,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Our contributions are part of our broader commitment to work together with our neighbours in confronting the pandemic. While we continue to support regional and global efforts to combat the virus, it is sensible that we begin by helping our neighbours, given their proximity to us, and the large number of cross-border flows between our countries. It is, hence, critical that we first bring the COVID-19 situation in our region under control.",5,2237,2021-09-14-T-037-S-02237

2021-09-14-T-044,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"First, we are transforming Singapore into a City in Nature. We have been launching new parks which feature more lush vegetation and natural landscapes, the most recent being Bukit Gombak Park and Phase 1 of Pasir Panjang Park. We have also announced new nature corridors, such as Clementi and Bukit Batok Nature Corridors, which will strengthen ecological connectivity in these areas.",2,2279,2021-09-14-T-044-S-02279
2021-09-14-T-044,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Second, we are making our buildings, HDB towns, and districts even more sustainable. We are committed to raising our environmental sustainability standards under the latest edition of the Singapore Green Building Masterplan. Last week, BCA launched its latest edition of the Green Mark scheme, which is one of the world’s leading green building certifications. The refreshed scheme raises our standards in energy performance, and places greater emphasis on other important sustainability outcomes. These include designing for maintainability, reducing embodied carbon across a building’s life cycle, using smart technologies, enhancing a building’s resilience to climate change, and creating healthier environments for building users. We have also developed a new Super Low Energy (SLE) standard for residential buildings, which will be awarded to residential buildings that achieve at least 60% improvement in energy efficiency over 2005 levels.",3,2280,2021-09-14-T-044-S-02280

This includes all common touch-points, such as door handles, lift buttons, letter boxes, escalators and railings. The approach taken is similar to that for other premises, such as public housing estates and commercial properties. MCSTs and MAs have been responsive in undertaking the disinfection works. Should it be necessary, NEA will work with MOH to compel any persistently uncooperative MCSTs to disinfect their premises through an order under the Infectious Diseases Act.",1,2285,2021-09-14-T-045-S-02285

However, we are concerned when parents send their children for tuition excessively, or to ace examinations even when their children are coping well with their school work.",2,2292,2021-09-14-T-047-S-02292
2021-09-14-T-047,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Implementing restrictions on the private tuition industry to address unnecessary reliance on tuition is unlikely to be effective, if the underlying reasons why students and parents take up tuition are not addressed.

We continue to monitor new developments, such as the new regulations in China, that the Member has referenced.",3,2293,2021-09-14-T-047-S-02293
2021-09-14-T-047,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We have progressively introduced several policy changes under our Learn for Life movement, to address the fundamental issues that drive the demand for tuition, with the aim of nurturing the joy of learning in our students, reduce the overemphasis on academic results and change the mindsets and attitudes of parents and students to adopt a broader definition of success.",4,2294,2021-09-14-T-047-S-02294
2021-09-14-T-047,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Our reforms will take time to bear fruit.

The energy efficiency of lighting products is currently regulated through NEA’s Mandatory Energy Labelling Scheme (MELS) and the Mandatory Energy Performance Standards (MEPS). MELS enables consumers to make an informed decision on the purchase of lighting products based on energy efficiency considerations, while MEPS raises the average energy efficiency of lighting products by removing the least energy-efficient models from the market. Through the public sector’s green procurement policy, most public sector buildings have already switched to energy-efficient lighting solutions.",1,2340,2021-09-14-T-057-S-02340

2021-09-14-T-060,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Health (a) what are the working hours and salaries of nurses in the intermediate and long-term care (ILTC) sector as compared to nurses in the public healthcare sector; and (b) what measures will be taken to enhance the attractiveness and career prospects in the ILTC sector to encourage more Singaporeans to join.,1,2356,2021-09-14-T-060-S-02356
2021-09-14-T-060,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Nurses in the ILTC sector, also known as the community care sector, have different job requirements including working hours, compared to public healthcare sector nurses. MOH works closely with the Agency for Integrated Care and Community Care Organisations (CCOs) to ensure that salaries of staff in the sector remain competitive. In 2020, we provided funding to CCOs to raise the salaries of local nurses and support care staff. Earlier this year, we announced further funding support for salaries and expanded the support to more job groups, such as allied health professionals, pharmacists, administrative and ancillary staff.",1,2357,2021-09-14-T-060-S-02357
2021-09-14-T-060,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Over the years, we have also strengthened various recruitment and workforce development support for the community care sector. We embarked on a pilot to redesign support care jobs within the sector to enhance career progression for these staff. The CCOs can also tap on funding support from the Ministry to hire and train new staff. We have also introduced scholarships, traineeship programmes and training subsidies for the sector to attract talent and develop the workforce. We are embarking on a Care to Go Beyond public communications campaign to raise awareness of the job opportunities in the sector.",2,2358,2021-09-14-T-060-S-02358
2021-09-14-T-061,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will review ways to narrow the gap between Cash Over Valuation (COV) and the valuation of an HDB flat as the current high COV has made it hard for young couples to buy resale flats which is the popular option now given the long BTO construction delays.,1,2359,2021-09-14-T-061-S-02359
2021-09-14-T-061,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The recent increase in resale prices can be partly attributed to a broad-based increase in demand for housing, supported by the current low interest rate environment. Nonetheless, the majority of resale flat buyers did not have to pay any cash-over-valuation (COV), and the median COV across all buyers has remained at $0.",1,2360,2021-09-14-T-061-S-02360
2021-09-14-T-061,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"HDB resale flat transactions are conducted on a ""willing-buyer-willing-seller"" basis, with prices negotiated and mutually agreed upon between flat buyers and sellers. Many factors influence the price of a flat, including its location, size and condition. The transacted prices of resale flats for the last 12 months are published on the HDB InfoWEB to guide flat buyers and sellers in their negotiations. Taking reference from these transacted prices, buyers should first consider if they will be overpaying for the flat when they make an offer.",2,2361,2021-09-14-T-061-S-02361
2021-09-14-T-061,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"After a resale price has been agreed upon, the flat sellers will grant an Option to Purchase (OTP) to the buyers. If the buyers wish to use their CPF savings or a housing loan to pay for the flat purchase, they will need to make a ""Request for Value"" to HDB. Cash-Over-Valuation (COV) arises when the resale price is higher than the market valuation of the flat, as the difference can only be paid by cash. Otherwise, there is no COV. Buyers can decide whether to exercise the OTP for the resale transaction depending on the valuation and any COV payable. Should they choose not to proceed with the transaction, buyers will forgo the option fee of between $1 and $1,000 paid to the seller.",3,2362,2021-09-14-T-061-S-02362
2021-09-14-T-061,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Ultimately, the resale price has to be agreed upon by the buyer and the seller. Before March 2014, sellers would obtain the valuation first before negotiating the COV payable with buyers. As a result, the vast majority of transactions involved a COV. We, therefore, reviewed the resale process and the current process allows price negotiations to take place between buyers and sellers, guided by the latest market information available on the HDB InfoWeb. Any further changes to the resale process that reduce or cap the COV payable could restrict the functioning of an efficient market. This is a situation we want to avoid.",4,2363,2021-09-14-T-061-S-02363

2021-09-14-T-062,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"We have chosen to highlight eight EV-Ready Towns, as these are the ones where existing electricity capacity can support charging points at all car parks with minimal upgrading. For all the other towns, we will also be deploying charging points in as many public carparks as possible. For instance, the Government’s pilot charging point deployment tender, awarded earlier this month, will see over 600 charging points at around 200 public carparks installed over the next year. By the 2030s, every HDB town will be an EV-Ready Town.",2,2367,2021-09-14-T-062-S-02367
2021-09-14-T-062,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"For private developments, premises owners have to assess the deployment of EV charging points taking into account the needs of their users and the existing electrical capacity. Several commercial developments, like retail malls and petrol stations, as well as some private residences, have already installed EV charging points. The Government will continue to facilitate such deployment, for instance, by launching the EV Common Charger Grant to further incentivise EV charger installation at non-landed private residences.",3,2368,2021-09-14-T-062-S-02368

2021-09-14-T-066,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"The root cause of these observations is human error. To help address this, the Government has progressively introduced tools to automate processes in IT controls. For account management, since November 2020, 33 agencies have implemented a tool that automatically notifies system managers of employee movements, so that they can be prompted to close the relevant user accounts. This is an interim measure. SNDGG will be implementing a technical solution that also automates the removal of accounts. Agencies will onboard onto this technical system, known as the Central Accounts Management (CAM) system, from January 2022 onwards, with all applicable systems onboarded by end-December 2023.",2,2380,2021-09-14-T-066-S-02380

The MRTT mission, staffed by 77 personnel from the Singapore Armed Forces, departed from Singapore on 26 August 2021 and returned to Singapore on 10 September 2021.

While there is currently no information of a specific terrorist threat to Singapore arising from the situation there, we are concerned if it would provide fertile conditions for transnational militant organisations, such as Al-Qaeda (AQ) and Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), to regroup or establish safe havens there, in the same manner that they had exploited other conflict zones like Syria/Iraq. These terrorist groups can also be expected to propagate an ideological narrative based on the American withdrawal, to draw recruits there.",1,2403,2021-09-14-T-072-S-02403
2021-09-14-T-072,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Our experience with the Soviet-Afghan conflict may be instructive. The conflict drew an estimated 10,000 foreign fighters over a 10-year period from 1979 to 1989, which included several hundred Southeast Asians. Through their experience in Afghanistan, these Southeast Asian militants developed links to AQ and formed a fraternity of mujahideen (fighters). Upon their return to Southeast Asia, they continued to pursue a path of violence through membership in regional militant groups like Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and imparted their operational skills to fellow members. At least 11 Singapore JI detainees were known to have attended military training in AQ camps in Afghanistan. Upon their return, several participated in terror plots targeting Singapore, including the collaboration with an AQ operative to mount suicide truck-bomb attacks against western embassies in Singapore.",2,2404,2021-09-14-T-072-S-02404

In 2019, a handful of Indonesian ISIS militants joined ISIS-K in Afghanistan. One of them was Saefullah, who plotted and financed attacks in Southeast Asia via a transnational network while he was embedded with ISIS-K. Notably, Saefullah facilitated the travel of an Indonesian couple to Jolo in southern Philippines, where they mounted suicide bombings on 27 January 2019.",3,2405,2021-09-14-T-072-S-02405

It is difficult to give a general response, since the law is often fact-specific, beyond stating that every road user owes a duty of care towards other road users. Members will, however, appreciate that it does not automatically mean that motorists can ignore another road user who may be in breach of the rules. For example, the fact that a pedestrian is crossing the road at a wrong place does not automatically mean that a motorist can ignore him and drive into the pedestrian and cause serious injury, when the motorist could have, in fact, stopped in time. In such cases, both parties may be liable, under different traffic rules. And civil law also has a way of apportioning the responsibilities, when claims are made.",3,2430,2021-09-14-T-075-S-02430

2021-09-14-T-081,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Flexi-Adjunct School Counsellors were introduced to better supplement schools’ short-term and ad hoc manpower needs, replacing the Part-Time School Counsellor Scheme in end-2020. About 100 Flexi-Adjunct School Counsellors are engaged in schools each month. Over 700 teacher counsellors are deployed in schools and we aim to increase this number to over 1,000 in the next few years.",2,2457,2021-09-14-T-081-S-02457

2021-09-14-T-081,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,We recognise that counselling work is demanding and teacher counsellors have to balance their teaching and counselling workload. Schools have the flexibility to reduce teaching or CCA duties for teacher counsellors to provide them more time to spend with students. Training for teacher counsellors has also been enhanced to equip them not only to support their students’ well-being but also better manage their own well-being. MOE will continue to monitor the workload of teacher counsellors and further strengthen the support for teacher counsellors to ensure that they are well-supported and have a manageable workload.,7,2462,2021-09-14-T-081-S-02462

2021-09-14-T-082,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Elective subjects, such as Music and Third Language, are not offered in all schools, as the enrolment could be too small to form a class. Hence, MOE has designated music/language centres spread across Singapore for students whose schools do not offer these subjects.",1,2464,2021-09-14-T-082-S-02464

There are also four zonal centres for M(SP) and two for C(SP) to cater to students from other schools. Foreign Language (French/German/Japanese/Spanish) classes are all held centrally at the two MOE Language Centres, as student numbers remain small.",2,2465,2021-09-14-T-082-S-02465

At the upper Secondary level, more than 25% of Secondary schools, well spread across Singapore, offer Music, as an elective subject, to their own students. Students enrolled in schools that do not offer Music at the upper Secondary level may choose to pursue it at 12 centres, also equally spread across the country.

2021-09-14-T-083,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Food manufacturers, caterers and event companies that were badly affected by the SMMs can appeal for the higher tier JSS. The entire category of companies cannot be automatically included because the industry classification (Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) codes) does not fully capture the range of activities that companies may undertake, or their main customer segments. For instance, many event companies tag themselves under “Audio/Video Equipment Rental1” and not the SSIC for event companies. Another factor is that SMM restrictions do not affect companies uniformly. For instance, food manufacturers that supply to F&B outlets may be more affected than food manufacturers that provide to supermarkets or overseas markets.",2,2469,2021-09-14-T-083-S-02469
2021-09-14-T-083,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As such, we exercise flexibility via appeals, and have extended the enhanced JSS support to companies which fall outside the stipulated qualifying criteria but are in genuine need.
