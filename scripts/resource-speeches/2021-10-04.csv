Including the two petitioners named above, there were a total of eight valid signatures.",1,2,2021-10-04-T-001-S-00002
2021-10-04-T-001,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),The petitioners allege that the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill contains extremely broad definitions that serve as a catch-all for a wide range of legitimate activities. They are concerned that the Bill proposes vast powers for the Minister for Home Affairs to issue directives to censure online content and criminalise the financing of online media platforms.,2,3,2021-10-04-T-001-S-00003
2021-10-04-T-001,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Further, the Bill allows the designation of Politically Sensitive Persons, which, once designated, would require adherence to a range of onerous reporting obligations and affect their right of free association. Yet, the avenues of appeal pertaining to powers within the Bill are limited and judicial review in open Court restricted to only procedural matters.",3,4,2021-10-04-T-001-S-00004
2021-10-04-T-001,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"If enacted, the law will have serious ramifications for multiple stakeholders and large sections of society, including academia, business, civil society and the media.",4,5,2021-10-04-T-001-S-00005
2021-10-04-T-001,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Singaporeans have an interest in a law that is more resistant to the potential for misinterpretation, misapplication, or even abused, in future.",5,6,2021-10-04-T-001-S-00006
2021-10-04-T-001,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The petitioners ask for a delay in the passage of the Bill into law, pending greater and more extensive public consultation, and the referral of the Bill to a Select Committee to consult and deliberate on the appropriateness and necessity of the measures included.",6,7,2021-10-04-T-001-S-00007
2021-10-04-T-001,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Apart from the eight signatories, the online petition with the same demands has garnered signatures from 39 civil organisations and 7,419 individuals as of 10.30 am, this morning.",7,8,2021-10-04-T-001-S-00008

2021-10-04-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,The Deputy Leader of the House (Mr Zaqy Mohamad),"While the hon Member has given a brief statement on the material allegations and prayers of the petitioners, I think it would be helpful if the terms and contents of the Petition could be made available to Members.

2021-10-04-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"In substance, the Petition makes several substantive criticisms about the Bill. Consequently, it calls for the Parliamentary passage of the Bill to be slowed down, in particular, by sending the Bill to a Select Committee for further consideration of the matters alleged.",2,21,2021-10-04-T-002-S-00021
2021-10-04-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"This being the case, I wish to seek your permission to move a Motion under Standing Order 18(6) proviso for the Petition to be considered during and together with the Second Reading of the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill.",3,22,2021-10-04-T-002-S-00022
2021-10-04-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Standing Order 18(6) provides two alternative procedures for a public petition to be dealt with  one, it can be referred to the Public Petitions Committee without any debate; two, when the petition relates to a Bill which is considered before Parliament, as is the case here, it can be considered by Parliament together with the Bill.",4,23,2021-10-04-T-002-S-00023
2021-10-04-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"In this case, it would make more sense for the Petition to be considered by this House together with the Bill, rather than be referred to the Public Petitions Committee.",5,24,2021-10-04-T-002-S-00024
2021-10-04-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the reasons are as follows.",6,25,2021-10-04-T-002-S-00025
2021-10-04-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"First, if the Petition is referred to the Public Petitions Committee rather than be considered by the House today, the Petition could effectively be rendered nugatory. This is because, so far as the Parliamentary passage of the Bill is concerned, the Second Reading debate is already fixed for today. The Petition cannot affect the order of the business that is already set down for today's proceedings. Therefore, by the time it goes to the Public Petitions Committee for consideration and the Committee makes its recommendations to Parliament, today's Second Reading would have been completed and the issue of the Bill will no longer be before this House. By enabling the Petition to be considered by Parliament during the debate on the Second Reading of the Bill, this Motion will facilitate and not avoid debate on matters raised in the Petition.",7,26,2021-10-04-T-002-S-00026
2021-10-04-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Secondly, Mr Speaker, the matters in the Petition are going to be addressed in the debate of the Second Reading of the Bill in any event. I say this because insofar as the substantive allegations are concerned, I note there appears to be substantial overlap between the points raised in the Petition and those raised by the Workers' Party in the Notice of Amendments to the Bill set out in the Order Paper Supplement. This means that those substantive points are going to be raised and debated during today's proceedings.",8,27,2021-10-04-T-002-S-00027
2021-10-04-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Sir, if this Motion is moved and agreed to, Members will be able to fully debate the issues in the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill and the Petition together.",9,28,2021-10-04-T-002-S-00028
2021-10-04-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Hence, I seek your consent to move this Motion.",10,29,2021-10-04-T-002-S-00029

2021-10-04-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Thank you. Mr Speaker, Sir, the recent move to quickly tighten safe management measures was a difficult but necessary decision. We are committed to our plans to opening up and transit to a COVID-19 resilient nation. Hence, lockdowns like circuit breakers are no longer an option. Many workers, families, students and businesses are going to suffer for it, and it will affect our ability to earn ourselves a living in the long term.",1,55,2021-10-04-T-003-S-00055
2021-10-04-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"With the great majority of our population – over 83% – fully vaccinated, we are one of the most highly vaccinated countries in the world. As a result, during this wave of infections, over 98% of infected individuals experienced mild or no symptoms, 1.7% required oxygen supplementation in hospitals typically for a few days, 0.2% required ICU care and unfortunately, 0.1% passed away.",2,56,2021-10-04-T-003-S-00056
2021-10-04-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Although only a small percentage of infected individuals require hospital or ICU care, we also admit many more others for observation, because they are at risk of developing serious illnesses. So, when infection number rises, all these translate to a larger number of hospital patients, which put considerable strain on our hospitals and our healthcare workers.",3,57,2021-10-04-T-003-S-00057
2021-10-04-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Hence, even as we continue our journey to transit to a COVID-19 resilient nation, we should also have a care for our hospitals and healthcare workers, and ""tap on the brakes"" to slow down the rate of transmission. This is why we had to implement the measures under the Stabilisation Phase last week.",4,58,2021-10-04-T-003-S-00058
2021-10-04-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Unfortunately, in this rapidly changing and evolving situation, we have to stay agile, adapt and respond quickly. We will try to give as early a notice as possible to businesses, but there is a practical limit to that, and we seek your understanding.",5,59,2021-10-04-T-003-S-00059
2021-10-04-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"On the Home Recovery Programme (HRP), this is an important part of our response, given that the vast majority of infected individuals has mild or no symptoms. These individuals do not need special medical care and can therefore recover safely at home.",6,60,2021-10-04-T-003-S-00060
2021-10-04-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Dennis Tan asked if individuals can request to be sent to an isolation facility instead. We have been considering and accommodating such requests, taking into account the medical conditions of the individuals and their family circumstances. But it is also important to emphasise that individuals and families should make, and have been making, some adjustments to their living arrangements to make HRP safe and possible at home. Because it is only with a high take-up of HRP, that our hospitals can focus resources on those who may require greater medical attention, including non-COVID-19 patients who need acute hospital care. This will enable our healthcare professionals to concentrate those who need acute hospital care.",7,61,2021-10-04-T-003-S-00061
2021-10-04-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In response to Mr Xie Yao Quan, in the initial days of HRP, a fair number of patients without serious symptoms did make their way to the Emergency Departments of hospitals. We did not compile the numbers but it had led to overcrowding of the Departments. We understand the anxiety of these patients. It is, therefore, important for us to iron out all the teething issues of HRP, so that there is a strong sense of assurance as patients undergo HRP. Over the past few days, such incidences have been significantly reduced.",8,62,2021-10-04-T-003-S-00062
2021-10-04-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Over the past week, and with the SAF overseeing and operating the programme end-to-end, we have been ironing out the teething issues, resolving service lapses, including those relating to timeliness of notification and conveyancing, and also improving communications with patients and their families. Things are improving day by day.",9,63,2021-10-04-T-003-S-00063
2021-10-04-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In response to Miss Cheng Li Hui, currently, there are about 9,800 people on the HRP and they are recovering well. Over 2,800 have been discharged as of 3 October 2021. Every day, over half of infected individuals will be onboarded on HRP and we expect the proportion to continue to rise. In recent days, for those eligible for HRP, 93% are contacted promptly and smoothly onboarded. But we still have difficulties contacting the remaining minority because there was either no response or contact details are not accurate. So, this is another teething issue that we are ironing out using IT solutions.",10,64,2021-10-04-T-003-S-00064
2021-10-04-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As for those who are illiterate and do not understand the SMS notifications from MOH, we hope family members, neighbours and volunteers can give them a hand. That is why our partnership with the People’s Association is very important. Over the weekend, volunteers have been mobilised to reach out to residents who have been served HRP notifications. I thank the People's Association and all our volunteers for their hard work on the ground.",11,65,2021-10-04-T-003-S-00065
2021-10-04-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As the patients are generally well, we have also kept the involvement of telemedicine providers quite light and have patients call them only when they need medical attention.",12,66,2021-10-04-T-003-S-00066
2021-10-04-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In response to Mr Xie Yao Quan, typically, after a person is detected as COVID-19 positive, MOH will contact him within 24 hours, where triaging will be done and a decision will be made on whether he will be on HRP or needs to be conveyed to a care facility.",13,67,2021-10-04-T-003-S-00067
2021-10-04-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In response to Ms Ng Ling Ling, amongst those on HRP, as of 26 September, about 400 are Persons under Quarantine who subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. Ninety-five percent of them are eligible for HRP and have recovered or are recovering well at home. Five percent needed to be conveyed to a care facility and this was generally done within 24 hours of the request for conveyance.",14,68,2021-10-04-T-003-S-00068
2021-10-04-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I would like to assure the House that MOH and the SAF are working hard together, devoting a lot of attention and resources to continue to improve the HRP and its processes.",15,69,2021-10-04-T-003-S-00069
2021-10-04-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Ms Sylvia Lim also asked about a related issue concerning the procedures of quarantine and Stay-Home Notices (SHN) for travellers. There have been some changes to the SHN procedures, which was announced last week, namely to align SHN duration with the quarantine duration.",16,70,2021-10-04-T-003-S-00070
2021-10-04-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As I have explained at the Multi-ministry Task Force (MTF) press conference over the weekend, the healthcare protocols developed over the past months have become complex and confusing to most people. We are undertaking a holistic and comprehensive review to simplify them, so that people understand them and can, therefore, do their part in the fight against COVID-19, and also help others who are in need of assistance and guidance.",17,71,2021-10-04-T-003-S-00071
2021-10-04-T-003,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Let me now move on to vaccination and boosters. Vaccination remains key to our battle against COVID-19.

There has been some international data available, including a fairly extensive study done earlier this year – it was pre-Delta – that was done in Chile, which uses a mixture of vaccines. Our neighbouring countries too have released some data. All these data showed that just like the mRNA vaccines, breakthrough infections are not uncommon amongst individuals vaccinated with the Sinovac vaccine, but the Sinovac vaccine does accord protection against severe illnesses.",20,74,2021-10-04-T-003-S-00074

Indeed, I have received a lot of feedback too, where a person after his discharge, does not have his TraceTogether indication lifted. So, we are fixing that, it is essentially an IT issue. The reason why there is now a fixed day of discharge, is because once a person is vaccinated, viral load drops very quickly, especially after day 5. And by day 10, NCID find that they cannot culture the virus anymore because viral load becomes quite low. Which is why we can safely discharge patients who are vaccinated at day 10.",1,128,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00128

So, in the next few days, the TraceTogether issue will be resolved as we will also synchronise the removal of the alert in line with the discharge day. So, once you are infected, the TraceTogether App would know and it will count that 10 days from then, if you are vaccinated, you will be automatically removed. If you are not vaccinated, it will be removed after 14 days. So, this problem I expect to be resolved.",2,129,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00129
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As for CCF, I thank the Member for raising that issue. There are nurses and there are workers available at the CCF. So, if we come across such cases where the senior is alone or illiterate, let us know and we will alert the CCFs. There are people on hand, medical workers, who can help out and help the senior navigate and understand the messages that we are sending to them.",3,130,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00130
2021-10-04-T-004,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Ms Denise Phua. Please limit to two supplementary questions if possible and keep the questions short. This applies to everyone.,1,131,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00131
2021-10-04-T-004,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"I thank the Minister and the Senior Minister of State for the answers. I know it is really a very difficult time for everyone. We also want to support as much as possible, but I cannot help asking these two supplementary questions.",1,132,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00132
2021-10-04-T-004,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Number one is, thank you for letting us know that Home Recovery now is a default option for COVID-19 positive residents. My questions are specifically for those who are vulnerable. What if Home Recovery is the default option but a resident is just not suitable for recovery at home? For example, in the Central district, we have a lot of rental flats where there are a lot of sharing of facilities like toilets and living rooms, with just one door for everybody to get through. What if the homes are just not suitable for Home Recovery? Or what if there are just very large families in some of these homes?",2,133,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00133
2021-10-04-T-004,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"The second supplementary question is this. Thank you to Senior Minister of State Janil for making it very clear that caregivers are allowed to accompany those who are vulnerable like the elderly who are not independent, the disabled young or old, and so forth. As Members of Parliament, we often get questions that come fast and furious from residents. If the questions come directly to us, we always get responsive replies, especially when we write to MOH Public Officeholders (POHs). But in general, how does the public get to know that the caregivers can accompany the more vulnerable, especially if the MOH hotline is very stretched at the moment? So, what if quick responses are required —",3,134,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00134

2021-10-04-T-004,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng,— and they just do not know where to get the answers. Thank you.,1,136,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00136
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,I will keep my answers short.,1,137,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00137
2021-10-04-T-004,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Thank you.,1,138,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00138
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"HRP is the default, provided you meet certain criteria, such as you are younger, you are vaccinated, some not vaccinated but younger. But within this default, while it is the default, it is not rigid. It is important that once the person is notified that he is on HRP, he is also given a phone number to call to reach what we call an HRP Buddy. If he is not comfortable because of living conditions or he is living with vulnerable seniors or unvaccinated children, they can then make the request to say, ""While I am asked to go on HRP, can I be taken out to a CCF?""",1,139,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00139
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"And we will try our best to accommodate those requests. So, your residents can certainly, request by calling the HRP Buddy.",2,140,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00140
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As for how would the public know, mass media is one way. We put out FAQs as simply as we can. But even so, it is hard to understand for many members of the public.",3,141,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00141
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Another layer will be our community volunteers, our Community Centres (CCs). Many do call up our CCs to ask questions. And so, we also need to arm PA and our CCs with answers for all these questions. Most or 80% of the questions are related to those few things. Our volunteers should be also equipped with the information and they can reach out and explain to them.",4,142,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00142
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Finally, it will be the hotline. It has been difficult to call through in the past few days. But we have been beefing up the resources day by day, with SAF's help, it has really improved a lot. As of yesterday when I checked, we are able to attend to almost 70% of the callers. So, it is improving and we continue to improve it. Once that happens, as more people can call through, get the answers, they will also tell their friends, and I think the situation will change.",5,143,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00143

2021-10-04-T-004,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker and thank you to Senior Minister of State Janil for his responses. Both my supplementary questions have to do with whether we are following protocol that may look good on the surface but actually seems to make less sense when you dig into the policy.",1,145,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00145
2021-10-04-T-004,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"The first has to do with my question on what the material differences between importing cases and quarantine. If I may develop this, is the concern the risk of importing new variants? And if so, does MOH actually have a view on risks of the new variants' fitness given that Delta is fairly endemic? Does it make sense to apply such a strict protocol that could discourage business travel with long stay-at-home requirements for imported cases?",2,146,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00146
2021-10-04-T-004,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"My second question has to do with how the Senior Minister of State indicated that currently those issued with a Quarantine Order should self-isolate, but it actually does not require all family members to do. So, I wonder what is the Senior Minister of State's view on how this procedure could potentially be a loophole, since surely there is no appreciable difference between the legal guardian that has to accompany a minor in the case of an SHN versus the other household members, insofar as virus exposure is concerned?",3,147,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00147
2021-10-04-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I thank the Member for his questions. For the first question, I think he is essentially asking why does it appear as if there are different standards for someone who is travelling, versus someone who is given a Home Quarantine Order or a Health Risk Alert here in Singapore.",1,148,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00148
2021-10-04-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Partly, this is a result of the changing situation and actually, today, an increasing number of travellers are allowed to do a Stay-Home Notice and you will see that we will have further and further streamlining, optimising and alignment of our various measures. The situation is moving quite fast. We will review and align these measures.",2,149,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00149
2021-10-04-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"But if I could go into the specifics of his question, or at least, what I think are the specifics of his question, the risk associated with travellers is partly to do with variants; it is partly to do with the robustness of the information that we are receiving, depending on where they are coming from, what we understand about the situation they have in their home country as well as the particulars of that individual's likely location if they are not in a dedicated facility here, in the stay-at-home facility.",3,150,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00150

2021-10-04-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"For his second question, I did not quite understand what he was asking. The call is for all of us to be responsible and for the household members of a contact indeed to register. We are not asking for only some of them to register. We are asking for all of them to register. And indeed, the risk to the whole household is pretty much the same as a caregiver that accompanies someone who is vulnerable. Hence, our request for all of them to register.",5,152,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00152
2021-10-04-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"In truth, much of the exposure and the risk will happen before the COVID-19 index case is detected.

2021-10-04-T-004,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"I have two supplementary questions. The first pertains to Question No 2. The COVIDsitrep website is a good initiative in terms of communications. I wish to ask whether the Ministry is prepared to consider a benchmark such as the probability and death rate of getting the seasonal flu and dengue fever versus getting COVID-19, in our public communications. This will help allay fears and contextualise the likelihood of getting COVID-19.",2,156,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00156
2021-10-04-T-004,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"My next supplementary question pertains to Question No 12. In monitoring the COVID-19 situation in Singapore, I wish to ask the Ministry, what the next trigger points that MOH is worried about. And given the R-nought (R0) indicator, we can roughly predict when they will occur. As such, how does MOH intend to communicate both the trigger points as well as the time horizon to the public? This will get the public and industries sufficiently timed and early warning to adjust to new measures.",3,157,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00157
2021-10-04-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I will address the Member's first question. Indeed, we do need to communicate. The relative risks of COVID-19 infection, and getting the infection, and then perhaps risks of complications and severe disease, and put these in context relative to other common diseases such as influenza or even not so common diseases such as dengue, for the public to understand how they should go about their business when we reach some sort of equilibrium.",1,158,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00158

2021-10-04-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"So, I thank the Member for his suggestion that we do need to put some of these numbers in the context of a lot of other diseases that we are used to dealing with. We will do so when we are approaching an equilibrium and we have plans to do so.",3,160,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00160
2021-10-04-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"But I think at the moment the anxieties are around the large number of cases, the wave that we are experiencing. It is very real and we should not under play it.",4,161,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00161
2021-10-04-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,I understand that Minister Ong Ye Kung will address the second question.,5,162,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00162
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Thank you. As for the Member's second question on trigger points before we loosen our safe management measures further, we are aware and we are all well aware that certain countries have declared certain dates or certain vaccination levels, and then, they will open up. We have not adopted that approach. Because we recognise that in battling COVID-19, this is a live, evolving, fast-changing situation and it is not wise for us to tie our hands and limit our options as we adapt and stay agile in battling the COVID-19 virus.",1,163,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00163
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Therefore, we will have to take into account of the situation in hospitals, our case numbers, how people are reacting, what is our social preparedness to live with the virus and how businesses are doing, and we adjust our measures from time to time. But our direction is very clear  we have to live with COVID-19, we have to become a COVID-19 resilient nation. The direction is clear, but from time to time, we may take a longer route, we may take a detour, but we will stay on course.",2,164,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00164

2021-10-04-T-004,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Sir, many Singaporeans and businesses are very frustrated with the repeated open-shut of our economy and our lives. Minister Ong said on 21 September that during the preparatory period, MOH projected handling 100 to 200 cases a day. This is far lower than the actual caseload since 19 August. Why were these projections so far off? Delta has been with us for almost six months and there is plenty of data on Delta infections from countries like India and Israel, which were hit by the Delta wave before us. Why was the Government not better prepared for the caseload after reopening?",2,167,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00167
2021-10-04-T-004,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"And for Senior Minister of State Janil, what is the rationale for children under 12 being ineligible for home recovery, given that children, even those unvaccinated usually have mild or no those symptoms when infected? Because allowing them to recover at home by default, allows their parents to care for them and will also reduce the load on hospitals.",3,168,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00168
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I will answer both questions. I do not think we characterised our safe management posture as opening and shutting. But depending on the situation, we have to make adjustments and over time, we have made progress in the sense that I think we have put circuit breaker behind us. If we remember in April last year, almost all businesses were shut. And then, we had Heightened Alert, which is a far more moderate form of slowing transmission, slowing economic activities. This time round, we try not to go back to Heightened Alert, but instead, it is mainly restaurants and F&B that are affected. We want to keep them open, try not to affect distances so much. MOF provided financial assistance, but they can operate with table of two.",1,169,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00169
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, I think we are making those progress and I think we should also feel encouraged that because of vaccinations, we are able to move forward.",2,170,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00170
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As for the numbers, if I remember correctly, in late August, when we started seeing a wave, I mentioned 3,200 as a possible daily number, if the doubling cycle goes on five times. We were at 100 cases then; if it goes on five times, we would have reached 3,200.",3,171,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00171
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The ""100 and 200"" number, I am not sure where it come from. A lot of things were said during the MTF press conferences, but I did refer to it, as during the preparatory phase, we were hoping to maintain around that number. Because we were still preparing ourselves.",4,172,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00172
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"And when the whole thing is over, in the  endemic stage, perhaps, we will see 200 cases, maybe more.",5,173,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00173
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But I hope we take all these numbers in the spirit. I speak to epidemiologists, doctors all the time. They explain things to me, they cite numbers. I then try to explain things to the public. And so, some numbers may be picked on, but let us take it in the right spirit. I am not making any projections or predictions, but these are things that I learn from MOH, and I am trying to explain honestly to the public to the best of my abilities.",6,174,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00174
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As for children under 12, actually, they can serve Home Recovery. We do encourage them to serve Home Recovery. And many parents, in fact, like to serve Home Recovery.",7,175,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00175
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I am not sure if it is made the default, but certainly, it has great potential to be made a default. And a great majority of children can recover very well at home and they are happier that way.",8,176,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00176

The Senior Minister of State mentioned that MOH has tapped on private hospitals to alleviate the load on public hospitals. I have one supplementary question. May I know how has this helped alleviate any shortage of resources in the public hospitals?",1,178,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00178
2021-10-04-T-004,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"I have had residents who have been hospitalised with non-COVID-19 related illnesses and shared that the care was inadequate. So, I hope the Senior Minister of State can answer that.",2,179,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00179
2021-10-04-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I thank the Member for the question. The whole of our healthcare system has been mobilised for this effort  public and private. And they are different institutions, but they are working as a team. It is a bit hard to quantify because the private sector is looking after COVID-19 patients under their roof, but they are also looking after other patients with other conditions. Their doctors and nurses have been deployed elsewhere into other sites. So, has it helped? The answer is yes, because manpower is available, beds are available, resources are available.",1,180,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00180

2021-10-04-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The way I would look at it is this. We have a healthcare system here in Singapore that is made up of public providers, private providers, volunteers as well. And the healthcare is not just about the bed, the doctor or the nurse. It is the entire system working together and everyone is mobilised to try to do their best to deal with this crisis in front of us.

I would like to ask either the Minister or the Senior Minister of State on individuals who need to do the seven-day or 14-day mandatory PCR tests. MOH currently publicly runs regional PCR screening centres. They are not quite located at the convenient locations for those who need to do those tests on a weekly basis or bi-weekly basis. So, can I ask MOH if there are plans to build more of such centres?",1,184,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00184
2021-10-04-T-004,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Secondly, in some estates, where there are hawker centres, they do have their own PCR testing facilities set-up. But only the stallholders are allowed to use those testing facilities. So, in such situations, can I ask if I MOH can allow or support or facilitate these PCR testing facilities to be used by other workers as well who need to do the regular seven-day, 14-day tests, so that the community resources can be shared and to ensure better convenience for those frontline workers as well as building that community spirit as well?",2,185,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00185
2021-10-04-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I thank the Member for his question. He has identified the direction in which we are moving with these strategies. We have opened up more centres. We have 22 Regional Screening Centres, 20 Quick Test Centres and five private Quick Test Centres. We are already working on opening up these areas to other users and working with the employers as well, just to make sure these resources are made available to as wide a base as possible, to speed up the processes that he talks about.",1,186,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00186
2021-10-04-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The sector leads among the employers are encouraged to move towards the fast and easy testing RRT, primarily with the employer supervised self-swab model, so that people could self-test at their own location, at their own convenience.

2021-10-04-T-004,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have two supplementary questions. The first is, I take the Minister for Health's earlier explanation about the numbers that were quoted earlier. But my question relates to what were the previous planning parameters when we first announced that we are moving into endemic phase? This is very key because we need to know that we are properly resourced; that we do not have a situation like we saw in the last couple of weeks where people were waiting for days, or up to a week before they were actually responded to.",1,190,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00190
2021-10-04-T-004,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"So, my question would be, how many cases were we planning for back then, before this current surge? Was it 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 or 5,000? And how can we actually put measures in place to make sure that it does not occur, especially, we are planning to loosen the restrictions again in three weeks. So, I think everybody wants to avoid a situation where we actually end up where, every time we loosen some restrictions, we see a massive surge, and then people cannot actually get any answers, or they cannot get through the hotlines.",2,191,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00191
2021-10-04-T-004,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"The second point is whether anything can be done for better communications and messaging for residents and people who are actually affected. We have things like Heightened Alert, Stabilisation, preparatory stages. People are getting very confused about what each of these actually refer to. Same goes for the acronyms like HRP, QOs. And I am sure many Members have actually seen the many, many different flowcharts and spreadsheets. It is just very, very confusing.",3,192,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00192
2021-10-04-T-004,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"What else can be done to make sure that our communications to a very complicated situation, is communicated to residents so that they do not end up having to jam the hotlines as well?",4,193,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00193
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I thank the Member for acknowledging that it is a complicated situation. Over 20 months, we have developed many responses, many protocols in order to handle the situation, which is why there is now a plethora of different protocols.",1,194,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00194
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But as I mentioned during our press conference over the weekend, now, we are in a different phase. Many of the protocols were designed at a time when the public wants to see us snuffing out every single cluster. And so, we have all these tight protocols.",2,195,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00195
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,But now we are in a phase of trying to live with COVID-19 and there are protocols.,3,196,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00196
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"And so, we announced last weekend that we are in the process of holistically reviewing all the protocols with a view to streamline them. I do not think we can get away with some abbreviations and some alphabet soup. That will still be around. It is after all, a very complicated situation. But we will try our best to streamline as much as possible, so that people would understand it, able to do their part to fight against COVID-19 and also, to help others.",4,197,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00197
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Back to the numbers and planning criteria, the Member seems to have a narrative that we totally did not plan for all these. On the contrary, we have always planned for a big surge. You would hear from Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, and these are partners that we work very closely with, they have projected 5,000 and 10,000 cases a day, as high as that. You speak to different epidemiologists, they may have different views, but these are the numbers if we fully open.",5,198,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00198
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"You have seen it in other countries happening that kind of peak. And that is why through our communication with public, you would hear us – whether myself, Minister Gan or Minister Lawrence Wong – always saying, cases will rise; and when cases rise, number of people with severe illnesses and deaths, will rise. And we have been saying that.",6,199,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00199
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I also mentioned at end August, when we start to see the start of this wave, we say that doubling cycle, if it happens five times, we will reach 3,200. Therefore, we have always sized ourselves up for that kind of number. We hope that we can do so progressively, and not suddenly, which is why we also announced a four-stage opening process  preparatory stage, where we try out home recovery, build up, our CTFs, CCFs and so on. And then transitions – we call it transition stage one, if people still remember – and stage two, and then finally endemicity. We gave no deadline or timeline for reasons I explained earlier that we need to watch the situation.",7,200,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00200
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,But we were just in the preparatory stage. The Delta variant came in and then cases start to shoot up.,8,201,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00201
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But fortunately, we have always been planning ahead, which is why at that point in time, we were already ready to handle 1,500 cases a day, in terms of Community Care Facilities (CCFs), hospital beds, ICU beds, and then also thinking already about setting up the Community Treatment Facility (CTF) beds and we are also starting with the HRP.",9,202,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00202
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"By now, we have capacity to handle 3,000 cases and ramping up in one to two weeks to handle 5,000 cases – but we do not know whether we will reach there.

2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, in terms of planning capacity, manpower, we are always one, two bounds ahead.",11,204,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00204
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"What I think did not go well and I fully acknowledge that, was the HRP. And all the complaints about conveyancing, calling, not getting in, people not getting responses. It is not because the beds were not catered for, but processes with regard to the HRP were not totally ready. We were caught by the sudden increase. We are still implementing the pilot programme when all these happened.",12,205,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00205
2021-10-04-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But the team swung into action, the call of public duty kicked in and everybody is putting their heart and soul to solve the problem. So, day by day, we are seeing improvements and will continue to do so. We have to make HRP work, then the great majority of patients who are well, no symptoms, mild symptoms who can recover at home. Then, the hospital capacity that we plan for can focus on the 2% that really need help. Things are improving.",13,206,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00206

2021-10-04-T-004,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question pertains to my original Parliamentary Question 18, part (b), which I believe has not been quite answered.",1,208,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00208
2021-10-04-T-004,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"The question really is this; as we learn to live with COVID-19 and as we settle into a new equilibrium of elevated daily number of cases, in the longer run, what is the capacity of general wards in public hospitals that the Ministry expects to set aside for COVID-19 patients? The concern is the more beds we set for COVID-19 patients, I think the less beds we have for non-COVID-19 related conditions. Are there enough hospital beds to go around in our public healthcare system?",2,209,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00209
2021-10-04-T-004,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"The other side of this question, is in terms of wait time, to a hospital bed for a COVID-19 patient, in the longer run, at steady state, does Ministry have an expectation and what might that be?",3,210,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00210
2021-10-04-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I thank the Member for the questions. For the first part, we set aside COVID-19 beds currently because our approach is to isolate them and separate them from the rest of the patients in the healthcare facilities.",1,211,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00211
2021-10-04-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"But as you go towards endemic COVID-19, COVID-19 will have to be treated like any other infectious disease. In peacetime in the endemic situation, we do not have influenza beds or dengue beds, or chickenpox beds – and all of these are infectious diseases. What we have is beds on the basis of the patients' needs. Increasingly, the COVID-19 patients in hospitals will have other types of diseases. They will have kidney problems, heart problems and neurological problems. So, it is a bit hard to then delineate in the steady state, once we are done with the surge, once we are done with this current strategy, as we move towards endemic COVID-19, I do not think we will be in a position to then say, these are the COVID-19 beds and these are the non-COVID-19 beds. We will have to treat COVID-19 like other infectious diseases.",2,212,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00212
2021-10-04-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Nevertheless, in the middle of the surge now, we are ramping up our capacity, mobilising resources as we have described in our answers to Parliamentary Questions and supplementary questions, but also trying to improve the flow of patients through our system, so that these resources are made available.",3,213,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00213
2021-10-04-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"But the most important strategy is to focus the resources that we do have on those who need it the most. Vaccination is part of reducing the number of people who need those resources. The well, who are asymptomatic, being able to stay home, or go to CCFs or CTFs, is part of that strategy as well, as are our attempts to then slow down the transmission in the community.",4,214,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00214
2021-10-04-T-004,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"All of these, then, feeds into the issue of wait time. Whether it is about bed space or having your call answered, making sure that those resources that we have, and those officers, are deployed to deal with the people who need help most, will also help in reducing the wait time. But ultimately, we do need the manpower and we are working on ramping up that capacity as well.",5,215,2021-10-04-T-004-S-00215
2021-10-04-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David,asked the Minister for Education (a) whether the Government can provide an update on the recent period of home-based learning (HBL) that is implemented in late September/early October 2021 for primary school students in terms of the impact on their learning and development; and (b) whether this indicates a possible shift to more HBL periods for schools in the future.,1,216,2021-10-04-T-005-S-00216
2021-10-04-T-005,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa,asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry will consider moving schools to home-based learning in view of the spike in the number of COVID-19 cases.,1,217,2021-10-04-T-005-S-00217
2021-10-04-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Mr Speaker, Sir, can I have your permission to take Question Nos 21 and 22 together?",1,218,2021-10-04-T-005-S-00218

2021-10-04-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"MOE's approach has been to keep schools safe so that they can remain open as far as possible. We recognise that Home-Based Learning (HBL) cannot be a full substitute for the school-based learning experience. On a prolonged basis, it comes at a cost not just to students' learning but also their socio-emotional development and mental well-being. It also imposes a burden to families and society. Moreover, not all students have a home environment conducive to HBL.",1,220,2021-10-04-T-005-S-00220
2021-10-04-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The past few months have given us greater confidence that we can strike a balance by taking a more targeted approach to ringfence cases and their close contacts. For example, rather than resorting to full HBL across all schools, or the entire level, we would only place affected classes on HBL in response to a confirmed case, if there is a possibility of transmission within schools.",2,221,2021-10-04-T-005-S-00221
2021-10-04-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"To reduce the possible disruption to the PSLE cohort and as an additional precautionary measure for Primary schools, we had placed all our Primary schools on HBL from 27 September to 6 October. Subsequently, when the national posture tightened, this was extended by a day to include 7 October, effectively covering Term 4, Week 3 to 4, or two weeks, given that Children's Day on 8 October is already a school holiday.",3,222,2021-10-04-T-005-S-00222
2021-10-04-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,Schools mitigate the impact of HBL by using technology to minimise disruption to curriculum coverage and maintain social connections. Teachers use online platforms and resources to ensure that students who are away from school can continue learning and conduct regular check-ins with these students to monitor their well-being. Schools have sufficient computing devices and Internet-enabling devices to loan to students and remain open for high needs students and those without alternative caregiving arrangements during HBL.,4,223,2021-10-04-T-005-S-00223

2021-10-04-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"The first one is that I understand the Minister's point about HBL not just for our Primary school students but also for keeping our PSLE cohort safe. However, moving forward beyond this week, does the Minister foresee the possibility of HBL being extended either into the future or perhaps even until the start of the school holidays?",2,227,2021-10-04-T-005-S-00227
2021-10-04-T-005,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"And also bearing in mind that we now have ""N"" level, ""O"" level and even ""A"" level examinations coming up, does the Minister foresee the possibility to keep those cohorts, say, protected as well, that HBL might be rolled out in Secondary schools and beyond?",3,228,2021-10-04-T-005-S-00228
2021-10-04-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, may I take the second question first and then, come back to the first.",1,229,2021-10-04-T-005-S-00229
2021-10-04-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the considerations for the Primary schools and the Secondary schools are quite different. The main difference being that most of our Primary school kids, less half of the Primary 6 cohorts, are not vaccinated yet, which is why we have taken extra precautions for our Primary schools. For Secondary schools and above, a vast majority of our students have already been vaccinated. So, the kind of anxiety that the students or their families may face is quite different. We will do what is necessary to make sure that the ongoing ""N"" level and the upcoming ""O"" level and ""A"" level examinations can continue to be conducted safely.",2,230,2021-10-04-T-005-S-00230
2021-10-04-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the first question as to whether we will extend HBL for the Primary schools, MOE will be making an announcement later this week. The reason why I am not making the announcement today are as follows.",3,231,2021-10-04-T-005-S-00231
2021-10-04-T-005,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"One, we are in the middle of PSLE. I would like to have all the school leaders and the teachers to focus on the task at hand first. Second, we are also proceeding with our internal preparations and communications with our educators and I would like them to know our decision collectively first before we make the announcement later part of this week in tandem with the national posture.",4,232,2021-10-04-T-005-S-00232

2021-10-04-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, our testing for staff and children will follow the national posture. Suffice to say that, we understand the importance of resuming the CCAs for our students as soon as possible, as much as possible because this is all part of their overall development beyond the academic subjects that they do in school. A large part of the school curriculum also involves, what we call the Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs), which helps our children to build up their socio-emotional resilience and well-being.

2021-10-04-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I had given Mr Speaker Notice that I wanted to make a short Ministerial Statement. This relates to something that was said in the Parliamentary Sitting on the 3 of August 2021, this year, by one of the Members of Parliament, Ms Khan, on the WP's Motion on Empowering Women.",1,264,2021-10-04-T-009-S-00264
2021-10-04-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"And Ms Khan had said that three years ago, she had accompanied a 25-year-old's survivor to file a Police report against a rape and that she saw the survivor coming out crying. The survivor told her that the Police officer had made comments about her dressing and the fact that she had been drinking. Ms Khan also shared her experience with this House about going with the victim to the Police, what she saw after she had filed the report and she cited it as an example of how law enforcement needs to ensure better treatment of sexual assault's survivors.",2,265,2021-10-04-T-009-S-00265
2021-10-04-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"My colleague, Minister of State Desmond Tan, then asked for more details about the incident so that the Government can investigate what happened. He explained that MHA takes these allegations very seriously and said that they had to be looked into to check if the case had been handled properly by the Police and that they should not be swept aside without further investigations.",3,266,2021-10-04-T-009-S-00266
2021-10-04-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),Ms Khan's response was that she had raised the example as it was her personal experience with the rape survivor. She also stated her belief that these anecdotes are not isolated and expressed the hope that such incidents could start further discussions about how victims are treated. She went on to say that the incident happened three years ago and she did not wish to re-traumatise this survivor whom she had accompanied.,4,267,2021-10-04-T-009-S-00267
2021-10-04-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Later in the debate, Ms Khan rose again to further clarify that she raised the example because it was her experience with the survivor and that the episode took place three years ago and she had been unsuccessful in getting in touch with the victim. She said this in the context that and, I quote, ""consent is imperative not least to avoid re-victimisation.""",5,268,2021-10-04-T-009-S-00268
2021-10-04-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"We take such allegations concerning the Police very seriously. Ms Khan had said that she did not the victim to be re-traumatised or re-victimised. I understand and empathise with that and we will bear that in mind as we seek to investigate what happened, especially since a Member has raised this here in Parliament, to make sure that we know what happened and, if necessary, discipline the Police officers involved. This does not have to mean naming the victim. We will consider carefully how to protect the victim and deal with these matters sensitively.",6,269,2021-10-04-T-009-S-00269
2021-10-04-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"What is extremely important is that we identify the Police station, the officers involved.

2021-10-04-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"And when the Member saw the victim come out crying after her interview, did the Member bring this to the Police officers' attention? What did the Member say to the officers? How did the officers respond when alerted to the victim's reaction? And did the Member lodge a complaint about what happened, either at that time or after that? And I think the Member should be able to remember the month, the year when this happened when she went to the Police station. She told the Parliament three times that this happened three years ago. Can she confirm that this took place in 2018?",11,274,2021-10-04-T-009-S-00274
2021-10-04-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"I should add that since we take very seriously all these points, Police has spent a lot of time searching their records since this point was made. They do not seem to be able to identify a case where Ms Khan was present with the victim. It is entirely possible that they did not note down Ms Khan's name. But it is most important that the matter is not left hanging, with doubt over what may or may not have happened.",12,275,2021-10-04-T-009-S-00275
2021-10-04-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"And as I have said, our focus is on the Police officers, the reputation of Singapore Police Force to help the victim and for us to find out what happened and to try and make sure that Police officers understand better, if indeed it happened in this way and change their behaviour, if necessary, and for the message to go out to all Police officers.",13,276,2021-10-04-T-009-S-00276

2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"And the second part dealing with foreign interference through local proxies. The second part, I will refer to it as the Politically Significant Persons or PSP part.",4,334,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00334
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"The second part is about slightly more than half of this Bill. There is existing law, the Political Donations Act (PDA) and we have ported over the existing PDA and updated it. Members of Parliament will be familiar with the PDA. So, it is the PDA which has been brought into the PSP part of the Bill, with updating.",5,335,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00335
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"I will set out the reasons for this Bill, deal with some of the concerns that have been raised and deal with the proposed amendments by the Workers' Party. My colleagues, Ministers of State Desmond Tan and Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, will take the Members through the detailed provisions of the Bill.",6,336,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00336
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"First, on the PSP part of the Bill. The philosophy is that our politics is for Singaporeans to deal with. We can argue, disagree, but ultimately, it is for us to decide.",7,337,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00337
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"If I can quote what the former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director James Comey told the House Intelligence Committee in March 2017, ""One of the things we radiate to the world is the importance of our wonderful, often messy, but free and fair democratic system and the elections that undergird it. And so, when there is something by a foreign nation state to mess with that, to destroy that, to corrupt that, it is very, very serious and threatens what is America."" The very idea of America.",8,338,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00338
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"We do not put it in the same grandiose terms but Singapore is important for us and we take the same approach. We say it is not for the Americans to tell us what to do, as they have tried, and is it not for anyone else to tell us what to do either.",9,339,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00339
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"This was expressed in 1973 in the President's speech and expressed in law through the PDA, which sets out rules for interactions with foreigners for election candidates, election agents and political associations.",10,340,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00340
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"The PSP part, as I said, is based on existing legislation, the PDA, ported over.",11,341,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00341
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Over the years, subversion has become an even more serious issue. Modern ease of communications, increased interactions and travel have made it inevitable that traditional spying and subversion increases in scope and intensity. This is happening in Singapore and elsewhere.",12,342,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00342
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),Just to give some examples from the last few years.,13,343,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00343
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"In 2017, an Australian former senator apparently received donations from an individual with connections to the People's Republic of China (PRC) government. He then advocated for China's position on the South China Sea.",14,344,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00344
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"A former chairman of a European Union foreign friendship group was sponsored flights and hotel stays by a foreign government and subsequently, voiced views that supported that government's policies on various issues.",15,345,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00345
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"In 2019, leaked documents revealed that the Russian government was allegedly planning to provide financial and public relations assistance to the election campaign of German politician Markus Frohnmaier, who was known to be very outspoken in favour of ending sanctions and recognising Russia's annexation of Crimea.",16,346,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00346
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),This has also happened in Singapore. Members would be familiar with the expulsion of academic Huang Jing in 2017 for collaborating with foreign intelligence agents. It was an attempt to influence senior decision-makers in Government.,17,347,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00347
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),Moving on to the HIC part of the Bill. The reasons are straightforward.,18,348,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00348
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Spying and subversion in another country are age-old. Using spies, agents, locals and useful idiots is all part of subversion.",19,349,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00349
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"As technology developed, the subversion increased and adapted new technology  phone tapping, cameras, recording, microfilming and so on.",20,350,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00350
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Now, technology has evolved again. The Internet has created a powerful new medium for subversion. Countries are actively developing attack and defence capabilities as an arm of warfare equal to and more potent than the land, air and naval forces. It is often seen as the fourth arm of service.",21,351,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00351
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"The Gerasimov Doctrine, named after the Russian chief of staff, identifies issues of ""protest potential"" in another country, uses information operations to polarise that society and incite public disorder and keeps the target country in a constant state of turmoil. Aggressors can more easily achieve their political and military outcomes.",22,352,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00352
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),New communication tools facilitate non-kinetic forms of attack and make these harder to detect.,23,353,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00353
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"For example, bots and digital ads can easily be bought to spread harmful information. Foreign actors can blend their activities with other authentic online users, which gives readers a false sense of reality.",24,354,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00354
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"We have an annex that sets out more details of the Gerasimov Doctrine, the new communications tools and HIC tactics used by foreign state actors. Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, can I ask for the distribution of a folder which contains annexes A to I that I am going to refer to? And we distribute them together, so that it is easier.",25,355,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00355
2021-10-04-T-021,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please. [",1,356,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00356
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,May I proceed as the annexes are being distributed?,1,357,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00357
2021-10-04-T-021,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,358,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00358
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"If Members were to look at annex A, paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4, they refer to the Russians developing a military doctrine for the Internet age.",1,359,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00359
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The doctrine took tactics developed by the Soviets, blended them with strategic military thinking about total war and laid out a theory of modern warfare. It specifies that its objective is to achieve an environment of permanent unrest and conflict within an enemy state. It includes harnessing the protest potential of the population of a target country, deepening the divisions within that, increasing hostility among different groups and getting them to distrust institutions.",2,360,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00360
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"With this doctrine, the rules of war have changed. Non-military means of achieving political and strategic goals without using the force of weapons, including utilising a range of actors and tools, hackers, the media, businessmen, information leaks and misinformation, are all part and parcel of new warfare.",3,361,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00361
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Russians are said to have done this. We have no way of verifying that. The following examples, which I will refer to, are based on reports.",4,362,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00362
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Ukraine is said to have suffered extensive intervention. Russia allegedly deployed this doctrine for many years.,5,363,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00363
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"One example. During the 2014 protests, sensitive fault lines were targeted to paint the Ukrainian government as a fascist, racist, xenophobic junta. They claimed that Jews were being terrorised and beaten and asserted that local Jewish leaders were appealing to international bodies for help. They tried to weaken the resolve of the armed forces and the population to build popular support for Crimea to join Russia. Eventually, of course, we know Crimea was annexed.",6,364,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00364
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Czech Republic. Our 2018 Parliamentary Select Committee received evidence that Russia had targeted extremists and fringe politicians to spread propaganda, undermine support for Ukraine and cause one-quarter to one-third of the Czech population to believe that the Ukrainian government was fascist. And it resulted in the Czech government being unable to support the Ukrainians. So, the HICs managed to change Czech foreign policy.",7,365,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00365
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Netherlands. During the Dutch Referendum on the EU-Ukraine FTA, Russians pretended to be Ukrainians, inflamed local debates, supported by online disinformation campaign involving fake stories about Ukraine and Dutch voters eventually voted against the FTA.",8,366,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00366
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Annex B sets out some of the details. If Members were to see annex B, page 8 refers to Ukraine – look at item 3 of page 8. Item 4, the use of tools. Page 10, paragraph 6, the consequences as a result of the campaign. Page 11, the interference in Czech Republic, paragraph 2 sets out how it has been successful, that 53% of the Czechs believed there is propaganda both for and against a foreign country in the Czech public space and therefore they cannot trust anything. That is another objective that people try and achieve  make you distrustful of everything. And page 12, interference in Netherlands. The box sets out the reference to the FTA referendum.",9,367,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00367
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"More recently, Russia was allegedly engaged in campaigns to erode trust in the EU’s COVID-19 strategy and to spread scepticism of Western-developed vaccines. As I said earlier, Russia is repeatedly mentioned. I am repeating what others have said and Singapore does not take a position on this.",10,368,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00368
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Countries other than Russia are also said to have also been using these strategies.,11,369,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00369
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In May 2019, a disinformation network was traced to Iran. This comprised fake persons who sought to influence US policymakers and also reporters and academics to carry their views. Some of these were eventually published in legitimate publications. Annex C sets out more details of reports that have identified Iran as a foreign state actor.",12,370,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00370
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In December 2020, the BBC reported on a vast 15-year global disinformation campaign to serve one particular country’s interests. This campaign spread over at least 116 countries, more than half of the world's countries, and targeted members of the European Parliament as well as the United Nations. It involved the use of stolen accounts and at least 750 fake media outlets, which were amplified with the help of a legitimate foreign wire service. So, you can see the use of legitimate news organisations.",13,371,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00371
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"February 2021, the social media analysis firm, Graphika, released a report on a propaganda coordinated network in favour of one country called “Spamouflage Dragon”. Using a mixture of bots, fake accounts, stolen accounts and so on to push and amplify videos and media targeting issues such as the safety of Western-made vaccines and discrediting the United States.",14,372,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00372
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"A 2020 study by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute found that there has been a significant increase worldwide in foreign interference. Between 2015 and 2020, at least 38 Elections and 6 Referendums were impacted.",15,373,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00373
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The international media regularly names Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. I do not know whether these countries in fact did what they are said to have done. But few doubt that they have the capabilities. It is notable that the US and other Western countries are not mentioned in these generally in these reports because they are Western media reports. But anyone sensible will know that the United States, UK and Western countries have similar or perhaps, in the case of the United States, even superior capabilities. Really, there are no angels in this game.",16,374,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00374
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Washington Post reported on 11 February 2020 that a Swiss encryption communications provider had sold devices to more than 120 countries. That company was actually secretly owned by the CIA and the German Intelligence. They had rigged the devices to read the encrypted communications of all the countries, 120 odd countries, that had bought the system. Reading secret, most confidential communications, of their own allies and of course, adversaries.",17,375,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00375
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The story was then released years after, after everything has been done and closed. The Washington Post wrote up the exposé based on a CIA internal history of the operation in 2004. So, CIA history was in 2004; the Washington Post released the story in 2020. And they also based it on an internal oral history project by the German intelligence in 2008. But everything was kept under wraps, until simultaneously published by the Post and a German broadcaster on 11 February 2020.",18,376,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00376
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, it has all the hallmarks of a deliberate, planned leak. Members might recall that at about the same time, a bit before that, but through that period, the US government was very seriously warning everyone about the dangers of relying on technology from China. So, basically, without embarrassment, this leak came out saying we did it, and now be careful about the Chinese. Have the Americans actually stopped? We can only guess. But it is now got to be taken as a given that this sort of thing will be done regularly and everyone will face this.",19,377,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00377
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"It has become very easy and inexpensive to do. The Select Committee in 2018 heard 1 million Instagram ""Likes"" cost US$18, to get 100 Twitter followers, likes, or re-tweets cost 34 US cents, and to organise a street protest in the US through online costs about US$200,000. These details are in annex D. It also gives examples of HICs targeting democratic processes, if you look at annex D.",20,378,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00378
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"And it is a cottage industry as well because there are reports of an active Macedonian disinformation industry. Young Macedonians have Internet access, some basic training to create fake news websites. In the final weeks of the 2016 US Presidential Elections, over 140 “fake news” US politics websites were traced to Macedonia, and these overtook mainstream news producers in their share of election stories shared on Facebook. The details are in annex E.",21,379,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00379
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Singapore. A few days ago, the French Military School Strategic Research Institute published a Report on Influence Operations. Singapore was among the countries featured as case studies. The report noted that there were several factors which made Singapore vulnerable. Our size, our hyper-connectivity, our multi-ethnic and multi-religious society. The report said we were resilient through a counter-narrative of our Singaporean identity and by our swift reactions against hate speech. It concluded that we, along with Sweden, were one of the best prepared states in the fight against information manipulation and hybrid threats in general.",22,380,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00380
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I am not so sanguine as the people who wrote this report. Our racial and religious mix is easily exploitable by different countries and we see a steady build-up of different narratives which is being very cleverly done. It is not obvious propaganda but it conditions people to think in certain ways, particularly on foreign policy issues, often appealing to a larger racial identity beyond the Singaporean identity.",23,381,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00381
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In my view, this is one of the most serious threats we face. Our population, and I think most Members of Parliament, are not really aware of this.",24,382,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00382

2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Cyber manipulation, I will give a couple of examples. During a period of tension with another country between 2016 and 2017, we experienced a coordinated HIC that attempted to undermine our foreign policy position. Online commentaries and videos were uploaded by social media accounts which had lain dormant for many years. Many of these were in Mandarin and targeted our Chinese-speaking population. These contents were also widely circulated via chat apps and aimed to influence sentiments among Singaporeans.",27,385,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00385
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In another case, during a period of bilateral tension with a country in 2018, we saw a large spike in online comments critical of Singapore and many came from anonymous accounts. They sought to give an artificial impression of widespread objection to Singapore’s position.",28,386,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00386
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I will say so far these have been relatively low level except for the strategic move, the attempts to condition our people's thinking, which is going on.",29,387,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00387

2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Have there been no discussions? We have been talking about this very seriously for more than three years; extensively. The Select Committee heard extensive evidence in 2018 on this. The evidence, the reports that I have been referring to so far in the various annexes, most of it comes from the evidence given in 2018 to the Parliamentary Select Committee.",32,390,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00390
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I would like to refer Members to annex F.

2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Dr Liew Kai Khiun highlighted the barrage of comments by seemingly Myanmar-based user accounts on social media news portals of Singapore’s mainstream news networks.

2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Dr Michael Raska highlighted that foreign states could engage in information operations that target our faultlines as a means of asymmetric warfare given Singapore’s traditional military strength.,40,398,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00398
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"This is an important point that I will ask Members to take note of.

For example, in the analogue world, you have the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act (NPPA) and the Broadcasting Act. They provide powers to proscribe foreign newspapers and broadcasting services. The digital equivalent under FICA is a Proscribed Online Locations App Removal. In the analogue world, the Broadcasting Act provides the power to order a TV station to carry a message.

Today, you see the existing powers of investigation and of arrest and detention, in light green. It can be seen that FICA is an update to ensure that our laws can deal with online HICs, by allowing for disclosure of information by global platforms, and new offences which have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt in Court for perpetrating HICs in a clandestine way. If you look at the top right hand side, it shows how existing laws cover foreign interference via traditional media – the Broadcasting Act and the NPPA. And the bottom right, the light green boxes show how online, there are powers to intervene under the Broadcasting Act and the Telecommunications Act.

But it depends on the facts. If there is a basis to believe that he is doing so, for example, as part of a hostile campaign, or is acting for a foreign agency, with the intent of causing damage to Singapore, then directions could be given, subject to the test of proportionality.

2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Another point that has been made is that presenting research at overseas conferences, writing for international journals, multi-authored book projects, publishing in and reviewing for prestigious academic presses, participating in international collaborative research projects, partaking of fellowships, visiting appointments, training programmes, participation in international funding opportunities, any of these may be subsidised or fully funded by foreign universities, foundations and states. None of that, on the face of it, as it is described, will fit within FICA, for the reasons I have already explained. But if there is a step-up to try and turn the person into an agent of influence, or there is an orchestrated campaign, then, again, it becomes different.",104,462,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00462
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, some of these doomsday scenarios, that FICA is going to close off foreign collaborations, if that is correct, we, as a Government, must have suddenly gone mad. Because in a country like Singapore, which depends so much on the flow of ideas and international collaboration, is that even thinkable? The difficulty we face at MHA, and which many other countries face when dealing with this foreign interference issue, is that out of 10,000 interactions, one might be the sort that we are interested in, where there is an attempt to interfere.",105,463,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00463
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Foreign agencies, and even non-agency, NGOs, others, will try and present a legitimate front. So, the language has got to be broad enough to cover that  that what is apparently normal but it is actually not normal.",106,464,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00464
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"And it is not only the classic foreign state agency subversion sort of thing. It could be foreign associations, NGOs, even individuals who want to change our laws, for example. So, you got to look carefully at what they are doing, what are all the factors taken in overall, using the proportionality test, what sort of issue are they focusing on, what is the possible impact, is there funding involved, but with the central guiding principle that Singaporeans should primarily decide on issues of importance to ourselves.",107,465,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00465
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"If you turn specifically to academics, questions have been raised about their collaborations with non-Singaporeans.

2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, the Bill will not affect the vast amount of academic work that is being done. We value the intellectual output, collaborations, exchange of ideas, the work our academics do. And they need to link with the rest of the world; for work, bone fide and professional work, not affected; it is important for Singapore.",109,467,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00467

2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"There is another thread to some of the points made, underlying all of these explanations and illustrations, that the Government's position and explanations are good but the powers can be abused, they can be used for a wrong purpose. The worry is that the Government will abuse its power and shut down legitimate cooperation because it does not like it.",111,469,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00469
2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, there are two points here. One, the powers that are necessary to deal with the threat. Second, the possibility of abuse of these powers. So far, I have explained why the powers are necessary and why these powers are no greater – in fact less so – then powers that already exist, and is more calibration for the Internet age. So, bearing that in mind, I will deal separately, later, with abuse of powers.",112,470,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00470

Chief amongst them are Mr PJ Thum and Ms Kirsten Han. Thum and Han, as I said in 2019, in the conference, take money from George Soros. Some of you may recall, Soros' Open Society Foundations (OSF) has a history of getting involved in the domestic politics of sovereign countries.",115,473,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00473

Thum wants our Independence Day to be 16 September, which is Malaysia Day. He regrets that Singapore separated from Malaysia. On several occasions, he has publicly said that Singapore should become part of Malaysia again and celebrate Independence on 16 September. Thum and Han and some other activists met with Dr Mahathir on 30 August 2018. They asked Dr Mahathir to bring democracy to Singapore.

The person could claim, for example, that he did not realise that his post would be picked up by others and shared around. He did not know it would be prejudicial and he had no reason to believe so.

2021-10-04-T-021,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Ms He also proposes to remove the immunity provision in clause 119. The reason for this suggestion is not clear. We recently amended the Police Force Act to provide that no liability shall lie personally against any enforcement officer who acts in good faith and with reasonable care in the execution of the Act or any other written law. That is clause 119. This provision simply extends the same protection to a competent authority or an authorised officer who assists a Police Officer in the execution of powers under the Act.,43,656,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00656

For example, a Singaporean is paid by a foreign intelligence agency to publish a number of articles criticising Singapore’s foreign policy towards that country. He does so but presents it in his personal capacity as a citizen without disclosing his links to the foreign agency. This would be considered covert.",11,670,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00670

2021-10-04-T-021,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),"The Minister has explained the reasoning behind the reviewing tribunal. The difficulty that confronts us is the suitability of making the Courts serve as an oversight body for decisions taken under the Bill, which involve issues of national security, defence and foreign policy and information from intelligence sources, not necessarily only of our agencies. Our own Courts have said that they have limits in these areas.",62,721,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00721

The Tribunal, in fact, goes further than judicial review in some ways in that it is able to assess the initial decision on its merits whereas the Court in judicial review proceedings focuses only upon the legality of the administrative decision.",63,722,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00722

Before I begin, I do not recall coming across a Bill that is understood in such diametrically opposing ways by, on the one hand, some members of the public, including at least two Senior Counsels, many civil society activists, former Nominated Members of Parliament and journalists, and by the Executive on the other.",1,802,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00802

2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, my speech has four parts. One, is a summary of the amendments filed by the Workers' Party's Members of Parliament; two, is on how exceptional executive power requires robust judicial oversight to ensure accountability; three, is on how the Government should have sought public feedback on this Bill; and four, is on how the Government has been largely muted as to the non-legislative measures to combat foreign interference and why this needs to be corrected urgently.",3,804,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00804
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),Let me first summarise the amendments proposed by the Workers' Party's Members of Parliament who will explain the substantive basis of their amendments in their respective speeches.,4,805,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00805
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Ms He Ting Ru, Mr Leon Perera, Mr Gerald Giam and Mr Jamus Lim filed amendments to the Bill on 27 September 2021 by 4 30 pm, which is the deadline for filing any amendments to Bills for this particular Sitting. The thrust of the amendments is in four areas  accountability, fairness, transparency and effectiveness.",5,806,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00806
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),The first area is accountability. The Government must be accountable when it implements this law and uses executive power against individuals and entities. There should be robust oversight of executive action by the Supreme Court. This must be the default position for parliamentary democracy that recognises the centrality of the separation of powers under our Constitution.,6,807,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00807
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second area is fairness. The law must more precisely scope the extent of executive powers to minimise the prospect of abuse of power. Phrases such as ""is likely to"" and ""where the Minister suspects"" create low thresholds of proof that could be unfairly used against entities and individuals if power is in the wrong hands. While the Bill targets foreign interference, Singaporeans are the central focus and it is important that their constitutional rights are respected.",7,808,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00808
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The third area is transparency. There has to be greater clarity and transparency on the entities and individuals affected by this Bill. I note in this regard that MHA has made a statement in the middle of last week – I think there have been a few statements and comments made by the Ministry – that it will publish details of designated persons or entities, but the point is, surely this should have been made more explicit in the Bill.",8,809,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00809
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The fourth area is effectiveness. The Workers' Party has no objection to the additional requirements that are ported to this Bill in connection with the porting over of the Political Donations Act into FICA. However, we do question whether the list of Politically Significant Persons is far-reaching enough. I note Minister's comments in his Second Reading speech. But the point is our Civil Service has a significant footprint in the success of Singapore, with its central role in influencing Government policy. As key nodes in decision-making, civil servants from Deputy Secretary upwards, in our view, should be designated like Politically Significant Persons.",9,810,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00810
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"As MHA's press release on the First Reading of the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill shows, the danger of elite capture is an insidious threat. It would be unwise to assume that only politicians, civil society activists and journalists are vectors for foreign influence. To this end, it would be important for the public to understand that the Government did not think it necessary to designate such individuals as PSPs in the original Bill. I will leave Member of Parliament Gerald Giam to speak more on this subject.",10,811,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00811

2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, the starting position of the Workers’ Party is that the ubiquity of the threat of foreign interference and its low-cost ecosystem, particularly online, is neither a figment of the imagination, nor can it be wished away. It follows that the Government must have powers and, in some cases, even potentially intrusive powers, to intervene in the appropriate case. However, if we accept that such broad-ranging, broadly defined powers should be legislated to deal with foreign interference, then this House must ensure the legislation of equally robust oversight mechanisms to prevent abuse of power.",13,814,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00814
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"If a poll were to be conducted among ordinary Singaporeans on concepts like the separation of powers doctrine and its centrality to our system of Government, such a poll, I would hazard, would likely elicit quizzical looks.

2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),Let me add a historical dimension. Members of this House may have noticed a compact wooden bookcase at one end of the Parliament library. This bookcase and a number of books on parliamentary and constitutional subjects were presented by the UK’s House of Commons to the then-Speaker of Parliament P Coomaraswamy on 16 November 1966 to mark Singapore becoming the 22nd nation of the Commonwealth to gain Independence.,15,816,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00816
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"This House passed a resolution recognising the receipt of these gifts on 5 December that year. One of the famous books in this bookcase is the Law of the Constitution by Albert Dicey where that hallowed phrase central to the separation of powers in all parliamentary democracies is found, and I quote  ""Powers, however extraordinary, which are conferred by or sanctioned by statute, are never unlimited, for they are confined by the words of the Act itself, and, what is more, by the interpretation put upon the statute by the judges."" Unquote.",16,817,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00817
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The separation of powers doctrine and its close relationship with the rule of law was affirmed in the recent Court of Appeal judgment in Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam v PP. The Court of Appeal observed that the separation of powers is, and I quote, ""embodied in the Singapore Constitution by virtue of Article 23 (which vests the executive authority in the President and the Cabinet), Article 38 (which vests the legislative power in the President and Parliament) and Article 93 (which vests the judicial power in a system of the courts).” Unquote.",17,818,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00818

2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In stark contrast, the Bill before us today envisages the creation of a Reviewing Tribunal within the Executive branch with quasi-judicial powers with regard to the right of appeal against authorisation for Part 3 directions, or against the decisions of a Competent Authority. Clause 99 appears to go so far as to completely displace natural justice from the oversight process as drafted in the Bill. One of its paragraphs states that the Rules may enable or require a Reviewing Tribunal to hear or consider any proceedings or appeal without the person who brought the appeal having been given full particulars of the reasons for any conduct which is the subject of the proceedings or appeal.",19,820,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00820

2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, the Workers’ Party rejects such an appeal mechanism. We propose an amendment of clause 104 to allow first for an appeal to the Minister and thereafter to the High Court with full judicial scrutiny. Of course, there is a provision for a private hearing where national security is at risk. Workers’ Party Member of Parliament for Sengkang GRC He Ting Ru will go through these amendments.",21,822,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00822

There have been a number of recommendations but the Government's response appears to have been focused on POFMA and now, FICA.",45,846,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00846
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),The S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) published a policy report in April this year on countermeasures against foreign influence.

2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The report said that to combat foreign interference, it is critical to build resilience, or in our Total Defence parlance, psychological defence – by raising awareness about information manipulation in both the Government as well as amongst the public.",47,848,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00848
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The paper noted that foreign campaigns to sway public opinion during the 2017 presidential campaign in France were unsuccessful. This was because the French government created awareness about information manipulation, built strong central organisations to counter this information and undertook a strategy to push counter narratives that blunted the effects of this information, such as focusing public attention on the perpetrators.",48,849,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00849
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Coming back to the Singapore Government's approach, the examples raised about foreign interference focused largely on long past attempts such as the Singapore Herald and Eastern Sun episodes and the Hendrickson affair.",49,850,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00850
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In a Straits Times article on 25 September, there were references to the impounding of SAF Terrex vehicles in Hong Kong and to reports of China's soft power efforts in Singapore through clan and business associations. This begs the question  how will this Bill, in particular, if enacted, address such examples of alleged foreign interference?",50,851,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00851
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Straits Times, our newspaper, of record, does not make this very clear. What must Singaporeans do to heighten our sensitivity to such interference? And how is this Government ensuring that the message flows to the masses and new generations of Singaporeans, including new citizens, given that Singapore's destiny as an immigrant nation is almost certain?",51,852,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00852

2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),This spike in online chatter sought to give the artificial impression that there was significant and fundamental objections to Singapore's position.

2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, this was a highly opportune moment to share the nature of the threat and to engage in a conversation with the public on foreign interference.

2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"More fundamentally, how does the Government distinguish between a genuine groundswell of sentiment and a dedicated hostile information campaign?",56,857,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00857
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I note that the MHA press release of the first reading of the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill dated 13 September 2021 anonymised this example, although it was clear that the MHA press release was referring to the same episode highlighted by Minister Josephine Teo in her parliamentary speech.",57,858,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00858
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, the Government has placed such a high priority on combating foreign interference to the extent of introducing a Bill which in some important ways has no substantive judicial safeguards. But what does it say about the Government when it takes an arguably unclear approach to non-legislative responses?",58,859,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00859
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Surely, non-legislative responses that promote a more participatory and educated citizenry would inoculate the population in a whole-of-society way far better against foreign interference.",59,860,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00860
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"This is an area I believe the Government needs to look into in a deliberate fashion across all levels of society. It is my argument that the Government needs to work with the public in a far more participative way so as to strengthen the resolve of the population against foreign interference. This apparent lack of integration of legislative and non-legislative measures to address foreign interference, in my view, is a critical omission in our public discourse of this subject.",60,861,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00861

2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I quote the RSIS paper, ""The manner of application of these countermeasures must be fair and necessary both in terms of process and perception without perpetuating the image of an Orwellian state. Singapore must not appear to be taking sides in geopolitical rivalries or using foreign interference as a pretext to clamp down on local political discourse and responsible activism. Ultimately, Singapore's survival depends on both its foreign policy principle of neutrality and reputation of openness to global trade, talent, investment and ideas.""",62,863,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00863
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"As things stand, particularly on the grounds of perception and fairness, this Bill falls short. That is why the four Workers' Party Members of Parliament have filed amendments to this Bill.",63,864,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00864
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, let me conclude. Public feedback should have been sought on this Bill. The Government failed to do so and does not appear minded to postpone this debate.",64,865,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00865
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"There is an opportunity to commit the Bill to a Select Committee for public input and to review oversight mechanisms, amongst others. The Government should not close the door to this.",65,866,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00866
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),What is more perplexing is that we know that the Government had been mulling the introduction of this Bill for many months. Why was it so difficult to undertake a period of public consultation before it was tabled for First Reading?,66,867,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00867
2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Government must also take immediate steps to implement non-legislative measures to tackle foreign interference, such as education and engagement of the public.

2021-10-04-T-021,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Finally, the most critical issue today is the high level of executive power introduced by this Bill, which demands that there must be strong oversight mechanisms, namely, our Courts.",68,869,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00869

2021-10-04-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Today's Bill aims to push against this tide.

2021-10-04-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My first point is on the consultation process for this Bill. Some residents have shared their concerns with me on this and it would be good for the Minister to clarify some of their doubts.,6,877,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00877
2021-10-04-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Can Minister share the consultation process for this Bill and whether it has integrated productive feedback from the consultation into this proposed law? Can the Minister also share how does the Ministry decide how much public consultation to hold for any proposed legislation?,7,878,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00878
2021-10-04-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, there were also some concerns about the interval between the First and Second Readings of the Bill. Some felt that the interval was too short and again, it will be good for the Minister to provide some clarifications on this as well.",8,879,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00879
2021-10-04-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My second point is on what it means to act with covertness, deception or concealment. This Act makes it an offence to undertake clandestine electronic communications activity on behalf of a foreign principal. The emphasis here is on ""clandestine"".",9,880,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00880
2021-10-04-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Subsection 1(d) of section 17 requires that the person's action is ""covert or involves deception"". Similarly, subsection 1(d) of section 18 requires that the person's action ""conceals from or fails to disclose"" their relationship with a foreign principal. Can Minister shed light on how an organisation can avoid being considered as having been covert, deceptive or otherwise opaque? If they receive a grant from a foreign principal, would it suffice to state on their website with the dollar amount received, the name of the grant-maker and the terms of the grant?",10,881,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00881
2021-10-04-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Would they need to print this material on all marketing material? Would it need to be in their Facebook posts and their Twitter profile?,11,882,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00882
2021-10-04-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),We should expect transparency and honesty. But this expectation is only fair if we make clear what reasonable compliance looks like. Will MHA release guidelines and illustrations that can help facilitate compliance by good faith actors?,12,883,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00883
2021-10-04-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My third point is on the appeals process in this Bill. Section 48 allows individuals the opportunity to be heard before being designated as a politically significant individual. The exception is when the competent authority considers it not practicable or desirable to do so.,13,884,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00884
2021-10-04-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Can Minister elaborate on when it would not be practicable or desirable for individuals to have the opportunity to be heard? It seems odd that an individual might be denied even the chance to present their side of the story.,14,885,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00885
2021-10-04-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In addition, will the individual receive written reasons to explain decisions made by the Ministry and by the Competent Authority?",15,886,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00886
2021-10-04-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"There are three scenarios where written reasons should be provided  one, when the Ministry designates an individual as politically significant; two, when the competent authority decides that it is not practicable or desirable to hear an individual before they get designated as politically significant; and three, when the Minister determines an appeal under section 101.",16,887,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00887

2021-10-04-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My fourth and final point is on Reviewing Tribunals. Can Minister share more about the considerations that the Cabinet should take into account when recommending the appointment of members of the Reviewing Tribunal? What is the profile of members envisioned for appointment of the Reviewing Tribunal?,18,889,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00889
2021-10-04-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"This is important to clarify, as members of the Reviewing Tribunal may themselves be politically significant or otherwise at a heightened risk of hostile foreign influence.",19,890,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00890
2021-10-04-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In addition, section 99 allows the Minister to prescribe the practices and procedures for proceedings and appeals before a Reviewing Tribunal. Can Minister share if these practices and procedures will be derived from the Rules of Court, practices and procedures for Court proceedings? Will these practices and procedures follow the same principles for a fair hearing in the Rules of Court, practices, and procedures for Court proceedings? And finally, when the Reviewing Tribunal determines an appeal under Section 97, will the Reviewing Tribunal provide written reasons for their decisions?",20,891,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00891
2021-10-04-T-021,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, in conclusion I do stand in support of the Bill. I believe there is a strong need to tackle foreign disruptions of our domestic politics but, at the time, there needs to be safeguards in place and it is essential that we are fair and transparent in how we restrict the activities of fellow Singaporeans.",21,892,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00892
2021-10-04-T-021,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Mr Speaker, the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) is strongly against foreign interference in our country's affairs. But the PSP cannot support the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act which I shall refer to as FICA, in its current form because of the insufficient evaluation by both parliamentarians and members of the public of its far-reaching implications. So, PSP calls upon the Government to delay the passing of the Bill, hold public consultations and appoint a Select Committee to scrutinise the Bill closely.",1,893,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00893
2021-10-04-T-021,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),The Minister has just got through two hours in this Chamber on the possible amendments. These are exactly what should have been done in Select Committee. Is it realistic or fair to expect parliamentarians to understand the pros and cons of the amendments in just a few hours of debate?,2,894,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00894

2021-10-04-T-021,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"One, for such an important Bill, it should not be rushed through Parliament, disregarding proper legislative processes and the feelings of Singaporeans suffering under a worsening COVID-19 crisis.",4,896,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00896
2021-10-04-T-021,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Two, countering foreign interference is an ongoing task and sufficient resources have already been deployed to it.

2021-10-04-T-021,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"FICA is a complex Bill with 127 sections over 249 pages and the content difficult to make sense of, even for senior lawyers.

Many Members of this House are probably not adequately prepared for a thorough debate today.",7,899,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00899
2021-10-04-T-021,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),It is difficult to understand why the Government is trying to rush the passage of this Bill or why the debate on this Bill cannot be postponed by three to six months to allow for proper scrutiny and consultation involving a wide range of stakeholders.,8,900,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00900
2021-10-04-T-021,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Just earlier this year, the Government established a two-month long public consultation process for the Copyright Bill. The POFMA Bill also went through a long consultation, lasting more than a year and, in addition, through a Select Committee before it was passed into law.",9,901,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00901
2021-10-04-T-021,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"So, where is the Select Committee for FICA which arguably should be held to even greater scrutiny in light of the removal of judicial supervision of the Government's usage of FICA's powers and our citizens' constitutional rights?",10,902,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00902
2021-10-04-T-021,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"We should also delay the reading of this Bill because we should be now focusing our resources and attention on the worsening COVID-19 situation in our country. The number of infections has shot up exponentially and there are more and more distressed situations amongst many of us Singaporeans.

2021-10-04-T-021,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"PSP recognises that foreign interference had existed in the past and will continue to exist.

2021-10-04-T-021,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"We deploy substantial resources to national security every year. For FY2021, we are spending $15 billion on defence; $6.5 billion on home affairs and $0.5 billion on foreign affairs, all for the purpose of upholding and protecting our sovereignty. This makes a total of $22 billion accounting for more than a quarter of our operating budget.",14,906,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00906

2021-10-04-T-021,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"To start with, we have the Internal Security Act (ISA) which was passed in 1960 when we were still part of Malaysia. The Court of Appeal's ruling that the ISA was subjected to judicial review was already overruled in a legislative amendment in 1988, giving the Government wide powers in administering the ISA. Incidentally, Malaysia had repealed its ISA in 2012 while our ISA is still in force.",16,908,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00908
2021-10-04-T-021,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Then, we have the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act (NPPA) since 1975, which is designed to ensure there is no foreign control on Singaporean newspapers and limits the circulation of foreign printed media. There is also the Broadcasting Act 1994 which requires online sites discussing Singapore's political issues to register for a licence with conditions covering foreign funding and interference.",17,909,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00909
2021-10-04-T-021,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The NPPA and Broadcasting Act allowed the Government to have almost monopoly control over the narrative on major policies and issues through the mainstream media. That was until the rise of social media, as a strong alternative platform from around 2010. As a result, the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) came into being in 2019 to allow the Government to tackle the spread of fake news and false information online.",18,910,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00910
2021-10-04-T-021,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Between the ISA, NPPA, Broadcasting Act and POFMA, this Government already has extensive powers to deal with any internal security threat, manage public opinion and prevent the spread of false information online. So, is there a need to give this Government further powers to deal with foreign interference at the expense of our citizens' constitutional rights?",19,911,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00911
2021-10-04-T-021,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"As there is no urgency but ample reasons why we should delay the Bill, we should then make best use of the opportunity to evaluate the implications of FICA properly.",20,912,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00912
2021-10-04-T-021,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"We understand all that has been said about combating foreign interference. But we cannot ignore the basic principles of democracy, which is not based on a benevolent ruler but on separation of powers and checks and balances. A law like FICA, which ignores those principles, ought to be considered carefully and over a long period of deliberation.",21,913,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00913
2021-10-04-T-021,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Just look at some of the frightening implications on people, on an accused person under FICA. It is possible that you may inadvertently commit an offence because the definition of an offence is broad and vague. There is no need to give you a reason to arrest you, and if evidence is offered later, the Government does not need to reveal the source and detention is non-bailable. You cannot choose your own legal Counsel and can be trialed in absence. And to cap it all, there is no judicial review for all the actions that are taken against you. Thus, FICA appears even worse than the Internal Security Act.",22,914,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00914

National security is of course something that we are very concerned about, and we also support giving the Government enough resources to deal with it. For example, in Financial Year 2021, $22 billion was allocated to maintain domestic and external security, accounting for a quarter of the total budget. Through the Internal Security Act, the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act, the Broadcasting Act and the POFMA, the Government has basically controlled threats to domestic security, public opinion and the transmission of fake news online.",25,917,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00917
2021-10-04-T-021,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Hence, FICA is really a law that is unnecessary. It gives the Government the power to deal with citizens who hold dissenting views. We should learn from history, such as the lessons of Militarism in Japan and Germany. Every time a government moves towards authoritarianism, it can bring about disastrous consequences for the country. The country needs checks and balances between the Government and the people in order to have lasting peace and stability.",26,918,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00918

Do not think that FICA has nothing to do with our everyday life. This is because without freedom of speech, even discussions on employment and livelihood issues could be restricted. Therefore, PSP feels that the Bill should be postponed to give the people and the Special Committee sufficient time to scrutinise it thoroughly.",27,919,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00919

While our capable security agencies and diplomatic channels are dealing with it, the best defence against foreign interference is not more laws to control our own people but to raise the awareness of our people towards national security threats. Hence, the anti-terrorist awareness campaign, SGSecure, which is aimed at all Singaporeans, is a wise move.",28,920,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00920
2021-10-04-T-021,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"Like what the Leader of the Opposition has commented just now, this Government should be more proactive in educating Singaporeans on what is online foreign interference, so that every citizen can be its eyes and ears.

As my Workers' Party colleagues will point out, we believe in giving relevant authorities clearly defined and effective tools to counter actual acts of foreign interference. Our objections, however, are raised in both the drafting of wide ranging powers, the problems with oversight mechanisms and also the way the Bill has been presented.",1,926,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00926

This is in stark contrast to POFMA, where a cross-party Select Committee convened public hearings over eight days, which saw 79 individuals and organisations testify. I also note that the Bill is 168 pages longer than the POFMA Bill and contains on the face of it, even broader powers which should logically mean that more scrutiny must be given before it is passed.",4,929,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00929

2021-10-04-T-021,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"While I reiterate that the Workers' Party agrees that appropriate measures need to be put in place to counter the threat of foreign interference, we would like to understand what is the real and imminent threat that Singapore faces that warrants such a rush in passing the Bill. How many instances of suspected foreign interference have there been in each of the last 10 years? And more crucially, why are the specific powers and tools contained under the Bill so urgently required by the Minister and various Competent Authorities that would mean the Bill needs to be rushed ahead and passed into law without further delay at this particular juncture?",6,931,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00931

Already, we have seen numerous voices from a Senior Counsel, various NGOs, Singaporean academics, including a senior research fellow at IPS, speaking up to voice their grave concerns not only at the speed at which the Bill is to be passed, but also about the substantive provisions contained in the Bill. There is a fear from many that in the rush to pass the Bill to counter foreign interference, we may be throwing the baby out with the bath water and end up catching many legitimate and innocent people, entities and projects in the dragnet.

2021-10-04-T-021,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Firstly, any uncertainty will create a chilling effect on political discussion and engagement. As a specific example, the wide discretion allowed by the drafting of the Bill to designate who is a Politically Significant Person (PSP) runs the risk of encouraging many to step away from conversation in the public space to avoid the onerous countermeasures that come with being a designated PSP. This means local content creators, local activists, local academics, their retraction from our public spaces will mean that we will be worse off, and this will dampen the richness of thinking and dialogue on issues that matter to all Singaporeans. It will also be damaging to our standing connection to the global commons, which has recently already been called into question with concerns raised over the closure of Yale-NUS College.",9,934,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00934
2021-10-04-T-021,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Secondly, many have echoed our fears that this Bill represents power given to the Government which is not subject to the oversight of the Courts. It provides the Minister wide ranging powers that are largely unfettered with the only exception being a reviewing Tribunal that has a narrow scope. Could this be a slippery slope that would lead to less checks on how these powers are wielded? And ultimately, in the hands of possible future rogue Ministers and officials, damage Singapore's reputation of an open, global business hub where enforcement and application is predictable and certain?",10,935,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00935

I must also sound a note of caution. We must ensure that we do not end up being so shrill and fearful of the threat of foreign interference that we end up neglecting an even more insidious threat, one where domestic players could seize an easy opportunity to whip up nationalism and anti-foreign sentiment to further their own political goals, nefarious or otherwise, in the flimsy name of protecting national interest and sovereignty.",11,936,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00936

All of them have built their success on twisted versions of patriotism and national identity and sovereignty.

This section is important as it prescribes the methods and processes in place to protect citizens against an abuse of power by the government of the day. Clause 92 provides for the setting up of a reviewing Tribunal which comprises three individuals who each have to be Singaporeans and will serve a term of three years. The government appoints these individuals and the chair of the Tribunal has to be a Supreme Court Judge. There are no other specific requirements in the Bill relating to the remaining two members of the Tribunal. The renumeration and expenses of the Tribunal are paid for under money provided by Parliament, but the rules for tribunal proceedings are, under clause 99, made by the Minister and are only presented to Parliament after being gazetted.",15,940,2021-10-04-T-021-S-00940

Second, even the small number of cases which are eligible to appeal to the Reviewing Tribunal, are subject to further restrictions, including the provision under clause 99(b) which states that the Minister may prescribe Tribunal Rules that enables a Reviewing Tribunal to decline to give the appellant the full particulars of the reasons for why a decision was made.

So, that is more than three years ago. And where we considered 169 written representations and oral evidence from 65 individuals and organisations. Some of these were shared by the Minister earlier in his speech. There were also public hearings held from 14 March to 29 March 2018. In fact, it lasted eight days in all.

Let me quote him. He said, ""Today, information can easily be weaponised by foreign actors, at low cost, and with anonymity and impunity. No country is immune. This is asymmetric information warfare, fought in a theatre and era with no distinction between war and peace. In this battlefield, Singapore, an open, democratic, digitally-connected and diverse country, is especially vulnerable. We are a young country with sensitive fault lines that foreign actors can exploit to foment distrust and ill-will among our various communities.""",12,1040,2021-10-04-T-021-S-01040

We have heard evidence from experts during the Select Committee hearings that hostile information campaigns are becoming cheaper to mount and becoming more prevalent.

As a Member of Parliament in this House, let me say this with ample evidence from our own history – there can be no civil liberties if activists can be bought or sold; and there can be no academic freedom if our Universities are homes for foreign agents. It will be naive to believe that all activists are high-minded patriots, just as it is mere pretence that all academics are cultivating young minds for the good of Singapore.",29,1057,2021-10-04-T-021-S-01057

2021-10-04-T-021,Tan Yia Swam,Dr Tan Yia Swam (Nominated Member),"I had not intended to speak, until a few doctors and Singapore Medical Association (SMA) staff approached me privately and separately to raise their concerns.

2021-10-04-T-021,Tan Yia Swam,Dr Tan Yia Swam (Nominated Member),"Firstly, many doctors volunteer or lead various NGOs, mostly on medical and humanitarian missions, but also for social goals. Some doctors have patients who are political office holders in other countries.

2021-10-04-T-021,Tan Yia Swam,Dr Tan Yia Swam (Nominated Member),"I agree that there should never be foreign interference in a country’s politics. As an ordinary citizen, I have remained blissfully unaware of how threats to Singapore have manifested, except for what is reported in mainstream news. Arresting a human agent with proof of radicalisation or obvious threats to the stability of Singapore is easy for us to accept. But in the modern world, it is scary to learn that modern threats can be subtle, through social media. Bots, ads, sponsored articles and posts to erode trust in the government, to take advantage of social fault lines and sow discord.",6,1070,2021-10-04-T-021-S-01070

2021-10-04-T-021,Tan Yia Swam,Dr Tan Yia Swam (Nominated Member),"Where my opinion differs is how best to tackle it. The Bill grants extensive powers to the Minister to enforce and regulate anyone or any organisation with an online presence, from the content produced down to the operations. While this may scare off the malicious, I am afraid that it may also scare away people who are genuinely interested in improving our nation. How can we recognise the difference between an activist for human rights from one whose motivations are political in nature?",8,1072,2021-10-04-T-021-S-01072
2021-10-04-T-021,Tan Yia Swam,Dr Tan Yia Swam (Nominated Member),"I list three key concerns  one, regulating and restricting the political space further may deter genuine individuals; two, organisations may want, or even need, collaborations and support with other foreign entities to survive and thrive; three, the Minister will be granted extensive discretion in addition to existing power under ISA and POFMA.",9,1073,2021-10-04-T-021-S-01073
2021-10-04-T-021,Tan Yia Swam,Dr Tan Yia Swam (Nominated Member),"Section 8 provides a very broad definition of what activities “directed towards a political end in Singapore” means. This is of concern as any organisation engaging in such could be designated a Politically Significant Person under Part 4 of the Bill, and will be subject to multiple additional requirements, such as the reporting of foreign donations, and being subject to declare, and may be directed to stop taking in foreign volunteers.",10,1074,2021-10-04-T-021-S-01074
2021-10-04-T-021,Tan Yia Swam,Dr Tan Yia Swam (Nominated Member),"This brings me to my first concern that we need to leave some space for people to participate as active citizens in shaping our future. Desiring to influence public opinion or decisions is part and parcel of advocacy. Increasing reporting requirements opens up a small organisation to potentially being targeted and increases the barrier for a citizen who wants to participate and contribute, or just to simply air their views. Ground-up initiatives may think twice.",11,1075,2021-10-04-T-021-S-01075
2021-10-04-T-021,Tan Yia Swam,Dr Tan Yia Swam (Nominated Member),"My next concern is about how Singapore relates to the wider world. The Bill empowers the Minister to direct a person to account for all donations, possibly return donations and even stop taking volunteers who are not Singaporean Citizens.",12,1076,2021-10-04-T-021-S-01076
2021-10-04-T-021,Tan Yia Swam,Dr Tan Yia Swam (Nominated Member),"I feel this is unrealistic. Singapore is an open country with organisations forming many collaborations, especially NGOs that might need the scale to ensure that their services are accessible by others. It seems impossible to expect that people should be deterred from seeking sponsorships beyond Singapore, and also that volunteers and manpower should only be limited to Singapore Citizens. Singaporeans may ourselves, shy away from working for NGOs for fear of being unwittingly implicated, real or imagined. I would like to believe that for every malicious person out there, there are way more well-intentioned people who want to support Singapore in its growth, not hinder it.",13,1077,2021-10-04-T-021-S-01077
2021-10-04-T-021,Tan Yia Swam,Dr Tan Yia Swam (Nominated Member),But this requires a lot more trust and faith in the people to do the right thing. This Bill equally asks for a lot of trust and faith in the Minister to do the right thing.,14,1078,2021-10-04-T-021-S-01078
2021-10-04-T-021,Tan Yia Swam,Dr Tan Yia Swam (Nominated Member),"There is great discretion given to the Minister on how to exercise the extensive powers under the Bill. It is a lot of power in one man’s hands. How can we protect it from future abuse? Could it be spread out? Not just to the different branches in the judiciary, but also across the people. Let them call for accountability and transparency in organisations they work with. Let organisations regulate amongst themselves who are the right people to seek sponsorships or volunteer work from. Let safeguards be what they are  limited protections for the worst case scenario, not pre-emptive strikes against people who may be just trying to do the right thing.",15,1079,2021-10-04-T-021-S-01079

Even in relatively peaceful times in the world today, foreign forces do often seek to influence the policies and affairs of other countries for their own political, economic, or military purposes. With the development of science and technology, these interference methods have become more sophisticated, and have the potential to cause significant and destructive impact in a short period of time. I think the comparison made by Mr Leong Mun Wai just now is rather inappropriate.

2021-10-04-T-021,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"The Singapore Government would be familiar with FARA because agencies like EBD, STB, Temasek Holdings and the Government itself have already been registered as foreign principals.

2021-10-04-T-021,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),Policymaking in Singapore is highly concentrated in the top ranks of the Government and the Civil Service. Many policymakers regularly exchange ideas with each other in informal settings like golf courses and exclusive clubs like the Pyramid Club. These are places where informal discussions on policies may take place well before they are discussed in the media or drafted into law.,25,1168,2021-10-04-T-021-S-01168

2021-10-04-T-021,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),This is why I tabled the amendments to the Bill to add several more classes of people to the list of defined PSPs under clauses 14 and 78.,27,1170,2021-10-04-T-021-S-01170

2021-10-04-T-021,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"For example, some countries, to further their own agenda, may insidiously play up their cultural affinity card.

It will be too easy for perpetrators to just disclaim knowledge that something is for example prejudicial to the security of Singapore.

However, in reality, foreign state or principals are likely to disavow any links to Hostile Information Campaigns (HICs). I think it matters less who that foreign principal is, so long as we know that the perpetrator is acting on behalf of a foreign principal.

I can understand that full disclosure would be extremely sensitive to the mission success of any intelligence operations. However, perhaps MHA can consider, from time to time, giving a report on the FICA offences or directions without the need to go into the specific details or naming the individuals or foreign principals involved.",28,1232,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01232

I stated my concern that social media and online news websites should be transparent in their sources of funding or political links. What was inherent in my evidence was my worry that any foreign actor can easily interfere in our country’s politics and disrupt the stability of our social and political institutions.

These questions are clearly important and should be thoroughly addressed and debated so that all Singaporeans will have a clear understanding of what the Act entails.",2,1252,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01252

2021-10-04-T-023,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"In modern times, foreign influence might take the overt form of Embassies and Foreign Chambers of Commerce lobbying and advocating for their interests. It may also take the covert form of actions such as state-sponsored actors conducting black ops and clandestine disinformation campaigns that sow discontent and distrust between the government and people and discord among citizens on contentious social issues. Such ops can also create an impression of mass support among the country’s citizens for a foreign country’s position on important bilateral issues.",4,1254,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01254
2021-10-04-T-023,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Such pernicious foreign influence creates a drip effect that can change the attitudes of citizens towards their own government and even towards their own fellow citizens, leading to the destabilisation of the country in the long run, and the weakening of its position vis-à-vis that of the foreign country that could be behind, exerting the covert influence. This is why an open economy and a small country like Singapore needs intelligence and counter-intelligence resources to help manage such threats.",5,1255,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01255

Such attacks can be conducted by hackers who are motivated by monetary gains or by state-linked groups that are trying to make a political statement. For example, the hacking of Sony Pictures, an entertainment company, in 2014 by the “Guardians of Peace” who supposedly had links with a North Asian nation. Cyberattacks can even be sponsored by foreign states as part of political espionage to retrieve embarrassing information about politicians or classified government information from rival states.",6,1256,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01256

So, my question is, if there is sufficient evidence that a foreign entity, be it a government or organisation, is behind certain activities that are deemed harmful or detrimental to Singapore, how transparent will the Government be in making that information known to Singaporeans?",8,1258,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01258
2021-10-04-T-023,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"I know that Singapore has always tried to be diplomatically sensitive when disclosing information on foreign influence.

2021-10-04-T-023,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"However, I would like to seek clarifications from the Minister on the position regarding NGOs, especially if these NGOs are local chapters of a global NGO. What would the Government’s position be if the local chapters of global NGOs happen to be supporting a particular cause that might be regarded as not being fully in alignment with what is best for Singapore? Because, sometimes, those issues are a bit grey, they are matters that are open to debate and interpretation. With FICA in place, would these NGOs be classified as agents of influence and be ordered to cease their operations here?",14,1264,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01264

2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Some Singaporeans might think that this is an arcane and obscure bill that will probably only impact those politicos who comment on or get involved in politics. Should we not be spending the time talking about COVID-19 jobs and other bread-and-butter matters? We should talk about bread-and-butter matters and Workers' Party Members of Parliament make parliamentary interventions on these matters even during the Sittings such as Parliamentary Questions on COVID-19. But this Bill is important too. It is important not only because there have always been malicious foreign actors who seek to twist our politics to their own ends and always will be, it is also important because the Bill the Government has placed before Parliament today promises to give yet more levers of power to the Ruling party, which can potentially be abused for partisan purposes, to limit criticism and disadvantage political opponents, plus corroding the very functioning of our hard-won democratic society.",2,1272,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01272

What will happen is that our politics will become less accountable, less contestable, less meaningful. The ideas that get raised in the public square may become more and more limited to a narrow field of opinion. Abuses, mistakes, may not come to light, or will get glossed over in public debate when they do. Fear of the enormous discretionary power of the government may poison political discourse.

The thing about giving the executive government more and more and more power in exchange for stability and economic benefits, is this  it is that if that government turns rogue one day and that stability and those benefits no longer get delivered, well-meaning patriots and alternative parties may struggle to change that entrenched government because the legal and institutional tools to bring about that change are all stacked against them and by then it will be too late.",6,1276,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01276

There is still debate and criticism of the Government in the public square. Sir, I will make two points here. It is hard to know what the effect of these laws has been in the past from the quantity and quality of debate versus if these had not been passed. Secondly, hobbling genuine debate is something that could still happen if future governments decide to use these laws to a greater extent than has thus happened. That could well happen one day if a Ruling party in the future, for example, faces a political crisis of confidence and decides to use the most draconian provisions latent in these laws to suppress criticism so as to stay in power.",7,1277,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01277

This creates the potential for abuse of power, especially when we recall that the Minister, like all Ministers regardless of Party, is still a political partisan at the end of the day, with a vested interest in winning arguments over critics and opponents and winning elections. The Minister is also subject to error, even with the best of intentions, as are all of us.

2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Thirdly, on the theme of oversight, I shall explain the rationale for the amendments I have moved to this Bill.",18,1288,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01288
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"First of all, Sir, I would like to speak on the danger of foreign interference, or FI, successfully directed at Ministers or even the Prime Minister or Minister for Home Affairs. Of course, I am not suggesting that that has happened in the past or is happening now, but it could. How does this Bill address that? What recourse do Singaporeans have were that to happen? And this is a subject my hon colleague Mr Gerald Giam also spoke about.",19,1289,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01289
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"This Bill does not create an independent investigative authority that could look into all cases of malicious FI, whether directed at the Ruling Party or Opposition, nor does it specify a clear route of complaint and follow-up action in cases where a member of the public, be they an NGO, a researcher or an ordinary citizen, has formed suspicions that a Minister is under inappropriate foreign influence. Instead, the Bill, like other Bills in the past, vests broad discretionary powers with the Minister for Home Affairs to act against FI directed at others. What is to be done if the FI is directed at him or her and succeeds?",20,1290,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01290
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Some academics refer to such a scenario as elite capture. It is not hard to understand why this can happen. A malicious foreign actor bent on interference may find that they have more power to influence Singapore’s politics if they can bring a Minister or even the Minister for Home Affairs himself under their influence rather than an Opposition politician. For a malicious foreign actor, influencing the Prime Minister and his or her Ministers brings more bang for the buck. This scenario is not academic, arcane or improbable. In the USA, one popular narrative that became a significant political issue, and I am not stating that this is ever true, was that the previous President of the United States had been suborned by a foreign power.",21,1291,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01291
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I would like to ask the Minister, how does this Bill enhance Singapore’s ability to check FI directed at Ministers, Minister for Home Affairs and the Prime Minister? This unpacks itself into a few distinct questions.",22,1292,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01292
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, can the Minister for Home Affairs under this Bill apply prescribed actions like transparency directives to his Ministerial colleagues and even the Prime Minister, notwithstanding the fact that the Prime Minister, could, presumably, remove him from his job as a consequence but at least the public would see that action before that happens?",23,1293,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01293
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Secondly, what is the recourse if the Minister for Home Affairs himself falls under foreign influence?",24,1294,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01294
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Thirdly, is there going to be a FICA Office under this Bill, along the lines of the POFMA office, staffed by trained professionals who could in theory investigate Ministers? And if so, how would their independence be established in cases where MHA office-holders are themselves the target of investigation?",25,1295,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01295
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I would like to conclude on this topic by suggesting that the answer to all of these questions could lie in a proposal that has been put forth to this House in the past by Workers’ Party Members of Parliament – the creation of the office of an independent Ombudsman. I do not have the time to elaborate on this here but this is a WP Manifesto proposal and I spoke about it at length during the debate in this House last year on access to justice, including rebutting objections to the idea.",26,1296,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01296
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The office of a public Ombudsman would, if properly designed and resourced, be a good receptacle for public complaints of FI directed at Ministers and would have the organisational independence and separation from the government of the day to be able to investigate Ministers credibly.",27,1297,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01297
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Before I leave this subject, I would like to pose two very distinct questions to the Minister for his reply during this debate.",28,1298,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01298
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, does the Minister, in the exercise of his powers under FICA as the Bill stands, agree that he and his office will apply FICA directives and actions equally to foreigners who improperly intervene in domestic partisan politics whether they intervene on the side of the Ruling Party or the Opposition or other Parties?",29,1299,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01299
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Let me offer an illustration. Media reports have described the work of a gentleman residing in Europe who runs a Facebook page that makes frequent interventions concerning partisan politics in Singapore, often to defend the Ruling Party and criticise the Opposition in Singapore. Just a short quote from one of his more recent posts  “People often accuse me of bias because I never criticise the Government in Singapore. As I explained many times, it would be a bit like criticising Usain Bolt for not running fast enough.”",30,1300,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01300
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"To be sure I am not calling for action to be taken against this person under FICA and I would argue for a more liberal approach towards debate in general, so long as there is transparency. However, does the Minister agree that he will apply FICA directives and actions equally to foreigners who improperly intervene in our domestic politics whether on the side of the Ruling Party or the Opposition.",31,1301,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01301
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Secondly, the Bill allows for the Government to require reports on foreigners volunteering in political capacities. Does this extend to volunteering for the People’s Association or PA? The PA works with grassroots advisors who are Ruling Party Members of Parliament or individuals associated with the Ruling Party. It does not formally work with Opposition Members of Parliament. Much of the work of the PA serves to build political capital and visibility for the Ruling Party by way of the Ruling Party Member of Parliament or individual gracing events as the Guest of Honour, being featured in publicity materials and so on. Given these political connotations and corollary political effects associated with some of the PA’s activities involving Ruling Party figures, will foreigners volunteering for the PA also be subject to foreigner volunteer reporting? This could be one route along which foreign interference directed at the Ruling Party travels.",32,1302,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01302
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I would like to move to the second broad theme of my speech, Sir, which is clarifications on miscellaneous points, and I would like to pose four clarifying questions for the Minister's replies and, hopefully, assurances.",33,1303,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01303
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, the subject of a Part 3 direction or POL declaration can apply, within a 30-day timeframe, to the Minister for a reconsideration of his or her decision under clause 23(1). That is as the Bill stands. However, it appears that the Minister does not have a corresponding deadline against which he or she has to come to a decision on the application for reconsideration. This is problematic given the potentially deleterious effects which such a Part 3 direction could have on the reputations of individuals and entities. Will the Minister commit to such a timeframe?",34,1304,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01304
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Secondly, clause 76(1) requires that all PSPs disclose every reportable arrangement during a reporting period to a competent authority. These reportable arrangements are defined broadly and could cover arrangements where the PSP, in her private sector capacity, secures a new foreign client for her business, for example. The language of the Bill repeatedly states that such arrangements are reportable even if not directed at political ends. This would be very onerous to PSPs who depend on doing business with foreigners for a living or for certain individuals who work with foreigners frequently, like academics, for example.",35,1305,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01305
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),What will the Government do to minimise the onerousness while maintaining the flow of information that is potentially actionable?,36,1306,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01306
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"For example, can the reporting arrangements be made to report on classes of foreign clients and partners, such as, for example, multinational companies in France or academics in Italian business schools, rather than being required to specify each and every one of the names of the foreign individuals or entities which the PSPs have dealings with? This still flags out the countries that the PSP has dealings with. At this point, I declare my interest as the CEO of an international research consultancy.",37,1307,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01307
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Thirdly, pursuant to clause 93, those who are designated as PSPs or PSEs or issued directives under Parts 5 and 6, may only appeal against that decision to the Minister. They have no right of appeal to the Tribunal, unlike those who are issued Part 3 directions. What is the basis for this? I ask this question notwithstanding the fact that my colleague Sengkang Member of Parliament Ms He has argued for replacing the Bill’s Review Tribunal mechanism with appeals to the Courts, a proposal I agree with.",38,1308,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01308
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Fourthly, in the Explanatory Note on page 205 on defining the offence of clandestine acts of foreign interference by electronic means, one example cited might suggest covert links to a foreign principal would be if the person moves communication with the foreign principal to encrypted communication platform. Sir, many communication platforms nowadays are encrypted end-to-end, such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook, Messenger and Signal. Does communicating with a foreigner on such a platform like WhatsApp, for example, in and of itself constitute proof that the communication is covert and clandestine?",39,1309,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01309
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"To turn to my third and last broad theme, Sir, I have moved amendments to this Bill, specifically clauses 47, 48, 78, 79, 81, 84 and 85. I do not propose to repeat these amendments here word for word. These are set out in the Order Paper Supplement.",40,1310,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01310
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The overall thrust of these amendments is to require the Government to publicise all of its decisions under this Bill, in terms of designating PSPs, issuing directives and taking other actions. The amendments also require that the Government publish the reasons why decisions are taken, including reasons for designating persons or entities, PSPs as dealt with in clause 48 or PSEs as dealt with in clause 47. This will allow the public to understand the reasons behind the Government's actions to form their own conclusions about the justifications for those actions. This is important because how FICA's powers are used is a matter of public interest and deserves scrutiny.",41,1311,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01311
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"These amendments require the Government to publish this information over the internet in a searchable, sortable and downloadable manner without charge, in the words of my amendment to clause 81 to which other amendments make reference, and this is for the sake of transparency and should be self-explanatory. An exception to transparency in publicising the register of PSEs and PSPs is made for national security grounds, but under the amendments moved by my colleague Ms He, this would be subject to appeals to the High Court and judicial review.",42,1312,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01312
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In clause 48(1)(b), I have moved an amendment to add the word ""reasonable"" for the Government’s ability to designate someone a PSP if their employment and activities are not obviously political. This enables a person to apply for judicial review of executive action taken against them under clause 48(1)(b).",43,1313,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01313
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),The amendment to clause 78 requires reportable arrangements to be made public. I would add that our call here is for such publicity to be made with due cognisance taken towards commercial sensitivities and individual privacy. This call should be seen in conjunction with my earlier suggestion to make these reportable arrangements less onerous.,44,1314,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01314
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In general, published information should be concise and focus on key types of foreign interests associated with PSPs and PSEs.",45,1315,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01315
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Government has previously said that it would publish some of these details. So, why am I moving these amendments? Are they redundant? No, for a few reasons.",46,1316,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01316
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"First, the Government did not say that it would publish the reasons behind their FICA decisions, which my amendments to clause 47, 48, 81, 84 and 85 require the Government to do.",47,1317,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01317
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Second, there is an amendment to clause 48 that requires the Government to exercise its executive discretion in designating PSPs reasonably.",48,1318,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01318
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Third, the amendments call on the manner of publishing to be over the internet in a searchable, sortable and downloadable manner without charge, centralised for ease of use by stakeholders and for accountability.",49,1319,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01319
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Fourth and, most importantly, Sir, notwithstanding the Government’s public assurance that it would publish information about FICA, we believe that this should be codified in law, so that this Government and future governments are obligated to do this under the law. There must be rule of law, not rule by law.",50,1320,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01320
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In conclusion, Sir, I have no doubt that there is a need to safeguard Singapore against foreign interference and I think we are all in agreement of that. However, the Bill as it stands has insufficient independent oversight, enables government overreach and overlooks real dangers like foreign interference directed at Ministers.",51,1321,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01321
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Like all dangers Singapore faces, the solution should never be to simply give the Government more and more and more broad discretionary powers that can be used against citizens, critics and opposition parties among others.",52,1322,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01322
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"By staking so much on strengthening state discretionary powers in this manner, we diminish the role of education and trust in the political maturity of our citizens, who are better educated than ever.",53,1323,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01323
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"We also risk executive over-reach and abuse, and the risk of that overreach or abuse diminishes trust in our institutions potentially, turns our citizens against one another potentially and harms national unity in the face of these foreign threats potentially.",54,1324,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01324

2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"Zooming straight into clause 5 of the Bill, there are concerns that this clause defines activities or conduct ""on behalf of a foreign principal"" too broadly, to include those ""in collaboration with"" a foreign individual or entity.",2,1329,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01329
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"Youths are understandably worried if their everyday interactions with foreign friends will run afoul of this Bill. And more precisely, whether any activity or conduct critical of the Government or Government policies and with any shade of foreign involvement, will be hit by FICA. If one reads the proposed legislation with its plain meanings, one can quite naturally come to these conclusions and concerns.",3,1330,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01330
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"But at the same time, a foreign principal with malicious intent to interfere with our affairs can very well exploit, or may already be exploiting, the cover of seemingly innocuous day-to-day activities or conduct, to achieve its insidious objectives. That is the whole point of artful interference and manipulation  to operate under cover. And this could certainly involve a seemingly innocent collaboration with another party.",4,1331,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01331
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"Let us take an example, a foreign principal can collaborate on a song about vaccines. We already have a song, a collaboration, may I add, about 菜饭, Economical Rice, so I think we can all agree that a song about COVID-19 vaccines is entirely conceivable. The song could be about the supposed superiority of certain vaccines and/or the alleged risks of certain other vaccines. If the song is catchy, if it is funny, engaging and sung with passion, it will have the potential to viral, no pun intended. And the foreign principal can very well do this in collaboration with some other parties. A foreign principal can also exploit the pretext of collaboration to create memes, videos, articles, even games, essentially, any number of platforms to achieve its sinister objectives.",5,1332,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01332
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"And so, herein lies the central paradox that we have to deal with when we discuss our approach as a people to counter foreign interference. Because the tactics of foreign interference can be so sophisticated, so clandestine, these efforts slide themselves effortlessly into our everyday lives and can so easily masquerade as normal activities and conduct. And so to counter these, we really need to fight these forces where they are, in other words, our laws and actions will have to operate within the realm of everyday activities and conduct in order to be effective. But this grates against our basic sensibilities, It touches a raw nerve and it causes worry, rightly so.",6,1333,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01333
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"But the basic point I am making is that ultimately, we are contemplating laws like FICA, which can intersect so much with the realm of our daily lives, only because the very threats that FICA seeks to counter have invited themselves into our daily lives first, whether we want it or not and the powers of FICA scoped on the basis of these fundamental reality.",7,1334,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01334

2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"First, the enemy is without, not within. The real and only threat is insidious foreign interference from overseas, not alternative voices, whether domestically or abroad. Second, to deal with this external enemy, the purpose of FICA is in fact very narrow, even if the range of tactics provided for in this Bill is indeed quite broad. So, there is a whole toolkit of directions and directives and countermeasures, but all these tactical modalities are ultimately to serve a very narrow purpose that FICA is intended for. Third, the principles of FICA are neither unique nor novel. In other words, Singapore is neither the only nor the first country moving such laws.",9,1336,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01336
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"Australia, for example, has the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme (FITS) since 2019. Their definition of activities ""on behalf of"" a foreign principal is similarly broad. An applicable arrangement with a foreign principal under FITS could be ""formal or informal, written or verbal. It could be a contract, understanding or agreement of any kind.""",10,1337,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01337

One can also certainly say that Company A in this illustration is working ""in collaboration with"", in its plain meaning, the foreign government. So, Australia has defined these activities quite broadly and the principles behind FICA are really no different.",11,1338,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01338
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"I will also note that none of the amendments that the Workers' Party has moved actually touches on clause 5, on what constitutes activities or conduct ""on behalf of"" a foreign principal.

2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"I have three suggestions. First, and most fundamentally, we should recognise that the ultimate check and balance on Governmental powers is not in more and more legislative guard rails, but rather, in the democratic vote in our own hands. We should recognise that any government, today or in future, as Executive of this and other laws of the land, will be held accountable to the people and by the people in Singapore. And in turn, we the people should have a key interest to choose suitable persons who will exercise these powers, any legislative powers, discretionary powers under the laws, judiciously and wisely.",14,1341,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01341
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"Notwithstanding this, secondly, I think transparency and timely disclosure by the Government to the public in its Executive actions under FICA will go a long way towards modulating the Government's administration of the law and keep trust with the public. In this light, I agree with the spirit of the amendments to clauses 78, 79, 81, 84 and 85 moved by Mr Leon Perera. I agree with the spirit of Mr Perera's proposed amendments.",15,1342,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01342

2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"To this end, I am glad to note that the Minister has also served notice in his speech just now, to move an amendment to clause 116 itself, with the new language reading, ""...it must prepare a notice informing about every Part 3 Direction except the Technical Assistance Direction given, every designation made under Part 4 or every directive given under Parts 5 or 6"". These proposed amendments will capture the Government's definitive commitment to public disclosure and transparency under FICA and I look forward to the passing of these amendment at the Committee Stage later.",19,1346,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01346
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"At this point, I would like to seek some clarifications. One, the Ministry has mentioned a Registry of Foreign and Political Disclosures for Parts 4, 5 and 6 in its interview with the media last week. So, my question is, where will Part 3 directions be published? Two, will the reasons for actions taken under Parts 3, 4, 5 or 6 also be published, as much as practicable? Three, will the Registry or Registries be accessible online, free of charge, searchable, sortable and downloadable, so as to maximise its intended potential for public education and awareness? And four, will appeals made and decided under FICA be similarly published?",20,1347,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01347
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"Sir, my third suggestion to better assure Singaporeans and keep their confidence in FICA is that the Government needs to constantly communicate the law's intended purpose and the Government's commitment to this intent. This is difficult to do, as the concerns that Singaporeans may have towards the Bill can be very visceral, as I noted at the start of my speech.",21,1348,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01348
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"So, to this end, can the Minister give definitive assurance, in this House, once again, that the youth climate activist working with regional and or international friends to advance their joint vision for climate justice has nothing to worry about as regards FICA and can indeed look forward to continuing and growing his or her work?",22,1349,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01349
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"Can the Minister assure that the Singaporean youth working overseas and writing, posting from overseas about his or her racialised experience with previous job searches or employers in Singapore will not be deemed a vector of a Hostile Information Campaign and thus, slapped with some Part 3 Direction under FICA?",23,1350,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01350
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"Can the Minister assure that indeed, students, lecturers, academics in our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning here, interacting with foreign students, discussing, exchanging views on any number of political issues will not find themselves subject to designation as Politically Significant Persons?",24,1351,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01351
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"Can the Minister assure that patriots, well-meaning Singaporeans who want to lend their own voices to civic discourse here, no matter how critical of the Government and Government Policies, will not be caught by FICA, simply on account of any actual or suspected interaction with a foreigner?",25,1352,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01352
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"Sir, let me conclude. The Select Committee on Online Falsehoods heard evidence in 2018 on a troll farm cottage industry in Macedonia. Macedonian teenagers worked in these farms and subverted the US presidential elections in 2016.",26,1353,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01353
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"They might very well have zero actual interest in US politics and it is unclear if they were taking directions from other foreign state players. But it was clear that they did this to earn money through advertisements. One teenager reportedly earned US$16,000 – more than 40 times the average monthly salary in Macedonia.",27,1354,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01354
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,There were even dedicated classes to train young Macedonians in this trade.,28,1355,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01355
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"There are two points to note here. One, the content created by this troll farm were not all ""fake news"" or falsehoods per se. So, not everything can be caught by POFMA. Second point and equally fundamental is that the Select Committee report came out in 2018. We are debating FICA today, three years later. Indeed, it would be fair to ask, what actually took us so long?",29,1356,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01356
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"Mr Speaker, the threat of foreign interference is real and urgent and the broad powers provided by this Bill are necessary. But Singaporeans, including youths, are concerned and I implore the Government to double down on transparency commitments as well as constantly communicate on the narrow intent of FICA so as to assure Singaporeans while ensuring that the Government has the wherewithal to effectively protect us against a common threat.",30,1357,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01357

2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"To end, I would like to touch on Mr Gerald Giam's proposed amendments to clause 8 on what is defined as being ""directed towards a political end in Singapore"".",32,1359,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01359
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"Mr Giam has proposed to remove limbs (f) and (g) of the definition in the Bill, namely, (f) on public opinion about a matter of public controversy in Singapore and (g) on political debate.",33,1360,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01360
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"Now, I have listened to the Minister explain the philosophy behind clause 8 and Mr Giam's argument for the proposed omissions.",34,1361,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01361
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"Sir, clause 8 sets out the entire political landscape, the entire surface area that foreign threat vectors can and will operate on to subvert our affairs. I therefore like to ask Mr Giam if he would not agree that the real effect of his proposed omissions will not so much scope the powers of the executive to limit the potential for over-reach and abuse of power but rather the real effect will be to curtail the real powers that the executive needs to counter the real and highly complex threats that FICA is exactly designed to counter?",35,1362,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01362
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"Would Mr Giam not agree that his proposed omissions defang FICA and strip it of its basic effectiveness to fight foreign interference? It is a bit like saying, let us fight with one arm tied behind our backs, or maybe more, because we are worried about the power of having two arms.",36,1363,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01363
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"Sir, lastly, I would also point out that the definition of what is ""directed towards a political end in Singapore"" in clause 8 of FICA is already found in existing laws such as the Public Order Act amended in 2017. In that debate in 2017, the Workers' Party had expressed no concern about the very same definition. So, it is not clear to me why the Workers' Party would have a concern now about the same definition four years on.",37,1364,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01364

2021-10-04-T-023,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"I mentioned that clause 7, which defines what public interest is, already gives the Minister the power, in the public interest, to take actions if it is necessary to ensure the public health, public finances, public safety, public tranquility, public peace and public order. All those are already in clause 7 and so there is no reason why the Minister cannot use those clauses to invoke directions in the public interest.",3,1368,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01368

2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"The Public Order Act as amended in 2017 deals with foreign organisation and participation in activities directed towards a political end in physical spaces in Singapore. So, as we debate FICA, I think it is quite clear and we can all agree that the same logic and the same definition should apply to even more nefarious and insidious threats in the online space that can apply to both Singaporeans and foreigners.",2,1372,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01372
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"Mr Gerald Giam mentioned clause 7 in FICA, specifically, I think, clause D.

2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"I would point out that the Public Order Act has exactly the same clause 7(2)(E). In fact, it has an additional word, ""hostility"".",4,1374,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01374
2021-10-04-T-023,Xie Yao Quan,Mr Xie Yao Quan,"I think the construct of the Public Order Act and FICA are essentially the same and I do not see why the Workers' Party, who had no issue four years ago, should have the issue today.",5,1375,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01375

But the Public Order Act does not have clause 7F – to prevent any foreign interference directed towards a political end in Singapore. Clause 7F leads on into clause 8, where it defines the political end in Singapore.",1,1377,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01377
2021-10-04-T-023,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"So, I think it is important for us to understand that we want to scope down the Bill to make sure that we focus on the acts that actually cause harm to Singapore, not provide a catch-all phrase inside the Bill for the Minister, if he cannot find anything else to use, to use that as a tool against harm. There are specific qualifications for what qualifies as harm against public interest, against public health and so on.",2,1378,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01378

2021-10-04-T-023,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Under the Bill, it is proposed that appeals made to the Reviewing Tribunal and the Minister with limited judicial review by the Supreme Court. The hon Member Ms He Ting Ru, proposed that appeals be heard hurt by the High Court, with the right of further appeal. I appreciate that her motivation is to provide checks and balances. I would respectfully demur with her suggestion although I must acknowledge there are merits to the broad rationale behind her proposal. As for my reasons for demurring, I need only refer to my Adjournment Motion speech made recently this House when I spoke about judicial review in March 2021.",35,1415,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01415

I said then that each generation of political leaders and people must find their own equilibrium on what is acceptable. They will also recall that in my same speech, I went on to state that, in my view, the status quo should be preserved for the ISA. I recounted the point made in 1991 by Prof S Jayakumar, the former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs in this House that when it comes to issues of national security, putting a Court to scrutinise exercise of powers would be tantamount to giving the Court, an unelected body, the final say on such matters.

It is preferable, when it comes to assessment of what action is to be taken, to counter foreign interference affecting public interest, the Minister must be held responsible and accountable through the political process. Also, in my respectful view, since we are dealing with issues of foreign interference affecting public interest, as defined under this Bill, a different form of procedure to ensure the swift and agile handling of cases and judicious safeguarding of sensitive information will be needed.",37,1417,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01417

There are already general powers. You can see that in light green. What FICA aims to do is to give targeted powers, and you see that in dark green. I heard the hon Member Mr Perera saying just now a theory about FICA having some latent powers being embedded which can be used later on by a Government which is malevolently intending to use these powers. If that is really the case, it will be better to use the latent powers already embedded in the current Acts. You do not have to pass FICA for that.

The Reviewing Tribunal deals with appeals against an authorisation of a Part III direction. I note it is contemplated that the chairperson of the Reviewing Tribunal must be a Supreme Court Judge. I also note that the decision is to be made by the President on the advice of the Cabinet. To me, the President should be consulting the Chief Justice, who heads our Judiciary in deciding who should be the chairman. This is the case under Article 151(2) of the Constitution which provides the chairman and two members of the Advisory Board which deals with preventive detention under the ISA shall be appointed by the President after consulting the Chief Justice.

2021-10-04-T-023,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai,"The point I wish to make is this. In my earlier speech in March 2021, I have already stated that when it comes to issues of national security, a different approach should be taken. I found instructive, the speech made by Prof Jayakumar about why the powers dealing with national security should be sited with the political leaders. So, in my personal view, the equilibrium is still the same vis-a-vis FICA because here, we are dealing with issues of national security. Additionally, I would add that FICA does not contemplate detention without trial.",2,1440,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01440

And as I said earlier in my speech, the focus of FICA is to give targeted powers so that you could better deal with national interest. So, in those circumstances, I would say, having regard to the fact that this is an area that has been traversed and the need to provide targeted directives, the equilibrium that we have in ISA would be the equilibrium that I am comfortable with vis-a-vis FICA and there is no contradiction.",3,1441,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01441

In cyberspace, the cyberattacks and hostile information campaigns have increased in complexity and have become more illicit, masking themselves in seemingly innocuous ways. Therefore, these risks should be actively pre-empted and addressed for the national security of Singapore.",1,1443,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01443
2021-10-04-T-023,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"I believe in the legislative intent of the Bill. However, I have concerns about certain aspects, namely transparency and the need for more checks and balances. Is there a way we can realise and uphold the good intentions of the Bill while at the same time provide some amendments which can address the concerns?",2,1444,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01444
2021-10-04-T-023,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"I will speak on three points. First, on the possible avenues of check and balances that can be incorporated into the Bill. Second, on how we can increase the transparency of this Bill. Thirdly, I will speak on how the definition of foreign principal may bring about potential discrimination which may affect Singapore’s reputation as a global hub.",3,1445,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01445
2021-10-04-T-023,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"First, the Bill grants considerable powers to the Government. For example, section 21 allows the Minister to give anticipatory directions even when the Minister only suspects or has reason to believe that the person is “preparing for, or planning to undertake, online communications activity by or on behalf of a foreign principal”. The substance of these decisions under the Bill are not subject to judicial review.",4,1446,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01446
2021-10-04-T-023,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"I understand that in cases of foreign interference, speed may be of the essence and information received must be acted upon quickly. Moreover, this information may be sensitive and require confidentiality to be preserved. However, provisions can be enacted in the Bill to require that sensitive information be sealed or otherwise not disclosed in the Court hearing such as to allow a judicial review to still be carried out. We have seen some precedent for this in the treatment of whistleblowing information and whistleblowers' identity in court proceedings. If time is of the essence and there is need for judicial reviews under this Bill to be expedited, surely this can also be provided for in the Bill as well. A reviewing Tribunal, even if presided by a High Court judge cannot replace the role of judicial oversight. We must strive to maintain Singapore’s reputation of holding and protecting the rule of law while recognising the ills of foreign interference.",5,1447,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01447
2021-10-04-T-023,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"Second, there have also been concerns about the transparency of the Bill. One example is the criteria on who can be designated a Part 4 PSP. In the Bill, a Part 4 PSP is a person or organisation whose activities are directed in part towards a political end in Singapore and the Competent Authority opines that it would be in the public interest to impose countermeasures on the entity. This is further elaborated on in sections 7 and 8 of the Bill. These definitions, though, are still broad and not easily understood by the community.",6,1448,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01448
2021-10-04-T-023,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"Section 20 will also grant the Minister for Home Affairs powers to issue directions to various entities such as social media services, relevant electronic services, internet access services, as well as persons who own or run websites, blogs or social media pages, to help the authorities investigate and counter hostile communications activity that is of foreign origin. Although it does not apply to Singaporeans expressing their own views on political matters, unless they are agents of a foreign principal and it may not be the intent of the Bill to stifle political speech, there are some members of the community, for example, members of academia or humanitarian and advocacy groups who have genuine concerns about this. These groups have many foreign connections due to their nature that encourages cross-border collaboration. The fear is that their work, which may touch on complex local political issues, and their ties with foreign entities, foundations and states as well as associated funding, may mean that they are at risk of running afoul of the law.",7,1449,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01449
2021-10-04-T-023,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"It may be argued that this does not cross the threshold of “public interest”. However, there is a sense of unease on the ground and reasonable concern that the current non-exhaustive way that “public interest” is defined in section 8 would still mean that their activities fall under it. Could more be done in the wording of the Bill to provide greater certainty to organisations on the types of entities that would be designated a Part 4 PSP and subject to directives, such that it avoids casting a shadow on their activities? After all, unless winter is coming in Singapore, surely it would be in the country's best interest to avoid casting a chilling effect on such complex cross-border research and activities.",8,1450,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01450
2021-10-04-T-023,Shahira Abdullah,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"I am also concerned about how our youths have received this. Youths include Singaporeans, foreigners and PRs among them, interacting together. And our youths value the ability to talk about potentially politically sensitive and difficult topics and is increasingly comfortable doing so on an online platform. Would these regulations give the impression that the Government is discouraging this? If it does, it will cast a shadow on the trust that the youths have for the Government which is something we should guard against. Youths are our future and trust is essential for governments to effectively lead.",9,1451,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01451

A foreign principal includes a foreigner even if he or she is a Permanent Resident of this country. This is understandable, as foreign interferences may masquerade as normal foreign entities when in essence they are not.",10,1452,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01452

This may have unintended effects on Singapore’s reputation as a hub for global trade and investments that upholds its constitutional values of equality and fairness. This is something we should always be vigilant about.",11,1453,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01453

A balance must be struck and its consequences understood as it also has a bearing on the trust Singaporeans may have in the Government and its systems. I fully agree that Singapore must always be prepared against the threat of foreign interference. This is something I recognise and that no one can deny. However, I do hope that in the implementation of this Act, we do not inadvertently lose public trust, discourage local political discourse or advocacy, or affect Singapore’s reputation as an open trading hub.",12,1454,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01454

Unfortunately, a recent IPS survey also found that our digital literacy rates are worryingly low with 6 in 10 respondents believing false information to be true and found that no one is immune to false information regardless of age, socio-economic status and educational background.

International investors from various industries are attracted to set up operations in Singapore. Facebook, Google, Twitter, Tencent, Alibaba, Huawei, Wechat.

We will have to be able to assert our neutrality and independence to maintain the balance that we have. We must prevent foreign interference from destabilising what we have.

However, let me just point out that such legislation to ensure non-interference by foreign agents are currently already in place in countries such as Australia, EU, US and Canada. They have laws to prevent, detect and disrupt foreign interferences conducted through hostile information campaigns and the use of local proxies in their domestic politics. For example, in June 2018, Australia passed laws targeting foreign interference in politics and other domestic affairs and the European Commission is proposing a new Digital Services Act which will, among other things, regulate online platforms by transposing what is already illegal offline to the online space.",11,1466,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01466
2021-10-04-T-023,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),These examples serve to illustrate the fact that it is only expected that states will have to protect their self-interests and prevent foreign intervention especially when its intention is to harvest protest potential.,12,1467,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01467
2021-10-04-T-023,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Notwitstanding the above, I wanted to share a concern which was addressed by the Minister in his speech earlier. One concern was from foreign businesses and Singaporeans working in MNCs on whether discussions between a Singaporean and non-Singaporean individual on policies which may affect their business may be seen as foreign interference and captured within the scope of the Bill especially if it is done on an online platform.",13,1468,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01468
2021-10-04-T-023,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"This has been of particular concern, especially in light of the current labour crunch causing delays and pushing up the cost of doing business. This labour crunch is brought about by border restrictions, the lack of access to foreign labour and the perceived increasingly anti-foreigner sentiments exacerbated by the current COVID-19 environment. Rightfully, foreign businesses and MNCs are concerned that such discussions on the impact of our policies on their businesses may run them foul of the law. I am glad to hear that Minister has reiterated that discussions of this nature does not meet the threshold to be foul of the law. Mr Speaker, in Malay, please.",14,1469,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01469
2021-10-04-T-023,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] The Select Committee on Online Falsehoods was established three years ago and comprises Members of Parliament from both sides of the House. After considering 169 written representations and oral evidence from 65 individuals and organisations, it has concluded that the spread of online falsehoods is a ""real and serious problem"" in Singapore. The Select Committee was also presented with evidence that information operations sponsored by foreign countries were carried out against Singapore.",15,1470,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01470

2021-10-04-T-023,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"There are other factors that make it important for this law to be implemented. A survey by the Institute of Policy Studies, or IPS, found that our digital literacy rate was low, with two-thirds of respondents believing in a manipulated article. Imagine, two-thirds of respondents inadvertently believed an article that was manipulated by the study! And imagine if article is manipulated by those who seek to divide our society. We should and must overcome such online falsehoods, especially when it is done through foreign interference.",17,1472,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01472
2021-10-04-T-023,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The spread of online falsehoods through foreign interference is a real and growing problem around the world. One of the ways it is done is by using fake social media accounts to influence and divide a harmonious society by using sensitive matters such as racial and religious issues. In one case in the United States, an organisation from a foreign state used fake accounts that promote Islamic objectives, as well as fake accounts that spread anti-Islam messages, in order to start a protest against the building of an Islamic library – at the same time and place! This prompted many Americans to attend the protest with one protester reportedly carrying a gun.",18,1473,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01473

2021-10-04-T-023,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"As we strive to improve the law to address this problem, we should also realise that we can play a role as Singapore citizens. We must be more careful and sceptical of what we read on social media including the comments and we must not be easily influenced that is not based on truth; especially on sensitive issues which are more easily manipulated to heighten racial discord. We should check the source of information so that we can get the accurate information.",20,1475,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01475

2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,A judicial process will not be appropriate in matters where we rely heavily on sensitive intelligence and collaboration with foreign counterparts. Many things cannot be publicly disclosed.,26,1534,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01534
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Courts themselves, have recognised their limitations in such matters. In Chng Suan Tze, the Court of Appeal recognised that where a decision – say the ISA detention – was based on national security concerns, judicial review of that decision would be precluded.",27,1535,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01535
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Court acknowledged that what national security requires has to be left to those responsible for national security, that would be the Executive. And in such situations, we have found alternative ways of providing for checks and balances with the view that we must maintain accountability.",28,1536,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01536
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Mr Perera asked who checks the checkers? What happens if the Prime Minister or the Minister for Home Affairs are suborned?,29,1537,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01537
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Well, what happens in any other country if a prime minister or minister for home affairs or any other minister is suborned? Do the Courts intervene? In the case of the US, have we seen the United States Supreme Court intervene?",30,1538,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01538
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,The ultimate check are the people. But do you expect the people as a collective body to deal with day-to-day problems of foreign interference? That is why we are elected and we are in Parliament here to debate what is the best way possible for the people.,31,1539,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01539
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We talk about consultation. We have had consultations for three years now. Mr Singh read out an answer given by Second Minister Josephine. Yes, she said we will consult. We have to bring people in, and this is what we have been doing from the Select Committee hearing. For three years we have been doing that  conferences, Select Committee hearings for over eight days, if I recall rightly, discussions in Parliament, speeches, extensive discussions.",32,1540,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01540
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, we agree entirely on the principles. In fact, if this Government had not stuck to those principles, fundamentally, and had not recognised that that is the foundation of our existence – rule of law, separation of powers, doing things according to the law – we would not be here. Not just the PAP. PAP would have been long out of power but Singapore would not be here.",33,1541,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01541
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, yes, Executive powers must be subject to checks and balances. The question is in what form and that depends on what is appropriate for the situation. When the Courts are not suitable, we have introduced other types of bodies or tribunals with statutory imposed safeguards. The further safeguards here, like requiring a Supreme Court Judge to consider the matter.",34,1542,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01542

2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,And we also have a series of cases where ouster clauses have been upheld by the Courts. These relate to areas which are traditionally regarded as non-justiciable. National security and foreign relations are classic areas.,36,1544,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01544
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Ms He Ting Ru made some points on the Tribunal  the scope of what they can review and their independence.,37,1545,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01545
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"First, on the scope of its review. She seems to be under the mistaken impression that the Tribunal’s remit is narrow. That is incorrect. The Tribunal can consider any appeal brought against a Part 3 Direction and there can be a review of the merits of the decision. It is not confined to procedural compliance or legality. And the Tribunal, chaired by a Supreme Court Judge, will look at sensitive intelligence and information.",38,1546,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01546
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Perera, I think, called it the Government-appointed Committee. I mean, again, rhetoric. Let us please not insult our High Court Judges. Please. And this Tribunal has powers to overrule the Minister’s decision.",39,1547,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01547
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Tribunal has been, as I said, expressly vested with the powers to override the Minister's decision and it is useful to point out clause 95(2) of the Bill insulates the members of the Reviewing Tribunal from pressure and states very clearly that the Minister cannot reduce the salary and terms of office once they are appointed by the President.",40,1548,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01548
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Singh pointed out that under clause 99(2)(b), the Tribunal will be able to consider a matter, without the appellant being given full particulars of the conduct which is the subject to the appeal. He talked about natural justice. I accept. But I also explained why sometimes we cannot give the full evidence. I said that in my opening speech which Mr Singh did not refer to at all. There might be times when the evidence would have to be given to the Tribunal for it to look at and decide for itself whether it makes sense to make the orders and it is proportionate to the kind of orders that can be made. We are not talking about the liberty of the individual. Also, clause 99(2)(f) allows the Tribunal to give a summary of any evidence to the appellant.",41,1549,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01549
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Mr Singh highlighted the importance of education about foreign interference and its dangers. We agree with that. I have explained that FICA is part of a comprehensive strategy to deal with foreign interference. Powers under FICA are only part of the picture and I have said that it is a calibrated piece of legislation to allow us to act surgically against threats.,42,1550,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01550
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Besides legislation, we have been and will continue to strengthen other defences – detection and response capabilities, Singaporeans’ ability to discern legitimate and artificial online discourse, though that is going to be very difficult, to counter the threat of foreign interference.",43,1551,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01551

2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Giam is right that a whole-of-society effort is required for public education. So, we will welcome everyone's assistance in helping to engage and educate the population.",49,1557,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01557

2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Moving on to foreigners who comment on Singapore politics and whether they are liable. Mr Perera mentioned someone. Again, I think he either missed it or was not listening to my speech, I dealt with it in my opening speech. A foreign commentator putting out his name and commenting is unlikely to be called ""covert"" per se. Depends on the facts and I said this arose from something that Assoc Prof Jamus Lim had put out in the context of his amendments. So, I addressed it.",55,1563,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01563
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"If a foreigner puts his name, writes articles, people can assess for themselves what is the weight to be attached.

2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Leong Mun Wai asked why is FICA necessary when we already have extensive powers and substantial resources to deal with foreign interference. I have, in my speech, pointed out how the Internet has opened an entirely new front for hostile action. Information forces are seen as a fourth branch of armed service. This Bill is about updating our powers to ensure that they are fit for the Internet age. Given the threats, we think there is a clear and present danger that justifies us acting now.",60,1568,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01568
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Assoc Prof Jamus Lim asked how MHA came to the conclusion that Singapore was being attacked in 2018 when Facebook’s assessment was that there had been no cases of foreign influence operations targeting Singapore since 2017. We do not know how Facebook makes its assessment and whether it depends only on Facebook. We look at the wide variety of communication tools. Based on the information we have available to us, we reached a different conclusion. And I would say to Assoc Prof Lim, matters of our national security should not be outsourced to private companies and they should not be made to decide what our fate ought to be.",61,1569,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01569

Mr Xie Yao Quan asked that we explain the targets of the Bill and how the law will be applied, especially with regard to young people.

2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The short answer really is no. I mentioned this in my speech earlier; I will just summarise. FICA will not stop individuals, businesses and organisations in Singapore from building overseas partnerships, soliciting overseas business, networking with foreigners, sourcing for donations, discussing government policies or political matters that affect their businesses with foreign colleagues or business partners or supporting charities. As long as these are done in an open and transparent manner and not part of an attempt to manipulate our political discourse or undermine public interest such as security.",63,1571,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01571
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,It will also not cover Singaporeans expressing their own views. It goes without saying Singaporeans have every right to speak up on our domestic politics. They are also free to engage in advocacy. That is not touched by FICA.,64,1572,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01572
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,Mr Louis Ng and Mr Zhulkarnain asked how the Government decides what is covert or deceptive. It is an assessment that has to depend on many factors. No different from many of the other things that the Government does.,65,1573,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01573
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Primarily, we have to examine the behaviour of the actor involved. Indicators of covert or deceptive behaviour will include attempts to mask their tracks, misrepresent their identity, attempting to launder their narratives by having them amplified by sympathetic or unwitting locals. And these can never be exhaustive. Tactics will continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, and I even attempted to set out the full list of tactics or factors that might be used or need to be considered.",66,1574,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01574

The fact that communications is private, on its own, would not make it hidden or covert. The use of such messages or VPN to intentionally avoid detection could be a factor in an assessment but it really must be taken into account with all the other facts and circumstances and the legal requirements set out in the law including proportionality.",67,1575,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01575
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Zhulkarnain asked in relation to the offences in clauses 17 and 18, why we should allow an individual to ""get away” if there is no covert or deceptive behaviour.",68,1576,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01576
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I had previously said that this Bill was calibrated, and this is one example of how. There is a line, a fine one, between a campaign to persuade and a campaign to manipulate. When campaigning is done openly, Singaporeans know who the content is from. They are able to make up their own minds and are free to agree, disagree, depending on whether they are persuaded. So, in our view, that should not be criminalised. But separately, directions can be given against a foreign party, depending on whether the thresholds have been crossed, which I explained earlier.",69,1577,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01577

Those will be prosecuted in open court. I specifically said so in my speech. There is no detention without trial in this Bill. So, to suggest that someone can be detained, trialed in absence, no judicial review? All of that is utter nonsense. I do not know where he got these ideas from.

2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,The level of authorisation required for various powers is calibrated based on the impact of the directions and countermeasures. PSP directions are targeted in their applications and scope. They are issued to a specified individual or entity. The impact of the directives are limited to that person or entity and compared with a HIC.,82,1590,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01590

2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Being conferred with an honorary title or degree by a foreign state or University alone is unlikely to be sufficient grounds for designation as a PSP.

We have no issues with making the appointments public. The committee will comprise third parties to render advice to the Minister.,88,1596,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01596
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"In response to Mr Louis Ng's question on whether individuals will receive written responses to explain decisions made by the competent authority on designating PSPs, this would be done as the specific activities that qualified them for designation will have a direct impact on how the controls will apply to them. For instance, a designated NGO that advocates on a variety of issues will have to report donations that it specifically receives for its activities that are directed towards a political end. The explanation will be important in setting out which are its activities of concern and those would be the donations that have to be disclosed.",89,1597,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01597
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Louis Ng asked if MHA will release guidelines and illustrations that can facilitate compliance by good-faith actors. Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked if there will be engagement to help businesses navigate how FICA applies to them. Non-compliance is an offence. A recipient of a direction who fails to comply, can be prosecuted. We agree with the intent of Mr Ng's and Mr Liang's questions, there is a need to help good faith actors comply. We will continue to engage stakeholders including tech companies and Internet access service providers to understand their capabilities and constraints, identify suitable modes of compliance and we will continue to work with our stakeholders to operationalise.",90,1598,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01598

Mr Zhulkarnain suggested giving a report on the FICA offences or directions without the need to go into specific details or naming the foreign principals. Mr Darryl David suggested informing the public when there is sufficient evidence that there is foreign interference and said we should make the entity's identity and activities known so that we can take a united position against such a country.",92,1600,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01600

There are wider national and foreign policy considerations in doing so. However, we will alert Singaporeans when such communications activity has been detected and if FICA directions were issued to block and contain such foreign interference. All Part 3 directions, except for the Technical Assistance Direction, will be published on a website accessible to the public.",93,1601,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01601

Where possible, we will inform the public on the broad grounds for issuance of directions. In response to Mr Xie's question on whether appeals made and ruled under FICA would be published, we can consider, although it would depend on the facts and circumstances of the case. The more sensitive the information used, the less likely we are able to do so.",94,1602,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01602

He also asked if a person would be held liable if he was not aware that he is acting on behalf of a foreign principal. The short answer is no. The Member can refer to clause 5(1)(b). The starting point is indeed we want to make it an offence to conduct or abet a HIC. But we cannot remove intentionality from the offence elements, otherwise we will end up making criminals out of Singaporeans who unknowingly aid an HIC by sharing content without knowing better. Given the sophistication of threat actors, this is more than likely.",96,1604,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01604

2021-10-04-T-023,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"I will start with the first which covers the Second Minister for Home Affairs, Minister Josephine Teo's comments at this year's Committee of Supply. Sir, I do not believe I misread that speech. Mr Christopher de Souza filed a cut, asking MHA what it would do to deter foreign interference in our domestic affairs. Minister replies, quite an extensive reply. It goes on for about a page, and right at the end, she says, ""Given the experience of other countries, we need to consider further measures"". This is post-Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods' findings, post some other seminars that have been referred to. And she says, ""We need to consider further measures to guard against foreign subversion, what levels of transparency, support, leadership are appropriate for home and the public has to play a big part in this to shape proposals and to give safeguards the strongest support"". It seems to me that it is not a misunderstanding of this but it is probably more accurate to say that, that does not seem to be an answer as to why the Bill could not be put before public consultation, like other Bills are. This is an omission for which I do not think we have heard any responses yet.",2,1612,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01612
2021-10-04-T-023,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"The second point pertains to the role of the Courts, which I think is the fundamental disagreement between the Government and the Workers' Party (WP)'s position is the oversight mechanism. I think there is scope to discuss some of the other points and I think Minister has agreed with some of our amendments but Minister referred to the case, the 1988 case of Chng Suan Tze v Minister for Home Affairs. Let me refer to it and try to capture the spirit of the WP's approaches to oversight mechanisms the way we see them vis-à-vis this Bill.",3,1613,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01613
2021-10-04-T-023,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"I refer to the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill. A debate that took place on the 25 of January 1989 and it also dealt with, the main debate also dealt with Internal Security Act (ISA) (Amendment) Bill, which sought to abolish appeal to the Privy Council in case of review of ISA cases.",4,1614,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01614
2021-10-04-T-023,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Then, Minister K Shanmugam, as a backbencher said the following and I would start with the reference to Chng Suan Tze and Minister said, ""It will be useful to consider exactly what the Court of Appeal said. It did not say that it can itself decide whether or not the detainee posed a threat. The Court said that it can consider, within broad parameters, whether or not there was any ground at all for the detention. It will set aside the detention only if there were absolutely no grounds for the detention, that is, it takes the view that no one in his right mind could possibly have concluded that the detainee posed any threat to national security. Otherwise, it will not interfere with the Minister's decision.",5,1615,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01615
2021-10-04-T-023,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Sir, the amendments will deny the Courts that power. This Government believes it has never abused the ISA and there is nothing to fear. The Government works on the basis that the persons in Government should be upright, moral and only do what is good for the country. Thus, the people have nothing to fear, despite the powers that the Government has. These powers will never be abused because they are so effective, they help the Government govern effectively for the greater good of all. So, that has worked.""",6,1616,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01616

We cannot guarantee that the future government will comprise of honourable men."" Minister then goes on, ""An argument, therefore, can be made out that there must be checks and balances within the system. The Minister in taking his decision can arguably be made to realise that if his decision is so unreasonable that one look at the facts will show that he could never have considered the detainee a threat, then his decision should be reversed by the Courts.""",7,1617,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01617
2021-10-04-T-023,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Insofar as FICA is concerned and as it is drafted with the limited judicial review clause, what we are taking away is precisely what the Minister was warning about in 1989. Illegality, irrationality are not grounds for judicial review consideration in this Bill, only procedural impropriety. And I was listening very carefully to the other People's Action Party (PAP) Members who spoke and I compared the speeches of those Members with the PAP Members who spoke in 1989. The Minister was not the only one who was concerned about an appeals mechanism or other appeals mechanism and that there be appropriate checks and balances. There were a few other PAP Members.",8,1618,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01618
2021-10-04-T-023,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"I am not going to go through the entire debate, but I think the point is, the WP does not understand at the very base level, why it has to be limited judicial review in this case. I think Minister gave some reasons and the Minister referred to leaks – that there could be leaks in the system, when you go to Court. Sir, I do not mean to just facetiously give a counter response, but there could be leaks in the reviewing tribunal as well.",9,1619,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01619
2021-10-04-T-023,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"So, that question, I think if you ask me on balance, should a Court at least look into and review the decision of the Minister? Should judicial review be allowed to be captured in its entirety by a Court of Law? I think the answer is yes and that is a fundamental difference. Notwithstanding this, Minister makes the point about national security and so forth, which is why the Workers' Party Members have proposed potential in-camera hearings and files can be sealed after that as well.",10,1620,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01620
2021-10-04-T-023,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"My third clarification, Sir, is a bit more specific and this pertains to designated PSPs. I am not sure it is appropriate for me to direct this question at Minister because it would probably be more appropriately directed at the other office holders in MHA who spoke on the Bill and this is with regard to designated PSPs. I will give an example, a hypothetical.",11,1621,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01621
2021-10-04-T-023,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Let us assume there is a cause-based, a single cause-based NGO in Singapore. Their cause is, they are very aghast at the idea of foreign workers being transported at the back of hard-top lorries. This is their single cause, they are all Singapore members and they regularly write to their Members of Parliament and encourage their Members of Parliament to bring this issue up in Parliament. Let us assume this NGO receives foreign funding. It receives foreign funding from another International Organisation, whose main object is that they seek to ensure and uphold the human rights of foreign workers all over the world. They are prepared to extend funding to anyone.",12,1622,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01622
2021-10-04-T-023,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Now, one reading of FICA, by virtue of a clause 8(f) and (g) and even (e) perhaps, will suggest that, this Singapore NGO could be classified as a Politically Significant Entity (PSE). My question is, will such a PSE be barred at the first instance, at the baseline, from continuing to accept foreign funding. That means will the Competent Authority say, ""No, sorry, you cannot receive this funding."" Because, I know under stepped-up countermeasures, you can do that.",13,1623,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01623
2021-10-04-T-023,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"At the baseline, I believe it says you cannot accept impermissible donations. I believe the Bill in clause 55 tells you what a permissible donor is. Are we to read that in the opposite, as in everybody who is out of that range is an impermissible donor?",14,1624,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01624
2021-10-04-T-023,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Because this has knock-on implications for other arguments that the Government and other Members of Parliament have made.

2021-10-04-T-023,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"This, I hope explains Mr Gerald Giam's amendments for clause 8(f) and (g), as to how do we balance this exercise. Because if you compare clause 8(a) to (e), there is a very clear target – legislature, presidential counsels, trying to change the laws – but the last two limbs are far more broad and that also explains why the Workers' Party proposed additional oversight arrangements.",16,1626,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01626

2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"To me, the best example of how this operated in practice is when I saw how the Americans were struggling with it. They had an ideological commitment to due process. Everyone must be tried. Everyone must have a lawyer. Everyone must be given a full trial.",28,1654,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01654
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But then, they have these, I do not know, hundreds or a thousand plus terrorists whom they do not want to give a trial to. America was never under an existential threat as a result of 9/11; never like the threat that we faced. But when they did it, they said Guantanamo Bay is in Cuba, our rules and laws do not apply there, there is no due process, we lock them up and we throw away the keys.",29,1655,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01655
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"That is why I said, let us get out of this colonisation of our minds. Let us look at what works, what is fundamental. Checks and balances are important.

2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, yes, I am not embarrassed to say that I had certain views, straight out of law school the first four years. The only mistake is I should not have become a Member of Parliament when I was 29 years old. I should have waited a bit longer.",31,1657,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01657
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But I am not embarrassed to say those were my views and those views have changed because of the realities of life, not because I became a Minister but because over time, long before I became a Minister, I saw how laws are meant to operate and where the exceptions have to be made.",32,1658,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01658
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, as I sat with my officers and drafted this and with the AGC, yes, there were parts that I wished were different. But that threat we face, as I said, are people armed with bazookas and I described this legislation as a toy gun. Because Singapore believes in the law, so we put forward the law, we give ourselves legal powers, but in reality, the kind of threats we face, the kind of adversaries and the resources they have in terms of manpower are far greater than what we have.",33,1659,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01659
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, that, and our people have not even begun to realise what the problem is and the nature of the problem despite all the speeches and the conferences and the seminars and the Select Committee hearings.",34,1660,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01660

Will it therefore be required to cease the foreign funding at the onset of the designation? So, the short answer to the question is no. At the onset of designation, the PSE will only be required to declare the foreign donors and where the funding is coming from. Only when there are reasons and it meets certain conditions will it be required to step up the countermeasures, the further measures to require the NGOs to then beyond declaring, to have to cease the funding, only when certain conditions are met. I hope that answers the question.",1,1663,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01663

2021-10-04-T-023,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Minister, I have heard you carefully. On the first point about Second Minister Josephine Teo, I stick to my position that I do not believe it was a misreading. Minister has a different view. I think I can leave that at that.",2,1666,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01666
2021-10-04-T-023,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"The point about judicial review, again, that reflection of how one's views changes over time is not something that I take lightly. I think all of us go through such a catharsis in our lives as we build up a crucible of experience.",3,1667,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01667
2021-10-04-T-023,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"But I would like to ask whether the Ministry considered judicial review in the usual sense and not limited judicial review. Why was it that illegality and irrationality were deemed, that they ought not to play a part in this Bill. It is not the ISA. We are talking of a different sort of threat. Yes, it could be ""ISA-like"". I would concede that point. But we are only asking the Court to just look at the lawfulness of a decision. Nobody is asking the Court to substitute the Minister's decision. And this, I believe is an important matter because we cannot use the experience of having legislation with ouster clauses to justify new legislation with ouster clauses. So, I think each legislation must be unpacked to why judicial review has to be limited.",4,1668,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01668
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I will answer that shortly. The reason is, our assessment was that here, a lot of the evidence we will rely on would probably be based on highly sensitive information that comes from our partners; by definition, partners meaning from outside. They could be from a variety of different intelligence sources. As I said, I am not saying we have the human assets but a variety of different types of assets.",1,1669,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01669
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"And our view was this. While the actions we take are nowhere near as serious as the Internal Security Act, nevertheless, in some ways, the Internal Security Act is often focused on the people within and we will be able to have our own evidence that would be able to be used. Here, we would have to depend on other types of evidence, other sources, whether our sources or partner sources, and there is a great deal of requirement for secrecy and confidentiality and this should not go to the Court process at all.",2,1670,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01670
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But we all agree there needs to be a robust process for making sure that the process we set up can properly look at what the Minister has done. So, the direct answer to the question is we assess that that the kind of information we will be looking at and assessing on deciding would be much, much, much more confidential and secret.",3,1671,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01671
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"And really, in ordinary circumstances, it would be known to no more than one or two persons. And we have to rely on that kind of information, sometimes for this.",4,1672,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01672
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"But if there are suggestions on how we can make it more robust, because we want it to be robust. That is why we have a High Court Judge sitting there. As I said, even though it is not in the Bill, I have asked the Chief Justice for names. So, he will give us the names. The President will appoint. And if there are other suggestions to make it robust without affecting the secrecy and confidentiality, we will be very happy to consider.",5,1673,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01673

2021-10-04-T-023,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"Thank you, Speaker. And I thank the Minister for his extensive discussion about our questions. I have three clarification questions for the Minister. The first is to ask if in referring to the events of 2018-2019, whether he continues to believe that there was indeed malign foreign state influence in that case. And if I appreciate the point that he raised, that we should not outsource our national security to a private company. But by the same token, I am sure he will appreciate that the tools available to large and sophisticated Internet companies such as Facebook might indeed throw additional light on an issue.",1,1675,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01675
2021-10-04-T-023,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"So, for me, the question is, does this apparent disagreement not already raise caution about how the Competent Authority's suspicions may not always be correct? Or does the Minister believe that MHA will always retain its own Counsel on what he believes to be true.",2,1676,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01676
2021-10-04-T-023,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"My second clarification has to do with the standards of suspicion embedded in the Bill. Does this always refer to the term reasonable suspicion, a point that I believe Members of Zhulkarnain and Murali also mentioned.",3,1677,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01677
2021-10-04-T-023,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"I ask this because for starters, this was not codified specifically in this form in the Bill. Second, while we do have a long history of, as other Members have said, of using this term in case law, lest we forget the Bill as it stands, does exclude judicial review. So, any such precedent strikes me as a largely advisory and informative rather than binding.",4,1678,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01678
2021-10-04-T-023,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"And third, I think it is worth remembering that the types of actions typically afforded by reasonable suspicion tend to be much more limited than those associated with probable cause. And that is part of the reason why, for me at least, this hurdle remains a little too low for establishing offence.",5,1679,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01679
2021-10-04-T-023,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"And my last question has to do with whether the Minister continues to believe that there is a misunderstanding of the law by those who have raised reservations. I mention this because the reservations brought by scores of academics, activists, other lawyers who have all scrutinised the Bill and thought that the language was vague. So, for me, it seems like either the language is indeed vague as claimed and hence subject to misunderstanding. Or it is not vague, in which case, then these individuals should not be accused of misunderstanding.",6,1680,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01680
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Let me try and deal with those points. On the first point, do we believe that there was a foreign state involved response. We believe it to be so. So I think Assoc Prof Lim's real point is, ""Facebook says, there is no such thing. You say there is. Doesn't that throw into question your credibility of assessment?""",1,1681,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01681
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Let me try and give Mr Lim some examples, or at least one example. At many stages, Facebook has denied something only to come back and reverse itself. I am not saying, therefore, they do not really mean what they say when they have not seen any state attack. I also pointed out that Facebook is not the only medium. There are a variety of other medium, other than Facebook. And I do not know if they have considered a complete survey. We were watching all the different media that was used.",2,1682,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01682
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Now, in Sri Lanka, and I think this was 2017 or 2016, on Facebook, Sinhalese were calling to gather together to go and kill Muslims. The Minister for Communications in Sri Lanka called up Facebook to say, can you do something about this? This is a riot being organised on Facebook in order to kill other people. Facebook told him this does not affect our community standards. So, I do not know. Their definition of what is or is not a foreign hostile activity, may well be different from ours. So, if I organise a pogrom to go and kill people, that apparently does not breach Facebook's community standards. And Muslims were killed.",3,1683,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01683
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Does Assoc Prof Lim think that a responsible state authority should outsource the way it handles law and order to Facebook, whose primary concern is, how much money it can make with the best thrill in the world?",4,1684,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01684
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"When someone took Nancy Pelosi's speech and re-did it to make it look as if she was drunk and slurring, Facebook also felt that in the interests of free speech, that does not breach their community standards.",5,1685,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01685
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"When attacker in the New Zealand mosque was killing people and livestreaming his attack, Facebook said it did not breach its community standards and it felt that attack should continue to be livestreamed, until there was such a furore and uproar that they reversed course.

2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, I cannot comment exhaustively, nor can I take it at face value that if they say, so it must be so. Maybe they do not know what happened. But we noticed activity, we draw certain lines. We have intelligence experts. We have people and they have come to the conclusion that the sudden spike in activity on a variety of platforms, specifically targeted for specific messages to be absorbed by our Mandarin speaking population was a very clear indication. And I am not going to all the details.",7,1687,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01687

2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Another question by Assoc Prof Jamus Lim is, do I believe there is a misunderstanding by all those who have raised issues? Or is the language indeed vague. There are different points. I think in any debate, again, after long years of experience in Parliament, my view is on any debate, it broadly breaks out into some who are honest and they understand; a large group who do not follow very carefully and may have views which are not accurate.",9,1689,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01689
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,How many people read very closely? How many people look at Bills? How many people look at even the detailed newspaper reports?

2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"And then, there will be a small group which will go out to deliberately misinform and confuse the population. There will always be that group and I have indicated that some of that has been happening too.",12,1692,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01692
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Quite apart from that, on language, let me try and explain to Assoc Prof Lim one more time. It is going to be 10 o'clock but I will try again. I said in my Opening Speech, I think I said out of 10,000 people, you are trying to catch that one case. Even in that one case, the foreign agency will try and make it look like it is a normal case. So, the facade will be normal, everything will look normal. In fact, if they are worth anything, they will make it look very normal. So, you have to have definitions; just because it looks normal does not mean that you do not have the powers. How do you go behind that, how do you deal with it.",13,1693,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01693
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, that is why you say it is to foreigners' involvement affecting public interest. The way in which it is done, I have explained the framework. If the idea is hostile information campaign, foreign state agency, payments, covert activities, I think it is quite clear. But there are also situations where it is not so clear, and that is where you build in the proportionality test.",14,1694,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01694
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"And it seems to me quite a few of the commentators do not understand the proportionality test. That is why I made it a point to say AGC advised me; that test is there. When you do not understand the proportionality test, then you say, ""Oh dear, it says 'collaboration', so, any collaboration with a foreigner on a matter that is of importance to Singaporeans could potentially run afoul"", because you misunderstand the proportionality test.",15,1695,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01695
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Beyond that, there is a second vein. Again, there are people who fall into those who deliberately push this line but there are also a large number, genuine people, honest people, who are genuinely concerned.",16,1696,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01696
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I would not say a large number of people are concerned with this Bill. In fact, our assessment is that, by and large, a large number of people understand, a vast majority of Singaporeans understand the need for FICA. So, of the very small group who are concerned, a significant number you can put down as honest people who, either for impressionistic reasons or other reasons, may have had some misunderstanding and like the two Nominated Members of Parliament who spoke up, say, is there a possibility of abuse.",17,1697,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01697
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"And that lies behind some of the points that have been made outside. Yes, if you apply the law as you say it should be, and if you apply the proportionality test correctly, yes, then it will be done properly. But what if you abuse your power? And my answer to that, I gave an extended analysis this morning about how abuse can take place under any legislation. Your question is, do you give the power and what are the checks you put in. So, we have put in, we think, a strong check through the appointment of a High Court Judge with extensive powers. We have drafted this to deal with a very large threat which is clear and present here. It is not in the future. It has happened, it is happening all around us and it will happen to us. It is not for nothing that the French study Singapore and showed it as a test case or one of the case studies.",18,1698,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01698

2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I think Mr Perera said, ""Trust in institutions should be built up"". I think listening to Mr Perera over the years, his ideal state, if you take the UK or the US, they have all the things that he says we should have – Freedom of Information Act, they have all these other bodies, many things go to the courts, they do not have an Internal Security Act. Can anyone tell me why the trust in their Congress in the US, I think, is now down to, perhaps, a single digit or maybe low double digits?

Trust depends on whether you have the courage of your convictions, in the face of some opposition, to say this is the right way, this is the way I will explain and I will do it for the benefit of people.

One, basically, the question revolves around what the Leader of Opposition has also been asking. I do not think the Minister has given enough convincing arguments about what is the hurry, why FICA is needed and why the judicial review is not needed.",1,1704,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01704
2021-10-04-T-023,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"First of all, my first question, what is the hurry. The Minister has been saying for hours that three years of consultation has been done, they have done a lot of things and all that. But what we have heard here is that those things are about identifying what need to be done and what are the threats, what are the foreign interference threats and all that. But just now he mentioned something that, oh, he also consulted some Singaporeans. But at the end of the day, I think we can all agree that there is little consultation of the general public. And what the Minister was trying to say just now is that it seems to be – I mean that is how I interpret it – let us have the law first and then Singaporeans will understand the law, that the law is good for them and all that. That is not the way the law should be implemented. So, since there is not enough consultation of the general public, should the Minister not consider postponing the passage of the Bill? That is my first question.",2,1705,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01705
2021-10-04-T-023,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"The second question, is FICA effective in protecting us much more than all the resources and the laws we have before this? We already have them, they are all there. Can the Minister point out a few examples, do not quote all the foreign countries example, quote Asian countries example, examples of Asian countries that have suffered from foreign interference. Because as an ordinary citizen watching the TV and all that, all the foreign interferences in Taiwan and Australia, for example, seem to be a joke. It was just a theatre of actions and all that but in the end, all the foreign interference seems to be unravelled. So, I ask the Minister to quote us some examples and educate us.",3,1706,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01706
2021-10-04-T-023,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"The third question is, we spend a lot of time talking about judicial review. What the Minister seems to be saying is ""Trust me, trust me"". I ask two questions with regard to that. The Tribunal is appointed by the Minister, right, under this FICA? Two, if judicial review can be done in other country, even with respect to national security issues, why can we not do it?",4,1707,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01707
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Well, Sir, I will answer to the extent that I understand the questions. On the first point, what is the hurry? I assume now, Mr Leong, we are talking about the same legislation because the legislation you talked about just now seemed to be a very different one.

2021-10-04-T-023,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Okay, what I have said is according to the legal advice that my Party had gotten from senior lawyers. So, you say those are not accurate, they are not right. Then, that is exactly what we have been saying or I have been saying in this Parliament. The discussion and the debate in this Parliament actually should not be conducted in a way that is just interpretation by you. Let us have a Committee, let the experts trash it out and then bring it to this main Chamber. We might as well call this legislative Chamber, legal Chamber. The legal experts who are advising me disagree with you.",1,1711,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01711
2021-10-04-T-023,Speaker,Mr Speaker,If I can request both Members to direct your comments through me.,1,1712,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01712
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Yes, I am sorry, Sir. Sir, can I ask through you for Mr Leong to show me which clause allows for detention without trial in FICA, please, as he suggested? Detention without trial, trial in absence and no judicial review for such detention. Since his senior lawyers have advised it, he should be able to tell me which clause.",1,1713,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01713
2021-10-04-T-023,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Leong.,1,1714,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01714
2021-10-04-T-023,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, there the Minister goes again. I am not going to go into all these legal interpretation. If we want to argue, we argue out of this. But most of the things that I have said is in section 99, and I did not say detention without trial. I say he can arrest you, of course, through due process, but after he arrests you, you are not bailable and all that, those are provided in section 99. But, anyway, I am not going down that line. Minister, let us go on with the other questions.",1,1715,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01715
2021-10-04-T-023,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Minister.,1,1716,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01716
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sir, I was listening very carefully when Mr Leong spoke and my blood pressure went up quite significantly when he said detention without trial. That phrase is there, I am sure it is captured in the Hansard. Detention without trial, trial in absentia and no judicial review. So, I just order and the person is arrested and detained, and he has got no rights of review.",1,1717,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01717
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"And now, Mr Leong says clause 99. He reads English, I read English, I can tell him that neither clause 99 nor any other clause in the Bill has detention without trial. Not just that, he says ""There he goes again"". When Mr Leong refers to provisions in FICA, I asked him which provisions. When Mr Leong says you can detain without trial, he says it, I asked him which clauses.",2,1718,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01718
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, we will take it that his position is that clause 99 allows the Minister to detain without trial. I can assure the House, he is reading something which I do not know anything about.",3,1719,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01719
2021-10-04-T-023,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Mr Leong, would you like to respond to that?",1,1720,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01720
2021-10-04-T-023,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,I have no response.,1,1721,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01721

2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Thank you, Sir. Sir, I do not want words put in my mouth. I did not say there was little consultation with Singaporeans nor did I say let us have the law first and then, go and explain to Singaporeans. I think I said a number of things in context and I would ask Mr Leong not to misquote me. I did not say it in those terms nor did I mean it in those terms.",1,1723,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01723
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The second the question is, is FICA effective in protecting us, given all the other resources that the Government has at its disposal? And Mr Leong says give us examples of Asian countries which have suffered such an attack. Sir, again, I am not usually at a loss for words. But is the suggestion that somehow because we are Asian, Asian countries will not be affected by foreign interference?",2,1724,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01724
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Is that the suggestion? I will suggest Mr Leong reads the French report and that he reads the Select Committee report. And I can tell him in the annexes we gave out this afternoon, while the names are not there, some of those countries are Asian.",3,1725,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01725
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"It is absolutely shocking to hear that the suggestion of foreign interference in Taiwan and Australia are jokes. I think, in the case of Taiwan, of course, it is a territory, or it is said to be a territory; in the case of Australia, it is a country. Those places will be very surprised that someone in Singapore thinks the attacks on them, for which Australia has passed legislation, very draconian legislation on reporting requirements. I said this afternoon, you are an ex-parliamentarian, your obligations are very onerous.",4,1726,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01726
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I think no one who knows the facts will say what Mr Leong has said, that it is a joke that these places have suffered foreign interference.",5,1727,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01727
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Whether they have suffered it from the countries they have named, we do not express a view because it is not our business to go and say they were attacked by X or Y or Z. But all the evidence that was laid out this afternoon – I talked about an Australian parliamentarian who was said to have been suborned by foreign money and making a statement on South China Sea that is contrary to his own party's position – what do you call that?",6,1728,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01728
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"When we say that Singapore itself has been subject to foreign interference recently, are you saying that what we are saying is untrue?",7,1729,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01729
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"There are reports that the Indian electric infrastructure was brought down as a result of an attack from outside of India. There are reports of foreign inspired attacks in a number of Asian countries, which I think you can see both in the Select Committee report and if you read the newspapers.",8,1730,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01730
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The third point he makes is, well, the Judge is appointed by the Minister and basically the approach is, trust me.",9,1731,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01731
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"No. The Tribunal is appointed by the President, on the advice of the Cabinet. It is headed by a High Court Judge, who has security of tenure, and he is a Judge of the Supreme Court. He does not owe any obligation to the Government.",10,1732,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01732
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Leong asks why is it possible that other countries can have judicial review and we cannot. Well, I gave an answer. It is a question of what those countries can do and if you look at New Zealand, they have not had to face very severe threats. For the first time now, they are facing different types of threats. In the absence of an Internal Security Act, they have to allow this man to be free for years outside and one day, he goes into a supermarket and knifes people. Do you want to wait for that?",11,1733,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01733
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"If you take France, I said 80% of the attackers were known to the security forces. Ninety-seven percent were on their radar. How many people have been killed? I said there were 22 incidents, including the Charlie Hebdo incident. Scores of people have been killed. The entire country brought to a standstill. Paralysed with fear.",12,1734,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01734
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"These are choices. There are trade-offs. So, I explained the trade-offs we make.",13,1735,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01735

2021-10-04-T-023,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Sir, I would like to clarify further with the Minister. One is that the appointment of the tribunal is recommended by the Cabinet, right, t o the President? In that case, does the President have the power to reject the appointment? First question.",1,1737,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01737
2021-10-04-T-023,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Second question is, just now I asked for some examples of Asian countries that are affected by foreign interference. I am looking for examples where there are more permanent damage, like really affected a national election and things like that. But what the Minister has pointed is this one senator being found with connections with a country.",2,1738,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01738
2021-10-04-T-023,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Those things in the normal course of our security operation, we can identify already. Do we need an extra law?",3,1739,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01739
2021-10-04-T-023,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"Secondly, is that Minister talked about the Indian electric infrastructure and all that? Similarly, our healthcare system data was compromised some years ago. Is FICA needed before we can prevent all these things? Or even with FICA, are we going to be able to prevent these kind of events? Minister, please.",4,1740,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01740
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sir, I do not intend to keep repeating my opening speech. I think Mr Leong has got to, I would suggest he goes and listen again or reads and the answers are all there. And it is not just one senator. I suggest he read some material that has been given.

2021-10-04-T-023,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Leong. I called Mr Leon Perera. Kindly sit down.,1,1748,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01748

2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Four supplementary questions. The first two are actually related to my speech and I do not think the Minister answered them, that is, unless I missed them. The first one is the subject of a Part 3 Direction or POL declaration can apply within a 30-day timeframe to the Minister for an appeal for reconsideration. But does the Minister have a timeframe within which he must respond on that; so, would the Minister commit to that?",1,1755,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01755
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"The second question is relating to clause 93, those who are designated as PSPs or PSEs issued directives on the Parts 5 and 6 may only appeal against that decision to the Minister. They have no right to appeal to the Tribunal, I believe, unlike those who are issued Part 3 Directions. So, what is the basis for that?",2,1756,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01756
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"The third question is in relation to what the Minister mentioned about my speech and speeches that I have made over the years. He talked about the trust deficit in countries like the UK and the US which have things like ombudsman and Freedom of Information Act, and so on and so forth. I would like to ask the Minister, would he agree that perhaps the trust deficit in the UK, the US and other countries which have those kinds of institutions that he is referring to may not be because of those institutions. It could be for other factors. And would he not agree that maybe if we took some of the kind of laws that we have in Singapore and applied it to those countries, it may not necessarily increase trust in those countries? And would he not agree that perhaps in Singapore, if we put in place laws a little bit more balanced, along the lines that we have argued today in Parliament, that might possibly increase the trust levels that we have here, even though those trust levels, you think are high. So, that is sort of the third question.",3,1757,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01757
2021-10-04-T-023,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"The fourth question and the last one, is on the part of my speech where I talked about who checks the checkers. I think it is a big subject. Essentially, I asked what recourse does a concerned citizen have in Singapore if they feel that very senior officials – Prime Minister, Minister of Home Affairs himself – has been suborned by a foreign power? What is their channel to redress that, to have that addressed? As far as I could discern, the Minister responded by saying that the form of redress would be the same as it is in other countries, which is through other people. So, actually, I would like to put this back to the Minister and say that in the spirit of coming to Parliament, not with rhetoric, but with concrete and practical solutions, could you expand on really what is the redress in that kind of scenario, very practically speaking?",4,1758,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01758
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"First, on the first four questions. On the first question, 30 days and whether there will be a time limit. It is difficult to commit to a time limit for the Minister to respond, simply because it depends on the facts and the kind of evidence that needs to be assessed. But what we can commit to is that it will be done as expeditiously as possible. On the stepped-up measures, I explained it in my speech, I responded.",1,1759,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01759
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"On the trust levels, I think finally we are beginning to get to some sort of narrowing of the gap. So, let us agree, you have all these institutions, Freedom of Information and the kind of media that they have and the ombudsman, does not automatically mean trust levels go up. In fact, trust levels have been declining. It may be because of other problems. And I think there is a kernel of accuracy in what Mr Perera said. And the kernel that I extract is this  each country has got to look at its own situation and decide what works for it.",2,1760,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01760
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"A country like China with 5,000 years and a single race – different considerations. A country like the US – different considerations. A country like Singapore with 700 square kilometres – different consideration. I think if we can agree on that and that therefore, we need to factor in what works for us, then the next question is, why have trust levels been so high in Singapore? They are very high. Why have they been high? There is a trust based on performance. There is a trust based on probity. There is a trust based on how leaders behave. There is a trust based on how powers are exercised.",3,1761,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01761
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, anytime there is abuse, there is corruption, there is lack of probity, there is a performance deficit, trust will dissipate. I believe in Singapore, it will dissipate very quickly because we are such a small place, everyone understands everything pretty much in broad terms.",4,1762,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01762
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Whether bringing in some of these institutions will add to trust is a conversation we can have as long as it is not a priori argument  if you have it, trust will increase. That is just not true. You have to ask, is it really going to? Why? Why do you say that? Or is it actually going to affect the performance of the Government in such a way that actually trust will go down?",5,1763,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01763
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Finally, who checks the checkers. I think Mr Perera must be aware the CPIB can investigate anyone including the Prime Minister. When the CPIB wants to investigate the Prime Minister, there is a higher authority they report to, independently. The CPIB can investigate me and any Minister. And the man who was considered – or Mr Lee Kuan Yew had publicly said, ""Where will I get another Teh Cheang Wan?"" because he solved the housing crisis.",6,1764,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01764
2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"If you were to consider one of the inner core of Ministers, Mr Teh Cheang Wan would have been in the inner core of Ministers. Powerful, heavyweight Minister. What happened when there were allegations? Mr Lee Kuan Yew told him, when Mr Teh wanted to see him, ""I am not speaking with you. Let the CPIB investigate."" That is Singapore. That is why our trust levels are high. [Applause.]",7,1765,2021-10-04-T-023-S-01765

2021-10-04-T-023,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The point I made is that the High Court Judge who will head the tribunal is independent, has security of tenure, is someone whose job is in the Supreme Court.

The second, is to develop a community support network of trained staff and volunteers. They can be our first point of contact to attend distress calls and walk in consultations.

Under the Blueprint, we began developing community capability, a key shift that entailed moving from an acute-centric institutionalised model to a community-based model. While acute care remains an important component of the system, only the acutely ill, disturbed or those with high risk of harm to self or others need to be hospitalised. For those whose conditions have stabilised, they should be discharged and allowed to recover and reintegrate back into the community.",5,2147,2021-10-04-T-025-S-02147

Through establishing more community-based services, we hope to facilitate greater acceptance of treatment, lower the stigma of mental illness and increase community outreach for early identification of mental health needs. In 2017, we have committed a further $160 million to enhance and expand community mental health services over the next five years. These national mental health plans have expanded the community touch-points to promptly identify and assess at-risk persons with mental health needs and link them to relevant services.

HDB will be increasing the supply of PPHS flats starting from this year and over the next two years. HDB has also finetuned the PPHS eligibility conditions and allocation process to prioritise families in greater need of subsidised temporary housing.",2,2202,2021-10-04-T-033-S-02202

Agencies typically consider candidates from within the ranks of their organisations, the wider Public Service including the Uniformed Services, and where relevant, the private sector. When it comes to former Uniformed Services officers, agencies would take a considered view of the officer’s career experience and competencies/qualities, together with other available candidates, before deciding on the best person for the senior role.",2,2260,2021-10-04-T-045-S-02260
2021-10-04-T-045,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister),"Candidates from the SAF, or the Uniformed Services in general, including the Home Team, would have served in roles that have developed in them a range of competencies, such as strategic leadership, organisation transformation, policy formulation, running of large-scale operations, and technology management, that are generally relevant to senior management positions in the Public Service. They also have valuable experience in working with, understanding, motivating, and winning the confidence of Full-time and Operationally Ready National Servicemen who are Singaporeans from all walks of life. Officers who demonstrate the capacity to assume top leadership positions are tested and prepared through challenging postings and leadership programmes. In addition, these officers are provided opportunities to develop Whole-of-Government perspectives through inter-agency projects, board directorships and external postings to the Public Service during their military careers. These experiences prepare the officers to assume senior appointments in the military, and also provide them with the background and perspective to take on senior leadership positions in the wider Public Service, if called upon and found suitable.",3,2261,2021-10-04-T-045-S-02261

In the first half of 2021 alone, 68 cases were reported to the SPF and the Singapore Computer Emergency Response Team (SingCERT). It is likely that there were more cases that were not reported. This trend mirrors the rise of the ransomware threat globally, with increasing use of digital devices and growing sophistication of cyber criminals.",2,2265,2021-10-04-T-046-S-02265
2021-10-04-T-046,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"If you fall victim to a ransomware attack, the Government does not recommend the payment of ransoms. These attackers are criminals, and the payment of ransom does not guarantee that the victim will be able to restore its systems, or that the data will be decrypted as promised; or that the data that was stolen will not be published eventually. The payment of ransom also encourages these cyber criminals to continue their malicious activities and target more victims. Cyber criminals may view organisations that have paid up as a soft target, and attack them again.

2021-10-04-T-046,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"However, attackers are always looking out for weak points to exploit, and businesses need to be prepared so that they can recover from an attack and restore businesses operations with minimal delay. Businesses should identify their business-critical assets and functions, and ensure that they perform back-ups of critical data and operating systems regularly. Importantly, these back-ups should be kept offline to allow rapid restoration of systems. Businesses should also practice their incident response and business continuity plans to ensure that employees know the required responses to any form of cyberattack. This is similar to running fire drills. More details on these measures are available on SingCERT’s website.",5,2268,2021-10-04-T-046-S-02268

The recent Colonial Pipeline incident in the US is an example of a ransomware attack that has spillover effects into the physical world, and can cause significant disruptions to our daily lives. It is important for enterprises to put in place measures to safeguard their systems and networks to minimise the risk of falling prey to ransomware attacks, and also be able to recover quickly should they suffer a ransomware attack. This is why the Government is developing information resources to empower businesses to better protect their systems and networks. But we cannot do this alone.

These sessions cover our core national interests and how Singapore conducts foreign policy as a small city state in Southeast Asia.

Each FPDA exercise can involve up to 4000 troops, 18 ships, 50 to 60 aircraft, and even submarines, but our ASEAN neighbours accept this, as the grouping is not aimed at any one country but, as intended in its origin, to act as a security umbrella for the peace and stability of Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore.

2021-10-04-T-068,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"There are three aspects to the recent developments in China’s property sector that are relevant to Singapore. First, the exposure of Singapore’s financial system to China Evergrande Group and China’s property sector. Second, the exposure of Singapore’s property developers to China. And third, the exposure of Singapore’s economy to a possible growth slowdown in China.",4,2369,2021-10-04-T-068-S-02369

2021-10-04-T-068,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Exposures to Singapore property developers with operations in China are a further 2.5% of loans to non-bank customers.

2021-10-04-T-068,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Third, while the Chinese authorities have thus far maintained stability in their financial system, the slowdown in China’s real estate sector could dampen its GDP growth. It is difficult to estimate how significant this will be, and hence how adverse its impact will be on regional economic growth. MAS and MTI are keeping a close watch on any indirect or spillover effects on the Singapore economy arising from developments in China.",10,2375,2021-10-04-T-068-S-02375

Following the return of our contingents from the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics, we have already commenced our review, which takes into account not only the performance of the athletes, but also the operating environment and challenges in the run-up to the Tokyo Olympics and during the Games. This allows us to analyse performance systemically, and to consider this against the backdrop of our national High Performance Sports (HPS) system and strategies. An important priority is to enable our national athletes to train and compete uninterrupted amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic situation, to ensure that preparations for upcoming international competitions and Major Games are not affected.

Town Councils can also tap on funding under the HCTIP to install better fittings and technology for easier cleaning and maintenance of the toilets at hawker centres.

The AfA will be piloting their recommendations over the next few months. An example is the setting up of Digital Support for Hawkers (DSH) groups to support and strengthen the digital presence of hawker centres. In addition, the AfA will pilot a 'Common Acquirer' model for food delivery at 14 hawker centres, which will allow hawkers easier access to customers of all participating online ordering platforms, along with an integrated interface to receive and manage orders.",4,2412,2021-10-04-T-073-S-02412

Since its inception in 2010, the YRCP has grown from 74 volunteers, to over 1,100 volunteers, and reached out to more than 16,000 families. There are several YRCP initiatives. One of these is the annual distribution of “Booster Packs” containing grocery vouchers to needy families. Bookstore vouchers are also given to school-going children aged 6 to 12. This outreach has benefitted over 2,000 families.",4,2431,2021-10-04-T-077-S-02431

The Government, in consultation with the Association of Catering Professionals Singapore (ACAPS), thus developed a set of safe management measures under which staff-served food lines have been allowed to resume at F&B premises and events. This form of catering is less risky than self-service food lines and allows catering companies to resume catering in a form that is closer to their traditional business format. We are continually reviewing our safe management measures and will review the resumption of self-service food lines at a suitable time, with the necessary safeguards in place, as we transition towards living with COVID-19.",2,2460,2021-10-04-T-082-S-02460

2021-10-04-T-093,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Government has implemented various schemes to protect lives and livelihoods during this COVID-19 pandemic, through supporting businesses and households. Recognising that both tenants and landlords have been affected by the pandemic, our approach has been to strike a balance between the needs of the two groups through the design of our support schemes. As first announced during the Ministerial Statement in Parliament on 26 July 2021, the Government will require landlords to provide two weeks’ waiver of gross rent to eligible tenants, to help tenants cope with the impact of the period of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) from 22 July to 18 August.",1,2498,2021-10-04-T-093-S-02498

2021-10-04-T-093,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Provisions are also in place to take into account the difficulties of landlords who rely mainly on rental income for their livelihood and face genuine difficulties in sharing the burden with their tenants. Landlords can apply for relief, to be assessed by an independent Rental Waiver Assessor based on specific factors in each case. If landlords meet the criteria, the Assessors can exempt them from providing rental waiver.",3,2500,2021-10-04-T-093-S-02500

This initiative involves schools, community agencies and other partners sharing information to facilitate the early identification of risks and needs and coordinating timely and holistic support for these children or youth and their families. Thus far, the pilot has supported over 120 students and their families. The LCN pilot complements the comprehensive system in schools to support students.

Post-care officers also collaborate with key stakeholders, families and volunteers to monitor the youths’ progress and ensure they remain meaningfully engaged (e.g. in school, training, or employment).

2021-10-04-T-103,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The well-being of our frontline workers, who are crucial in our fight against COVID-19, is an important priority for the Government and our tripartite partners. At the workplace, transport operators and public healthcare institutions (PHIs) support workers through initiatives such as the formation of driver relations team among taxi and private hire car (PHC) operators, as well as implementation of peer support programmes for healthcare workers, respectively. Within these groups, frontline workers are able to voice out mental health concerns and seek support to cope with stress. Supervisors in both the healthcare and transport settings also closely monitor the wellbeing of frontline workers. Where necessary, workers may be referred for counselling services if they require further support.",1,2552,2021-10-04-T-103-S-02552

For example, HPB collaborated with transport operators and unions to organise mental well-being workshops for over 4,000 transport workers and leaders. Similarly, the PHIs have rolled out stress management training, to help staff cope with stressful situations. Frontline workers can also tap on mental health resources such as Mindline.sg, as well as national and community-based hotlines which are available to the broader public, if they require further support and assistance.",2,2553,2021-10-04-T-103-S-02553
