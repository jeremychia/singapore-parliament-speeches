2021-10-04-T-001-S-00001,2021-10-04-T-001,1,Speaker,Presentation of Petition. The Non-Constituency Member Mr Leong Mun Wai wishes to present a Petition. Mr Leong.
2021-10-04-T-001-S-00002,2021-10-04-T-001,2,Leong Mun Wai,"Speaker, Sir, I present to this Parliament a Petition from Mr Howe Wen Khong Rocky, Mr Xu Yuan Chen and other of like opinion. Including the two petitioners named above, there were a total of eight valid signatures."
2021-10-04-T-001-S-00003,2021-10-04-T-001,3,Leong Mun Wai,The petitioners allege that the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill contains extremely broad definitions that serve as a catch-all for a wide range of legitimate activities. They are concerned that the Bill proposes vast powers for the Minister for Home Affairs to issue directives to censure online content and criminalise the financing of online media platforms.
2021-10-04-T-001-S-00004,2021-10-04-T-001,4,Leong Mun Wai,"Further, the Bill allows the designation of Politically Sensitive Persons, which, once designated, would require adherence to a range of onerous reporting obligations and affect their right of free association. Yet, the avenues of appeal pertaining to powers within the Bill are limited and judicial review in open Court restricted to only procedural matters."
2021-10-04-T-001-S-00005,2021-10-04-T-001,5,Leong Mun Wai,"If enacted, the law will have serious ramifications for multiple stakeholders and large sections of society, including academia, business, civil society and the media."
2021-10-04-T-001-S-00006,2021-10-04-T-001,6,Leong Mun Wai,"Singaporeans have an interest in a law that is more resistant to the potential for misinterpretation, misapplication, or even abused, in future."
2021-10-04-T-001-S-00007,2021-10-04-T-001,7,Leong Mun Wai,"The petitioners ask for a delay in the passage of the Bill into law, pending greater and more extensive public consultation, and the referral of the Bill to a Select Committee to consult and deliberate on the appropriateness and necessity of the measures included."
2021-10-04-T-001-S-00008,2021-10-04-T-001,8,Leong Mun Wai,"Apart from the eight signatories, the online petition with the same demands has garnered signatures from 39 civil organisations and 7,419 individuals as of 10.30 am, this morning."
2021-10-04-T-001-S-00009,2021-10-04-T-001,9,Leong Mun Wai,The petitioners pray that the hon Members of this Parliament take steps to
2021-10-04-T-001-S-00010,2021-10-04-T-001,10,Leong Mun Wai,"(a) delay passage of the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill into law, pending greater and more extensive public consultation on the implementation, effects and implications of the Bill for the general public; and"
2021-10-04-T-001-S-00011,2021-10-04-T-001,11,Leong Mun Wai,"(b) refer this Bill to a Select Committee for further consultation and deliberation on the appropriateness and the necessity of the measures contained within the Bill, with adequate representation from a variety of stakeholders."""
2021-10-04-T-001-S-00012,2021-10-04-T-001,12,Leong Mun Wai,"Sir, the Petition has been handed to the Clerk at the Table. [Please refer to Annex 1.] Thank you."
2021-10-04-T-001-S-00013,2021-10-04-T-001,13,Leong Mun Wai,[(proc text) Petition handed to the Clerk at the Table. (proc text)]
2021-10-04-T-001-S-00014,2021-10-04-T-001,14,Speaker,Leader of the Opposition.
2021-10-04-T-001-S-00015,2021-10-04-T-001,15,Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I support, and the Workers' Party supports, the call to allow the Public Petitions Committee to review the Petition. Thank you."
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00016,2021-10-04-T-002,16,Speaker,Deputy Leader.
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00017,2021-10-04-T-002,17,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Speaker, the Non-Constituency Member Mr Leong Mun Wai has just presented to this House a  Petition on seeking further consultation and scrutiny of the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill, under Standing Order 18(6"
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00018,2021-10-04-T-002,18,Zaqy Mohamad,"While the hon Member has given a brief statement on the material allegations and prayers of the petitioners, I think it would be helpful if the terms and contents of the Petition could be made available to Members. May I ask that copies of the Petition be distributed to Members now."
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00019,2021-10-04-T-002,19,Speaker,"Yes, please. ["
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00020,2021-10-04-T-002,20,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Speaker, this Petition  relates to the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill, the Second Reading of which has been set down for Second Reading on the Order Paper today."
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00021,2021-10-04-T-002,21,Zaqy Mohamad,"In substance, the Petition makes several substantive criticisms about the Bill. Consequently, it calls for the Parliamentary passage of the Bill to be slowed down, in particular, by sending the Bill to a Select Committee for further consideration of the matters alleged."
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00022,2021-10-04-T-002,22,Zaqy Mohamad,"This being the case, I wish to seek your permission to move a Motion under Standing Order 18(6) proviso for the Petition to be considered during and together with the Second Reading of the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill."
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00023,2021-10-04-T-002,23,Zaqy Mohamad,"Standing Order 18(6) provides two alternative procedures for a public petition to be dealt with  one, it can be referred to the Public Petitions Committee without any debate; two, when the petition relates to a Bill which is considered before Parliament, as is the case here, it can be considered by Parliament together with the Bill."
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00024,2021-10-04-T-002,24,Zaqy Mohamad,"In this case, it would make more sense for the Petition to be considered by this House together with the Bill, rather than be referred to the Public Petitions Committee."
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00025,2021-10-04-T-002,25,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the reasons are as follows."
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00026,2021-10-04-T-002,26,Zaqy Mohamad,"First, if the Petition is referred to the Public Petitions Committee rather than be considered by the House today, the Petition could effectively be rendered nugatory. This is because, so far as the Parliamentary passage of the Bill is concerned, the Second Reading debate is already fixed for today. The Petition cannot affect the order of the business that is already set down for today's proceedings. Therefore, by the time it goes to the Public Petitions Committee for consideration and the Committee makes its recommendations to Parliament, today's Second Reading would have been completed and the issue of the Bill will no longer be before this House. By enabling the Petition to be considered by Parliament during the debate on the Second Reading of the Bill, this Motion will facilitate and not avoid debate on matters raised in the Petition."
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00027,2021-10-04-T-002,27,Zaqy Mohamad,"Secondly, Mr Speaker, the matters in the Petition are going to be addressed in the debate of the Second Reading of the Bill in any event. I say this because insofar as the substantive allegations are concerned, I note there appears to be substantial overlap between the points raised in the Petition and those raised by the Workers' Party in the Notice of Amendments to the Bill set out in the Order Paper Supplement. This means that those substantive points are going to be raised and debated during today's proceedings."
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00028,2021-10-04-T-002,28,Zaqy Mohamad,"Sir, if this Motion is moved and agreed to, Members will be able to fully debate the issues in the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill and the Petition together."
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00029,2021-10-04-T-002,29,Zaqy Mohamad,"Hence, I seek your consent to move this Motion."
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00030,2021-10-04-T-002,30,Speaker,I give my consent. Please move the Motion.
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00031,2021-10-04-T-002,31,Zaqy Mohamad,"Mr Speaker, I beg to move, ""That the Petition on ‘Seeking Further Consultation and Scrutiny of the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill’ presented by the Non-Constituency Member be referred to Parliament for consideration at the Second Reading of the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill."""
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00032,2021-10-04-T-002,32,Speaker,"The question is as moved by the Deputy Leader of the House. As many as are of that opinion say ""Aye""."

2021-10-04-T-002-S-00034,2021-10-04-T-002,34,Speaker,"To the contrary say ""No"". Leader of the Opposition."
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00035,2021-10-04-T-002,35,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, I wish to speak on the Motion."
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00036,2021-10-04-T-002,36,Speaker,"Please do. Oh, Leader of the Opposition, there will be no debate on this. You can speak at the Second Reading."
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00037,2021-10-04-T-002,37,Pritam Singh,So be it.
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00038,2021-10-04-T-002,38,Pritam Singh,"[(proc text) Question again put, and agreed to. (proc text)]"
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00039,2021-10-04-T-002,39,Pritam Singh,"[(proc text) Resolved, ""That the Petition on ‘Seeking Further Consultation and Scrutiny of the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill’ presented by the Non-Constituency Member be referred to Parliament for consideration at the Second Reading of the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill."" – [Mr Zaqy Mohamad] (proc text)]"
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00040,2021-10-04-T-002,40,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, I beg your pardon. I apologise. With regard to the Motion, I would wish that Workers' Party (WP) Members have their dissent recorded."
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00041,2021-10-04-T-002,41,Speaker,We will. Thank you. If I can ask all the Members who are dissenting to stand so that we can record it.

(proc text)]"
2021-10-04-T-002-S-00043,2021-10-04-T-002,43,Speaker,"Thank you. Ms Jessica Tan, Questions for Oral Answer."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00044,2021-10-04-T-003,44,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"asked the Minister for Health (a) with the increasing number of COVID-19 cases, whether the current measures are effective in ensuring that Singapore is prepared for COVID-19 to be treated as “endemic”; (b) whether the healthcare system has adequate capacity; and (c) whether new measures are required."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00045,2021-10-04-T-003,45,Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Health as Singapore opens up and moves towards an endemic management model for COVID-19 (a) whether the reporting of COVID-19 cases and the KPIs related to the managing of COVID-19 cases will shift towards availability of COVID-19 management facilities in relation to the number of infections nationally; (b) if so, when will it take place; and (c) what are the plans to effectively communicate this shift to the public."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00046,2021-10-04-T-003,46,Sylvia Lim,asked the Minister for Health whether the Government is reviewing the manner of implementation of COVID-19 Quarantine Orders and Stay-Home Notices so as to improve communication with affected households while safeguarding public health.
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00047,2021-10-04-T-003,47,Wan Rizal,asked the Minister for Health regarding the Home Recovery scheme (a) what is the efficacy of the Home Recovery scheme; (b) how many persons have completed the Home Recovery scheme without affecting other family members; (c) what is the average response time for someone who has received a Quarantine Order; (d) whether the current manpower to support the scheme is sufficient; and (e) whether the disbursement of antigen rapid test kits has been timely and sufficient for families under the scheme.
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00048,2021-10-04-T-003,48,Ng Ling Ling,"asked the Minister for Health with regard to Home Recovery being the default care management model for eligible COVID-19 patients from 15 September 2021 (a) what is the number of Persons under Quarantine (PUQ) who are COVID-19 positive and are under Home Recovery; (b) of these, how many are subsequently found to be ineligible for Home Recovery; and (c) how long is the waiting time for them to be sent to a hospital or dedicated care facilities."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00049,2021-10-04-T-003,49,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for Health in what circumstances can COVID-19 patients request the Ministry to have their recovery in community care facilities or hospitals after a positive diagnosis, instead of a quarantine at home."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00050,2021-10-04-T-003,50,Xie Yao Quan,"asked the Minister for Health (a) how are the younger and fully vaccinated COVID-19 patients being triaged for other home recovery criteria, such as having no severe co-morbidities or vulnerable household members; (b) whether such triaging typically occurs within 24 hours of confirmation of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results; and (c) in the longer run, what is the target time to pick these patients up for conveyance to a government facility from the time they are deemed unsuitable for home recovery."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00051,2021-10-04-T-003,51,Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Health (a) when will the Ministry decide on using viral vector or other combinations of vaccines for the third COVID-19 vaccine booster jab; (b) how will this decision impact the booster jab programme for seniors; (c) whether the definition of ""fully vaccinated"" will be changed to differentiate those who have taken the third booster jab; and (d) if so, how will this be reflected in the TraceTogether app."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00052,2021-10-04-T-003,52,He Ting Ru,"asked the Minister for Health in relation to the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme (VIFAP) (a) whether the findings of the independent VIFAP Clinical Panel can be released to applicants and, if not, whether this can be done; (b) what avenues are available to applicants to appeal against decisions to reject claims made under the VIFAP; and (c) what are some of the most common grounds for rejecting applications."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00053,2021-10-04-T-003,53,Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Speaker, Sir, may I request that I answer questions for oral answers 1-9 and questions for written answers 32-36 together. Thereafter, Senior Minister of State Dr Janil Puthucheary will answer questions for oral answers 10-20 and questions for written answers 27-30. And both of us will then take supplementary questions together after our respective answers, please?"
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00054,2021-10-04-T-003,54,Speaker,Please proceed.
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00055,2021-10-04-T-003,55,Ong Ye Kung,"Thank you. Mr Speaker, Sir, the recent move to quickly tighten safe management measures was a difficult but necessary decision. We are committed to our plans to opening up and transit to a COVID-19 resilient nation. Hence, lockdowns like circuit breakers are no longer an option. Many workers, families, students and businesses are going to suffer for it, and it will affect our ability to earn ourselves a living in the long term."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00056,2021-10-04-T-003,56,Ong Ye Kung,"With the great majority of our population – over 83% – fully vaccinated, we are one of the most highly vaccinated countries in the world. As a result, during this wave of infections, over 98% of infected individuals experienced mild or no symptoms, 1.7% required oxygen supplementation in hospitals typically for a few days, 0.2% required ICU care and unfortunately, 0.1% passed away."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00057,2021-10-04-T-003,57,Ong Ye Kung,"Although only a small percentage of infected individuals require hospital or ICU care, we also admit many more others for observation, because they are at risk of developing serious illnesses. So, when infection number rises, all these translate to a larger number of hospital patients, which put considerable strain on our hospitals and our healthcare workers."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00058,2021-10-04-T-003,58,Ong Ye Kung,"Hence, even as we continue our journey to transit to a COVID-19 resilient nation, we should also have a care for our hospitals and healthcare workers, and ""tap on the brakes"" to slow down the rate of transmission. This is why we had to implement the measures under the Stabilisation Phase last week."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00059,2021-10-04-T-003,59,Ong Ye Kung,"Unfortunately, in this rapidly changing and evolving situation, we have to stay agile, adapt and respond quickly. We will try to give as early a notice as possible to businesses, but there is a practical limit to that, and we seek your understanding."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00060,2021-10-04-T-003,60,Ong Ye Kung,"On the Home Recovery Programme (HRP), this is an important part of our response, given that the vast majority of infected individuals has mild or no symptoms. These individuals do not need special medical care and can therefore recover safely at home."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00061,2021-10-04-T-003,61,Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Dennis Tan asked if individuals can request to be sent to an isolation facility instead. We have been considering and accommodating such requests, taking into account the medical conditions of the individuals and their family circumstances. But it is also important to emphasise that individuals and families should make, and have been making, some adjustments to their living arrangements to make HRP safe and possible at home. Because it is only with a high take-up of HRP, that our hospitals can focus resources on those who may require greater medical attention, including non-COVID-19 patients who need acute hospital care. This will enable our healthcare professionals to concentrate those who need acute hospital care."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00062,2021-10-04-T-003,62,Ong Ye Kung,"In response to Mr Xie Yao Quan, in the initial days of HRP, a fair number of patients without serious symptoms did make their way to the Emergency Departments of hospitals. We did not compile the numbers but it had led to overcrowding of the Departments. We understand the anxiety of these patients. It is, therefore, important for us to iron out all the teething issues of HRP, so that there is a strong sense of assurance as patients undergo HRP. Over the past few days, such incidences have been significantly reduced."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00063,2021-10-04-T-003,63,Ong Ye Kung,"Over the past week, and with the SAF overseeing and operating the programme end-to-end, we have been ironing out the teething issues, resolving service lapses, including those relating to timeliness of notification and conveyancing, and also improving communications with patients and their families. Things are improving day by day."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00064,2021-10-04-T-003,64,Ong Ye Kung,"In response to Miss Cheng Li Hui, currently, there are about 9,800 people on the HRP and they are recovering well. Over 2,800 have been discharged as of 3 October 2021. Every day, over half of infected individuals will be onboarded on HRP and we expect the proportion to continue to rise. In recent days, for those eligible for HRP, 93% are contacted promptly and smoothly onboarded. But we still have difficulties contacting the remaining minority because there was either no response or contact details are not accurate. So, this is another teething issue that we are ironing out using IT solutions."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00065,2021-10-04-T-003,65,Ong Ye Kung,"As for those who are illiterate and do not understand the SMS notifications from MOH, we hope family members, neighbours and volunteers can give them a hand. That is why our partnership with the People’s Association is very important. Over the weekend, volunteers have been mobilised to reach out to residents who have been served HRP notifications. I thank the People's Association and all our volunteers for their hard work on the ground."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00066,2021-10-04-T-003,66,Ong Ye Kung,"As the patients are generally well, we have also kept the involvement of telemedicine providers quite light and have patients call them only when they need medical attention."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00067,2021-10-04-T-003,67,Ong Ye Kung,"In response to Mr Xie Yao Quan, typically, after a person is detected as COVID-19 positive, MOH will contact him within 24 hours, where triaging will be done and a decision will be made on whether he will be on HRP or needs to be conveyed to a care facility."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00068,2021-10-04-T-003,68,Ong Ye Kung,"In response to Ms Ng Ling Ling, amongst those on HRP, as of 26 September, about 400 are Persons under Quarantine who subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. Ninety-five percent of them are eligible for HRP and have recovered or are recovering well at home. Five percent needed to be conveyed to a care facility and this was generally done within 24 hours of the request for conveyance."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00069,2021-10-04-T-003,69,Ong Ye Kung,"I would like to assure the House that MOH and the SAF are working hard together, devoting a lot of attention and resources to continue to improve the HRP and its processes."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00070,2021-10-04-T-003,70,Ong Ye Kung,"Ms Sylvia Lim also asked about a related issue concerning the procedures of quarantine and Stay-Home Notices (SHN) for travellers. There have been some changes to the SHN procedures, which was announced last week, namely to align SHN duration with the quarantine duration."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00071,2021-10-04-T-003,71,Ong Ye Kung,"As I have explained at the Multi-ministry Task Force (MTF) press conference over the weekend, the healthcare protocols developed over the past months have become complex and confusing to most people. We are undertaking a holistic and comprehensive review to simplify them, so that people understand them and can, therefore, do their part in the fight against COVID-19, and also help others who are in need of assistance and guidance."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00072,2021-10-04-T-003,72,Ong Ye Kung,"Let me now move on to vaccination and boosters. Vaccination remains key to our battle against COVID-19. Those who are fully vaccinated with	Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines are about 40% protected against infection from the Delta variant. This is protection against infection of the Delta variant. Nevertheless, both vaccines remain very effective in protecting against severe illnesses from COVID-19 infections."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00073,2021-10-04-T-003,73,Ong Ye Kung,"As for the Sinovac vaccine, the number of people who have been administered with the vaccine in Singapore is low, at less than 2% of our population, and we do not yet have meaningful data to gauge its effectiveness – whether against infection or against severe illnesses."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00074,2021-10-04-T-003,74,Ong Ye Kung,"But the Member who asked this question is probably interested to know about the relative effectiveness of the vaccines. There has been some international data available, including a fairly extensive study done earlier this year – it was pre-Delta – that was done in Chile, which uses a mixture of vaccines. Our neighbouring countries too have released some data. All these data showed that just like the mRNA vaccines, breakthrough infections are not uncommon amongst individuals vaccinated with the Sinovac vaccine, but the Sinovac vaccine does accord protection against severe illnesses."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00075,2021-10-04-T-003,75,Ong Ye Kung,"For those who are not fully vaccinated due to concerns over medical complications or because they experienced severe side effects after their first dose of mRNA vaccine, may take the Sinovac vaccine at public hospitals. As of 3 October, under this public health programme, more than 1,900 individuals have taken the first dose of the Sinovac vaccine and around 1,300 individuals have completed their full vaccination regimen."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00076,2021-10-04-T-003,76,Ong Ye Kung,"To Dr Lim Wee Kiak’s question on whether we intend to grant full registration to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, this is something we are looking into, once the longer-term follow-up data is fully available to us and HSA has completed its evaluation."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00077,2021-10-04-T-003,77,Ong Ye Kung,"To Mr Dennis Tan’s question, we are also waiting for data from Pfizer-BioNTech with the view to extend the use of the vaccine to include children aged five to 11 years old. These are areas we are proactively working on together with the pharmaceutical companies."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00078,2021-10-04-T-003,78,Ong Ye Kung,"We have also commenced our booster programme. To date, about 550,000 individuals have been invited to take their boosters. Three hundred and fifty thousand of them have taken their jabs or booked an appointment. This is before this weekend. I think by now the numbers have gone up. Two hundred and forty thousand of them have completed their jabs. So, we are off to an encouraging start."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00079,2021-10-04-T-003,79,Ong Ye Kung,"To Ms Ng Ling Ling’s question, the Expert Committee has recommended, and MOH has accepted, that individuals eligible for boosters will include those aged 50 and above and all those who are immunocompromised. The Expert Committee continues to review international data to assess the efficacy and safety of booster shots for younger groups, as well as those exposed to high-risk environments, such as healthcare and frontline workers."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00080,2021-10-04-T-003,80,Ong Ye Kung,"In time, we will also be inviting eligible individuals who have taken the Sinovac or SinoPharm vaccine to take their mRNA booster shots. However, most of them are not due yet."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00081,2021-10-04-T-003,81,Ong Ye Kung,"For policy consistency, Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme (VIFAP), will only apply to the vaccines used under our National Vaccination Programme."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00082,2021-10-04-T-003,82,Ong Ye Kung,"Ms He Ting Ru asked whether VIFAP applicants would have access to the findings by the Panel as well as avenues for appeal if their applications are rejected. The VIFAP Clinical Panel assesses applications based on two considerations. First, whether the patient’s conditions are related to the COVID-19 vaccination. Second, the severity criteria. The reasons for rejected applications are made known to the applicant and unsuccessful applicants may apply for a reassessment if there are new supporting medical information."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00083,2021-10-04-T-003,83,Ong Ye Kung,"At this stage, individuals’ vaccination status as listed on the TraceTogether app will not change regardless of their booster dose status. We are administering booster in good time and so this issue of expiring vaccination status has not arisen yet. But in time, this is an issue that we will need to review."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00084,2021-10-04-T-003,84,Ong Ye Kung,"Mr Yip Hon Weng asked about the possibility of exploring a combination of vaccines to be used for the booster jab. The Expert Committee on COVID-19 vaccination is still studying the heterologous strategy of administering a non-mRNA booster shot that is different from the first two primary series mRNA doses as data emerges. In the meantime, we will administer mRNA vaccines under the booster programme as the best available data utilise these vaccines for boosting with good effect."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00085,2021-10-04-T-003,85,Ong Ye Kung,"Ms Jessica Tan asked if our current measures are effective in ensuring that Singapore is prepared for COVID-19 to be treated as ""endemic"". Our transition journey to living with COVID-19 is unique in this world in the sense that we did not allow ourselves to go through big waves of transmission last year which many countries did, and suffered tremendous loss of lives. Today, when we see other countries opening up and living lives almost normally, let us not forget the heavy price that they have paid last year."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00086,2021-10-04-T-003,86,Ong Ye Kung,"We commenced our transition journey only after we have vaccinated the large majority of our population, so that for the vast majority of infected persons, they now have no or mild symptoms."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00087,2021-10-04-T-003,87,Ong Ye Kung,"I believe our plan is as comprehensive and effective as it can be, given what we know about the virus and the tools we have on hand. But we continue to learn about the virus and improve our responses day by day, week by week. Senior Minister of State Janil will elaborate on other parts of the plan. It is still a long battle ahead, which we will prevail as one Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-003-S-00088,2021-10-04-T-003,88,Ong Ye Kung,"It has been a challenging 20 months for all of us, especially our healthcare workers. Although it was posed as a question, I fully agree and thank Mr Xie Yao Quan’s suggestion to recognise healthcare workers. We have enhanced their salaries but I think recognition needs to go beyond that. In good time, when the pandemic has settled down or over, we must properly express our gratitude to them and make sure that generations of Singaporeans will be inspired by their bravery and dedication during the COVID-19 pandemic."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00089,2021-10-04-T-004,89,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"asked the Minister for Health what support measures will be granted to persons with disabilities, the young and elderly, who are served with SHN/Quarantine Orders and are deemed to be unable to do so on their own or in unfamiliar physical settings."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00090,2021-10-04-T-004,90,Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the current number of personnel involved in administering the Quarantine Order (QO) and Stay-Home Notice (SHN) process; (b) whether the service providers are able to cope with the increased numbers of people on QO and SHN; (c) whether the overall experience can be improved; and (d) how many cases of adverse feedback have been received to date.
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00091,2021-10-04-T-004,91,Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the stipulated time limit to address public queries on their quarantine orders (QOs); (b) in August 2021, what is the number of feedback that the Ministry has received concerning belated issuances of QOs or problematic communications and how are they addressed; and (c) whether the Ministry has a backup plan to deploy additional manpower in case of a surge in COVID-19 infections."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00092,2021-10-04-T-004,92,Jamus Jerome Lim,"asked the Minister for Health given how individuals exposed to COVID-19 positive cases serve their Stay-Home Notices (SHN) at their place of residence, but those arriving from abroad serve SHN in a dedicated SHN facility (regardless of whether they have access to an isolated place of residence) (a) what are the material differences between these two cases for this differentiated treatment; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider allowing those with isolated residences to serve their SHN at home rather than a dedicated facility, should they opt to do so."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00093,2021-10-04-T-004,93,Xie Yao Quan,asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the number of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases with mild symptoms who sought medical attention at the Emergency Department of a public hospital in the last 28 days; and (b) what are the strategies that the Ministry is considering to direct more of such cases to primary care.
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00094,2021-10-04-T-004,94,Jamus Jerome Lim,asked the Minister for Health what is the current procedure and reason for isolating minors issued with a Quarantine Order especially with regard to (i) the other members of their household and (ii) their legal guardian.
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00095,2021-10-04-T-004,95,Joan Pereira,"asked the Minister for Health in view of the number of patients hospitalised for COVID-19 (a) what has been the impact on the resources, particularly manpower, allocation within hospitals and the consequent impact on care quality; and (b) how will the Ministry ensure that resources are allocated adequately to those who are ill, including those in critical conditions not related to COVID-19."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00096,2021-10-04-T-004,96,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Health for COVID-19 patients serving their quarantine order at home, whether it is reasonable to expect that, despite their best efforts, they will not spread the virus to members of their household, particularly if they live in smaller flats which lack rooms with attached bathrooms."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00097,2021-10-04-T-004,97,Xie Yao Quan,"asked the Minister for Health (a) for the last 14 days, what is (i) the average time taken to pick up COVID-19 patients aged 70 years and above for conveyance to a hospital, from the time they are confirmed positive by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and (ii) the number of COVID-19 patients in home recovery and community care facilities who turned ill and required hospitalisation; and (b) in the longer run what is the capacity of general wards in public hospitals and SCDF ambulances that the Ministry expects to set aside for COVID-19 patients."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00098,2021-10-04-T-004,98,Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Health regarding COVID-19 patients (a) for the past three months, what is the weekly capacity and utilisation rates of (i) ICU beds (ii) isolation beds in hospitals and (iii) community care facilities; (b) what are the plans and associated lead time to increase ICU capacity if required; (c) what are the criteria used to determine the need to increase ICU capacity; (d) whether the recent spike in COVID-19 infections has led to a congruent spike in ICU and oxygen supplementation patients; (e) if so, why; and (f) if not, why."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00099,2021-10-04-T-004,99,Ang Wei Neng,asked the Minister for Health whether the Government will (i) consider providing more Antigen Rapid Test (ART) kits to each Singaporean household beyond the three provided by Temasek Foundation and (ii) work with distributors of ART to lower the retail price of ART given the sharp rise in COVID-19 cases in the community.
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00100,2021-10-04-T-004,100,Janil Puthucheary,"Mr Speaker, the recent exponential rise in cases has impacted our healthcare capacities. Currently, about 15% of hospital beds in the acute public hospitals are used for around 10% of all COVID-19 cases. Those requiring oxygen supplementation or ICU care account for 2% of total cases, most of whom are unvaccinated or the elderly."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00101,2021-10-04-T-004,101,Janil Puthucheary,"In the last three months, ICU bed occupancy has increased from 26% to 53%. Occupancy of isolation beds has risen from 58% to 86%, while the occupancy of community care facility (CCF) beds has gone from 10% to 35%."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00102,2021-10-04-T-004,102,Janil Puthucheary,Public hospital emergency departments have seen up to an eight-fold increase in the number of patients with ART or PCR positive results seeking medical attention.
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00103,2021-10-04-T-004,103,Janil Puthucheary,"Prior to the last 14 days, we conveyed COVID-19 patients above 70 years old to a hospital within 12 hours from the time they had a PCR positive test."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00104,2021-10-04-T-004,104,Janil Puthucheary,"With the current high caseloads, we are now taking on average between 48 and 72 hours to do so. SCDF ambulances are reserved for patients with emergency conditions, hence, MOH has set up a dedicated fleet of 95 additional ambulances to convey COVID-19 patients to the different healthcare facilities."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00105,2021-10-04-T-004,105,Janil Puthucheary,"We are taking steps to expand our hospital and treatment resources to ensure that everyone who requires medical care, whether for COVID-19 or other conditions, will receive it. We have asked hospitals to prioritise resources for COVID-19 patients by reducing non-essential elective appointments."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00106,2021-10-04-T-004,106,,"We have been shifting asymptomatic and lower risk COVID-19 patients from hospital to COVID-19 treatment facilities (CTF), as well as the Community Care Facilities (CCFs) and the Home Recovery Programme. This allows acute hospital resources to be focused on managing patients who need urgent or essential care."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00107,2021-10-04-T-004,107,,"We are closely monitoring ICU trends, in particular. We have increased the ICU bed capacity by 74 beds, for a total of 187 beds dedicated to COVID-19 patients with severe conditions. More ICU beds can be opened on short notice, if needed."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00108,2021-10-04-T-004,108,,"We are also closely monitoring the hospital manpower situation, given that close to 400 healthcare workers have tested positive for COVID-19. Our hospitals will continue to dynamically cross-deploy their resources to ensure that our manpower needs are met. We are also working with private healthcare providers to augment our manpower."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00109,2021-10-04-T-004,109,,"To further preserve our healthcare capacity in the face of future waves of infections, we must also adopt more sustainable healthcare protocols based on the medical care required. The vast majority – over 98% – of infected individuals have mild or no symptoms and only 0.3% have needed ICU care or have sadly passed on. This is a result of having vaccinated most of our population, who will only experience mild illness if they suffer a breakthrough infection. Thus, we are making home recovery the default protocol for infected individuals, unless they have severe symptoms, are elderly, or have underlying co-morbidities that make them more susceptible to severe disease outcomes."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00110,2021-10-04-T-004,110,,"Besides focusing our hospital and medical treatment resources on those who need it most, we are also ensuring that our COVID-19 response systems are directed appropriately."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00111,2021-10-04-T-004,111,,"We will continue to use technology, such as TraceTogether and SafeEntry systems to automatically and quickly identify the majority of close contacts, and to prompt these contacts to self-monitor and take precautions against unknowingly infecting others. This process augments our efforts and allows us to focus the work of the 350 full-time contact tracers that we have today. We must optimise the deployment of these officers. As cases have increased multiple fold in the community, it is not always useful to comprehensively contact trace around every case detected, by conducting extra interviews and manual case detection."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00112,2021-10-04-T-004,112,,"Instead, we are focusing these intensive contact tracing efforts on cases and clusters detected in vulnerable settings like hospitals, nursing homes and schools. These are areas where contact mapping and comprehensive identification of close contacts have the greatest public health benefits today. Individuals who are tested positive have also been asked to self-declare their household members so that they can be placed under quarantine. What we are doing is calling on the self-responsibility of our people to aid our officers and aid our efforts."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00113,2021-10-04-T-004,113,,"Next, if I may speak on our quarantine and isolation operations. The Quarantine Order (QO) and Stay-Home Notice (SHN) processes are administered by around 300 officers from MOH and the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA). These officers handle around 6,700 daily queries on average, on issues such as quarantine status, quarantine conveyance and testing, as well as QO rescindment requests."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00114,2021-10-04-T-004,114,,"While such queries should be resolved within three working days, the current surge has resulted in some, especially the complex ones, taking longer to resolve. This also increases the waiting time for others before their calls can be connected, even if their queries are not as complex. We will continue to enhance the resourcing to manage surges and seek the public's understanding for longer response times during this period. We have put out more public communications materials, in print media and on our websites, so that individuals affected by COVID-19 can potentially self-help themselves as well as their families and friends."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00115,2021-10-04-T-004,115,,"We will continue to scale up the Home Recovery Programme (HRP). This ensures that our hospital and medical treatment resources are prioritised for those who are, or could be, severely ill. We have also adjusted our QO regime to allow individuals who are less likely to fall severely ill with COVID-19 and whose homes are suitable for home recovery, to quarantine at home. This regime places the responsibility on the confirmed COVID-19 cases and their household members, including minors and caregivers to self-register. After the original quarantined individual is confirmed to have COVID-19 and has been served an Isolation Order, the other household members should self-register for quarantine as well, in order for the whole family to recover and be quarantined together at home."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00116,2021-10-04-T-004,116,,"We will also increasingly allow fully vaccinated travellers who need to serve a SHN to do so at home. Currently, such travellers from Category II and III countries may already apply to serve their SHN at their place of residence or other suitable accommodation that they have secured. Almost all travellers from Category II countries and around half the travellers from Category III countries fulfill the criteria and have opted-out of the dedicated SHN facility. We will progressively review and adjust our border measures, but for now, fully vaccinated travellers from Category IV countries must still serve their SHN at the SHN dedicated facilities."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00117,2021-10-04-T-004,117,,"Those serving home quarantine or home SHN are also given information on transmission prevention, including isolation protocols and good personal hygiene practices. ART kits are provided to household members for them to monitor their own health. Those on home isolation requiring dedicated care arrangements may also apply for assistance ahead of, or during the SHN. Vulnerable persons serving SHN or QO who need support for their activities of daily living, such as minors and the disabled, may also be accompanied by a caregiver. We will continue to review our protocols and measures."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00118,2021-10-04-T-004,118,,"There is a financial impact to businesses or individuals whose livelihoods are affected by QOs. Between January and September this year, around 3,300 point-to-point (P2P) drivers and riders have been placed on a QO. These individuals, along with others whose livelihoods have been affected by QOs, can apply for a QO Allowance to help cushion the financial impact."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00119,2021-10-04-T-004,119,,"Mr Speaker, the public health actions that are triggered upon confirmation of COVID-19 infection for an individual are disruptive. But it remains important that we detect possible COVID-19 infections early, so as to minimise the impact of transmission to their loved ones at home, or to their friends or colleagues."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00120,2021-10-04-T-004,120,,"There are some who have a misconception that we are testing widely to attempt to eliminate the virus. This is not so. We have many community cases around us. Our widespread testing aims to reduce the overall rate of transmission from each COVID-19 infection, slowing the spread in the community. ART testing also enables individuals to perform self-testing and do our own part to slow down transmission of the virus. These strategies will allow us to ride the wave of infections without overwhelming our healthcare and public health response resources."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00121,2021-10-04-T-004,121,,"To this end, regular testing in the workplace and at home remains key. We have made ART test kits widely available, through sale at major retailers, free through nationwide household distributions and supplying kits to companies for mandatory routine testing regimes or voluntary regular testing. Individuals who are exposed to the virus and issued health warnings or alerts may also collect ART kits for regular self-testing from our vending machines island-wide."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00122,2021-10-04-T-004,122,,"To make the test kits on sale more competitively priced, we are actively reviewing new brands of equally effective kits to bring into the market. We will also evaluate if there is a need to conduct another round of nationwide household distribution of kits to support regular self-testing. These Fast and Easy tests have been effective in augmenting our case identification efforts. Of the total COVID-19 cases identified in the last eight weeks via the PCR test at Swab and Send Home (SASH) clinics, 7% had initially tested positive using the self-test ART kits before coming forward for their confirmatory PCR test."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00123,2021-10-04-T-004,123,,"Sir, as we move towards living with COVID-19, each of us must play our part to lower transmission risks and slow the pace of community infections. While the Government will continue to make adjustments to augment our healthcare and public health response capacity, all of us need to be socially responsible to take care of ourselves and others around us through regular testing and adherence to isolation protocols if we have been exposed to positive cases. Continued adherence to our Safe Management Measures will also help to dampen the rate of transmission. This is what it means for us to work together to be a COVID-19 resilient nation."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00124,2021-10-04-T-004,124,Speaker,Ms Jessica Tan.
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00125,2021-10-04-T-004,125,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank Minister as well as Senior Minister of State for the comprehensive reply as well as the reassurance that we will continue to improve the processes and measures. I would like to ask two supplementary questions."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00126,2021-10-04-T-004,126,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"With the increase in cases and Home Recovery as the default care management measure for COVID-19 positive cases, there is no discharge memo that will be given after they have recovered, after the 10 days. What help can individuals get in terms of getting TraceTogether status cleared? I have got quite a few requests for help because many have got their TraceTogether still indicating that they are not cleared and they cannot proceed on to even just do daily necessary activities."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00127,2021-10-04-T-004,127,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"The second supplementary question is, for seniors that are sent to the CCF, what is the support given especially those who are not so digitally savvy and they need help at the centre? They are alone and they are not able to be accompanied and several of them may be over 80. I also had several requests for help because some of the seniors did not know what to do and even how to ask for help or use some of the simple facilities."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00128,2021-10-04-T-004,128,Ong Ye Kung,"I thank the Member for raising this issue. Indeed, I have received a lot of feedback too, where a person after his discharge, does not have his TraceTogether indication lifted. So, we are fixing that, it is essentially an IT issue. The reason why there is now a fixed day of discharge, is because once a person is vaccinated, viral load drops very quickly, especially after day 5. And by day 10, NCID find that they cannot culture the virus anymore because viral load becomes quite low. Which is why we can safely discharge patients who are vaccinated at day 10."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00129,2021-10-04-T-004,129,Ong Ye Kung,"The IT system needs to keep up that policy. So, in the next few days, the TraceTogether issue will be resolved as we will also synchronise the removal of the alert in line with the discharge day. So, once you are infected, the TraceTogether App would know and it will count that 10 days from then, if you are vaccinated, you will be automatically removed. If you are not vaccinated, it will be removed after 14 days. So, this problem I expect to be resolved."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00130,2021-10-04-T-004,130,Ong Ye Kung,"As for CCF, I thank the Member for raising that issue. There are nurses and there are workers available at the CCF. So, if we come across such cases where the senior is alone or illiterate, let us know and we will alert the CCFs. There are people on hand, medical workers, who can help out and help the senior navigate and understand the messages that we are sending to them."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00131,2021-10-04-T-004,131,Speaker,Ms Denise Phua. Please limit to two supplementary questions if possible and keep the questions short. This applies to everyone.
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00132,2021-10-04-T-004,132,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"I thank the Minister and the Senior Minister of State for the answers. I know it is really a very difficult time for everyone. We also want to support as much as possible, but I cannot help asking these two supplementary questions."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00133,2021-10-04-T-004,133,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"Number one is, thank you for letting us know that Home Recovery now is a default option for COVID-19 positive residents. My questions are specifically for those who are vulnerable. What if Home Recovery is the default option but a resident is just not suitable for recovery at home? For example, in the Central district, we have a lot of rental flats where there are a lot of sharing of facilities like toilets and living rooms, with just one door for everybody to get through. What if the homes are just not suitable for Home Recovery? Or what if there are just very large families in some of these homes?"
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00134,2021-10-04-T-004,134,Denise Phua Lay Peng,"The second supplementary question is this. Thank you to Senior Minister of State Janil for making it very clear that caregivers are allowed to accompany those who are vulnerable like the elderly who are not independent, the disabled young or old, and so forth. As Members of Parliament, we often get questions that come fast and furious from residents. If the questions come directly to us, we always get responsive replies, especially when we write to MOH Public Officeholders (POHs). But in general, how does the public get to know that the caregivers can accompany the more vulnerable, especially if the MOH hotline is very stretched at the moment? So, what if quick responses are required —"
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00135,2021-10-04-T-004,135,Speaker,"If the Member could keep her questions short, please."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00136,2021-10-04-T-004,136,Denise Phua Lay Peng,— and they just do not know where to get the answers. Thank you.
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00137,2021-10-04-T-004,137,Ong Ye Kung,I will keep my answers short.
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00138,2021-10-04-T-004,138,Speaker,Thank you.
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00139,2021-10-04-T-004,139,Ong Ye Kung,"HRP is the default, provided you meet certain criteria, such as you are younger, you are vaccinated, some not vaccinated but younger. But within this default, while it is the default, it is not rigid. It is important that once the person is notified that he is on HRP, he is also given a phone number to call to reach what we call an HRP Buddy. If he is not comfortable because of living conditions or he is living with vulnerable seniors or unvaccinated children, they can then make the request to say, ""While I am asked to go on HRP, can I be taken out to a CCF?"""
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00140,2021-10-04-T-004,140,Ong Ye Kung,"And we will try our best to accommodate those requests. So, your residents can certainly, request by calling the HRP Buddy."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00141,2021-10-04-T-004,141,Ong Ye Kung,"As for how would the public know, mass media is one way. We put out FAQs as simply as we can. But even so, it is hard to understand for many members of the public."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00142,2021-10-04-T-004,142,Ong Ye Kung,"Another layer will be our community volunteers, our Community Centres (CCs). Many do call up our CCs to ask questions. And so, we also need to arm PA and our CCs with answers for all these questions. Most or 80% of the questions are related to those few things. Our volunteers should be also equipped with the information and they can reach out and explain to them."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00143,2021-10-04-T-004,143,Ong Ye Kung,"Finally, it will be the hotline. It has been difficult to call through in the past few days. But we have been beefing up the resources day by day, with SAF's help, it has really improved a lot. As of yesterday when I checked, we are able to attend to almost 70% of the callers. So, it is improving and we continue to improve it. Once that happens, as more people can call through, get the answers, they will also tell their friends, and I think the situation will change."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00144,2021-10-04-T-004,144,Speaker,Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00145,2021-10-04-T-004,145,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Thank you, Mr Speaker and thank you to Senior Minister of State Janil for his responses. Both my supplementary questions have to do with whether we are following protocol that may look good on the surface but actually seems to make less sense when you dig into the policy."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00146,2021-10-04-T-004,146,Jamus Jerome Lim,"The first has to do with my question on what the material differences between importing cases and quarantine. If I may develop this, is the concern the risk of importing new variants? And if so, does MOH actually have a view on risks of the new variants' fitness given that Delta is fairly endemic? Does it make sense to apply such a strict protocol that could discourage business travel with long stay-at-home requirements for imported cases?"
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00147,2021-10-04-T-004,147,Jamus Jerome Lim,"My second question has to do with how the Senior Minister of State indicated that currently those issued with a Quarantine Order should self-isolate, but it actually does not require all family members to do. So, I wonder what is the Senior Minister of State's view on how this procedure could potentially be a loophole, since surely there is no appreciable difference between the legal guardian that has to accompany a minor in the case of an SHN versus the other household members, insofar as virus exposure is concerned?"
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00148,2021-10-04-T-004,148,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I thank the Member for his questions. For the first question, I think he is essentially asking why does it appear as if there are different standards for someone who is travelling, versus someone who is given a Home Quarantine Order or a Health Risk Alert here in Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00149,2021-10-04-T-004,149,Janil Puthucheary,"Partly, this is a result of the changing situation and actually, today, an increasing number of travellers are allowed to do a Stay-Home Notice and you will see that we will have further and further streamlining, optimising and alignment of our various measures. The situation is moving quite fast. We will review and align these measures."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00150,2021-10-04-T-004,150,Janil Puthucheary,"But if I could go into the specifics of his question, or at least, what I think are the specifics of his question, the risk associated with travellers is partly to do with variants; it is partly to do with the robustness of the information that we are receiving, depending on where they are coming from, what we understand about the situation they have in their home country as well as the particulars of that individual's likely location if they are not in a dedicated facility here, in the stay-at-home facility."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00151,2021-10-04-T-004,151,Janil Puthucheary,"So, we do take all these factors into account when dealing with the appeals, with respect to travellers."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00152,2021-10-04-T-004,152,Janil Puthucheary,"For his second question, I did not quite understand what he was asking. The call is for all of us to be responsible and for the household members of a contact indeed to register. We are not asking for only some of them to register. We are asking for all of them to register. And indeed, the risk to the whole household is pretty much the same as a caregiver that accompanies someone who is vulnerable. Hence, our request for all of them to register."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00153,2021-10-04-T-004,153,Janil Puthucheary,"In truth, much of the exposure and the risk will happen before the COVID-19 index case is detected. Hence, that is why we are requiring the whole household to limit their movement and their exposure to people outside of the household. Thank you, Sir."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00154,2021-10-04-T-004,154,Speaker,Mr Yip Hon Weng.
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00155,2021-10-04-T-004,155,Yip Hon Weng,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. And I thank the Minister and the Senior Minister of State for their replies."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00156,2021-10-04-T-004,156,Yip Hon Weng,"I have two supplementary questions. The first pertains to Question No 2. The COVIDsitrep website is a good initiative in terms of communications. I wish to ask whether the Ministry is prepared to consider a benchmark such as the probability and death rate of getting the seasonal flu and dengue fever versus getting COVID-19, in our public communications. This will help allay fears and contextualise the likelihood of getting COVID-19."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00157,2021-10-04-T-004,157,Yip Hon Weng,"My next supplementary question pertains to Question No 12. In monitoring the COVID-19 situation in Singapore, I wish to ask the Ministry, what the next trigger points that MOH is worried about. And given the R-nought (R0) indicator, we can roughly predict when they will occur. As such, how does MOH intend to communicate both the trigger points as well as the time horizon to the public? This will get the public and industries sufficiently timed and early warning to adjust to new measures."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00158,2021-10-04-T-004,158,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I will address the Member's first question. Indeed, we do need to communicate. The relative risks of COVID-19 infection, and getting the infection, and then perhaps risks of complications and severe disease, and put these in context relative to other common diseases such as influenza or even not so common diseases such as dengue, for the public to understand how they should go about their business when we reach some sort of equilibrium."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00159,2021-10-04-T-004,159,Janil Puthucheary,"We will be putting more information out into the public. But at the moment we have not reached that equilibrium yet. We are in the middle of quite a large wave and there are very real anxieties around COVID-19, and I think, especially for the elderly, the vulnerable, the under-vaccinated."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00160,2021-10-04-T-004,160,Janil Puthucheary,"So, I thank the Member for his suggestion that we do need to put some of these numbers in the context of a lot of other diseases that we are used to dealing with. We will do so when we are approaching an equilibrium and we have plans to do so."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00161,2021-10-04-T-004,161,Janil Puthucheary,"But I think at the moment the anxieties are around the large number of cases, the wave that we are experiencing. It is very real and we should not under play it."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00162,2021-10-04-T-004,162,Janil Puthucheary,I understand that Minister Ong Ye Kung will address the second question.
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00163,2021-10-04-T-004,163,Ong Ye Kung,"Thank you. As for the Member's second question on trigger points before we loosen our safe management measures further, we are aware and we are all well aware that certain countries have declared certain dates or certain vaccination levels, and then, they will open up. We have not adopted that approach. Because we recognise that in battling COVID-19, this is a live, evolving, fast-changing situation and it is not wise for us to tie our hands and limit our options as we adapt and stay agile in battling the COVID-19 virus."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00164,2021-10-04-T-004,164,Ong Ye Kung,"Therefore, we will have to take into account of the situation in hospitals, our case numbers, how people are reacting, what is our social preparedness to live with the virus and how businesses are doing, and we adjust our measures from time to time. But our direction is very clear  we have to live with COVID-19, we have to become a COVID-19 resilient nation. The direction is clear, but from time to time, we may take a longer route, we may take a detour, but we will stay on course."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00165,2021-10-04-T-004,165,Speaker,Mr Gerald Giam.
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00166,2021-10-04-T-004,166,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Sir, my first supplementary question is for Minister Ong and my second supplementary question is for Senior Minister of State Janil."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00167,2021-10-04-T-004,167,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Sir, many Singaporeans and businesses are very frustrated with the repeated open-shut of our economy and our lives. Minister Ong said on 21 September that during the preparatory period, MOH projected handling 100 to 200 cases a day. This is far lower than the actual caseload since 19 August. Why were these projections so far off? Delta has been with us for almost six months and there is plenty of data on Delta infections from countries like India and Israel, which were hit by the Delta wave before us. Why was the Government not better prepared for the caseload after reopening?"
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00168,2021-10-04-T-004,168,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"And for Senior Minister of State Janil, what is the rationale for children under 12 being ineligible for home recovery, given that children, even those unvaccinated usually have mild or no those symptoms when infected? Because allowing them to recover at home by default, allows their parents to care for them and will also reduce the load on hospitals."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00169,2021-10-04-T-004,169,Ong Ye Kung,"I will answer both questions. I do not think we characterised our safe management posture as opening and shutting. But depending on the situation, we have to make adjustments and over time, we have made progress in the sense that I think we have put circuit breaker behind us. If we remember in April last year, almost all businesses were shut. And then, we had Heightened Alert, which is a far more moderate form of slowing transmission, slowing economic activities. This time round, we try not to go back to Heightened Alert, but instead, it is mainly restaurants and F&B that are affected. We want to keep them open, try not to affect distances so much. MOF provided financial assistance, but they can operate with table of two."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00170,2021-10-04-T-004,170,Ong Ye Kung,"So, I think we are making those progress and I think we should also feel encouraged that because of vaccinations, we are able to move forward."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00171,2021-10-04-T-004,171,Ong Ye Kung,"As for the numbers, if I remember correctly, in late August, when we started seeing a wave, I mentioned 3,200 as a possible daily number, if the doubling cycle goes on five times. We were at 100 cases then; if it goes on five times, we would have reached 3,200."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00172,2021-10-04-T-004,172,Ong Ye Kung,"The ""100 and 200"" number, I am not sure where it come from. A lot of things were said during the MTF press conferences, but I did refer to it, as during the preparatory phase, we were hoping to maintain around that number. Because we were still preparing ourselves."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00173,2021-10-04-T-004,173,Ong Ye Kung,"And when the whole thing is over, in the  endemic stage, perhaps, we will see 200 cases, maybe more."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00174,2021-10-04-T-004,174,Ong Ye Kung,"But I hope we take all these numbers in the spirit. I speak to epidemiologists, doctors all the time. They explain things to me, they cite numbers. I then try to explain things to the public. And so, some numbers may be picked on, but let us take it in the right spirit. I am not making any projections or predictions, but these are things that I learn from MOH, and I am trying to explain honestly to the public to the best of my abilities."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00175,2021-10-04-T-004,175,Ong Ye Kung,"As for children under 12, actually, they can serve Home Recovery. We do encourage them to serve Home Recovery. And many parents, in fact, like to serve Home Recovery."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00176,2021-10-04-T-004,176,Ong Ye Kung,"I am not sure if it is made the default, but certainly, it has great potential to be made a default. And a great majority of children can recover very well at home and they are happier that way."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00177,2021-10-04-T-004,177,Speaker,Ms Joan Pereira.
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00178,2021-10-04-T-004,178,Joan Pereira,"Thank you, Speaker. The Senior Minister of State mentioned that MOH has tapped on private hospitals to alleviate the load on public hospitals. I have one supplementary question. May I know how has this helped alleviate any shortage of resources in the public hospitals?"
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00179,2021-10-04-T-004,179,Joan Pereira,"I have had residents who have been hospitalised with non-COVID-19 related illnesses and shared that the care was inadequate. So, I hope the Senior Minister of State can answer that."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00180,2021-10-04-T-004,180,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I thank the Member for the question. The whole of our healthcare system has been mobilised for this effort  public and private. And they are different institutions, but they are working as a team. It is a bit hard to quantify because the private sector is looking after COVID-19 patients under their roof, but they are also looking after other patients with other conditions. Their doctors and nurses have been deployed elsewhere into other sites. So, has it helped? The answer is yes, because manpower is available, beds are available, resources are available."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00181,2021-10-04-T-004,181,Janil Puthucheary,"But to put a specific quantification on it, I do not think I am able to adequately answer the Member's question."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00182,2021-10-04-T-004,182,Janil Puthucheary,"The way I would look at it is this. We have a healthcare system here in Singapore that is made up of public providers, private providers, volunteers as well. And the healthcare is not just about the bed, the doctor or the nurse. It is the entire system working together and everyone is mobilised to try to do their best to deal with this crisis in front of us. So, I suppose the shortest answer to the Member's question is yes."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00183,2021-10-04-T-004,183,Speaker,Mr Liang Eng Hwa.
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00184,2021-10-04-T-004,184,Liang Eng Hwa,"Thank you, Sir. I would like to ask either the Minister or the Senior Minister of State on individuals who need to do the seven-day or 14-day mandatory PCR tests. MOH currently publicly runs regional PCR screening centres. They are not quite located at the convenient locations for those who need to do those tests on a weekly basis or bi-weekly basis. So, can I ask MOH if there are plans to build more of such centres?"
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00185,2021-10-04-T-004,185,Liang Eng Hwa,"Secondly, in some estates, where there are hawker centres, they do have their own PCR testing facilities set-up. But only the stallholders are allowed to use those testing facilities. So, in such situations, can I ask if I MOH can allow or support or facilitate these PCR testing facilities to be used by other workers as well who need to do the regular seven-day, 14-day tests, so that the community resources can be shared and to ensure better convenience for those frontline workers as well as building that community spirit as well?"
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00186,2021-10-04-T-004,186,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I thank the Member for his question. He has identified the direction in which we are moving with these strategies. We have opened up more centres. We have 22 Regional Screening Centres, 20 Quick Test Centres and five private Quick Test Centres. We are already working on opening up these areas to other users and working with the employers as well, just to make sure these resources are made available to as wide a base as possible, to speed up the processes that he talks about."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00187,2021-10-04-T-004,187,Janil Puthucheary,"The sector leads among the employers are encouraged to move towards the fast and easy testing RRT, primarily with the employer supervised self-swab model, so that people could self-test at their own location, at their own convenience. Some sectors will still keep going with the Quick Test Centres. And the ones, particularly in the hawker centres, that the Member talked about, are available, but they are prioritised on the basis of how they were set up for the employees that they are meant to serve."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00188,2021-10-04-T-004,188,Janil Puthucheary,"But in the medium term, we are working with other parts of Government to incentivise private vendors; perhaps, through a grant scheme and our intent is to then set up more centres which can be more convenient in other locations for the community and larger groups of workers. This is an important part of our strategy going forward for COVID-19 resilience."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00189,2021-10-04-T-004,189,Speaker,Ms He Ting Ru.
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00190,2021-10-04-T-004,190,He Ting Ru,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have two supplementary questions. The first is, I take the Minister for Health's earlier explanation about the numbers that were quoted earlier. But my question relates to what were the previous planning parameters when we first announced that we are moving into endemic phase? This is very key because we need to know that we are properly resourced; that we do not have a situation like we saw in the last couple of weeks where people were waiting for days, or up to a week before they were actually responded to."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00191,2021-10-04-T-004,191,He Ting Ru,"So, my question would be, how many cases were we planning for back then, before this current surge? Was it 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 or 5,000? And how can we actually put measures in place to make sure that it does not occur, especially, we are planning to loosen the restrictions again in three weeks. So, I think everybody wants to avoid a situation where we actually end up where, every time we loosen some restrictions, we see a massive surge, and then people cannot actually get any answers, or they cannot get through the hotlines."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00192,2021-10-04-T-004,192,He Ting Ru,"The second point is whether anything can be done for better communications and messaging for residents and people who are actually affected. We have things like Heightened Alert, Stabilisation, preparatory stages. People are getting very confused about what each of these actually refer to. Same goes for the acronyms like HRP, QOs. And I am sure many Members have actually seen the many, many different flowcharts and spreadsheets. It is just very, very confusing."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00193,2021-10-04-T-004,193,He Ting Ru,"What else can be done to make sure that our communications to a very complicated situation, is communicated to residents so that they do not end up having to jam the hotlines as well?"
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00194,2021-10-04-T-004,194,Ong Ye Kung,"I thank the Member for acknowledging that it is a complicated situation. Over 20 months, we have developed many responses, many protocols in order to handle the situation, which is why there is now a plethora of different protocols."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00195,2021-10-04-T-004,195,Ong Ye Kung,"But as I mentioned during our press conference over the weekend, now, we are in a different phase. Many of the protocols were designed at a time when the public wants to see us snuffing out every single cluster. And so, we have all these tight protocols."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00196,2021-10-04-T-004,196,Ong Ye Kung,But now we are in a phase of trying to live with COVID-19 and there are protocols.
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00197,2021-10-04-T-004,197,Ong Ye Kung,"And so, we announced last weekend that we are in the process of holistically reviewing all the protocols with a view to streamline them. I do not think we can get away with some abbreviations and some alphabet soup. That will still be around. It is after all, a very complicated situation. But we will try our best to streamline as much as possible, so that people would understand it, able to do their part to fight against COVID-19 and also, to help others."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00198,2021-10-04-T-004,198,Ong Ye Kung,"Back to the numbers and planning criteria, the Member seems to have a narrative that we totally did not plan for all these. On the contrary, we have always planned for a big surge. You would hear from Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, and these are partners that we work very closely with, they have projected 5,000 and 10,000 cases a day, as high as that. You speak to different epidemiologists, they may have different views, but these are the numbers if we fully open."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00199,2021-10-04-T-004,199,Ong Ye Kung,"You have seen it in other countries happening that kind of peak. And that is why through our communication with public, you would hear us – whether myself, Minister Gan or Minister Lawrence Wong – always saying, cases will rise; and when cases rise, number of people with severe illnesses and deaths, will rise. And we have been saying that."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00200,2021-10-04-T-004,200,Ong Ye Kung,"I also mentioned at end August, when we start to see the start of this wave, we say that doubling cycle, if it happens five times, we will reach 3,200. Therefore, we have always sized ourselves up for that kind of number. We hope that we can do so progressively, and not suddenly, which is why we also announced a four-stage opening process  preparatory stage, where we try out home recovery, build up, our CTFs, CCFs and so on. And then transitions – we call it transition stage one, if people still remember – and stage two, and then finally endemicity. We gave no deadline or timeline for reasons I explained earlier that we need to watch the situation."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00201,2021-10-04-T-004,201,Ong Ye Kung,But we were just in the preparatory stage. The Delta variant came in and then cases start to shoot up.
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00202,2021-10-04-T-004,202,Ong Ye Kung,"But fortunately, we have always been planning ahead, which is why at that point in time, we were already ready to handle 1,500 cases a day, in terms of Community Care Facilities (CCFs), hospital beds, ICU beds, and then also thinking already about setting up the Community Treatment Facility (CTF) beds and we are also starting with the HRP."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00203,2021-10-04-T-004,203,Ong Ye Kung,"By now, we have capacity to handle 3,000 cases and ramping up in one to two weeks to handle 5,000 cases – but we do not know whether we will reach there. And then, already thinking about the next step on how to handle 10,000 cases."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00204,2021-10-04-T-004,204,Ong Ye Kung,"So, in terms of planning capacity, manpower, we are always one, two bounds ahead."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00205,2021-10-04-T-004,205,Ong Ye Kung,"What I think did not go well and I fully acknowledge that, was the HRP. And all the complaints about conveyancing, calling, not getting in, people not getting responses. It is not because the beds were not catered for, but processes with regard to the HRP were not totally ready. We were caught by the sudden increase. We are still implementing the pilot programme when all these happened."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00206,2021-10-04-T-004,206,Ong Ye Kung,"But the team swung into action, the call of public duty kicked in and everybody is putting their heart and soul to solve the problem. So, day by day, we are seeing improvements and will continue to do so. We have to make HRP work, then the great majority of patients who are well, no symptoms, mild symptoms who can recover at home. Then, the hospital capacity that we plan for can focus on the 2% that really need help. Things are improving."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00207,2021-10-04-T-004,207,Speaker,Mr Xie Yao Quan.
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00208,2021-10-04-T-004,208,Xie Yao Quan,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question pertains to my original Parliamentary Question 18, part (b), which I believe has not been quite answered."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00209,2021-10-04-T-004,209,Xie Yao Quan,"The question really is this; as we learn to live with COVID-19 and as we settle into a new equilibrium of elevated daily number of cases, in the longer run, what is the capacity of general wards in public hospitals that the Ministry expects to set aside for COVID-19 patients? The concern is the more beds we set for COVID-19 patients, I think the less beds we have for non-COVID-19 related conditions. Are there enough hospital beds to go around in our public healthcare system?"
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00210,2021-10-04-T-004,210,Xie Yao Quan,"The other side of this question, is in terms of wait time, to a hospital bed for a COVID-19 patient, in the longer run, at steady state, does Ministry have an expectation and what might that be?"
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00211,2021-10-04-T-004,211,Janil Puthucheary,"Sir, I thank the Member for the questions. For the first part, we set aside COVID-19 beds currently because our approach is to isolate them and separate them from the rest of the patients in the healthcare facilities."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00212,2021-10-04-T-004,212,Janil Puthucheary,"But as you go towards endemic COVID-19, COVID-19 will have to be treated like any other infectious disease. In peacetime in the endemic situation, we do not have influenza beds or dengue beds, or chickenpox beds – and all of these are infectious diseases. What we have is beds on the basis of the patients' needs. Increasingly, the COVID-19 patients in hospitals will have other types of diseases. They will have kidney problems, heart problems and neurological problems. So, it is a bit hard to then delineate in the steady state, once we are done with the surge, once we are done with this current strategy, as we move towards endemic COVID-19, I do not think we will be in a position to then say, these are the COVID-19 beds and these are the non-COVID-19 beds. We will have to treat COVID-19 like other infectious diseases."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00213,2021-10-04-T-004,213,Janil Puthucheary,"Nevertheless, in the middle of the surge now, we are ramping up our capacity, mobilising resources as we have described in our answers to Parliamentary Questions and supplementary questions, but also trying to improve the flow of patients through our system, so that these resources are made available."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00214,2021-10-04-T-004,214,Janil Puthucheary,"But the most important strategy is to focus the resources that we do have on those who need it the most. Vaccination is part of reducing the number of people who need those resources. The well, who are asymptomatic, being able to stay home, or go to CCFs or CTFs, is part of that strategy as well, as are our attempts to then slow down the transmission in the community."
2021-10-04-T-004-S-00215,2021-10-04-T-004,215,Janil Puthucheary,"All of these, then, feeds into the issue of wait time. Whether it is about bed space or having your call answered, making sure that those resources that we have, and those officers, are deployed to deal with the people who need help most, will also help in reducing the wait time. But ultimately, we do need the manpower and we are working on ramping up that capacity as well."
2021-10-04-T-005-S-00216,2021-10-04-T-005,216,Darryl David,asked the Minister for Education (a) whether the Government can provide an update on the recent period of home-based learning (HBL) that is implemented in late September/early October 2021 for primary school students in terms of the impact on their learning and development; and (b) whether this indicates a possible shift to more HBL periods for schools in the future.
2021-10-04-T-005-S-00217,2021-10-04-T-005,217,Hazel Poa,asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry will consider moving schools to home-based learning in view of the spike in the number of COVID-19 cases.
2021-10-04-T-005-S-00218,2021-10-04-T-005,218,Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, can I have your permission to take Question Nos 21 and 22 together?"
2021-10-04-T-005-S-00219,2021-10-04-T-005,219,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2021-10-04-T-005-S-00220,2021-10-04-T-005,220,Chan Chun Sing,"MOE's approach has been to keep schools safe so that they can remain open as far as possible. We recognise that Home-Based Learning (HBL) cannot be a full substitute for the school-based learning experience. On a prolonged basis, it comes at a cost not just to students' learning but also their socio-emotional development and mental well-being. It also imposes a burden to families and society. Moreover, not all students have a home environment conducive to HBL."
2021-10-04-T-005-S-00221,2021-10-04-T-005,221,Chan Chun Sing,"The past few months have given us greater confidence that we can strike a balance by taking a more targeted approach to ringfence cases and their close contacts. For example, rather than resorting to full HBL across all schools, or the entire level, we would only place affected classes on HBL in response to a confirmed case, if there is a possibility of transmission within schools."
2021-10-04-T-005-S-00222,2021-10-04-T-005,222,Chan Chun Sing,"To reduce the possible disruption to the PSLE cohort and as an additional precautionary measure for Primary schools, we had placed all our Primary schools on HBL from 27 September to 6 October. Subsequently, when the national posture tightened, this was extended by a day to include 7 October, effectively covering Term 4, Week 3 to 4, or two weeks, given that Children's Day on 8 October is already a school holiday."
2021-10-04-T-005-S-00223,2021-10-04-T-005,223,Chan Chun Sing,Schools mitigate the impact of HBL by using technology to minimise disruption to curriculum coverage and maintain social connections. Teachers use online platforms and resources to ensure that students who are away from school can continue learning and conduct regular check-ins with these students to monitor their well-being. Schools have sufficient computing devices and Internet-enabling devices to loan to students and remain open for high needs students and those without alternative caregiving arrangements during HBL.
2021-10-04-T-005-S-00224,2021-10-04-T-005,224,Chan Chun Sing,We will continue to review the need for further periods of HBL based on the prevailing COVID-19 situation and national posture.
2021-10-04-T-005-S-00225,2021-10-04-T-005,225,Speaker,Mr Darryl David.
2021-10-04-T-005-S-00226,2021-10-04-T-005,226,Darryl David,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to thank the Minister for his answer and like to thank also all the teachers who are currently doing a good job at HBL, as a parent of child who is currently on HBL right now in Primary school. I have two supplementary questions, Mr Speaker."
2021-10-04-T-005-S-00227,2021-10-04-T-005,227,Darryl David,"The first one is that I understand the Minister's point about HBL not just for our Primary school students but also for keeping our PSLE cohort safe. However, moving forward beyond this week, does the Minister foresee the possibility of HBL being extended either into the future or perhaps even until the start of the school holidays?"
2021-10-04-T-005-S-00228,2021-10-04-T-005,228,Darryl David,"And also bearing in mind that we now have ""N"" level, ""O"" level and even ""A"" level examinations coming up, does the Minister foresee the possibility to keep those cohorts, say, protected as well, that HBL might be rolled out in Secondary schools and beyond?"
2021-10-04-T-005-S-00229,2021-10-04-T-005,229,Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, may I take the second question first and then, come back to the first."
2021-10-04-T-005-S-00230,2021-10-04-T-005,230,Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the considerations for the Primary schools and the Secondary schools are quite different. The main difference being that most of our Primary school kids, less half of the Primary 6 cohorts, are not vaccinated yet, which is why we have taken extra precautions for our Primary schools. For Secondary schools and above, a vast majority of our students have already been vaccinated. So, the kind of anxiety that the students or their families may face is quite different. We will do what is necessary to make sure that the ongoing ""N"" level and the upcoming ""O"" level and ""A"" level examinations can continue to be conducted safely."
2021-10-04-T-005-S-00231,2021-10-04-T-005,231,Chan Chun Sing,"On the first question as to whether we will extend HBL for the Primary schools, MOE will be making an announcement later this week. The reason why I am not making the announcement today are as follows."
2021-10-04-T-005-S-00232,2021-10-04-T-005,232,Chan Chun Sing,"One, we are in the middle of PSLE. I would like to have all the school leaders and the teachers to focus on the task at hand first. Second, we are also proceeding with our internal preparations and communications with our educators and I would like them to know our decision collectively first before we make the announcement later part of this week in tandem with the national posture."
2021-10-04-T-006-S-00233,2021-10-04-T-006,233,Shahira Abdullah,asked the Minister for Education as Singapore moves towards a COVID-19 endemic status and with the important need to strengthen students' relationships and social interactions for their holistic mental wellness and development (a) what is the expected timeline the Ministry has to further open up schools to normalcy; and (b) what are the possible changes that the schools may make by the end of the year.
2021-10-04-T-006-S-00234,2021-10-04-T-006,234,Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, MOE recognises that Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) and other interpersonal activities are important for student development and overall well-being. MOE has taken a calibrated approach to resume student activities, with reference to the national posture."
2021-10-04-T-006-S-00235,2021-10-04-T-006,235,Chan Chun Sing,"In-person CCAs and enrichment activities at the Secondary-level and above, including our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) resumed in August this year with the relevant safe management measures in place. With the tightening of the community safe management measures in the Stabilisation Phase from 27 September, MOE had suspended in-person CCAs and enrichment activities for Secondary and Junior College/Millenia Institute students. We hope to resume these activities when it is safe for our students to do so."
2021-10-04-T-006-S-00236,2021-10-04-T-006,236,Chan Chun Sing,"For Primary school students who are not yet eligible to be vaccinated, we have taken a more cautious approach, with in-person CCAs still suspended. We are monitoring the situation carefully and will decide at an appropriate juncture when to resume in-person CCAs and activities in a safe manner, complemented by stringent safe management and surveillance measures."
2021-10-04-T-006-S-00237,2021-10-04-T-006,237,Speaker,Dr Shahira Abdullah.
2021-10-04-T-006-S-00238,2021-10-04-T-006,238,Shahira Abdullah,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to thank the Minister for his answer. May I also ask what are the plants in future for regular testing of the children so that all these activities can open up faster?"
2021-10-04-T-006-S-00239,2021-10-04-T-006,239,Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Speaker, Sir, our testing for staff and children will follow the national posture. Suffice to say that, we understand the importance of resuming the CCAs for our students as soon as possible, as much as possible because this is all part of their overall development beyond the academic subjects that they do in school. A large part of the school curriculum also involves, what we call the Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs), which helps our children to build up their socio-emotional resilience and well-being. So, we will try to do that as much as possible, as soon as possible, in line with the national posture."
2021-10-04-T-007-S-00240,2021-10-04-T-007,240,Saktiandi Supaat,"asked the Minister for Education with school terms affected by home-based learning (a) what financial assistance is given to school canteen operators who are forced to shut during the school closures; (b) what is the total number of school canteen stall holders currently; and (c) since 2020, how many stall holders have given up their stall licences."
2021-10-04-T-007-S-00241,2021-10-04-T-007,241,Sun Xueling,"To support school canteen operators whose businesses may have been affected by safe management measures arising from the COVID-19 situation, MOE has been granting rental waivers for the affected periods, in line with the rental waivers provided for qualifying tenants in commercial properties owned by Government agencies at the national level in 2020 and 2021."
2021-10-04-T-007-S-00242,2021-10-04-T-007,242,Sun Xueling,"In 2020, MOE granted a four-month rental waiver for the months of April to August 2020. This excluded the month of May, which was the designated school holiday period in 2020. For 2021, we have granted two months of rental waiver for the months of May and July 2021, during Phase Two (Heightened Alert), and will be extending another half-month of rental waiver in October as part of the Government's support for sectors affected by the recent tightened measures."
2021-10-04-T-007-S-00243,2021-10-04-T-007,243,Sun Xueling,"Today, there are about 2,380 school canteen stallholders across our Government and Government-aided schools, a slight decrease from the 2,410 in 2020."
2021-10-04-T-007-S-00244,2021-10-04-T-007,244,Speaker,Mr Saktiandi Supaat.
2021-10-04-T-007-S-00245,2021-10-04-T-007,245,Saktiandi Supaat,"Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister of State for the answer. I have got two supplementary questions."
2021-10-04-T-007-S-00246,2021-10-04-T-007,246,Saktiandi Supaat,"One is that I am happy that the Minister of State mentioned that the rental waivers are being provided to the stallholders. But my question first is, how many school canteen assistants are affected by the school HBLs and ensuing stall closures? I have been approached by a number of our residents who are school canteen assistants, which are probably slightly more than the school stallholders?"
2021-10-04-T-007-S-00247,2021-10-04-T-007,247,Saktiandi Supaat,"The second question is, what form of assistance can we provide for them access CRGTs and other assistance if possible, especially the school canteen assistants, which could be residents of some of us here in the Chamber?"
2021-10-04-T-007-S-00248,2021-10-04-T-007,248,Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. School canteen operators are considered self-employed persons and the school canteen assistants employed by the operators are also considered for COVID-19 Recovery Grant (CRG) if they meet the qualifying criteria. So, to answer the Member's question, both the canteen operator as well as the assistants that they employ can qualify for CRG if they meet the qualifying criteria. I hope that addresses his question."
2021-10-04-T-008-S-00249,2021-10-04-T-008,249,Rachel Ong,"asked the Minister for Education (a) how many students are graduating from studies in hospitality, aviation and aerospace in 2021; and (b) whether and how will the Government support these graduating students to gain meaningful employment engagements given the challenges faced by these sectors during the COVID-19 pandemic."
2021-10-04-T-008-S-00250,2021-10-04-T-008,250,Gan Siow Huang,"Mr Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted many economic activities. The hospitality, aviation and aerospace sectors have been particularly impacted. The Government has been working closely with the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and the industry to support graduates entering the workforce since last year, including around 5,000 graduates from full-time courses related in hospitality, aviation and aerospace from the IHLs, who graduated between December 2020 and September 2021."
2021-10-04-T-008-S-00251,2021-10-04-T-008,251,Gan Siow Huang,"The SGUnited Traineeships Programme was introduced last year to provide fresh graduates with industry experience and the opportunity to convert their training to a full-time job. Over 10,200 graduates have benefited from this, including some from hospitality, aviation and aerospace courses. MOM and Workforce Singapore (WSG) have extended this programme until March 2022. Graduates also receive career guidance and assistance through the IHL Career Centres, WSG's Career Connect Centres and NTUC's e2i's career centres."
2021-10-04-T-008-S-00252,2021-10-04-T-008,252,Gan Siow Huang,"Graduates from harder-hit sectors, such as hospitality, aviation and aerospace who wish to explore new opportunities in adjacent sectors can also access career fairs organised by the IHLs as well. Graduates from the Class of 2020 and 2021 can also tap on the free Continuing Education and Training modules offered by the IHLs to enhance their skills while they seek employment. These courses will be available until March 2022."
2021-10-04-T-008-S-00253,2021-10-04-T-008,253,Gan Siow Huang,"These measures have helped cushion the impact of a challenging job market. About nine in 10 graduates from courses related to hospitality, aviation and aerospace who entered the labour market in 2020 were employed within six months after their final examinations or one year after completion of full-time National Service. Of those who were employed, about one in 10 were on boarded as trainees under the SGUnited Traineeships Programme. This is similar to the overall employment rate for Class of 2020 graduates across all IHL courses, as well as those who graduated in 2019 before the onset of COVID-19."
2021-10-04-T-008-S-00254,2021-10-04-T-008,254,Gan Siow Huang,The Government will continue to monitor the graduate employment situation closely as the economy recovers and prepare our graduates well in starting their first careers.
2021-10-04-T-008-S-00255,2021-10-04-T-008,255,Speaker,"Order. End of Question Time. Minister Shanmugam, I think you have something to raise?"
2021-10-04-T-008-S-00256,2021-10-04-T-008,256,Speaker,"[Pursuant to Standing Order No 22(3), Written Answers to Question Nos 28-30, 34, 38-39, 42, 46-53, 56-59, 62-64, 66, 69-70, 72-75, 77-78, 80-89, 91, 93-96, 99-101 and 104 on the Order Paper are reproduced in the Appendix.

2021-10-04-T-009-S-00257,2021-10-04-T-009,257,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, point of order, please."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00258,2021-10-04-T-009,258,Speaker,Mr Leong.
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00259,2021-10-04-T-009,259,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, I propose an amendment to the question that the Bill be now read a Second time. To leave out the word ""now"" and add —"
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00260,2021-10-04-T-009,260,Speaker,"Mr Leong, what are you referring to?"
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00261,2021-10-04-T-009,261,Leong Mun Wai,I am referring to the Bill that we are going to debate.
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00262,2021-10-04-T-009,262,Tan Chuan-Jin,"No, Minister Shanmugam has something else to raise."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00263,2021-10-04-T-009,263,Leong Mun Wai,"Oh, I beg your pardon."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00264,2021-10-04-T-009,264,K Shanmugam,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I had given Mr Speaker Notice that I wanted to make a short Ministerial Statement. This relates to something that was said in the Parliamentary Sitting on the 3 of August 2021, this year, by one of the Members of Parliament, Ms Khan, on the WP's Motion on Empowering Women."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00265,2021-10-04-T-009,265,K Shanmugam,"And Ms Khan had said that three years ago, she had accompanied a 25-year-old's survivor to file a Police report against a rape and that she saw the survivor coming out crying. The survivor told her that the Police officer had made comments about her dressing and the fact that she had been drinking. Ms Khan also shared her experience with this House about going with the victim to the Police, what she saw after she had filed the report and she cited it as an example of how law enforcement needs to ensure better treatment of sexual assault's survivors."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00266,2021-10-04-T-009,266,K Shanmugam,"My colleague, Minister of State Desmond Tan, then asked for more details about the incident so that the Government can investigate what happened. He explained that MHA takes these allegations very seriously and said that they had to be looked into to check if the case had been handled properly by the Police and that they should not be swept aside without further investigations."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00267,2021-10-04-T-009,267,K Shanmugam,Ms Khan's response was that she had raised the example as it was her personal experience with the rape survivor. She also stated her belief that these anecdotes are not isolated and expressed the hope that such incidents could start further discussions about how victims are treated. She went on to say that the incident happened three years ago and she did not wish to re-traumatise this survivor whom she had accompanied.
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00268,2021-10-04-T-009,268,K Shanmugam,"Later in the debate, Ms Khan rose again to further clarify that she raised the example because it was her experience with the survivor and that the episode took place three years ago and she had been unsuccessful in getting in touch with the victim. She said this in the context that and, I quote, ""consent is imperative not least to avoid re-victimisation."""
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00269,2021-10-04-T-009,269,K Shanmugam,"We take such allegations concerning the Police very seriously. Ms Khan had said that she did not the victim to be re-traumatised or re-victimised. I understand and empathise with that and we will bear that in mind as we seek to investigate what happened, especially since a Member has raised this here in Parliament, to make sure that we know what happened and, if necessary, discipline the Police officers involved. This does not have to mean naming the victim. We will consider carefully how to protect the victim and deal with these matters sensitively."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00270,2021-10-04-T-009,270,K Shanmugam,"What is extremely important is that we identify the Police station, the officers involved. I have given very clear instructions to the Police that we have to identify the officers involved, get their versions, to be fair to them. What further steps are taken, depend on the facts."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00271,2021-10-04-T-009,271,K Shanmugam,"The Government is very serious about making sure that the Police do the right thing. So, if they have not behaved well, then we must discipline them. That means investigating what happened, identifying the officers involved. That is how we have maintained an excellent Home Team."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00272,2021-10-04-T-009,272,K Shanmugam,"As I have said, this does not have to mean that the victim has to be named publicly. We will consider carefully how to proceed so as not to re-traumatise the victim. And for us to take this further, we need more details."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00273,2021-10-04-T-009,273,K Shanmugam,"So, can the Member – I ask the Member through you, Sir – to tell us at the very least the Police station that she went to with the victim and, if possible, the names of the Police officer or officers who attended to the victim and the Member; and if she cannot remember the names, then some details  how many officers were there, some description of them, rough age, race, male or female. Whatever details she can give."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00274,2021-10-04-T-009,274,K Shanmugam,"And when the Member saw the victim come out crying after her interview, did the Member bring this to the Police officers' attention? What did the Member say to the officers? How did the officers respond when alerted to the victim's reaction? And did the Member lodge a complaint about what happened, either at that time or after that? And I think the Member should be able to remember the month, the year when this happened when she went to the Police station. She told the Parliament three times that this happened three years ago. Can she confirm that this took place in 2018?"
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00275,2021-10-04-T-009,275,K Shanmugam,"I should add that since we take very seriously all these points, Police has spent a lot of time searching their records since this point was made. They do not seem to be able to identify a case where Ms Khan was present with the victim. It is entirely possible that they did not note down Ms Khan's name. But it is most important that the matter is not left hanging, with doubt over what may or may not have happened."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00276,2021-10-04-T-009,276,K Shanmugam,"And as I have said, our focus is on the Police officers, the reputation of Singapore Police Force to help the victim and for us to find out what happened and to try and make sure that Police officers understand better, if indeed it happened in this way and change their behaviour, if necessary, and for the message to go out to all Police officers."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00277,2021-10-04-T-009,277,K Shanmugam,"So, Sir, through you, may I ask Ms Khan for those details."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00278,2021-10-04-T-009,278,Speaker,"Ms Raeesah Khan, if you can furnish the details, please. Thank you."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00279,2021-10-04-T-009,279,Raeesah Khan,"I thank the Minister for the clarifications. Like I said, it did happen three years ago, and I have not been successful getting in touch with the person that I accompanied and with regards to confidentiality, I would prefer for it to remain that way."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00280,2021-10-04-T-009,280,K Shanmugam,"Sir, I asked which Police station, which month and the identities of the officers, to the extent Ms Khan knows them."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00281,2021-10-04-T-009,281,Speaker,"Ms Khan, to facilitate the investigation by the Police, to check."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00282,2021-10-04-T-009,282,Raeesah Khan,Thank you. I do not know the identity of the Police officers.
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00283,2021-10-04-T-009,283,Speaker,"And the questions on Police station, date and so on."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00284,2021-10-04-T-009,284,Raeesah Khan,"With regards to confidentiality, with the survivor, I will not like to reveal any of this information. Thank you."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00285,2021-10-04-T-009,285,K Shanmugam,"Sir, we are talking about the Police station. That has got nothing to do the confidentiality."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00286,2021-10-04-T-009,286,Speaker,Understand. Ms Raeesah Khan. The Minister is not asking about the identity of the individual.
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00287,2021-10-04-T-009,287,Raeesah Khan,"I understand but, with regards to confidentiality, I will not be revealing any other information. Thank you."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00288,2021-10-04-T-009,288,Speaker,Minister.
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00289,2021-10-04-T-009,289,K Shanmugam,"Sir, I have to say that, perhaps, Mr Speaker has the power to direct answers since the matter has been raised and through you, Sir, I ask for the direction to be given that we be told which Police station and the month; if not the date, at least the month and which Police station."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00290,2021-10-04-T-009,290,Speaker,"Ms Khan, I think that is a fair question. Would you like to respond or are you holding to the same position? The reason is that certain allegations have been made which I think are fair and serious. The Police, I understand, would like to follow up to check to make sure that they can rectify the situation. So, any leads would be useful without divulging the name of the lady concerned."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00291,2021-10-04-T-009,291,Raeesah Khan,Thank you. I would still like for it to remain confidential. Thank you.
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00292,2021-10-04-T-009,292,Speaker,Minister.
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00293,2021-10-04-T-009,293,K Shanmugam,"Sir, I do not understand this point about confidentiality. Can I ask through you, Sir, for Ms Khan to confirm in this House that everything she has told us is accurate, that she did accompany such a person and such an incident did happen."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00294,2021-10-04-T-009,294,Speaker,Ms Khan.
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00295,2021-10-04-T-009,295,Raeesah Khan,Yes.
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00296,2021-10-04-T-009,296,K Shanmugam,"Sir, we have checked our records. We have no such case that fits in with the description that has been given by the Member. I wanted to give her the option of giving us the best information she has but she confirms that such an incident happened that she accompanied this victim to the Police station and that she does not wish to divulge the information only because of confidentiality."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00297,2021-10-04-T-009,297,K Shanmugam,Speaker and Members will know that confidentiality does not extend to not telling us which Police station.
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00298,2021-10-04-T-009,298,K Shanmugam,"Sir, I will leave it here for now but that does not mean the matter rests. The Police will investigate this very serious matter further. The officers in-charge and the Police will interview Ms Khan and any allegations of misconduct concerning specific officers will be referred to SPF's Internal Affairs Office for further investigation."
2021-10-04-T-009-S-00299,2021-10-04-T-009,299,K Shanmugam,"I will say to Ms Khan, through you, Sir, that at the very least, she must remember which Police station, which year this happened and which month and some details of the number and the ages and the races of the police officers whom she says and she has confirmed for us that she did see them. Thank you, Sir."

2021-10-04-T-021-S-00331,2021-10-04-T-021,331,K Shanmugam,"Thank you, Sir. Mr Speaker, I beg to move, that the Bill be now read a second time."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00332,2021-10-04-T-021,332,K Shanmugam,This Bill covers two aspects.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00333,2021-10-04-T-021,333,K Shanmugam,"First, dealing with Online Hostile Information Campaigns – we call them HICs – conducted by foreign parties. I will refer to that as the HIC part."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00334,2021-10-04-T-021,334,K Shanmugam,"And the second part dealing with foreign interference through local proxies. The second part, I will refer to it as the Politically Significant Persons or PSP part."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00335,2021-10-04-T-021,335,K Shanmugam,"The second part is about slightly more than half of this Bill. There is existing law, the Political Donations Act (PDA) and we have ported over the existing PDA and updated it. Members of Parliament will be familiar with the PDA. So, it is the PDA which has been brought into the PSP part of the Bill, with updating."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00336,2021-10-04-T-021,336,K Shanmugam,"I will set out the reasons for this Bill, deal with some of the concerns that have been raised and deal with the proposed amendments by the Workers' Party. My colleagues, Ministers of State Desmond Tan and Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, will take the Members through the detailed provisions of the Bill."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00337,2021-10-04-T-021,337,K Shanmugam,"First, on the PSP part of the Bill. The philosophy is that our politics is for Singaporeans to deal with. We can argue, disagree, but ultimately, it is for us to decide."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00338,2021-10-04-T-021,338,K Shanmugam,"If I can quote what the former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director James Comey told the House Intelligence Committee in March 2017, ""One of the things we radiate to the world is the importance of our wonderful, often messy, but free and fair democratic system and the elections that undergird it. And so, when there is something by a foreign nation state to mess with that, to destroy that, to corrupt that, it is very, very serious and threatens what is America."" The very idea of America."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00339,2021-10-04-T-021,339,K Shanmugam,"We do not put it in the same grandiose terms but Singapore is important for us and we take the same approach. We say it is not for the Americans to tell us what to do, as they have tried, and is it not for anyone else to tell us what to do either."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00340,2021-10-04-T-021,340,K Shanmugam,"This was expressed in 1973 in the President's speech and expressed in law through the PDA, which sets out rules for interactions with foreigners for election candidates, election agents and political associations."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00341,2021-10-04-T-021,341,K Shanmugam,"The PSP part, as I said, is based on existing legislation, the PDA, ported over."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00342,2021-10-04-T-021,342,K Shanmugam,"Over the years, subversion has become an even more serious issue. Modern ease of communications, increased interactions and travel have made it inevitable that traditional spying and subversion increases in scope and intensity. This is happening in Singapore and elsewhere."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00343,2021-10-04-T-021,343,K Shanmugam,Just to give some examples from the last few years.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00344,2021-10-04-T-021,344,K Shanmugam,"In 2017, an Australian former senator apparently received donations from an individual with connections to the People's Republic of China (PRC) government. He then advocated for China's position on the South China Sea."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00345,2021-10-04-T-021,345,K Shanmugam,"A former chairman of a European Union foreign friendship group was sponsored flights and hotel stays by a foreign government and subsequently, voiced views that supported that government's policies on various issues."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00346,2021-10-04-T-021,346,K Shanmugam,"In 2019, leaked documents revealed that the Russian government was allegedly planning to provide financial and public relations assistance to the election campaign of German politician Markus Frohnmaier, who was known to be very outspoken in favour of ending sanctions and recognising Russia's annexation of Crimea."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00347,2021-10-04-T-021,347,K Shanmugam,This has also happened in Singapore. Members would be familiar with the expulsion of academic Huang Jing in 2017 for collaborating with foreign intelligence agents. It was an attempt to influence senior decision-makers in Government.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00348,2021-10-04-T-021,348,K Shanmugam,Moving on to the HIC part of the Bill. The reasons are straightforward.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00349,2021-10-04-T-021,349,K Shanmugam,"Spying and subversion in another country are age-old. Using spies, agents, locals and useful idiots is all part of subversion."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00350,2021-10-04-T-021,350,K Shanmugam,"As technology developed, the subversion increased and adapted new technology  phone tapping, cameras, recording, microfilming and so on."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00351,2021-10-04-T-021,351,K Shanmugam,"Now, technology has evolved again. The Internet has created a powerful new medium for subversion. Countries are actively developing attack and defence capabilities as an arm of warfare equal to and more potent than the land, air and naval forces. It is often seen as the fourth arm of service."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00352,2021-10-04-T-021,352,K Shanmugam,"The Gerasimov Doctrine, named after the Russian chief of staff, identifies issues of ""protest potential"" in another country, uses information operations to polarise that society and incite public disorder and keeps the target country in a constant state of turmoil. Aggressors can more easily achieve their political and military outcomes."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00353,2021-10-04-T-021,353,K Shanmugam,New communication tools facilitate non-kinetic forms of attack and make these harder to detect.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00354,2021-10-04-T-021,354,K Shanmugam,"For example, bots and digital ads can easily be bought to spread harmful information. Foreign actors can blend their activities with other authentic online users, which gives readers a false sense of reality."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00355,2021-10-04-T-021,355,K Shanmugam,"We have an annex that sets out more details of the Gerasimov Doctrine, the new communications tools and HIC tactics used by foreign state actors. Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, can I ask for the distribution of a folder which contains annexes A to I that I am going to refer to? And we distribute them together, so that it is easier."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00356,2021-10-04-T-021,356,Speaker,"Yes, please. ["
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00357,2021-10-04-T-021,357,K Shanmugam,May I proceed as the annexes are being distributed?
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00358,2021-10-04-T-021,358,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00359,2021-10-04-T-021,359,K Shanmugam,"If Members were to look at annex A, paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4, they refer to the Russians developing a military doctrine for the Internet age."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00360,2021-10-04-T-021,360,K Shanmugam,"The doctrine took tactics developed by the Soviets, blended them with strategic military thinking about total war and laid out a theory of modern warfare. It specifies that its objective is to achieve an environment of permanent unrest and conflict within an enemy state. It includes harnessing the protest potential of the population of a target country, deepening the divisions within that, increasing hostility among different groups and getting them to distrust institutions."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00361,2021-10-04-T-021,361,K Shanmugam,"With this doctrine, the rules of war have changed. Non-military means of achieving political and strategic goals without using the force of weapons, including utilising a range of actors and tools, hackers, the media, businessmen, information leaks and misinformation, are all part and parcel of new warfare."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00362,2021-10-04-T-021,362,K Shanmugam,"The Russians are said to have done this. We have no way of verifying that. The following examples, which I will refer to, are based on reports."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00363,2021-10-04-T-021,363,K Shanmugam,Ukraine is said to have suffered extensive intervention. Russia allegedly deployed this doctrine for many years.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00364,2021-10-04-T-021,364,K Shanmugam,"One example. During the 2014 protests, sensitive fault lines were targeted to paint the Ukrainian government as a fascist, racist, xenophobic junta. They claimed that Jews were being terrorised and beaten and asserted that local Jewish leaders were appealing to international bodies for help. They tried to weaken the resolve of the armed forces and the population to build popular support for Crimea to join Russia. Eventually, of course, we know Crimea was annexed."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00365,2021-10-04-T-021,365,K Shanmugam,"Czech Republic. Our 2018 Parliamentary Select Committee received evidence that Russia had targeted extremists and fringe politicians to spread propaganda, undermine support for Ukraine and cause one-quarter to one-third of the Czech population to believe that the Ukrainian government was fascist. And it resulted in the Czech government being unable to support the Ukrainians. So, the HICs managed to change Czech foreign policy."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00366,2021-10-04-T-021,366,K Shanmugam,"Netherlands. During the Dutch Referendum on the EU-Ukraine FTA, Russians pretended to be Ukrainians, inflamed local debates, supported by online disinformation campaign involving fake stories about Ukraine and Dutch voters eventually voted against the FTA."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00367,2021-10-04-T-021,367,K Shanmugam,"Annex B sets out some of the details. If Members were to see annex B, page 8 refers to Ukraine – look at item 3 of page 8. Item 4, the use of tools. Page 10, paragraph 6, the consequences as a result of the campaign. Page 11, the interference in Czech Republic, paragraph 2 sets out how it has been successful, that 53% of the Czechs believed there is propaganda both for and against a foreign country in the Czech public space and therefore they cannot trust anything. That is another objective that people try and achieve  make you distrustful of everything. And page 12, interference in Netherlands. The box sets out the reference to the FTA referendum."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00368,2021-10-04-T-021,368,K Shanmugam,"More recently, Russia was allegedly engaged in campaigns to erode trust in the EU’s COVID-19 strategy and to spread scepticism of Western-developed vaccines. As I said earlier, Russia is repeatedly mentioned. I am repeating what others have said and Singapore does not take a position on this."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00369,2021-10-04-T-021,369,K Shanmugam,Countries other than Russia are also said to have also been using these strategies.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00370,2021-10-04-T-021,370,K Shanmugam,"In May 2019, a disinformation network was traced to Iran. This comprised fake persons who sought to influence US policymakers and also reporters and academics to carry their views. Some of these were eventually published in legitimate publications. Annex C sets out more details of reports that have identified Iran as a foreign state actor."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00371,2021-10-04-T-021,371,K Shanmugam,"In December 2020, the BBC reported on a vast 15-year global disinformation campaign to serve one particular country’s interests. This campaign spread over at least 116 countries, more than half of the world's countries, and targeted members of the European Parliament as well as the United Nations. It involved the use of stolen accounts and at least 750 fake media outlets, which were amplified with the help of a legitimate foreign wire service. So, you can see the use of legitimate news organisations."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00372,2021-10-04-T-021,372,K Shanmugam,"February 2021, the social media analysis firm, Graphika, released a report on a propaganda coordinated network in favour of one country called “Spamouflage Dragon”. Using a mixture of bots, fake accounts, stolen accounts and so on to push and amplify videos and media targeting issues such as the safety of Western-made vaccines and discrediting the United States."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00373,2021-10-04-T-021,373,K Shanmugam,"A 2020 study by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute found that there has been a significant increase worldwide in foreign interference. Between 2015 and 2020, at least 38 Elections and 6 Referendums were impacted."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00374,2021-10-04-T-021,374,K Shanmugam,"The international media regularly names Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. I do not know whether these countries in fact did what they are said to have done. But few doubt that they have the capabilities. It is notable that the US and other Western countries are not mentioned in these generally in these reports because they are Western media reports. But anyone sensible will know that the United States, UK and Western countries have similar or perhaps, in the case of the United States, even superior capabilities. Really, there are no angels in this game."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00375,2021-10-04-T-021,375,K Shanmugam,"The Washington Post reported on 11 February 2020 that a Swiss encryption communications provider had sold devices to more than 120 countries. That company was actually secretly owned by the CIA and the German Intelligence. They had rigged the devices to read the encrypted communications of all the countries, 120 odd countries, that had bought the system. Reading secret, most confidential communications, of their own allies and of course, adversaries."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00376,2021-10-04-T-021,376,K Shanmugam,"The story was then released years after, after everything has been done and closed. The Washington Post wrote up the exposé based on a CIA internal history of the operation in 2004. So, CIA history was in 2004; the Washington Post released the story in 2020. And they also based it on an internal oral history project by the German intelligence in 2008. But everything was kept under wraps, until simultaneously published by the Post and a German broadcaster on 11 February 2020."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00377,2021-10-04-T-021,377,K Shanmugam,"So, it has all the hallmarks of a deliberate, planned leak. Members might recall that at about the same time, a bit before that, but through that period, the US government was very seriously warning everyone about the dangers of relying on technology from China. So, basically, without embarrassment, this leak came out saying we did it, and now be careful about the Chinese. Have the Americans actually stopped? We can only guess. But it is now got to be taken as a given that this sort of thing will be done regularly and everyone will face this."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00378,2021-10-04-T-021,378,K Shanmugam,"It has become very easy and inexpensive to do. The Select Committee in 2018 heard 1 million Instagram ""Likes"" cost US$18, to get 100 Twitter followers, likes, or re-tweets cost 34 US cents, and to organise a street protest in the US through online costs about US$200,000. These details are in annex D. It also gives examples of HICs targeting democratic processes, if you look at annex D."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00379,2021-10-04-T-021,379,K Shanmugam,"And it is a cottage industry as well because there are reports of an active Macedonian disinformation industry. Young Macedonians have Internet access, some basic training to create fake news websites. In the final weeks of the 2016 US Presidential Elections, over 140 “fake news” US politics websites were traced to Macedonia, and these overtook mainstream news producers in their share of election stories shared on Facebook. The details are in annex E."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00380,2021-10-04-T-021,380,K Shanmugam,"Singapore. A few days ago, the French Military School Strategic Research Institute published a Report on Influence Operations. Singapore was among the countries featured as case studies. The report noted that there were several factors which made Singapore vulnerable. Our size, our hyper-connectivity, our multi-ethnic and multi-religious society. The report said we were resilient through a counter-narrative of our Singaporean identity and by our swift reactions against hate speech. It concluded that we, along with Sweden, were one of the best prepared states in the fight against information manipulation and hybrid threats in general."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00381,2021-10-04-T-021,381,K Shanmugam,"I am not so sanguine as the people who wrote this report. Our racial and religious mix is easily exploitable by different countries and we see a steady build-up of different narratives which is being very cleverly done. It is not obvious propaganda but it conditions people to think in certain ways, particularly on foreign policy issues, often appealing to a larger racial identity beyond the Singaporean identity."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00382,2021-10-04-T-021,382,K Shanmugam,"In my view, this is one of the most serious threats we face. Our population, and I think most Members of Parliament, are not really aware of this."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00383,2021-10-04-T-021,383,K Shanmugam,"Singapore has been subjected to attacks in recent times, both cyber attacks as well as cyber manipulation."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00384,2021-10-04-T-021,384,K Shanmugam,"Cyber attack in 2018, hackers targeted SingHealth’s databases and stole the particulars of 1.5 million patients, including the Prime Minister's data."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00385,2021-10-04-T-021,385,K Shanmugam,"Cyber manipulation, I will give a couple of examples. During a period of tension with another country between 2016 and 2017, we experienced a coordinated HIC that attempted to undermine our foreign policy position. Online commentaries and videos were uploaded by social media accounts which had lain dormant for many years. Many of these were in Mandarin and targeted our Chinese-speaking population. These contents were also widely circulated via chat apps and aimed to influence sentiments among Singaporeans."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00386,2021-10-04-T-021,386,K Shanmugam,"In another case, during a period of bilateral tension with a country in 2018, we saw a large spike in online comments critical of Singapore and many came from anonymous accounts. They sought to give an artificial impression of widespread objection to Singapore’s position."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00387,2021-10-04-T-021,387,K Shanmugam,"I will say so far these have been relatively low level except for the strategic move, the attempts to condition our people's thinking, which is going on."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00388,2021-10-04-T-021,388,K Shanmugam,"Before I deal with some of the substantive points of this Bill, let me also deal with the issue of timing."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00389,2021-10-04-T-021,389,K Shanmugam,"Some have said there have been no discussions, why is this Bill being put through so quickly?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00390,2021-10-04-T-021,390,K Shanmugam,"Have there been no discussions? We have been talking about this very seriously for more than three years; extensively. The Select Committee heard extensive evidence in 2018 on this. The evidence, the reports that I have been referring to so far in the various annexes, most of it comes from the evidence given in 2018 to the Parliamentary Select Committee."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00391,2021-10-04-T-021,391,K Shanmugam,"I would like to refer Members to annex F. It sets out the discussion that have taken place and the summary of the testimonies given at the Select Committee. Twenty different types of evidence – persons, organisations, including experts, gave evidence on the seriousness of the foreign threat. I will touch on some of the evidence that was given at the Select Committee."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00392,2021-10-04-T-021,392,K Shanmugam,"Disinformation expert, Mr Ben Nimmo testified on the Internet Research Agency (IRA)'s various tactics, said to be controlled by Russia, tactics to boost support for Mr Trump as he then was and opposition to Mrs Clinton during the 2016 US Presidential Elections and to widen the divide in the US between the Black Lives Matter movement and the Police."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00393,2021-10-04-T-021,393,K Shanmugam,"Dr Kevin Limonier, a French cybersecurity expert, spoke of an alleged Russian HIC that tried to sway the 2017 French Presidential Elections using a combination of state media, social media platforms and bots, including by attempting to spread leaked emails on the eve of the election to discredit the Macron campaign."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00394,2021-10-04-T-021,394,K Shanmugam,Experts also highlighted that Singapore has been targeted and is especially vulnerable when race and religion is used as an issue of protest potential.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00395,2021-10-04-T-021,395,K Shanmugam,Dr Shashi Jayakumar said that it would be a mistake to assume that foreign HICs were not already happening.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00396,2021-10-04-T-021,396,K Shanmugam,"Dr Gulizar Haciyakupoglu gave testimony behind closed doors, because of the sensitivity, and said there were indicators of information warfare being practised against Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00397,2021-10-04-T-021,397,K Shanmugam,Dr Liew Kai Khiun highlighted the barrage of comments by seemingly Myanmar-based user accounts on social media news portals of Singapore’s mainstream news networks. These were inflammatory with Islamophobic tones and incited backlash from Singaporean Muslims.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00398,2021-10-04-T-021,398,K Shanmugam,Dr Michael Raska highlighted that foreign states could engage in information operations that target our faultlines as a means of asymmetric warfare given Singapore’s traditional military strength.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00399,2021-10-04-T-021,399,K Shanmugam,"This is an important point that I will ask Members to take note of. I once heard our then Defence Minister, Dr Tony Tan, describe our defence strategy in the following terms. Singapore’s defence strategy is predicated on the superiority of our military in the region. Our conventional military strength has got to be clearly superior; and it is clearly superior."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00400,2021-10-04-T-021,400,K Shanmugam,"The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is very well regarded both in the region and globally for its professionalism, its technological edge and the interoperability of our systems – what Mr Lee Kuan Yew said, the vision of a ""poisoned shrimp"". But that means, as Dr Raska pointed out, is that the Internet becomes a particularly attractive theatre for our adversaries who would seek to do us harm. I will ask Members of Parliament to register this point in particular. Our conventional military superiority ironically means we become an even bigger target online."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00401,2021-10-04-T-021,401,K Shanmugam,"This topic was also quite extensively referenced in the Select Committee Report and discussed several times in Parliament. And if you look at annex F(2) that sets out the discussions that had taken place in Parliament. There were Questions and answers that emphasised our vulnerability. The Select Committee recommended that measures be taken and we have said that in Parliament that legislation will be considered and legislation will be necessary. I made speeches in Committee of Supply (COS) 2019 as well as COS this year, and made it clear that legislation was needed."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00402,2021-10-04-T-021,402,K Shanmugam,"You can also refer to my speech at a major international conference in September 2019, pages 26 and 27. I did, at that point, referenced Mr PJ Thum and Ms Han. I will come back to this, but I made it clear that legislation is going to be needed. That conference was held in Singapore on 25 September 2019 with 10 international and local speakers, experts."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00403,2021-10-04-T-021,403,K Shanmugam,"Prof Allan Rock, a former Canadian Cabinet Minister at that conference noted that tools of interference were well-known  dissemination of false information, hacking and leaking. And he said governments have got to take this seriously and take counter-measures that protect the electoral system that candidates, political parties and voters from information manipulation."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00404,2021-10-04-T-021,404,K Shanmugam,"This topic of foreign interference has been extensively covered in media as well. That is set out in annex F(3). If you look at the headlines on some of them, it says, ""Stronger laws planned to combat foreign interference"" and ""Singapore to have legislation to combat increased risk of foreign interference."""
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00405,2021-10-04-T-021,405,K Shanmugam,"Annex F(4) shows – and I am giving a small sample of extensive studies internationally – Brookings Institute, RAND Institute and the Council for Foreign Relations have all commissioned and published studies. So, this topic has been extensively discussed and debated for over three years."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00406,2021-10-04-T-021,406,K Shanmugam,"The other comments made  it is a very long Bill. Members of Parliament are used to lengthy Bills, you understand the structure, you understand which are the key provisions, you understand the Explanatory Statement, you take view and then you go through all the provisions again, look at the accompanying statements, infographics and get a better sense."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00407,2021-10-04-T-021,407,K Shanmugam,"As I have said, more than half of this Bill is based on the PDA which Members will or should be familiar with. The rest on HIC, and it is set out fairly comprehensively."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00408,2021-10-04-T-021,408,K Shanmugam,"I think the threat of foreign interference and its seriousness is not disputed by most people. Most people also agree that something needs to be done. So, this is the context in which we are moving this Bill."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00409,2021-10-04-T-021,409,K Shanmugam,"Before we consider the Bill, it is useful to first consider the current powers to deal with subversion."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00410,2021-10-04-T-021,410,K Shanmugam,"Today, assume a person X is suspected of being a foreign agent or acting for a foreign agency against Singapore's interests. Such a suspected foreign agent can be detained without trial under the Internal Security Act (ISA). Investigations can be conducted. Section 20 of the CPC allows the Police to ask anyone in Singapore, individuals as well as companies for information. Not just under the ISA, under any legislation if there are investigations. Ask anyone in Singapore, individuals as well as companies for information and require them to produce any document or item for investigation."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00411,2021-10-04-T-021,411,K Shanmugam,"So, under current laws, suppose there is an online campaign and there is a basis to believe that this is foreign agency or entity inspired and it is prejudicial to our national security, then investigations can be conducted under ISA. Information, including the writer's identity, will have to be made available under the CPC. The writer and anyone else suspected of subversion can be detained. Any challenge will be heard by the ISA Tribunal, not by the High Court. And it is not public, unless the ISD decides to make it so. This applies equally, whether the subversion is done online or in the physical world."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00412,2021-10-04-T-021,412,K Shanmugam,One of the pieces of misinformation that is being put out is that the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act or FICA would now allow the Government to get any information and that this is a new power. Section 20 of the CPC has been used all these years and it is in broad terms to get any information for investigations.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00413,2021-10-04-T-021,413,K Shanmugam,"When we talk about powers, the powers to detain, to investigate, I will refer to them as ""Substantive Powers""."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00414,2021-10-04-T-021,414,K Shanmugam,"The powers to enforce, like requiring the taking down of material, I will refer to them as ""Executory Powers""."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00415,2021-10-04-T-021,415,K Shanmugam,"There are several Executory Powers now available now, including under the Broadcasting Act which allows the Government to deal with objectionable content in the Internet space. It allows for directions to be issued to broadcasting licensees and for content to be taken down or blocked."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00416,2021-10-04-T-021,416,K Shanmugam,"The Telecommunications Act gives powers to allow for directions to be issued to telecommunications licensees in the public interest, including the stopping, delaying and censoring of messages."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00417,2021-10-04-T-021,417,K Shanmugam,"The Public Order Act allows the Government to regulate physical assemblies and processions. The Commissioner of Police may deny permits for such events that are ""directed towards a political end"" and involve foreign entities or individuals."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00418,2021-10-04-T-021,418,K Shanmugam,"So, the issues of what directions might call the ""protest potential"" are regulated in the physical word. Logically, similar rules should apply in the online space."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00419,2021-10-04-T-021,419,K Shanmugam,"The current Political Donations Act requires those that are directly involved in our political processes, be they political parties, election candidates and their agents, to declare their political donations. The Act prohibits the receipt of foreign funding and has a cap on anonymous donations."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00420,2021-10-04-T-021,420,K Shanmugam,"So, I have taken the House through the current legal landscape. What does FICA add to the current powers?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00421,2021-10-04-T-021,421,K Shanmugam,"Take the example I gave earlier, say X is acting for a foreign agency. He has an agenda to subvert our political process, subvert our sovereignty and he conducts an online campaign."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00422,2021-10-04-T-021,422,K Shanmugam,"Today, as I have explained, action will be taken under the ISA. And bear in mind that foreign agencies will often use legitimate looking fronts. Annex G sets out the examples of such legitimate looking fronts."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00423,2021-10-04-T-021,423,K Shanmugam,"If FICA is passed, then we can proceed under FICA if we can show that online communications activity has been prepared or planned, by or on behalf of a foreign principal and it is in the public interest to give one or more directions."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00424,2021-10-04-T-021,424,K Shanmugam,"Example of directions that can be issued include for a communicator to take down his content, for an Internet intermediary to take down the content and for an Internet intermediary to suspend or terminate the account. The person can also be arrested and prosecuted if an offence of clandestine foreign interference is made out. But under FICA, there is no detention without trial."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00425,2021-10-04-T-021,425,K Shanmugam,"Public interest is defined as including activities ""directed towards a political end"". This is taken from the Public Order Act to prohibit foreigners from organising or taking part in public assemblies directed towards such ends and FICA applies this definition to the online space."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00426,2021-10-04-T-021,426,K Shanmugam,"The Executory Powers under FICA are more calibrated. I referred earlier to the Broadcasting Act and directions can be issued. Under the Telecommunications Act, directions can be issued to telecommunications licensees. And in both Acts, there are limits to judicial review."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00427,2021-10-04-T-021,427,K Shanmugam,"So, what in the HIC part of FICA goes further than the current laws? Mainly, in extraterritorial application. Because it now explicitly includes global platforms which are often vectors for HICs. So, that updates the analogue powers for the Internet age. For example, in the analogue world, you have the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act (NPPA) and the Broadcasting Act. They provide powers to proscribe foreign newspapers and broadcasting services. The digital equivalent under FICA is a Proscribed Online Locations App Removal. In the analogue world, the Broadcasting Act provides the power to order a TV station to carry a message. The digital equivalent under FICA is a must-carry direction, issued to communicator, social media services."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00428,2021-10-04-T-021,428,K Shanmugam,I will ask Members to refer to annex H which has two charts.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00429,2021-10-04-T-021,429,K Shanmugam,"First, Chart 1, and this is quite important. If you look at Chart 1, the existing powers are in light green and the updated powers under FICA are in darker green. So, on the left, what is headed ""Substantive Powers"". Today, you see the existing powers of investigation and of arrest and detention, in light green. It can be seen that FICA is an update to ensure that our laws can deal with online HICs, by allowing for disclosure of information by global platforms, and new offences which have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt in Court for perpetrating HICs in a clandestine way. If you look at the top right hand side, it shows how existing laws cover foreign interference via traditional media – the Broadcasting Act and the NPPA. And the bottom right, the light green boxes show how online, there are powers to intervene under the Broadcasting Act and the Telecommunications Act. What FICA does, in the dark green boxes, is targeted and more calibrated directions."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00430,2021-10-04-T-021,430,K Shanmugam,"If you look at Chart 2. The existing PDA is in green; FICA in pink or red. On the left, the green box shows what PDA provides today. All the measures in that box apply to gazetted political associations. Under FICA, at the first instance, the only measure that applies to a designated PSP is in the first red box in the second column which is annual declaration of donations. If there is heightened threat of foreign interference, then, the other red boxes can be applied by the competent authority."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00431,2021-10-04-T-021,431,K Shanmugam,"To use another example, suppose we discover that a Singapore company has been secretly hired by a foreign intelligence agency to put out memes and videos on social media, and to spread the view that a particular ethnic group is persecuted. And the aim, let us say, is to drive a wedge between ethnic groups in Singapore. What would we do today? The company’s officers can be detained under the ISA. Other laws can also potentially be used. This can be reviewed if their detention is under the ISA by the ISA Tribunal. There is no judicial review except in relation to compliance with procedural requirements under the Act."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00432,2021-10-04-T-021,432,K Shanmugam,"Where the content crosses the threshold of other laws like the Penal Code, of course, criminal investigations can be initiated. The CPC comes in – that will allow any information about the company's activities or that of its staff to be obtained. And there is a legal obligation for the information to be provided by anyone in Singapore when the Police ask for it, including Internet companies. And these actions can be pre-emptive."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00433,2021-10-04-T-021,433,K Shanmugam,"Under FICA, directions can be issued to tech companies to disable access to the content or restrict those accounts from view of end users in Singapore, if the thresholds are met. These can stem the HIC without having to block the entire platform."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00434,2021-10-04-T-021,434,K Shanmugam,"Social media platforms can also be asked to provide information to support an investigation into a HIC. Today, if this data resides abroad, we cannot do so, under the CPC."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00435,2021-10-04-T-021,435,K Shanmugam,"The Government would also have the option of charging the company and its officers under FICA for clandestine foreign interference and prosecuting them in open court. So, that deals with the HIC part of FICA."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00436,2021-10-04-T-021,436,K Shanmugam,"There has been some degree of misrepresentation on FICA, that this Bill seeks to curtail normal interactions with foreigners. That is not true. Singapore depends for its success and vitality on being open, and a Government that seeks to close down that will lead Singapore to ruin."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00437,2021-10-04-T-021,437,K Shanmugam,I actually want the House to see how our approach compares that with the US and Australia.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00438,2021-10-04-T-021,438,K Shanmugam,"In the US, under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), it covers people and organisations that are under the control of a foreign government or organisations or persons outside of the United States. Under the US' FARA, a ""foreign principal"" is defined very broadly, and any political activity that is designed to influence government decision-making on behalf of a foreign principal will require or trigger registration."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00439,2021-10-04-T-021,439,K Shanmugam,"For instance, take something that we take as normal. An American citizen meeting a US Congressman and advocating for his company's product. If the company was a foreign company, an MNC, that will trigger registration. So, the American provision is quite broad. That scenario will not meet the thresholds for designation of PSPs under FICA."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00440,2021-10-04-T-021,440,K Shanmugam,"On the HIC part and how it applies, I will deal with it later."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00441,2021-10-04-T-021,441,K Shanmugam,"Let us also look at Australia. The Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme (FITS) covers government-related entitles and individuals who have arrangements with foreign principals or undertake certain activities on behalf of foreign principals. Under Australia's FITS, any activity by a former Commonwealth politician would trigger the threshold for registration. So, you could be an ex-Minister or an ex-Member of Parliament of any political party, and if you did this, it will trigger."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00442,2021-10-04-T-021,442,K Shanmugam,"Singapore, under FICA, on the PSP Part, only covers Defined and Designated PSPs. So, a much, much, much narrower group. Why have we taken this approach? Because we are not the US; we are not Australia; we are Singapore; we are an international hub. Interactions with international counterparts, business people, siting of MNCs in Singapore – all of these are vital for us."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00443,2021-10-04-T-021,443,K Shanmugam,"In this Bill, action can be taken in respect of HIC if the following conditions are satisfied."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00444,2021-10-04-T-021,444,K Shanmugam,"Internet activity by or on behalf of a foreign principal and public interest in Singapore is affected. I am paraphrasing, but in essence."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00445,2021-10-04-T-021,445,K Shanmugam,"A PSP Designation is possible if the activities are directed towards a political end and it is in the public interest that countermeasures should be applied. So, one of the key points for both areas is the phrase ""Public Interest""."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00446,2021-10-04-T-021,446,K Shanmugam,"The definition of ""Public Interest"" includes the requirement of ""proportionality"", which the Minister or Authority will have to consider in arriving at a decision. The ""Public Interest"" test imports a built-in requirement of proportionality for the Minister before deciding on a Part [3} direction."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00447,2021-10-04-T-021,447,K Shanmugam,"The definition of ""Public Interest"" refers to ""necessary or expedient""; that is clause 7. So, if a decision has to be made on the basis of ""necessary or expedient"", you have got to look at the facts carefully and the actions you want to take must be proportional."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00448,2021-10-04-T-021,448,K Shanmugam,"Take an example. Two academics, one of them foreign, collaborate on a paper on LGBT issues. It will be difficult to say it is necessary or expedient to issue Directions under FICA and, really, try explaining that to a Supreme Court Judge, who will chair the Tribunal, that it is necessary or expedient."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00449,2021-10-04-T-021,449,K Shanmugam,"The vast majority of collaborations, linkages will not meet the required conditions. And they will also not meet the requirement of proportionality."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00450,2021-10-04-T-021,450,K Shanmugam,"As an aside, and this has been raised by Member of Parliament Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, if a foreigner writes articles on controversial issues using his own name, or clearly stated to be a foreigner, people can assess the value, credibility, weight, and it is generally unlikely to be necessary or expedient to issue directions. But it depends on the facts. If there is a basis to believe that he is doing so, for example, as part of a hostile campaign, or is acting for a foreign agency, with the intent of causing damage to Singapore, then directions could be given, subject to the test of proportionality. And if he disagrees, he can appeal to the Tribunal."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00451,2021-10-04-T-021,451,K Shanmugam,"Likewise and, again, I think this arises from Assoc Prof Lim's proposed amendments. If the Economist or New York Times publish articles, it would not be possible to invoke FICA. However, if there is more to it, if a foreign newspaper is being used as part of a campaign targeting Singapore, that may be different. But again, it comes back to proportionality, the nature of the actions, the likely effect, the likely intent, several other factors."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00452,2021-10-04-T-021,452,K Shanmugam,"Newspapers – it does not mean automatically they are all kosher. They have often been used as a front for such activities, which is why I put annex G in. Legitimate newspapers, newswires have all been used as fronts. So, you cannot give a carte blanche exception but it is most unlikely that many of these would be a front unless we have very clear other evidence."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00453,2021-10-04-T-021,453,K Shanmugam,"If some deception is involved in the campaign, if a foreigner hides his identity or masquerades as a local, we could, under FICA, give orders for them to be transparent, just disclose who you are, so that people can judge for themselves."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00454,2021-10-04-T-021,454,K Shanmugam,"Collaboration and partnership with a foreign person by itself is not the trigger. You have to go further and look at the facts. As I said, is there a hostile campaign, is there damage to Singapore, is there a foreign agency involved, what is the extent of possible damage? These are non-exclusive factors nor must they all be present or any one of them present. You really got to look at the facts, assess based on what you know and assess the proportionality as well."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00455,2021-10-04-T-021,455,K Shanmugam,"I have referred to proportionality. I said this is my view. But this is what the Government has been advised by AGC and that is one of the reasons for my view. I am capable of forming my own views but we go by advice from AGC. And this is the intent behind the legislative approach which we are setting out clearly for reference, so that if this Bill becomes law, and if it needs to be interpreted, it will be interpreted in the light of what the Government has said is the legislative intent and how the phrases are intended to cover these things."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00456,2021-10-04-T-021,456,K Shanmugam,"It has been suggested by some that case law means that the test of proportionality cannot be applied. The advice I get from AGC is that it is different for this legislation because we are making clear the legislative intent for this specific Bill. I have made similar points in respect of other legislation as well, as part of the Second Reading speech."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00457,2021-10-04-T-021,457,K Shanmugam,"I will, in this context, invite Members to look at annex I. Sorry, I made a mistake. Annex I is not in a hard copy. Sir, with your permission, it will be emailed directly to Members in soft copy. Part of annex I is there but the part that I wanted to refer to, we did not have time to put that in."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00458,2021-10-04-T-021,458,K Shanmugam,"One suggestion was open non-clandestine collaboration between Singaporeans and any ordinary private foreign citizen to improve any aspect of our laws and public policies constitutes foreign interference, notwithstanding the absence of any foreign state manipulation or foreign funding."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00459,2021-10-04-T-021,459,K Shanmugam,"Let me put it this way. On the one side, if there is manipulation with a foreign agency involved, I think everyone will agree, it is quite clear. On the other side, there is foreign collaboration, bona fide work, everyone will agree that cannot be. And then, there is the in-between. There could be a group of foreigners working with Singaporeans, exchanging viewpoints, writing papers and so on. We have indicated that that would not be covered. How does that become necessary or expedient? How is the test of proportionality satisfied?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00460,2021-10-04-T-021,460,K Shanmugam,"But, supposing, the group comes together and their motive is to effect a change; or take a different example, there is money involved or, let us say, there is materiality, and the entire focus is political change; then, again, Members of Parliament will say that is a very different kettle of fish. Or, for that matter, the range of public policy issues that are currently or which may in the future become subject to political debates, where there is legitimate reason for concerned Singaporeans to collaborate with international experts, researchers, NGOs; on the face of it, that would not be covered. But if it changes along the lines of what I have said earlier, then there is a case for looking at it carefully."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00461,2021-10-04-T-021,461,K Shanmugam,"So, one has got to look at the facts, test materiality."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00462,2021-10-04-T-021,462,K Shanmugam,"Another point that has been made is that presenting research at overseas conferences, writing for international journals, multi-authored book projects, publishing in and reviewing for prestigious academic presses, participating in international collaborative research projects, partaking of fellowships, visiting appointments, training programmes, participation in international funding opportunities, any of these may be subsidised or fully funded by foreign universities, foundations and states. None of that, on the face of it, as it is described, will fit within FICA, for the reasons I have already explained. But if there is a step-up to try and turn the person into an agent of influence, or there is an orchestrated campaign, then, again, it becomes different."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00463,2021-10-04-T-021,463,K Shanmugam,"So, some of these doomsday scenarios, that FICA is going to close off foreign collaborations, if that is correct, we, as a Government, must have suddenly gone mad. Because in a country like Singapore, which depends so much on the flow of ideas and international collaboration, is that even thinkable? The difficulty we face at MHA, and which many other countries face when dealing with this foreign interference issue, is that out of 10,000 interactions, one might be the sort that we are interested in, where there is an attempt to interfere."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00464,2021-10-04-T-021,464,K Shanmugam,"Foreign agencies, and even non-agency, NGOs, others, will try and present a legitimate front. So, the language has got to be broad enough to cover that  that what is apparently normal but it is actually not normal."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00465,2021-10-04-T-021,465,K Shanmugam,"And it is not only the classic foreign state agency subversion sort of thing. It could be foreign associations, NGOs, even individuals who want to change our laws, for example. So, you got to look carefully at what they are doing, what are all the factors taken in overall, using the proportionality test, what sort of issue are they focusing on, what is the possible impact, is there funding involved, but with the central guiding principle that Singaporeans should primarily decide on issues of importance to ourselves."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00466,2021-10-04-T-021,466,K Shanmugam,"If you turn specifically to academics, questions have been raised about their collaborations with non-Singaporeans. They collaborate, create, partner, pursue their research interests professionally. No HIC, it does not come within FICA."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00467,2021-10-04-T-021,467,K Shanmugam,"So, the Bill will not affect the vast amount of academic work that is being done. We value the intellectual output, collaborations, exchange of ideas, the work our academics do. And they need to link with the rest of the world; for work, bone fide and professional work, not affected; it is important for Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00468,2021-10-04-T-021,468,K Shanmugam,"But in some situations, there are academics who go into a different realm around the world, and they are dealt with, like we did with Huang Jing."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00469,2021-10-04-T-021,469,K Shanmugam,"There is another thread to some of the points made, underlying all of these explanations and illustrations, that the Government's position and explanations are good but the powers can be abused, they can be used for a wrong purpose. The worry is that the Government will abuse its power and shut down legitimate cooperation because it does not like it."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00470,2021-10-04-T-021,470,K Shanmugam,"So, there are two points here. One, the powers that are necessary to deal with the threat. Second, the possibility of abuse of these powers. So far, I have explained why the powers are necessary and why these powers are no greater – in fact less so – then powers that already exist, and is more calibration for the Internet age. So, bearing that in mind, I will deal separately, later, with abuse of powers."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00471,2021-10-04-T-021,471,K Shanmugam,The fundamental principle is the intention – and we do not believe that legislation prevents bona fide exchange of ideas.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00472,2021-10-04-T-021,472,K Shanmugam,"Can a government abuse the power? Any government can abuse this power and any power. So, we will come to that and what should be the checks and balances for that."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00473,2021-10-04-T-021,473,K Shanmugam,"There have also been others, beyond these concerns, who have been actively trying to put out misinformation about the Bill. Chief amongst them are Mr PJ Thum and Ms Kirsten Han. Thum and Han, as I said in 2019, in the conference, take money from George Soros. Some of you may recall, Soros' Open Society Foundations (OSF) has a history of getting involved in the domestic politics of sovereign countries."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00474,2021-10-04-T-021,474,K Shanmugam,"In 2018, ACRA rejected Thum and Han's attempt to register a company funded by OSF to organise ""democracy classroom"" sessions in Singapore. They have set up an organisation called New Naratif, which receives significant foreign funding. New Naratif organised a series of ""Democracy Classrooms"" focusing on Malaysia and that was supported by the US Embassy in Kuala Lumpur."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00475,2021-10-04-T-021,475,K Shanmugam,"Make no mistake about it. We will say no to that in Singapore. You can organise democracy classrooms. We have no issues. Anyone can organise, anyone can criticise the current state of democracy, but it cannot be funded by Soros or the US Embassy or any other Embassy. The nature of activity and who the funding is from will have to be considered in this context."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00476,2021-10-04-T-021,476,K Shanmugam,"I will say a bit more about Thum and Han before I go on to discuss their objections. Thum wants our Independence Day to be 16 September, which is Malaysia Day. He regrets that Singapore separated from Malaysia. On several occasions, he has publicly said that Singapore should become part of Malaysia again and celebrate Independence on 16 September. Thum and Han and some other activists met with Dr Mahathir on 30 August 2018. They asked Dr Mahathir to bring democracy to Singapore. I suppose Malaysian style democracy."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00477,2021-10-04-T-021,477,K Shanmugam,"Han described a social movement as ""the work that goes into potentially one day having 500,000 people on the streets."" She has also said, ""When the government says foreigners should not influence domestic affairs, or foreigners should not bring their country's politics into Singapore, we should push back on that as well, because why not, because solidarity is important."" Her view is that Malaysians can influence our politics. She says so openly."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00478,2021-10-04-T-021,478,K Shanmugam,"I believe, I have not seen it, but I assume the Petition that the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) is presenting in Parliament is one that is inspired by Ms Han. So, I would like to know whether they agree with this statement that Singaporeans should push back and say foreigners should be able to influence domestic affairs in Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00479,2021-10-04-T-021,479,K Shanmugam,"So, Members can see why the two of them are very concerned that FICA will focus on foreign funding and have been mounting their own disinformation campaign."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00480,2021-10-04-T-021,480,K Shanmugam,"Han has been posting on social media extensively – I am told, over a hundred tweets, posts and so on, organised a petition, sent around email templates for people to write to their Members of Parliament. Thum has meanwhile written a commentary calling this Bill a ""stealth coup"" by me."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00481,2021-10-04-T-021,481,K Shanmugam,"Basically, that I am personally going to take over Singapore and all my colleagues have to be very concerned. I suppose a coup means that I take over from the Prime Minister. A coup in Singapore. The Prime Minister needs to be very concerned too."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00482,2021-10-04-T-021,482,K Shanmugam,"It requires a turn of mind, completely at odds with reality and living in fantasy to think of a coup in Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00483,2021-10-04-T-021,483,K Shanmugam,"Mr Thum forgets that if there is this fear that I am going to mount a coup, then I or any Minister for Home Affairs has far more powers under other legislation  the Internal Security Act (ISA), the Criminal Law Temporary Provisions Act (CLTPA), the Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act (MRHA), including the powers of detention. FICA, in contrast, is a toy gun. It gives powers to give directions."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00484,2021-10-04-T-021,484,K Shanmugam,"So, Members can see there is no limit to the absurdities and fantasies that some will put out and an Oxford education in itself does not immunise one from spouting such nonsense."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00485,2021-10-04-T-021,485,K Shanmugam,"But I can see that they are concerned. Han has said, in arguing against this Bill, that it is difficult to get money for these causes in Singapore, so foreign funding is necessary."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00486,2021-10-04-T-021,486,K Shanmugam,"So, you can see. If Singaporeans are excited about it, interested, they will contribute. But because they will not contribute, I need foreign funding."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00487,2021-10-04-T-021,487,K Shanmugam,"Mr Terry Xu has joined Han in starting the petition, which some groups have signed up to. I am not sure how many of these groups know what Thum and Han's objectives are. We will look at the petition that is being put up in Parliament by the PSP. I think Members can look at it in the context of who inspired them and how today's PSP is completely aligned, it appears, with what Thum and Han want to achieve."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00488,2021-10-04-T-021,488,K Shanmugam,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the points raised in the petition, assuming it is the same petition that we see online, I have dealt with most of them, I am dealing with them, we can debate the points today and I would say Parliament can fully consider and debate the points today. There is no need to do it at another session."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00489,2021-10-04-T-021,489,K Shanmugam,"Mr Terry Xu, as many of us know, and as I said in my September 2019 speech at the conference, uses Malaysian and other foreign writers to write incendiary articles on Singapore without bylines and without identification. The articles include a call for Singaporean civil servants to march on the streets like their Hong Kong counterparts."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00490,2021-10-04-T-021,490,K Shanmugam,"So, you read the articles and what would readers think? These are from local writers writing about Singapore in these terms. But the articles are often by foreign writers who are paid to write these stories. The more incendiary, the better."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00491,2021-10-04-T-021,491,K Shanmugam,Mr Xu and others can continue to do this even after FICA. But a direction can be given to them to make it clear that the article is by a foreigner.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00492,2021-10-04-T-021,492,K Shanmugam,"We all want transparency, right? So, it would be useful for Singaporeans to know whether the writer of the article is local or foreign. FICA will allow us to issue a transparency directive requiring that Singaporeans be told upfront who the article is written by and what nationality the author has."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00493,2021-10-04-T-021,493,K Shanmugam,"Sir, moving on to a slightly different topic. For HIC directions, appeals go to an independent reviewing tribunal, which has the power to overrule the Minister. The tribunal is headed by a Supreme Court judge. Appeals are made to this tribunal and not the Court so as to protect sensitive information that may be relied on to make a decision."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00494,2021-10-04-T-021,494,K Shanmugam,"For example, we may determine foreign interference based on a tip-off or sensitive information shared by a foreign counterpart security agency. The consequences of a leak would be very serious. Most Singaporeans understand the need for this legislation."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00495,2021-10-04-T-021,495,K Shanmugam,"Sir, I will now deal with the proposed amendments put forward by some Members of the Workers' Party."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00496,2021-10-04-T-021,496,K Shanmugam,"The Workers' Party has stated that they believe in the ""legitimate need to counter malign acts of foreign interference"". They also realise the ""Purposes"" provision of the Bill is important – that is clause 2 – and obviously so."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00497,2021-10-04-T-021,497,K Shanmugam,"So, with your permission, Mr Speaker, may I distribute a second folder which contains annexes J to L that I am going to refer to now."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00498,2021-10-04-T-021,498,Speaker,Please do. [
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00499,2021-10-04-T-021,499,K Shanmugam,"If I may carry on while it is being distributed, Sir?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00500,2021-10-04-T-021,500,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00501,2021-10-04-T-021,501,K Shanmugam,"It is to be welcomed that the Workers' Party has set out what they disagree with in the Bill. They are, looking at the amendments, in agreement with most of the Bill. And the details are in annex J."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00502,2021-10-04-T-021,502,K Shanmugam,Their disagreement with the Bill can be itemised into five categories. Two of the categories are somewhat process related.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00503,2021-10-04-T-021,503,K Shanmugam,"The first one is by Mr Leon Perera. He has put in suggested amendments to clauses 47, 48, 78, 79, 81, 84 and 85. He wants the Government to maintain a public registry of all individuals and entities designated as PSPs and persons with declared involvement in foreign ""policy"" organisations. Now, I would say the Bill does not use the term foreign ""policy"" organisation. I assume he was referring to a foreign ""political"" organisation instead."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00504,2021-10-04-T-021,504,K Shanmugam,"He also wants the Government to make publicly available the following information  (a) all reportable arrangements; (b) all transparency directives, disclosures, reports and explanations for these decisions; and (c) all directives to PSPs to end their affiliation with a foreign principal or to prohibit foreign volunteers."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00505,2021-10-04-T-021,505,K Shanmugam,It is unclear to us why he only wants to make public these two stepped-up countermeasures and did not include the other stepped-up countermeasures on prohibition of donations and foreign memberships.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00506,2021-10-04-T-021,506,K Shanmugam,"The Bill, in clause 116, states that we may make public any designation and the issuance of any stepped-up countermeasures on PSPs and transparency directive issued."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00507,2021-10-04-T-021,507,K Shanmugam,"The media had asked us about this previously and we said while the Bill says ""may"", our intention though was to make public the designations and stepped-up countermeasures on PSPs, as well as the directives to counter a HIC. Our response was carried in mainstream media on 25 September."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00508,2021-10-04-T-021,508,K Shanmugam,Mr Leon Perera wants to have this as an obligation for the countermeasures that they have identified.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00509,2021-10-04-T-021,509,K Shanmugam,"The Government can agree to this. We will make public all designations, stepped-up countermeasures on PSPs, transparency directives and HIC directives, except the technical assistance requirements (TADs) because that would be in the course of investigations and we do not want to tip off hostile actors about the investigations that are going on."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00510,2021-10-04-T-021,510,K Shanmugam,"There is one issue on the suggestion to make public the names of citizens involved in foreign political and legislative organisations. A substantial number of these citizens may not be PSPs. This reporting requirement under clause 79 applies to non-PSPs, ordinary citizens."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00511,2021-10-04-T-021,511,K Shanmugam,"If they are a member of the, say, the Russian Communist Party, we want to know. They may not be PSPs in Singapore. There are also other communist parties. If they are a member of the Cuban Communist Party, we also want to know. Likewise, if they are a member of the UK's Conservative Party."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00512,2021-10-04-T-021,512,K Shanmugam,"It could become quite wide and we have to be mindful when making disclosures relating to this group. We are studying that particular issue, whether we should make all these non-PSP reports public."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00513,2021-10-04-T-021,513,K Shanmugam,"Our previous intention was ""no"". We should let them have their privacy on this. Reporting to the Government is enough. But given that Mr Leon Perera has raised it, we will relook at that particular point and if we agree with him, we could make that amendment in a future point in time but not now."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00514,2021-10-04-T-021,514,K Shanmugam,"Mr Leon Perera also wants a list of all reportable arrangements. I do not think that is necessary. The Bill sets out clearly the conditions where an arrangement is reportable, for example, when the PSP is obliged to act in accordance with the instructions of a foreign principal."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00515,2021-10-04-T-021,515,K Shanmugam,"The second category where the Workers' Party wants to make some amendments, Mr Gerald Giam, he wants to add the following to categories of PSPs  members of Central Executive Councils or equivalent of registered political parties in Singapore, senior public servants holding office of Deputy Secretary or above or equivalent, board members or chief executives of a Statutory Board or a Government company listed in the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution. I will come back to this."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00516,2021-10-04-T-021,516,K Shanmugam,"The third category of amendments, Mr Giam wants to amend the definition of what amounts to ""directed towards a political end""."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00517,2021-10-04-T-021,517,K Shanmugam,"The fourth category of amendments is to clause 17. Assoc Prof Jamus Lim wants to remove the phrase ""likely to be"" from ""is or likely to be prejudicial""; and he proposes similar edits to clause 18. He also wants to amend clause 17(2) to remove a caveat."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00518,2021-10-04-T-021,518,K Shanmugam,"The fifth category of amendments, the Bill provides for challenges to some Directions issued by the Minister to be dealt with by a Tribunal, headed by a Supreme Court Judge. Ms He wants this to be dealt with by the High Court, rather than a Tribunal headed by the Supreme Court."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00519,2021-10-04-T-021,519,K Shanmugam,"So, I will now turn to the specific amendments proposed and set out our views."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00520,2021-10-04-T-021,520,K Shanmugam,"On Mr Perera's amendments on clauses 47, 48, 78, 79, 81, 84 and 85, we can agree to several of them. I have set out my position."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00521,2021-10-04-T-021,521,K Shanmugam,"On Mr Giam's amendment to clause 14 on amending the definition of PSP. Now, once you are designated as a PSP, there is a baseline set of obligations. Declaration of foreign affiliations, declaration of migration benefits, anonymous donations cap of $5,000, declaration of donations of $10,000 or more from permissible donors, no foreign volunteers and so on. So, if you take a CEC member or equivalent, we can agree to this. We can add them today at the Committee stage."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00522,2021-10-04-T-021,522,K Shanmugam,I will seek to move a set of amendments to the Bill during the Committee stage of proceedings and for these to be debated alongside the other proposed amendments filed by the other Members of Parliament on the Bill.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00523,2021-10-04-T-021,523,K Shanmugam,"Insufficient notice has been given for these amendments from my Ministry necessarily, because we are dealing with amendments in turn proposed by Mr Perera and Mr Giam."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00524,2021-10-04-T-021,524,K Shanmugam,"So, I will be seeking your consent, Sir, Mr Speaker, as well as the general assent of Members present to waive notice. Copies of these proposed amendments will be distributed to this House so that Members can read them ahead."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00525,2021-10-04-T-021,525,K Shanmugam,"Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, may I ask the Clerks to distribute the proposed amendments?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00526,2021-10-04-T-021,526,Speaker,Please do. [
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00527,2021-10-04-T-021,527,K Shanmugam,"May I continue, Sir?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00528,2021-10-04-T-021,528,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00529,2021-10-04-T-021,529,K Shanmugam,"On the CEC members, one of the reasons why we left it out is that we did consider CEC members as well as branch secretaries to be included. But we left it out because on the side of the PAP to comply with this, is not going to be difficult because all except two of the CEC members are PSPs anyway. So, the obligations are more onerous for the other registered political parties because many, in some cases, none, of the CEC members are PSPs. But as I said, we can agree to it if that is what Mr Giam wants."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00530,2021-10-04-T-021,530,K Shanmugam,"Mr Giam also wants DS and officers above the DS level to be included as PSPs. What are the status of DSes and PSes and what rules are they subject to? They are all subject to various tight rules and requirements which are tighter than FICA requirements on PSPs. They have to hold valid security clearance throughout their appointment. They have to make annual declarations including on investments, ownership, financial embarrassment, declarations on a variety of matters, going well beyond what PSPs have to do."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00531,2021-10-04-T-021,531,K Shanmugam,They have to declare all gifts and entertainment and they cannot work for other employers or engage in trade or business without explicit permission. They can be directed to cease outside activities or divest investments if there is any conflict. A list of their key obligations is set out in annex K.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00532,2021-10-04-T-021,532,K Shanmugam,"The rules for PSPs are not as tight. PSPs cannot accept anonymous donations over $5,000, which really means they can accept anonymous donations under $5,000 and they can also accept above $5,000 from identified persons. Any DS or PS who accepts that will not remain in service for much after that, and they would be subject to severe disciplinary action if they contravene any of the rules."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00533,2021-10-04-T-021,533,K Shanmugam,"Politicians and others who may be PSPs play by different rules compared with Senior Civil Servants. If we imposed on PSPs the rules that Senior Civil Servants are under, I think it will be very difficult."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00534,2021-10-04-T-021,534,K Shanmugam,"Ministers are also subject to strict rules, except that political donations are possible."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00535,2021-10-04-T-021,535,K Shanmugam,"Mr Giam and Mr Pritam Singh will be aware of these requirements, having both been public servants themselves in the past. I also do not think it is appropriate to classify them as PSPs. These senior civil servants are non-political, so we cannot agree to this proposal."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00536,2021-10-04-T-021,536,K Shanmugam,"Mr Giam also wants to include board members, chief executives of Statutory Boards, chief executives of Fifth Schedule companies."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00537,2021-10-04-T-021,537,K Shanmugam,"CEs of Statutory Boards, as public officers, are subject to the same rules as DSes and above and the points I have already made apply equally to them."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00538,2021-10-04-T-021,538,K Shanmugam,"As for Board Members, it would not be feasible to automatically define them as PSPs. It is preferable to use powers of designation instead."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00539,2021-10-04-T-021,539,K Shanmugam,"On board members. They will often have foreign members. You ask them to declare all donations received in home countries, migration benefits, all their foreign affiliations? It does not make sense. If we went out and asked not just these companies, but any other listed company, ask them if it will be feasible to impose these requirements on their foreign directors, they will tell you it is too onerous. They will have difficulties getting good people."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00540,2021-10-04-T-021,540,K Shanmugam,"And if you take banks and you impose these obligations on the Schedule companies, but you do not impose these obligations on their competitors who might be in the same business, then you make it difficult for the Schedule companies to get good people."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00541,2021-10-04-T-021,541,K Shanmugam,"It is the same for Fifth Schedule companies. So, leave it to the companies to choose people of integrity and our security agencies need to be alert. Not just about them, but other directors of major companies in Singapore. So, these additional proposals are impractical from a market point of view."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00542,2021-10-04-T-021,542,K Shanmugam,"Now, I move to clause 8 as proposed by Mr Giam. He wants to amend the definition of “directed towards a political end in Singapore”."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00543,2021-10-04-T-021,543,K Shanmugam,"The context is HIC directions can be issued if there is online communications activity where material is published in Singapore, it is undertaken by or on behalf of a foreign principal, and it is in the public interest to issue a direction such as to prevent foreign interference directed towards a political end."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00544,2021-10-04-T-021,544,K Shanmugam,"And for a PSP to be designated, that person or entity’s activities must be directed wholly or in part towards a political end; and the Competent Authority must additionally assess that it is in the public interest for countermeasures to be applied."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00545,2021-10-04-T-021,545,K Shanmugam,"So, changing this definition will affect how we can act against foreign interference. The meaning of the “directed toward a political end” in the Bill has seven parts. Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, may I display a slide with the definition on screen, please."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00546,2021-10-04-T-021,546,Speaker,"Yes, please. ["
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00547,2021-10-04-T-021,547,K Shanmugam,"The first five, I think it is not the easiest to read. I think it is also in the Schedule that I have handed out, after annex M. Pages 1 and 2 with what is proposed to be struck out. For those of us who cannot read this slide."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00548,2021-10-04-T-021,548,K Shanmugam,"The first five are  (a) to promote the interests of a political party, or a politically significant entity, in Singapore; (b) to seek to influence the outcome of any election or referendum; (c) to seek to influence Singapore Governmental decisions including by trying to influence the public; (d) to seek to influence any aspect of proceedings of key public institutions including Parliament, Presidential Council for Minority Rights, and so on; (e) to seek to bring about changes of the law or otherwise influence the legislative process."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00549,2021-10-04-T-021,549,K Shanmugam,"So, Mr Giam accepts all of this as legitimate, meaning legitimate for the purpose of defining what is ""directed towards a political end"" and that these are necessary. But he wants to remove the last two paragraphs."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00550,2021-10-04-T-021,550,K Shanmugam,"Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, may I ask for Slide 2 that highlights these changes to be put up?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00551,2021-10-04-T-021,551,Speaker,"Yes, please."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00552,2021-10-04-T-021,552,K Shanmugam,"Again, it is in page 1 after annex M of the handout that has been given."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00553,2021-10-04-T-021,553,K Shanmugam,"Mr Giam wants to remove two sub-clauses, first of which reads (f) to seek to influence public opinion on a matter which, in Singapore, is a matter of public controversy; (g) to seek to influence any aspect, or to promote or oppose political views, or public conduct relating to activities that have become the subject of a political debate in Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00554,2021-10-04-T-021,554,K Shanmugam,This is a little difficult to understand. Let me explain.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00555,2021-10-04-T-021,555,K Shanmugam,Members will recall that I have said a number of times that there are three conditions for a HIC direction and two for a PSP designation.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00556,2021-10-04-T-021,556,K Shanmugam,"For HIC directions, to refresh Members' memory, there has to be online activity where material is published in Singapore, it has to be done on behalf of a foreign principal and public interest in Singapore likely to be affected."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00557,2021-10-04-T-021,557,K Shanmugam,"For a PSP designation, the person's or entity’s activities must be directed wholly or in part towards a political end; and the Competent Authority must additionally assess that it is in the public interest for countermeasures to be applied."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00558,2021-10-04-T-021,558,K Shanmugam,"With Mr Giam’s proposal, if an issue is only within (f) or (g), then no counter-HIC directions can be issued and no PSP designation is possible."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00559,2021-10-04-T-021,559,K Shanmugam,"To put it in the form of an example, in other words, his position is that we should not stop foreigners from interfering to shape public opinion on matters of public controversy; or to influence public views on a political debate, and this is so regardless of whether deception is involved."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00560,2021-10-04-T-021,560,K Shanmugam,There are numerous scenarios that could fall under limbs (f) and (g) that may not be covered by one of the other limbs.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00561,2021-10-04-T-021,561,K Shanmugam,"For example, promoting some types of solidarity between members of one race or nationality, with the aim that this can eventually help them have negative feelings towards other races, or promoting some types of religious piety, with the aim that eventually they may take different views on matters of political debate in Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00562,2021-10-04-T-021,562,K Shanmugam,"If we believe that is being done, for example, at the direction of a foreign intelligence agency, with the ultimate purpose of creating divisions within Singapore, should we not be able to act?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00563,2021-10-04-T-021,563,K Shanmugam,"If an intel agency in another country regularly pays someone in Singapore to write about these matters or support the policies of the Workers' Party, or the PAP, and gradually deepen divisions, enhance the ""protest potential"", as General Gerasimov might have said, that would not be covered. Frankly, Sir, that goes against common sense."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00564,2021-10-04-T-021,564,K Shanmugam,"When we had the debates on CECA, were we not having a political discussion? Under Mr Giam's proposal, any foreigner trying to influence such a debate in Parliament would be covered by FICA. But any foreigner trying to influence the wider public on the same topics will not be covered when that discussion takes place outside, unless it can be shown that that was done in order to influence Government policy."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00565,2021-10-04-T-021,565,K Shanmugam,"But Members would have seen from the example that I put in the annexes on foreign influence, influencing public opinion is a key aspect of foreign manipulation. Realms and realms of examples and look at the modus referred to in paragraphs 200 to 206 of the Select Committee report, I do not have it here but Members can check it out. Where the Select Committee report says ""...Russians built up internet presence in the US to influence..."" and this has been done regularly in other countries."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00566,2021-10-04-T-021,566,K Shanmugam,"As an example, the Guardian reported that YouTubers, bloggers and influencers in France and Germany were offered money by a PR agency with apparent connections to another state to spread falsehoods about COVID-19 vaccines. For example, ""death rate among the vaccinated with Pfizer is almost three times higher than those vaccinated by AstraZeneca."" They were asked to ""act like you have the passion and interest in this topic"" and avoid using the words ""sponsored"". They were instructed that ""the material should be presented as your own independent view""."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00567,2021-10-04-T-021,567,K Shanmugam,"Sir, I would say it is not logical, if you look at this, we agree that (a) foreigners should not influence; and (c) is wrong, we should not allow foreigners to influence or seek to influence Singapore Government decisions; (e) is wrong and should not be allowed. But foreign inspired subversion on (f) and (g) are okay."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00568,2021-10-04-T-021,568,K Shanmugam,"But, if you look at (a) ""to promote the interest of a political party"" and if you look at (g) ""to influence or seek to influence any aspect of to promote or post political views or public conduct relating to activities that have become the subject of a political debate in Singapore"", you can do (a) in a different way under (g), that was what I meant earlier. And you could argue I was doing (g) and not (a)."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00569,2021-10-04-T-021,569,K Shanmugam,"So, foreign inspired subversion on (f) and (g) are not okay and this is exactly what the Gerasimov Doctrine seeks to exploit. It seeks to identify issues of “protest potential”, use info operations to polarise society, incite public disorder along these issues and keep the target country in a constant state of turmoil."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00570,2021-10-04-T-021,570,K Shanmugam,"Take another example, the Explanatory Statement to the Bill. Say a humanitarian crisis in Country Z, it becomes a hot political topic in Singapore. Country Z then sets up Company Y, in Singapore in a bid to sway public opinion. Company Y pretends to be a private local trading enterprise. But it is really just a front for Country Z to influence Singaporeans. To do this, Company Y sets up multiple personas online. It puts out many commentaries online, pretending to be ""a freelance journalist"" or ""experts"" in foreign politics, trying to manipulate Singaporeans to take a particular view of the matter. This is taken from real world happenings."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00571,2021-10-04-T-021,571,K Shanmugam,"With the deletions that Mr Giam has proposed, such conduct may fall outside of FICA, unless it can be referred back to one of the earlier limbs. I think it is not acceptable for us to allow such foreign interference and allow such manipulation of Singaporeans. Eventually, it will weaken our society. The shareholders of the sham company may even get paid for their actions and there would be no offence and no Part 3 Directions can be issued, however pervasive the online campaign."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00572,2021-10-04-T-021,572,K Shanmugam,"You will also have situations, where (f) and (g) may overlap with the other limbs. Limb (c)  ""influencing governmental decisions"" is defined in section 9 to include influencing the public on a process in respect of the Government decision. If this is a matter of public controversy, then it will overlap with (f). As I said earlier, insofar as (g) covers the influence of political views, this may overlap with matters under (a) which promote the interests of a political party; or (e) which aim to bring about changes in the law."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00573,2021-10-04-T-021,573,K Shanmugam,"In this context, let us also look at the exemptions proposed by Member Assoc Prof Jamus Lim. He proposes to exempt ""any activity undertaken by Singaporeans to exercise their right to discuss politics by expressing their own views on political matters, unless they are agents of a foreign principal""."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00574,2021-10-04-T-021,574,K Shanmugam,"Second, he proposes to exempt ""an activity undertaken by foreign individuals or foreign publications reporting or commenting on Singapore politics, in an open, transparent and attributable way, even if their comments may be critical of Singapore or the Government"". Both proposals are modelled on my Ministry's press release of 13 September 2021, which was issued after the First Reading of the Bill, where we set out the powers under the Bill and explained that it will not apply to these two situations, in the context of clause 120."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00575,2021-10-04-T-021,575,K Shanmugam,"It is unnecessary to write this in. It is not covered by the Act. I have said this, in Parliament, the MHA statement has stated it and the Explanatory Statement to the Bill clause 120 explains this. You cannot regularly be writing – sometimes there may be a need to – but you cannot regularly be writing into legislation both what is covered and also, what else is not covered. Because, the above two situations are not the only ones not covered, many other issues are not covered. We clarified those in the press statement because people may have these questions in mind."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00576,2021-10-04-T-021,576,K Shanmugam,"Let me move to clause 17, which is Clandestine Publishing and this is proposed by Member Assoc Prof Jamus Lim and I should say it as an aside, Prime Minister is back, he must have heard the part about the coup and taking over his powers. But I am sure he will rid them."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00577,2021-10-04-T-021,577,K Shanmugam,"Clause 17 is now sought to be amended. The current wording is that  ""the offence is committed if A publishes in Singapore, he does this on behalf of a foreign principal and A has reason to believe that what is published is likely to be prejudicial to Singapore's interests, in one of various ways and he does this covertly and deceptively"". Assoc Prof Jamus Lim wants to remove the phrase ""is likely to be""."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00578,2021-10-04-T-021,578,K Shanmugam,"Mr Speaker, with your permission, may I ask the Clerk to display the slide number three which contains this amendment."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00579,2021-10-04-T-021,579,Speaker,Please do.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00580,2021-10-04-T-021,580,K Shanmugam,"Again, for those who cannot read it, you can look at the handout, the grey file that has been handed out."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00581,2021-10-04-T-021,581,K Shanmugam,"This proposed amendment will narrow the mental state. The phrase is ""likely to be"" is sought to be struck out. If this edit goes through, the prosecution must then prove that a person knew that it would likely be prejudicial. Taking one step back, I would say we are using a slide rule here to try and measure and assess people who are going to come with bazookas. This will not work in the real world. Even more so when it comes to clandestine foreign interference. Any decent intelligence service would know how to cover its tracks, conceal its linkages and disavow knowledge."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00582,2021-10-04-T-021,582,K Shanmugam,"So, under these proposed amendments someone could take money from a neighbouring country, attack us, publish allegations against the Police or SAF or other institutions, cause unhappiness and unrest amongst our local ethnic communities. This can be done covertly and not disclose that he is taking money. Yet, if the proposals are accepted, the person cannot be charged in Court because the prosecution has to show the person knew or had reason to believe that his actions would be prejudicial. The person could claim, for example, that he did not realise that his post would be picked up by others and shared around. He did not know it would be prejudicial and he had no reason to believe so. This is so, even if we can prove that he took money from a foreign agency to put up the posts with the purpose of damaging Singapore. It is really like taking knives to a gunfight."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00583,2021-10-04-T-021,583,K Shanmugam,"Common sense is if you had reason to believe that your actions are likely to prejudice Singapore's interests and you are acting for a foreign agency, you are acting covertly, secretly, it should be an offence."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00584,2021-10-04-T-021,584,K Shanmugam,"I make broadly the same points for the proposed amendments to clauses 18, 40 and 75. Related to this, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim wishes to amend clause 17(2), to remove a caveat that ""Y does not need to have in mind a particular foreign country or foreign principal in order to be considered to have committed an offence"". This similarly narrows the mental state for the offence and means that the prosecutor must prove that the person is acting for a specific foreign principal and is impractical for the reasons I had already given."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00585,2021-10-04-T-021,585,K Shanmugam,"As matter of principle, knowledge that there is ""a foreign principal"" and ""acting on his behalf"" should suffice, even if the person does not know which foreign principal it is. It does not matter whether you are acting for country X, Y or Z as long as you know you are acting for some country."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00586,2021-10-04-T-021,586,K Shanmugam,"If I may move to clause 20, also the amendment proposed by Assoc Prof Jamus Lim. The current wording is that the Minister may authorise directions where, in the opinion of the Minister, those conditions for HIC are satisfied. The Member wants to remove the phrase ""or is suspected of being or having been undertaken""."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00587,2021-10-04-T-021,587,K Shanmugam,"In practice, suspicion of links to a foreign principal would likely arise from a lead, an intelligence tip-off or other kinds of tip-off. If there is such a suspicion, security agencies would probe further, gather data, try to corroborate the information, ascertain if the lead is reliable and they would require triangulation from different sources."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00588,2021-10-04-T-021,588,K Shanmugam,"If you recall the earlier example of a state that apparently worked through a PR agency to get social media influencers to discredit vaccines. People eventually got suspicious due to a combination of indicators  suspicious instructions from the company to mask that they were being paid to push their messages; the company claimed to be based at an address in London, but turned out not to be registered there; company management from Moscow; online presence disappeared once people started raising suspicions. None of these indicators, on their own, prove a conclusive link to a foreign principal. But collectively, they paint a suspicious picture."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00589,2021-10-04-T-021,589,K Shanmugam,"So, if a foreign publication strongly attacks a Government policy and a local person is actively helping them and pushes out that content while accepting donations from them and taking effort to conceal the funding. Consistently over time, circumstances look suspicious, but nothing can be done if we cannot prove that the person was actually acting on behalf of a foreign principal. I think we must be able to act on reasonable suspicion which is a threshold well-established in law."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00590,2021-10-04-T-021,590,K Shanmugam,"Under FICA, the Government would be able to take some measures  issue directions to take down the harmful content, or a must-carry direction to inform the public that a HIC is going on and these are executory in nature. Thresholds above do not relate to an offence. If the person receiving the direction is aggrieved, he can appeal to the Tribunal."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00591,2021-10-04-T-021,591,K Shanmugam,"Clause 21, Assoc Prof Lim wants to add in the phrase ""rely on actionable intelligence”. So, we now call this agency to come and prove the actionable intelligence or we get documents and produce them. There is a process. You cannot just produce a document. And added on to that, Assoc Prof Lim and his colleagues want this to be in Court. How do you even prove these documents? How do you put any foreign intelligence agents on the stand? What is actionable intelligence?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00592,2021-10-04-T-021,592,K Shanmugam,"In the real world, tip-offs come from intelligence agencies, from certain activities, associations, sometimes, it can be definitive, a ""smoking gun"", but in the vast majority of cases, it is less definite. Links to a foreign state could be through ownership, funding, other associations. It requires piecing together of different data points."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00593,2021-10-04-T-021,593,K Shanmugam,"I can tell Assoc Prof Lim from experience if ever – if ever – we said that we are going to refer what they said to us publicly, immediately they will disavow all knowledge and thereafter, they will refuse to have contact with us. That is the real world. So, we need to be practical, not theoretical in this, with an understanding on how intelligence operations work."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00594,2021-10-04-T-021,594,K Shanmugam,"There is another problem which lawyers will understand –what is the legal standard for actionable intelligence. It will replace ""suspects or has reason to believe"" which is a concept which lawyers know and is well defined; at least, there is case law. You have replaced that with actionable intelligence."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00595,2021-10-04-T-021,595,K Shanmugam,"Essentially, the Tribunal will have the right to consider the information available, which the Government makes available and decide whether the conclusion that the Government has come to, was justified."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00596,2021-10-04-T-021,596,K Shanmugam,Let me now move to the final set of amendments.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00597,2021-10-04-T-021,597,K Shanmugam,"Clause 104, an amendment proposed by Ms He. She wants to replace the Tribunal with proceedings in the High Court. This is in respect of appeals against our counter-HIC directions. Any Part 3 direction or declaration as a Proscribed Online Location."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00598,2021-10-04-T-021,598,K Shanmugam,"The question is, should the appeals relating to HIC Directions go to Court and should there be public hearings? In a Court process, the Government may be required to set out its case in public, months in advance of the trial, documents have to be exchanged, witnesses must be available to give evidence, there will be cross examination and then, the Judge decides."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00599,2021-10-04-T-021,599,K Shanmugam,"Going back to my earlier example, assume we get an intel tip-off. Foreign agency tipping us off about someone, which has happened even quite recently, and by which then led to us exercising powers under the Internal Security Act. There are no documents. Will we be able to get the foreign intel contact to come to Court? As I said, they will just not hear us. We would not even get a response and that will be the end of the cooperation."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00600,2021-10-04-T-021,600,K Shanmugam,"If we think the tip-off has some merit, we do our own investigations and then issue Directions. If the person is not happy, he appeals to the Tribunal. The Tribunal members have the same immunity and protection as High Court Judges. They will consider any appeal brought under section 92."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00601,2021-10-04-T-021,601,K Shanmugam,"Let me give you another example. Some countries – I am not saying we do – but some countries have human assets in other countries. Let us say the information is obtained through such a human asset. You want to reveal that in Court? Depending on the country that the human asset is in, he may not live for very long after that. And even if he lives, he would not be free."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00602,2021-10-04-T-021,602,K Shanmugam,One could ask  can you have the case in-camera in Court? That would not solve the problem.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00603,2021-10-04-T-021,603,K Shanmugam,"You have to file the evidence in Court. A lot of parties get to see the file. Some of this information, frequently, is often known only to two to three persons who need to know, even within the security agency. The Minister does not get to see it or know about it, unless it is necessary to brief the Minister."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00604,2021-10-04-T-021,604,K Shanmugam,"Let me give you a simple illustration of the real world by referring to a case that is before the Courts now, which is not anywhere in the category of cases we are now talking about in terms of sensitivity."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00605,2021-10-04-T-021,605,K Shanmugam,"There is a case pending, an application by 17 prisoners awaiting capital punishment. They are making an application against the Attorney-General. They seek various reliefs against the Attorney-General. Various allegations have been made which the AGC considers to be completely scurrilous and without basis and being made to simply throw mud and stirred. That is the AGC's view."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00606,2021-10-04-T-021,606,K Shanmugam,"They are represented by a local lawyer. The hearing is in Chambers. The lawyer will know the hearing is in Chambers. It has not been published. Details of the affidavits, everything cannot be published. But details of the plaintiffs' affidavits appeared in a Malaysian news portal within a month of the application being filed and the allegations relate to, well, I was going to say there were very strong racial undertones. In fact, they are about race."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00607,2021-10-04-T-021,607,K Shanmugam,"Someone wanted to make these assertions in Court and then, make sure they were published outside, which AGC considers absolutely scandalous. The info should not have been made public. It is a possible breach of rules. The lawyer claims that his “instructing solicitor” is from Malaysia, for one of the plaintiffs. So, now you investigate and even if you take action for breach of the rules, the info is public."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00608,2021-10-04-T-021,608,K Shanmugam,"In this case, the info is not security sensitive."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00609,2021-10-04-T-021,609,K Shanmugam,"But let us say you have highly secret intel information. First of all, does it make sense to hand it over to the very person who is a suspect or to his lawyers? And how do you have a Court process?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00610,2021-10-04-T-021,610,K Shanmugam,"So, the theory has to fit the practice."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00611,2021-10-04-T-021,611,K Shanmugam,"That is why we thought long and hard and then, said let us have a Tribunal headed by a Supreme Court Judge who can overrule the Minister. The Courts still have a role to play and that is in the Explanatory Statement. They will ensure procedural compliance, proper exercise of jurisdiction, but they will not review the merits, other aspects of executory decisions taken under the Bill."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00612,2021-10-04-T-021,612,K Shanmugam,"As the House considers this, we must also look at the content of some other pieces of legislation we have in Singapore and what our approach to governances. Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, may I display a slide which compares different legislation."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00613,2021-10-04-T-021,613,Speaker,"Yes, please. ["
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00614,2021-10-04-T-021,614,K Shanmugam,W e have legislation that provide for Tribunals and limits the Courts’ power of judicial review to achieve a variety of different objectives. And so far Singapore has been successful in this balancing exercise.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00615,2021-10-04-T-021,615,K Shanmugam,"The starting point is always Rule of Law. It is fundamental, both for the well-functioning of society and to build a modern, economically vibrant society. At the same time, we recognise the normal judicial process is not best suited for specific matters; that is an exercise that requires careful consideration. Let me give a few examples. This is in annex L."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00616,2021-10-04-T-021,616,K Shanmugam,"If you look at the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act (MRHA), the Minister can issue Restraining Orders. They are considered by the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony, which in turn makes its recommendations to the President to confirm, vary or cancel the order. All orders and decisions of the President and the Minister, and the recommendations of the Council, are final and not subject to judicial review."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00617,2021-10-04-T-021,617,K Shanmugam,"During the Second Reading of the MRHA, I explained that where religious issues are concerned, the trial process may not be the best way to deal with it. It can deepen the fault lines, encourage martyrdom and inflame tensions even more."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00618,2021-10-04-T-021,618,K Shanmugam,"The Restraining Orders can impose a significant restraint on normal freedoms. The Restraining Order can restrain the person from addressing orally or in writing any congregation, require the person to stop communication activity, stop contributing to any religious publication, and restrain the person from holding office in an editorial board or committee of a religious publication."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00619,2021-10-04-T-021,619,K Shanmugam,"The Orders can be made against religious groups, to prohibit a group from receiving donations from specific or all foreign donors; require the entire governing body of the group to be Singapore Citizens; or require the group to suspend or remove specific foreigners from office. So, you can see the underlining philosophy there again – concern is foreign influence."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00620,2021-10-04-T-021,620,K Shanmugam,"In some ways, these Orders are more serious than what can be viewed under FICA. The religious groups were initially concerned. We talked to them, we explained, how our powers can be exercised and they understood and they accepted."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00621,2021-10-04-T-021,621,K Shanmugam,"Second, we look at the Land Acquisition Act. This is your house, you are living there. You could be living there all your life. The Government can acquire under the Land Acquisition Act. Any appeal from the collector’s awards have to be heard by an Appeals Board."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00622,2021-10-04-T-021,622,K Shanmugam,"Good reason  we learnt from the experience of other countries. A small country  we decided if we want to reshape and develop Singapore, the Government must have the power to acquire land quickly, develop it and not be tied up with the normal litigation process. In fact, the inspiration and one of the places we looked at was India, and when it was taken, then Prime Minister decided the constitutional protection for land which is in the Indian Constitution should be removed from our Constitution."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00623,2021-10-04-T-021,623,K Shanmugam,"So, a person’s property can be acquired and it is the Tribunal that decides on the value."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00624,2021-10-04-T-021,624,K Shanmugam,"The approach to land acquisition, the policy on land acquisition underpins our entire public housing policy, HDB policy. It underpins our entire industrial land policy and many other aspects, just based on this unorthodox approach."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00625,2021-10-04-T-021,625,K Shanmugam,"If you look at the Immigration Act, section 39A, no judicial review for any decision made by the Minister or Controller of under the Immigration Act, save in relation to procedural compliance."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00626,2021-10-04-T-021,626,K Shanmugam,"If you look at the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, financial penalties can be imposed, other Orders can be made, appeal is to an Appeal Board, chaired by a person qualified to be a Judge of the Supreme Court. May not even be a Judge. A person qualified to be a Judge. And the Appeal Board determines its own procedures and its decision is final."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00627,2021-10-04-T-021,627,K Shanmugam,"Decisions of the Controller relating to the issuance or cancellation of work passes, or variation of its conditions, these are not subject to judicial review, save in relation to procedural compliance."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00628,2021-10-04-T-021,628,K Shanmugam,"The Internal Security Act (ISA) has been instrumental in ensuring our safety and security. It provides for detention without trial, on Executive Order. Singaporeans understand and accept the ISA. It allows us to pick up would-be terrorists, pre-emptively."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00629,2021-10-04-T-021,629,K Shanmugam,"In 2017, we picked up a 22-year-old old kindergarten teacher. Young and our first female detainee. Do we wait until she does something, perhaps to the kindergarten children? She went through rehab and is now is now released."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00630,2021-10-04-T-021,630,K Shanmugam,"In any other country, she could not have been picked up and there are countries where she could have been picked up, but I am referring to the countries that we normally refer to. If she is not picked up and she goes overseas to one of the war zones, she might well not be alive today. But now, she has the prospect of carrying on with her life and achieve her full potential."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00631,2021-10-04-T-021,631,K Shanmugam,"In the last couple of years, amongst those picked up were two teenagers. One wanted to carry out a knife attack in a mosque and the other wanted to carry out a knife attack in a synagogue. Do we wait until they actually attack? What will be the harm to our social fabric? So, the ISA has helped us avoid the bad incidents and hypocrisies we see elsewhere."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00632,2021-10-04-T-021,632,K Shanmugam,"Recall the incident in New Zealand on 3 September 2021 where an extremist stabbed shoppers at the supermarket. You wake up in the morning, you go the supermarket. Suddenly, someone comes and stabs you. The attacker was known to the security agencies. He was under surveillance since 2016 because of his support for the Islamic State ideology. But under New Zealand's laws, he could not be picked up. There have been other similar cases in the UK and in France. Annex M sets out the details."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00633,2021-10-04-T-021,633,K Shanmugam,"The global security think tank GLOBSEC examined 22 terror incidents in France since 2012 and noted that nearly 80% of the people behind those attacks had been on a terror watchlist and 97% had been on the radar of authorities. With the ISA, 97% of those incidents could have been avoided and many lives saved. This included Said and Cherif Kouachi, who were career criminals who killed 12 people in January 2015 in the Charlie Hebdo office in Paris."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00634,2021-10-04-T-021,634,K Shanmugam,"If you turn to the US, President Obama took office in 2008. He campaigned on the promise to close down Guantanamo Bay or Gitmo. He did not do so during his eight years of his Presidency. One reason  closing Gitmo could mean that several of these hardcore detainees could be moved to the United States and many Americans were opposed to that idea. To date, what we can check – we may be wrong – is that only one Gitmo prisoner has been transferred to the US for prosecution in the federal courts. We may be wrong about the exact number but I think it is a very low number."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00635,2021-10-04-T-021,635,K Shanmugam,"What is the theory? The theory, and the Americans have been preaching this to us on the ISA, there must be due process, you must not have detention without trial and State Department will tells us and publish a list. But when we come to the US, there is due process in the US. They have all these hardened criminals, terrorists picked up from around the world. So, they put them in Gitmo which is in Cuba and then they say, well, since this is outside of the US, the US due process laws do not apply, and therefore, we can detain without trial and they do not get the benefit of US due process. On top of that, basically, Members know about the atrocities that were committed on the prisoners."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00636,2021-10-04-T-021,636,K Shanmugam,"Which is why I said we look at the world as it is and we avoid hypocrisies. We deal with it in a practical way. Doctors look at the ISD detainees. Justices of Peace go there, see them. We give them religious rehabilitation. We do not throw away the keys. And after a while, many of them are released, when they are rehabilitated. We do not allow ideology to stand in the way of doing right for society when that ideology does not make sense. The ideology must be to do what is right for Singaporeans."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00637,2021-10-04-T-021,637,K Shanmugam,"If you go to the CLTPA, it also provides for detention without trial. And I am well aware that the Workers' Party has a different view both on the ISA and the CLTPA, though I do not know what will be the substance of the provisions they will replace the ISA with. But anyway, and therefore, it may be difficult for them to philosophically agree with this. But I am setting out the approach the Government has taken."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00638,2021-10-04-T-021,638,K Shanmugam,"The CLTPA provides for detention without trial. It is a practical approach by then Prime Minister, Mr Lee. Evidence will often not be available; people too frightened to give evidence. In fact, we inherited this from the British and then, changed it. People will be too frightened to give evidence. In the longer term, more harm to society, by leaving gangsters out in society. So, better to give to the Executive these powers to deal with some types of pernicious criminals. It has helped to keep our society safe."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00639,2021-10-04-T-021,639,K Shanmugam,"If we had stuck to the approach of looking at everything on the basis only of the rights of the persons accused in the way that, say, the US or UK look at it, and without balancing the rights of the society, we will not have the safe and crime-free society we have today. And the rights of the accused or detainees, both under the ISA and CLTPA, are protected. They are dealt with by Tribunals."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00640,2021-10-04-T-021,640,K Shanmugam,"So, the questions for this House is  how do we view the risks of foreign interference? How do we place the risks, in the context of the other legislation that I have referred to? Would it be possible to deal with these issues of foreign interference through a normal Court process? Often, we do not even name the countries involved. Can you imagine naming one of our neighbours in Court? Or a larger country? When we asked Huang Jing to leave, we did not say who he was acting for. Why?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00641,2021-10-04-T-021,641,K Shanmugam,"The foreign policy and national security implications are too serious. The US can name any other country that it wishes. But we are a price taker in this business of international relations. Also, how do you have a Court process without leaks?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00642,2021-10-04-T-021,642,K Shanmugam,"So, if you look at what can be done through Executive Order under FICA, directives can be issued for greater transparency. The Government might ask some to disassociate themselves from foreigners if there is increased threat of foreign interference, but we should compare that against Land Acquisition, against the Orders that can be made under other legislation that I referred to. And also, it is not as it is either a Court process or nothing. There is a Tribunal, fully empowered, headed by a Supreme Court Judge. And they can consider any appeal brought under section 92."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00643,2021-10-04-T-021,643,K Shanmugam,"On a separate point, generally, in legislation, the usual rules for judicial review limit review of the Courts to reasonableness, legality and propriety. That has been so in POFMA as well as in other legislation."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00644,2021-10-04-T-021,644,K Shanmugam,"Members can see therefore, various pieces of legislation have conferred the Government with generally worded discretion. Philosophically, the Government has seen that as part of good governance to ensure our laws are effective so that Government can act when it needs to. You need checks and balances, but the checks must be suited to the task and balanced against the risks."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00645,2021-10-04-T-021,645,K Shanmugam,"What are the risks? There are risks with giving any government any power, whether or not it is appealable to a Court. There are always risks. It is a degree of risk. There is also risks in not giving power. The real issue is what powers should you give. What are the risks? And what are the risks in not giving the powers?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00646,2021-10-04-T-021,646,K Shanmugam,"The risk here which underlines some of the concerns that have been raised and some of the illustrations because the Government says these illustrations do not come within FICA and then we will say, what if the Government abuses its power. I referred to it briefly earlier. And what if the Government interferes with perfectly normal collaboration? With a foreigner, it will be an abuse of power. But what if the Government abuses its power?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00647,2021-10-04-T-021,647,K Shanmugam,"So, you have to weigh the risks of a rogue Government doing that versus a rogue foreign interference. The latter, is a far greater risk."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00648,2021-10-04-T-021,648,K Shanmugam,"The risk of a rogue Government abusing its power. First of all, what is the power compared with the powers in other legislation. Second, it can be looked at by a Tribunal headed by a Supreme Court Judge. All decisions published, people can see and assess themselves. And ultimately, people have the final say in a highly literate population like Singapore. A final say of public opinion and public opinion expressed through elections. People in Singapore would not stand for a rogue government."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00649,2021-10-04-T-021,649,K Shanmugam,"The risk of not giving the power or requiring a Court process, in the context of the risks I have outlined, will severely compromise the Government's ability to deal with the real risk of foreign interference which has actually happened."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00650,2021-10-04-T-021,650,K Shanmugam,"I, like some of those who could have made comments, and I am sure everyone here, wish that there is a world where the Government has the power to act and, at the same time, there is a complete check against abuse. If we can find that formula, we would gladly take that because that is ideal. But there is no such formula."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00651,2021-10-04-T-021,651,K Shanmugam,"Then, we have to look, first of all, admit that there are trade-offs whichever route you take. If you go to Court, there are trade-offs; if you have a Tribunal, there are trade-offs. And I agree that with a rogue government, there is a risk of abuse, as I have said, not just of this power but several other powers; and not just the powers executive powers but also even powers which can be looked at or appealed to the Courts. Just as there is a risk of an order made under MRHA against preachers on religious groups that we do not agree with, or detentions under the CLTPA, or land acquisition."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00652,2021-10-04-T-021,652,K Shanmugam,"In many countries, the population would not support this kind of land acquisition powers because it only leads to some very wealthy Ministers or not much public benefit. But in Singapore, the population trusted the Government and Singapore has developed in a way which could not even have been dreamt about in 1965. Along the way, we have had to make these choices in a number of areas as I showed to Members. And over time, people have seen how our approach proved to be good for the majority of people."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00653,2021-10-04-T-021,653,K Shanmugam,"And over the same period, Singapore's reputation for Rule of Law, its judicial system, legal system, institutions, both in and outside of the legal field, were all enhanced and they were built up."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00654,2021-10-04-T-021,654,K Shanmugam,"So, I say to this House  this law gives the Government a set of tools that can help. It is not a complete defense against foreign interference but they can help."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00655,2021-10-04-T-021,655,K Shanmugam,The Bill represents the best balance that we can find between dealing with the risks and providing checks against abuse.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00656,2021-10-04-T-021,656,K Shanmugam,Ms He also proposes to remove the immunity provision in clause 119. The reason for this suggestion is not clear. We recently amended the Police Force Act to provide that no liability shall lie personally against any enforcement officer who acts in good faith and with reasonable care in the execution of the Act or any other written law. That is clause 119. This provision simply extends the same protection to a competent authority or an authorised officer who assists a Police Officer in the execution of powers under the Act.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00657,2021-10-04-T-021,657,K Shanmugam,"Sir, in conclusion, I have articulated the need for the Bill and addressed the misconceptions that have surfaced in the past few days. This Bill is a calibrated piece of legislation that enables us to act surgically against threats that have come and continue to loom over us. Mr Speaker, I beg to move. [Applause.]"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00658,2021-10-04-T-021,658,K Shanmugam,[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00659,2021-10-04-T-021,659,Speaker,"Minister of State, Faishal Ibrahim."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00660,2021-10-04-T-021,660,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Mr Speaker, the Minister for Home Affairs has explained the outline and reasons for the Bill. I support the principles of the Bill as outlined by the Minister and would like to advocate the importance of having such a law to deal with Hostile Information Campaigns (HICs)."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00661,2021-10-04-T-021,661,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,I will discuss Parts 2 and 3 provisions pertaining to HICs.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00662,2021-10-04-T-021,662,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Foreign actors have leveraged digital technologies to carry out HICs. We have observed that these tend to be deliberate and coordinated attempts to use information to manipulate public opinion and harm a country’s interest. In addition, they are often clandestine and seek to mislead the public under false pretenses."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00663,2021-10-04-T-021,663,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,This Bill does so by providing a set of offences and empowering the Government to issue directions to counter HICs.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00664,2021-10-04-T-021,664,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"The new offences in Part 2 of the Bill are aimed at acts of foreign interference by covert means using electronic communications. Clause 10 defines electronic communications activity as the communication or distribution of any information or material through means of SMS, MMS, a social media service, a relevant electronic service or an Internet access service."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00665,2021-10-04-T-021,665,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Clause 17 introduces the offence of clandestine foreign interference by electronic communications activity. There are three elements.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00666,2021-10-04-T-021,666,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"First, the person acts on behalf of a foreign principal, or on behalf of a person acting on behalf of a foreign principal. He undertakes electronic communications activity that results in or involves publishing in Singapore any information or material."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00667,2021-10-04-T-021,667,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Second, any part of the person’s undertaking or electronic communications activity is covert or involves deception."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00668,2021-10-04-T-021,668,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Third, the person knows or has reason to believe that the electronic communications activity or the information or material published in Singapore is against Singapore’s public interest."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00669,2021-10-04-T-021,669,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"The offence clearly deals with persons covertly and knowingly acting against the public interest on behalf of a foreigner. The mere fact that communications were private, for example, an online video call between two people, would not make them covert."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00670,2021-10-04-T-021,670,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"For an offence to be made out, there must be an element of secrecy or a lack of transparency surrounding the person’s conduct. For example, a Singaporean is paid by a foreign intelligence agency to publish a number of articles criticising Singapore’s foreign policy towards that country. He does so but presents it in his personal capacity as a citizen without disclosing his links to the foreign agency. This would be considered covert."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00671,2021-10-04-T-021,671,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Clause 17 does not cover Singaporeans acting on their own accord or foreigners making open and attributable comments. Nor does it cover unintentional acts.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00672,2021-10-04-T-021,672,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"For example, an article by a foreigner who openly declares his identity, published in a foreign publication such as the Economist or the Wall Street Journal, would not be an offence under FICA. The same applies to foreign political observers or political commentators publishing on a social media platform or a blog, if they make no attempt to mislead Singaporeans as to who they are."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00673,2021-10-04-T-021,673,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"A Singaporean shares an online video propagated as part of a foreign HIC on his social media account. However, he does so unwittingly and was not aware that the content is part of a HIC nor did he receive any support or instruction from a foreign principal. The Singaporean also has not committed an offence."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00674,2021-10-04-T-021,674,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Clause 18 introduces a separate aggravated offence of clandestine foreign interference of a target using electronic communications activity. This offence would apply if a few conditions are fulfilled.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00675,2021-10-04-T-021,675,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"First, a person undertakes electronic communications activity on behalf of a foreign principal."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00676,2021-10-04-T-021,676,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Second, the person does so to influence another person to undertake activity or engage in conduct in Singapore that is prejudicial to Singapore’s public interest."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00677,2021-10-04-T-021,677,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Third, in doing so, the person does not disclose his links to the foreign principal."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00678,2021-10-04-T-021,678,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"This is an aggravated offence because it involves a greater degree of duplicity in targeting another person to act against Singapore’s public interest. Such acts are calculated and more likely even harder to detect, and consequently have the potential to cause greater harm. The offence thus carries higher penalties commensurate with the greater harm."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00679,2021-10-04-T-021,679,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Clause 19 introduces an offence of preparing or planning for the above offences and clause 115 clarifies that these offences will have extra-territorial application.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00680,2021-10-04-T-021,680,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"These offences will be investigated by the Police. For offences involving SAF installations, assets and personnel, Police will work with the SAF."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00681,2021-10-04-T-021,681,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"The Bill contains customised powers for the Government to act against HIC content online. Part 3 of the Bill empowers different directions  (a) to obtain information about HICs before they happen; (b) to detect and prevent HICs taking place; and (c) should they occur here, to contain the HIC."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00682,2021-10-04-T-021,682,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"As Minister has stressed, the basic architecture of our counter-HIC measures is that directions can be issued only when the Minister assesses that all of the following three conditions in clause 20 are met  (a) online communications activity is undertaken, or suspected to be undertaken, by or on behalf of a foreign principal; (b) The online communications activity results in content that is published in Singapore; and (c) it is in the public interest to issue that direction."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00683,2021-10-04-T-021,683,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Clause 7 sets out non-exhaustive illustrations of what would cross the public interest threshold. For example, in the interest of the security of Singapore, to protect public health or public finances, to prevent incitement of feelings of enmity between different groups in Singapore, or to prevent foreign interference directed towards a political end, which would include interfering in our domestic politics."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00684,2021-10-04-T-021,684,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"These illustrations reflect the context of HICs. They are not meant to constrain the interpretation of public interest found in other laws, which should be read in their respective contexts."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00685,2021-10-04-T-021,685,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"To improve the Government’s ability to investigate potential HICs, clause 36 introduces the Technical Assistance Direction to request various forms of assistance from social media services, relevant electronic services, hosting services, Internet access service providers and proprietors of online locations. The intent is for these parties to provide information or data that is useful in investigating if there is an ongoing HIC and the source of the HIC content, in particular, whether it originates from a foreign source."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00686,2021-10-04-T-021,686,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"This information includes basic subscriber information that is provided when accounts are set up such as IP addresses, or aggregated geolocation data. It is not MHA’s intent to demand assistance that is not reasonably practicable or information beyond what is necessary. Nor will we demand information for purposes beyond investigating a suspected HIC."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00687,2021-10-04-T-021,687,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Technical Assistance Directions are subject to a non-disclosure requirement to prevent tipping off a suspect of an ongoing investigation and prevent any unauthorised external party from undermining investigations. Recipients can specify that they received the direction but cannot disclose the substance of the direction. Breaches of any non-disclosure requirement constitutes an offence under clause 46.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00688,2021-10-04-T-021,688,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Other Part 3 directions are designed to provide targeted powers for the Government to contain the propagation of HICs and mitigate the harms caused.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00689,2021-10-04-T-021,689,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Clause 32 introduces the Must Carry Direction that will require the recipient to publish, post, display or include a message about the HIC content in a manner prescribed by Regulations. The intent of such directions is to warn the public that the content is part of a HIC. There are four classes of directions for different recipients."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00690,2021-10-04-T-021,690,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,A Class 1 Must Carry Direction can be issued to the communicator of the HIC content to publish a mandatory message.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00691,2021-10-04-T-021,691,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"A Class 2 direction can be issued to relevant electronic services and social media services to publish a mandatory message with respect to specified information or material, or identical copies of it. For example, if a foreign state-run media outlet posts videos on social media and these videos are part of a HIC campaign, then the Government may issue a Class 2 direction to the social media platform, to require the platform to publish a notification tagged to the video to notify the public that this video is part of a HIC campaign."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00692,2021-10-04-T-021,692,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"A Class 3 direction requires providers of social media services, relevant electronic services, telecommunications services, newspapers or licensed broadcasting services to publish a general notice to end-users in Singapore. It is not necessary for HIC content to have been communicated on the service in order for a direction to be issued. This class of directions is intended to alert Singaporeans that a HIC is ongoing."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00693,2021-10-04-T-021,693,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,A Class 4 direction requires proprietors of Proscribed Online Locations to put up a notice about its proscribed status so that any visitors to the online location are aware that it is a HIC vector.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00694,2021-10-04-T-021,694,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,There are two directions to remove specific HIC content from being accessible by end users in Singapore.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00695,2021-10-04-T-021,695,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Clause 30 introduces the Stop Communication (end-user) Direction, which will require communicators to take down information or material that is published in Singapore, and to stop publishing similar material in Singapore; and clause 31 introduces the Disabling Direction, which will require relevant electronic services and social media services to take down specific content from the view of Singapore end-users."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00696,2021-10-04-T-021,696,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Clause 34 introduces the Account Restriction Direction, which can be issued to relevant electronic services and social media services, and is intended to prevent specific accounts from communicating with Singapore end-users."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00697,2021-10-04-T-021,697,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Clause 35 introduces the Service Restriction Direction, which can be issued to relevant electronic services, social media services and internet access service providers to stem the virality of HICs and restrict internet service functionality respectively. Each Service Restriction Direction will specify the actions required of the recipient. For example, restricting a certain function of their service, preventing harmful content from being actively recommended to end-users in Singapore, or slowing down or stopping Internet access. MHA will work with the industry on how such directions are to be operationalised, and identify reasonable and practicable interventions, given the potential significant impact on the services."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00698,2021-10-04-T-021,698,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Clause 37 introduces the App Removal Direction to stop the further distribution of an app to Singapore end-users, if the app is being used to spread HIC content. This can be issued only if at least one direction that is not a Technical Assistance Direction or another App Removal Direction, had been issued with respect to that app."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00699,2021-10-04-T-021,699,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Clause 24 provides for the Minister to declare an online location as a Proscribed Online Location (or POL) if one Part 3 direction, other than the Technical Assistance Direction, has been issued. Once proscribed, it is an offence to operate this POL, provide support to it or have advertising dealings with it. Clauses 39 to 41 give effect to these restrictions. To ensure that the public is aware of its POL status, a Class 4 Must Carry Direction can be issued to require the owner to put up a notice about its proscribed status. The intent of this POL regime is hence to reduce the impact of the POL by  (a) firstly, reducing its visibility via advertising; (b) secondly, warning Singaporeans to the threat posed by the POL; and (c) thirdly, cutting off its revenue streams and preventing it from profiting from its operations."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00700,2021-10-04-T-021,700,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,We also need to be able to take action against non-compliance of directions. Clause 33 introduces the Access Blocking Direction. There are two classes.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00701,2021-10-04-T-021,701,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Class 1 can be issued to Internet access service providers to disable access by every end-user in Singapore to the website or service that had not complied with the direction.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00702,2021-10-04-T-021,702,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Class 2 can be applied to internet access service providers, relevant electronic services and social media services to disable access to a POL if paid content on the POL is published in Singapore or the POL fails to comply with the Must Carry (Class 4) Direction to notify Singaporean users about its POL status."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00703,2021-10-04-T-021,703,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Clause 38 introduces the Disgorgement Direction. This can be issued to any Singaporean, resident in Singapore or locally registered entity that has supported the HIC and it will require them to return to the foreign source any funding or material support provided."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00704,2021-10-04-T-021,704,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Non-compliance with these directions will be an offence under clause 45. If charged, parties may raise the defence that it was not reasonably practicable to do more than what was done or that there were no better practicable means of complying, for example, due to technical impossibility."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00705,2021-10-04-T-021,705,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Mr Speaker, HICs can cause devastating harm, including erosion of the country's sovereignty, undermining of social cohesion and loss of public trust. Minister has provided a detailed account and these cases are well publicised. In addition, threat actors are improving their tactics all the time."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00706,2021-10-04-T-021,706,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Therefore, we cannot wait for harms to occur before taking action because severe damage may already be done. Should there be credible information about a potential HIC threat, the Government must be able to act to prevent it."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00707,2021-10-04-T-021,707,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Our authorisation thresholds must therefore be calibrated to allow certain directions to be issued even before any harmful communications have commenced. Clause 21 therefore provides for two specific directions – Technical Assistance Direction and Account Restriction Direction – to be authorised before harmful communications activity has taken place.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00708,2021-10-04-T-021,708,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Let me illustrate how we intend to use these levers.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00709,2021-10-04-T-021,709,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Take the following scenario, which is illustrative but not exhaustive. It is not hypothetical because we have seen this modus operandi in HICs conducted against other countries."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00710,2021-10-04-T-021,710,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"On a social media service, a set of accounts amasses followers by first posting popular content on lifestyle matters, such as cute animal videos or funny memes. There are multiple accounts and the accounts act in coordination. For example, account A actively tries to increase account B's visibility by sharing its content and so on."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00711,2021-10-04-T-021,711,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"At the opportune moment, such as election season or during a period of tension with another country, these accounts start to pivot to social and political commentaries, hoping to sway how Singaporeans vote or react to a foreign policy issue."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00712,2021-10-04-T-021,712,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assuming this happens here and our monitoring agencies detect these accounts gaining traction. We can issue a Technical Assistance Direction to investigate the origin of such accounts.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00713,2021-10-04-T-021,713,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"If we have sufficient reason to believe that these are foreign accounts and are planning to undertake a HIC against Singapore, we can issue Account Restriction Directions to prevent them from propagating their HIC content to end-users in Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00714,2021-10-04-T-021,714,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Mr Speaker, MHA has studied international cases and reviewed testimony from the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods to come up with these directions. Let me reiterate that MHA will use these powers judiciously and will calibrate our actions based on the specifics of each case."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00715,2021-10-04-T-021,715,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"In assessing whether a HIC is afoot, the primary determinant is the behaviour of the actor involved and the entities behind the content. It is clear therefore that Singaporeans who are simply expressing their own views or engaging in the political process on their own accord are not covered and neither will the vast majority of communications involving foreigners, be it journalism or academia or online advocacy."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00716,2021-10-04-T-021,716,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"MHA has also consulted the major stakeholders on the operationalisation of these directions and will continue doing so, to take into account the industry's constraints, from the technical to the legal, as we work together to counter HIC threats on their platforms."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00717,2021-10-04-T-021,717,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,I have set out the clear conditions that must be met before directions can be issued and the defences inscribed in the Bill. I will now set out the avenues for appeal.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00718,2021-10-04-T-021,718,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,This Bill will provide the right of appeal to recipients of counter-HIC directions and proprietors of Proscribed Online Locations (POL). Appeals will be heard by a reviewing tribunal.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00719,2021-10-04-T-021,719,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Clause 23 clarifies that recipients of counter-HIC directions and proprietors of POLs must first apply to the Minister to reconsider the Part 3 direction. Should the Minister reject the application, the appealing party may then appeal to a reviewing tribunal, which is constituted under Part 8 of the Bill."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00720,2021-10-04-T-021,720,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"The appeal to the tribunal must be submitted within 30 days from the outcome of the Minister's reconsideration. This tribunal can then dismiss the appeal, confirm the direction appealed against, or revoke the direction. Decisions would be determined by the tribunal and are final. These are set out in clause 97."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00721,2021-10-04-T-021,721,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"The Minister has explained the reasoning behind the reviewing tribunal. The difficulty that confronts us is the suitability of making the Courts serve as an oversight body for decisions taken under the Bill, which involve issues of national security, defence and foreign policy and information from intelligence sources, not necessarily only of our agencies. Our own Courts have said that they have limits in these areas."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00722,2021-10-04-T-021,722,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"The reviewing tribunal structure thus recognises the need for checks and balances while protecting sensitive intelligence that is relied upon to counter a HIC. The Tribunal, in fact, goes further than judicial review in some ways in that it is able to assess the initial decision on its merits whereas the Court in judicial review proceedings focuses only upon the legality of the administrative decision."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00723,2021-10-04-T-021,723,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Mr Speaker, allow me to continue my speech in Malay."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00724,2021-10-04-T-021,724,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Speaker, we are facing a severe and evolving threat of foreign interference, which can be carried out online through HICs or through local proxies involved in our political processes also known as Politically Significant Persons or PSPs. Minister and I have outlined the threat of HICs, and MOS Desmond will speak on the threat of PSPs. It is clear that we need to take steps to counter it."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00725,2021-10-04-T-021,725,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"We have been discussing these issues in Singapore over the last three years. At least 18 representors spoke on the threat of foreign interference at the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods in 2018. There was a major conference in 2019, and discussions at our Committee of Supply (COS) Debates. So, this is not a Bill that has come in haste."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00726,2021-10-04-T-021,726,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"This Bill does not significantly increase the substantive powers from existing laws such as the Internal Security Act, Criminal Procedure Code, Broadcasting Act and Telecommunications Act. In fact, a significant portion of the Bill, is simply the Political Donations Act ported over."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00727,2021-10-04-T-021,727,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"So, what the Bill does is to provide more targeted and calibrated levers against HICs, which are narrower than existing powers such as in the Broadcasting and Telecommunications Act. I have brought the House through these levers, and provided some illustrations of how we intend to use them in a judicious and proportionate manner."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00728,2021-10-04-T-021,728,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"In addition, this Bill ports over the requirements for PSPs from the Political Donations Act and introduces a more robust framework of designations and executory powers to deal with interference through PSPs, which Minister of State Desmond will elaborate on."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00729,2021-10-04-T-021,729,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,There are comparable levers and requirements in other foreign jurisdictions.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00730,2021-10-04-T-021,730,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Let me also reiterate that this Bill does not target Singaporeans participating independently in our domestic political discourse nor the very vast majority of interactions with foreigners. It is primarily concerned about covert and clandestine activities to manipulate our domestic politics and undermine our political sovereignty, and not open, transparent and attributable activities, transactions, relationships, or even criticisms. There are also various safeguards such as clear criteria for offences, clear authorisation thresholds for directions and avenues for appeal."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00731,2021-10-04-T-021,731,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Mr Speaker, this Government has always taken the firm stance that our domestic politics are for Singaporeans to decide, and that we should not allow foreign actors to interfere in them. This Bill ensures that we can continue to take this stance and that Singaporeans can continue to make our own choices on how we should govern our country and live our lives."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00732,2021-10-04-T-021,732,Speaker,Minister of State Desmond Tan.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00733,2021-10-04-T-021,733,Desmond Tan,"Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Minister, I will now take Members through the second part of the Bill that empowers us to counter foreign interference through local proxies."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00734,2021-10-04-T-021,734,Desmond Tan,"Despite the proliferation of foreign interference attempts in the digital space, we still see many instances of interference by hostile foreign actors in the physical world through compromising local proxies."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00735,2021-10-04-T-021,735,Desmond Tan,"One example that was raised in the Minister's earlier speech took place in Australia, where a former senator received donations from an individual with connections to a foreign government. The former senator then advocated for the foreign country's position on the South China Sea despite it being contradictory to his party's position."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00736,2021-10-04-T-021,736,Desmond Tan,"Another example took place in 2015, where Reuters reported that a state-linked company was covertly backing at least 33 radio stations in countries across the Asia Pacific region to form a global network broadcasting news that placed that particular state in a positive light."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00737,2021-10-04-T-021,737,Desmond Tan,"Closer to home, Singapore is not immune. In the 1980s, the First Secretary of the United States Embassy in Singapore, Hank Hendrickson, cultivated a group of Singaporean lawyers to join Opposition politics and contest the 1988 General Election. The lawyers were offered funding, and one of them was even offered refuge in the US should he subsequently run into difficulties with the Singapore Government."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00738,2021-10-04-T-021,738,Desmond Tan,We should update our laws to address the new ways that foreign actors can influence local political individuals and entities.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00739,2021-10-04-T-021,739,Desmond Tan,"We currently have the Political Donations Act (PDA) that prohibits political associations, as well as election candidates and their agents, from accepting monetary donations from foreign sources."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00740,2021-10-04-T-021,740,Desmond Tan,"However, the PDA does not cover other individuals who are directly involved in our political processes, such as our Members of Parliament. Also, the PDA only covers monetary donations, and does not cover other possible vectors of interference such as through formal affiliation with a foreign organisation and provision of volunteer services by foreigners."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00741,2021-10-04-T-021,741,Desmond Tan,"To strengthen our safeguards, this Bill will repeal the PDA, bring the existing PDA obligations into this Bill, and introduce some additional countermeasures."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00742,2021-10-04-T-021,742,Desmond Tan,"First, let me go through the individuals and entities that this Bill aims to cover."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00743,2021-10-04-T-021,743,Desmond Tan,"Clause 14 of the Bill defines individuals and entities, who are formally involved in our political processes, as Politically Significant Persons (PSPs). These are listed in the Bill, and are, namely  political parties; Political Office Holders; Members of Parliament, which includes elected Members of Parliament, Non-Constituency Members of Parliament and Nominated Members of Parliament; Leader of the House; Leader of the Opposition; election candidates; and election agents."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00744,2021-10-04-T-021,744,Desmond Tan,"The Bill also empowers the Competent Authority, a civil servant in MHA appointed by the Minister for Home Affairs, to designate other individuals and entities as PSPs, if certain conditions are met."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00745,2021-10-04-T-021,745,Desmond Tan,"Clause 14, read with clauses 47 and 48, empowers the Competent Authority to designate entities and individuals respectively as PSPs if  (a) they are members of foreign political or legislative bodies, or their activities are directed in part towards a political end; and (b) the Competent Authority assesses that it is in the public interest that countermeasures be applied."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00746,2021-10-04-T-021,746,Desmond Tan,It is important that we have levers to designate and impose countermeasures on individuals and entities who may be at risk of foreign interference and have exhibited behaviour that points to such risk. It also has the effect of promoting transparency and deterring would-be foreign actors with malicious intent from trying to influence Singapore’s politics through these local proxies.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00747,2021-10-04-T-021,747,Desmond Tan,I will now talk about the different countermeasures that will be imposed on both defined and designated PSPs.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00748,2021-10-04-T-021,748,Desmond Tan,All PSPs will have to comply with a baseline set of obligations and countermeasures.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00749,2021-10-04-T-021,749,Desmond Tan,We will apply the most stringent countermeasures on defined PSPs as they are directly involved in Singapore’s political processes.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00750,2021-10-04-T-021,750,Desmond Tan,"For designated PSPs, in the first instance of designation, their obligations only pertain to disclosure. However, clause 88 provides for countermeasures to be stepped-up, if conditions are met, potentially to the same level as those for defined PSPs."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00751,2021-10-04-T-021,751,Desmond Tan,The countermeasures on PSPs are detailed in Chart 2 that was earlier distributed.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00752,2021-10-04-T-021,752,Desmond Tan,"First, let me talk about donations."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00753,2021-10-04-T-021,753,Desmond Tan,"Clauses 62 to 65 require all PSPs, both defined and designated, to disclose donations to the Competent Authority. Donations need to be disclosed if they are $10,000 or more. Smaller donations from the same donor that when aggregated during the same reporting period amounts to $10,000 or more, also have to be disclosed."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00754,2021-10-04-T-021,754,Desmond Tan,"Donations that need to be disclosed do not only cover those that are made in cash. Clause 51 articulates the types of donations that the Bill will cover, including donations made in kind, or the provision of goods and services for a fee below the fair market value."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00755,2021-10-04-T-021,755,Desmond Tan,"That said, the Bill does not cover all kinds of donations, only donations that are directed wholly or in part towards a political end."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00756,2021-10-04-T-021,756,Desmond Tan,"The disclosure requirements do not cover personal gifts, for example, as the intent of the Bill is to safeguard against foreign interference in our domestic politics. Certain other donations or gifts may be handled by other laws."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00757,2021-10-04-T-021,757,Desmond Tan,"Defined PSPs are subject to more stringent donation controls. For example, defined PSPs are  (a) prohibited from receiving donations from impermissible donors, such as foreign donors and Singapore citizens below the age of 21 years old; (b) not allowed to receive $5,000 or more of anonymous donations; and (c) are required to maintain a dedicated bank account to hold their political donations."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00758,2021-10-04-T-021,758,Desmond Tan,Designated PSPs are not subject to these restrictions at the onset of designation. Members will see from the annex that most of these requirements already exist in the PDA today.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00759,2021-10-04-T-021,759,Desmond Tan,"Influence can also come about though volunteers apart from donations. Clause 56 prohibits defined PSPs from accepting volunteer labour or services from foreigners. The Bill is not concerned with all types of voluntary services, and only prohibits defined PSPs from accepting voluntary services that relate specifically to the duties and responsibilities of the PSPs in question. For instance, a Member of Parliament cannot allow foreigners to volunteer at Meet-the-People Sessions or any other programmes that are organised by the political parties."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00760,2021-10-04-T-021,760,Desmond Tan,"For designated PSPs, there is no prohibition on foreign volunteers in the first instance."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00761,2021-10-04-T-021,761,Desmond Tan,"However, if there is an increased risk of foreign interference, clause 85(2)(b), read with clause 88, empowers the Competent Authority to require that the designated PSP report voluntary labour and services that are rendered by foreigners."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00762,2021-10-04-T-021,762,Desmond Tan,"Next, disclosure requirements on foreign affiliations. The Bill does not cover all kinds of affiliations. For example, personal friendships or co-workers are not covered by the Bill. The Bill does not restrict association with a foreigner and is not intended to reduce foreign partnerships or businesses."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00763,2021-10-04-T-021,763,Desmond Tan,"An example of what the Bill is concerned with is foreign affiliations where the foreign principals are in a position of control over the PSP and the PSP is taking direct instructions from the foreign principal. For example, being an employee of a foreign company would be one such arrangement that will need to be disclosed if you are a PSP. These reportable arrangements are defined in clause 78."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00764,2021-10-04-T-021,764,Desmond Tan,"If there is an increased risk of foreign interference, clause 84, read with clause 88, empowers the Competent Authority to require the PSP to terminate its foreign affiliations."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00765,2021-10-04-T-021,765,Desmond Tan,"Clauses 78(3) and 78(4) will require defined and designated PSPs individuals to declare if they have been granted migration benefits by foreign countries. Examples of migration benefits will include a foreign passport, travel identification documents, an entitlement or privilege or status to work or reside in the foreign country, or an honorary citizenship. The purpose of this declaration is simply for transparency. There would be no stepped-up countermeasures to prohibit the acceptance of migration benefits."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00766,2021-10-04-T-021,766,Desmond Tan,"Next, on leadership and membership. The Societies Act already disallows foreigners from being members of political parties. This will continue."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00767,2021-10-04-T-021,767,Desmond Tan,"Designated Politically Significant Entities (PSEs), in the first instance, are not prohibited from appointing foreigners to leadership positions or accepting foreign memberships. If there is an increased risk of foreign interference, clause 83, read with clause 88, empowers the Competent Authority to prohibit the PSE from accepting foreigners as members or appointing them as responsible officers within the entity."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00768,2021-10-04-T-021,768,Desmond Tan,There may be instances where the Government will need to act even before we designate an individual or organisation as PSPs. The Bill provides for countermeasures in two of such cases.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00769,2021-10-04-T-021,769,Desmond Tan,"First, foreign states may attempt to cultivate Singapore citizens to influence our domestic politics through their involvement in foreign political and legislative bodies. Examples of these would be a foreign political party, or political advisory body."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00770,2021-10-04-T-021,770,Desmond Tan,Clause 79 will require Singapore Citizens to declare their involvement in foreign political or legislative bodies.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00771,2021-10-04-T-021,771,Desmond Tan,"MHA recognises that there may be innocuous instances where Singaporeans living abroad join foreign political bodies, such as Singaporean students joining foreign political parties while they are studying abroad, out of their own personal interests. However, this can nonetheless still pose a threat, as such Singaporeans may be cultivated, approached or influenced, even unknowingly, and subsequently made use of to affect our local politics. As such, it is necessary to require them to disclose their involvement in such bodies for transparency purposes."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00772,2021-10-04-T-021,772,Desmond Tan,"Second, based on our experience of seeing foreign writers masquerading as local writers in penning articles relating to Singaporean political matters, we felt that it was important for Singaporeans to be aware of the origin of such articles and perspectives."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00773,2021-10-04-T-021,773,Desmond Tan,"If there is an increased risk of foreign interference, clauses 80 to 82 will allow the Competent Authority to issue a transparency directive to direct any newspaper, media outlet which includes online media, or any defined or designated PSP that publishes matters on political issues relating to Singapore, to disclose the particulars of any foreign author or foreign principal for whom or at whose direction the article or programme is published, if the article or programme is a political matter concerning Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00774,2021-10-04-T-021,774,Desmond Tan,"To be clear, this will only apply to entities that are issued with the transparency directives."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00775,2021-10-04-T-021,775,Desmond Tan,There is no fixed expiry date for the designation and countermeasures imposed on PSPs. This approach is the same as that under the PDA.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00776,2021-10-04-T-021,776,Desmond Tan,But the process is transparent when we designate PSPs.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00777,2021-10-04-T-021,777,Desmond Tan,"Clause 49 of the Bill states that when we designate a politically significant person or entity, the Competent Authority must, without delay, give the individual or entity notice of the designation."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00778,2021-10-04-T-021,778,Desmond Tan,"Moreover, if a PSP wishes to challenge its designation for the stepped-up countermeasures imposed on it, it may submit an application for the Competent Authority’s reconsideration or an appeal to the Minister for Home Affairs."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00779,2021-10-04-T-021,779,Desmond Tan,Clause 102 allows the Minister to consult an advisory body before arriving at a determination on the merits of the appeal.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00780,2021-10-04-T-021,780,Desmond Tan,"Unless a Singaporean or entity is acting as a foreign agent or working with foreigners to affect our public interest, they will not be covered. Academic research, business partnerships, creative collaborations, cultural exchanges – such interactions will not be designated. An employee working for an American tech firm that is openly advocating for American technology as part of their business will not be designated as there is no public interest in doing so. It is also not within the Bill’s intent to prevent local NGOs from freely working with foreign businesses on their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects. The Bill also does not seek to stop businesses and organisations from building overseas partnerships or soliciting for overseas business, networking with foreigners, going to conferences or seminars, or engaging in cultural exchanges."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00781,2021-10-04-T-021,781,Desmond Tan,These types of activities and dealings will not be constrained in any way by the proposed Bill. It will be business as usual as we know it for the vast majority of Singaporeans and residents in Singapore.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00782,2021-10-04-T-021,782,Desmond Tan,Allow me to give an example of how the PSP measures will apply.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00783,2021-10-04-T-021,783,Desmond Tan,Let us take a case of a Singapore-registered entity which has been actively commenting on Singapore’s politics in advocating a potentially divisive social issue. The Competent Authority has reason to believe that the entity may be receiving support from a foreign state-linked agency. This entity may be designated by the Competent Authority as a PSE.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00784,2021-10-04-T-021,784,Desmond Tan,"To ensure transparency of its activities, the PSE will have to submit donation and foreign affiliation disclosures in the very first instance."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00785,2021-10-04-T-021,785,Desmond Tan,"This is in fact less stringent than the PDA of today. Under the PDA, if an entity is designated as a political association, the controls are the same as those imposed on a political party. This includes not being allowed to receive foreign funding and a cap on anonymous donations."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00786,2021-10-04-T-021,786,Desmond Tan,"If the Competent Authority assesses that there is a heightened threat of foreign interference, the PSE may be issued with stepped-up countermeasures."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00787,2021-10-04-T-021,787,Desmond Tan,"For example, if the PSE is suspected to be receiving funding from the foreign agency to organise a petition against the Government calling for a change in our laws on the issue that the group is advocating for, the Competent Authority may issue a directive prohibiting the PSE from receiving foreign donations."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00788,2021-10-04-T-021,788,Desmond Tan,"If the PSE is affiliated with a foreign group which is suspected to be taking instructions from a foreign state, the Competent Authority may direct the PSE to end its affiliation with the foreign group. If the PSE has been publishing articles related to Singapore politics, it may also be issued with a transparency directive to disclose the nationalities of contributors of the articles."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00789,2021-10-04-T-021,789,Desmond Tan,"Finally, it is useful to highlight that a substantial portion of the Bill that deals with local proxies was ported over from the PDA. Where it is new, it is meant to address the gaps. Our approach is also narrower than the Australian or US approach."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00790,2021-10-04-T-021,790,Desmond Tan,"Mr Speaker, allow me to now speak and conclude in Chinese."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00791,2021-10-04-T-021,791,Desmond Tan,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Speaker, Sun Tzu's Art of War has a saying, ""it is better to win the heart of people than to capture the city."" This saying encapsulates why we need a Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00792,2021-10-04-T-021,792,Desmond Tan,"Historical thinkers have warned us against overlooking psychological defence in warfare. As the saying goes, ""the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting."" In today's context, the best strategy in warfare is to win the war without the firing of a single bullet."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00793,2021-10-04-T-021,793,Desmond Tan,"History is full of such examples. One such example is Ukraine, which is said to have suffered extensive intervention during the 2014 Crimean status referendum, where sensitive societal fault lines were targeted by a hostile information campaign orchestrated by the Russians to build popular support for Crimea to join Russia. This eventually led to the annexation of Crimea."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00794,2021-10-04-T-021,794,Desmond Tan,"If we were to allow foreign interference in our domestic politics, Singapore may similarly be subject to such divisive forces. This may result in us losing our autonomy and becoming a vassal state to a foreign power, or a puppet to foreign forces. This is certainly not the desirable outcome."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00795,2021-10-04-T-021,795,Desmond Tan,"The PAP Government has always taken a firm stand that our domestic politics are for Singaporeans to decide, and that we should not allow foreign actors to interfere in them."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00796,2021-10-04-T-021,796,Desmond Tan,"However, this is easier said than done. Being a small open economy and a multicultural society, Singapore is highly susceptible to foreign interference. To ensure that we keep step with the evolving tactics of hostile actors, it is timely for us to update our laws to address the threat of foreign interference."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00797,2021-10-04-T-021,797,Desmond Tan,"In addition, I must point out that contrary to what some commentators have been saying about FICA, the Bill is not intended to target businesses, academic institutions, trade associations, clan associations or other cultural, religious, community or charity groups in their legitimate dealings with foreigners. Singaporeans will still be free to express their views. In fact, the Government's wish is that with FICA, Singaporeans will be able to freely voice their opinions on Singaporean matters and not the perspective of others."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00798,2021-10-04-T-021,798,Desmond Tan,"I want to remind the public that the foreign interference threat is an invisible one, and the threat that the passage of FICA aims to mitigate is one that is hard to guard against because it insidiously targets our world view. And once these perspectives are allowed to fundamentally alter our belief systems, it will be too late for us to take remedial action."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00799,2021-10-04-T-021,799,Desmond Tan,"The Bill provides Singapore with the basic levers to defend ourselves, but we hope FICA will raise Singaporeans' awareness about the threat of foreign interference, so that we will not unwittingly become vehicles for hostile foreign actors to undermine our national interest. My wish is for Singaporeans to commit to working together to ensure that our affairs will be for Singaporeans only to decide."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00800,2021-10-04-T-021,800,Desmond Tan,"(In English)  Mr Speaker, this Government has taken a firm stance against foreign interference since our Independence. This Bill ensures that Singaporeans retain the freedom to decide how we should govern our country, how we should live our lives."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00801,2021-10-04-T-021,801,Speaker,Mr Pritam Singh.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00802,2021-10-04-T-021,802,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, I rise to speak on the Bill. Before I begin, I do not recall coming across a Bill that is understood in such diametrically opposing ways by, on the one hand, some members of the public, including at least two Senior Counsels, many civil society activists, former Nominated Members of Parliament and journalists, and by the Executive on the other."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00803,2021-10-04-T-021,803,Pritam Singh,This anomaly in our public discourse regarding this Bill is significant and it bears deep reflection on how our laws are made and communicated to the public before they are passed in this House.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00804,2021-10-04-T-021,804,Pritam Singh,"Sir, my speech has four parts. One, is a summary of the amendments filed by the Workers' Party's Members of Parliament; two, is on how exceptional executive power requires robust judicial oversight to ensure accountability; three, is on how the Government should have sought public feedback on this Bill; and four, is on how the Government has been largely muted as to the non-legislative measures to combat foreign interference and why this needs to be corrected urgently."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00805,2021-10-04-T-021,805,Pritam Singh,Let me first summarise the amendments proposed by the Workers' Party's Members of Parliament who will explain the substantive basis of their amendments in their respective speeches.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00806,2021-10-04-T-021,806,Pritam Singh,"Ms He Ting Ru, Mr Leon Perera, Mr Gerald Giam and Mr Jamus Lim filed amendments to the Bill on 27 September 2021 by 4 30 pm, which is the deadline for filing any amendments to Bills for this particular Sitting. The thrust of the amendments is in four areas  accountability, fairness, transparency and effectiveness."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00807,2021-10-04-T-021,807,Pritam Singh,The first area is accountability. The Government must be accountable when it implements this law and uses executive power against individuals and entities. There should be robust oversight of executive action by the Supreme Court. This must be the default position for parliamentary democracy that recognises the centrality of the separation of powers under our Constitution.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00808,2021-10-04-T-021,808,Pritam Singh,"The second area is fairness. The law must more precisely scope the extent of executive powers to minimise the prospect of abuse of power. Phrases such as ""is likely to"" and ""where the Minister suspects"" create low thresholds of proof that could be unfairly used against entities and individuals if power is in the wrong hands. While the Bill targets foreign interference, Singaporeans are the central focus and it is important that their constitutional rights are respected."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00809,2021-10-04-T-021,809,Pritam Singh,"The third area is transparency. There has to be greater clarity and transparency on the entities and individuals affected by this Bill. I note in this regard that MHA has made a statement in the middle of last week – I think there have been a few statements and comments made by the Ministry – that it will publish details of designated persons or entities, but the point is, surely this should have been made more explicit in the Bill."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00810,2021-10-04-T-021,810,Pritam Singh,"The fourth area is effectiveness. The Workers' Party has no objection to the additional requirements that are ported to this Bill in connection with the porting over of the Political Donations Act into FICA. However, we do question whether the list of Politically Significant Persons is far-reaching enough. I note Minister's comments in his Second Reading speech. But the point is our Civil Service has a significant footprint in the success of Singapore, with its central role in influencing Government policy. As key nodes in decision-making, civil servants from Deputy Secretary upwards, in our view, should be designated like Politically Significant Persons."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00811,2021-10-04-T-021,811,Pritam Singh,"As MHA's press release on the First Reading of the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill shows, the danger of elite capture is an insidious threat. It would be unwise to assume that only politicians, civil society activists and journalists are vectors for foreign influence. To this end, it would be important for the public to understand that the Government did not think it necessary to designate such individuals as PSPs in the original Bill. I will leave Member of Parliament Gerald Giam to speak more on this subject."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00812,2021-10-04-T-021,812,Pritam Singh,"Of the four areas of amendments, foremost is accountability of the Executive, because without that, fairness in scoping powers and greater transparency are but shadow puppets."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00813,2021-10-04-T-021,813,Pritam Singh,This is why the second part of my speech is on how exceptional executive power requires the strongest of oversight to ensure accountability.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00814,2021-10-04-T-021,814,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, the starting position of the Workers’ Party is that the ubiquity of the threat of foreign interference and its low-cost ecosystem, particularly online, is neither a figment of the imagination, nor can it be wished away. It follows that the Government must have powers and, in some cases, even potentially intrusive powers, to intervene in the appropriate case. However, if we accept that such broad-ranging, broadly defined powers should be legislated to deal with foreign interference, then this House must ensure the legislation of equally robust oversight mechanisms to prevent abuse of power."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00815,2021-10-04-T-021,815,Pritam Singh,"If a poll were to be conducted among ordinary Singaporeans on concepts like the separation of powers doctrine and its centrality to our system of Government, such a poll, I would hazard, would likely elicit quizzical looks. One can hazard a guess that not a small number of our citizens would be unsure of how important such principles are to our political system."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00816,2021-10-04-T-021,816,Pritam Singh,Let me add a historical dimension. Members of this House may have noticed a compact wooden bookcase at one end of the Parliament library. This bookcase and a number of books on parliamentary and constitutional subjects were presented by the UK’s House of Commons to the then-Speaker of Parliament P Coomaraswamy on 16 November 1966 to mark Singapore becoming the 22nd nation of the Commonwealth to gain Independence.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00817,2021-10-04-T-021,817,Pritam Singh,"This House passed a resolution recognising the receipt of these gifts on 5 December that year. One of the famous books in this bookcase is the Law of the Constitution by Albert Dicey where that hallowed phrase central to the separation of powers in all parliamentary democracies is found, and I quote  ""Powers, however extraordinary, which are conferred by or sanctioned by statute, are never unlimited, for they are confined by the words of the Act itself, and, what is more, by the interpretation put upon the statute by the judges."" Unquote."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00818,2021-10-04-T-021,818,Pritam Singh,"The separation of powers doctrine and its close relationship with the rule of law was affirmed in the recent Court of Appeal judgment in Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam v PP. The Court of Appeal observed that the separation of powers is, and I quote, ""embodied in the Singapore Constitution by virtue of Article 23 (which vests the executive authority in the President and the Cabinet), Article 38 (which vests the legislative power in the President and Parliament) and Article 93 (which vests the judicial power in a system of the courts).” Unquote."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00819,2021-10-04-T-021,819,Pritam Singh,"The Court of Appeal also observed, and I quote again, ""any society that prides itself in being governed by the rule of law, as our society does, must hold steadfastly to the principle that all power has legal limits, and the rule of law demands that the courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power."" Unquote."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00820,2021-10-04-T-021,820,Pritam Singh,"In stark contrast, the Bill before us today envisages the creation of a Reviewing Tribunal within the Executive branch with quasi-judicial powers with regard to the right of appeal against authorisation for Part 3 directions, or against the decisions of a Competent Authority. Clause 99 appears to go so far as to completely displace natural justice from the oversight process as drafted in the Bill. One of its paragraphs states that the Rules may enable or require a Reviewing Tribunal to hear or consider any proceedings or appeal without the person who brought the appeal having been given full particulars of the reasons for any conduct which is the subject of the proceedings or appeal."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00821,2021-10-04-T-021,821,Pritam Singh,"Many of the public have read it carefully and I would forward that it shocks the sensitivities of many, and it goes some way to explain how this Bill has been framed and understood by the public since its First Reading three weeks ago."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00822,2021-10-04-T-021,822,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, the Workers’ Party rejects such an appeal mechanism. We propose an amendment of clause 104 to allow first for an appeal to the Minister and thereafter to the High Court with full judicial scrutiny. Of course, there is a provision for a private hearing where national security is at risk. Workers’ Party Member of Parliament for Sengkang GRC He Ting Ru will go through these amendments."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00823,2021-10-04-T-021,823,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, the books presented to Speaker Coomaraswamy in 1966 and their subject matter may only be familiar to a small class of Singaporeans. But ask Singaporeans generally about checks and balances and a clear majority would agree that they are important for Singapore. Power and responsibility must be divided, to empower each branch of Government, and ensure the exercise of power is not unlimited."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00824,2021-10-04-T-021,824,Pritam Singh,Which brings me to the third part of my speech on how the Government should have sought public feedback on the Bill.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00825,2021-10-04-T-021,825,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, there has been considerable disquiet in some quarters at the speed at which this Bill has been presented to Parliament. In March this year at the Committee of Supply debates, Deputy Speaker Christopher de Souza enquired what MHA would do to deter foreign influence in Singapore’s domestic affairs."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00826,2021-10-04-T-021,826,Pritam Singh,"The Second Minister for Home Affairs, hon Mrs Josephine Teo, addressed the query and announced that legislative levers may be needed. I quote, ""Given the recent experience of other countries, we need to consider further measures to guard against foreign subversion of politically significant individuals and entities. For example, what levels of transparency in funding support and leadership are appropriate and for whom."""
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00827,2021-10-04-T-021,827,Pritam Singh,"More significantly, the Minister then went on to say, and I quote, ""The public has a big part in this to shape proposals and to give the eventual safeguards their stronger support. It is the only way we can effectively deter bad foreign actors from exploiting our vulnerabilities."""
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00828,2021-10-04-T-021,828,Pritam Singh,"Let me say that again. ""The public has a big part in this to shape proposals and to give the eventual safeguards their stronger support."""
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00829,2021-10-04-T-021,829,Pritam Singh,"In the six months between Minister Josephine Teo's statement and the First Reading of this Bill, the Government did not hold any public consultation on this Bill and nor can it be said that the public played a big part in shaping this Bill."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00830,2021-10-04-T-021,830,Pritam Singh,"This omission contradicts the position on record of the Second Minister for Home Affairs, which was to lean on the public to shape the Bill, which must surely include its safeguards."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00831,2021-10-04-T-021,831,Pritam Singh,"In March this year, in his Adjournment Motion on Judicial Review and ousted clauses like clause 104 of this Bill, the hon Member for Bukit Batok and Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) Chair for Home Affairs and Law, Mr Murali Pillai stated that it was important for each generation of political leaders and the people to find their own equilibrium of what our people would accept without question."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00832,2021-10-04-T-021,832,Pritam Singh,This is a position I accept and welcome.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00833,2021-10-04-T-021,833,Pritam Singh,"The hon Member then quoted his party Secretary-General's speech at the 36th PAP Party Conference held in November last year, when Prime Minister Lee said that Singaporeans have expressed the desire to have greater checks and balances, and that the PAP Government must change and respond to these desires and expectations."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00834,2021-10-04-T-021,834,Pritam Singh,"Taking the words of the Minister and the GPC Chair together, it is wholly incongruous for the Government to accept that the public of today desires greater checks and balances, then omits to seek public feedback on a Bill that does away with substantive judicial review."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00835,2021-10-04-T-021,835,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, I believe I would not be too far off in speculating that if the public had been surveyed on this Bill, most Singaporeans would have readily supported the use of executive power to curb foreign influence."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00836,2021-10-04-T-021,836,Pritam Singh,"However, I am also sure that if asked, most Singaporeans would be in favour of our Courts acting as a check to ensure that executive power is exercised lawfully, appropriately and fairly."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00837,2021-10-04-T-021,837,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, in the national language."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00838,2021-10-04-T-021,838,Pritam Singh,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Speaker, there has been some disquiet among certain quarters about the speed at which this Bill has been tabled in Parliament. In March this year, during the Committee of Supply (COS) debates, Deputy Speaker Christopher De Souza asked MHA about the measures that will be taken to prevent foreign interference in domestic affairs."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00839,2021-10-04-T-021,839,Pritam Singh,"The Second Minister for Home Affairs replied by highlighting the need for legislative levers. She said, ""Given the recent experiences of other countries, we need to consider further measures to guard against foreign subversion of politically significant individuals and entities. For example, what levels of transparency in funding, support and leadership are appropriate? For whom?"""
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00840,2021-10-04-T-021,840,Pritam Singh,"More importantly, she also said, ""The public has a big part in this to shape proposals and to give the eventual safeguards their strongest support. It is the only way we can effectively deter bad foreign actors from exploiting our vulnerabilities."""
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00841,2021-10-04-T-021,841,Pritam Singh,"In the period of six months from Mrs Josephine Teo's statement at this year’s Committee of Supply (COS), to the first reading of this Bill last month, the Government has not conducted any public consultation about this Bill, or obtained public feedback as it is usually done. This is very different from the statement made by the Second Minister for Home Affairs in Parliament, which intended to take heed of the views of the general public when drafting this Bill and its assurances."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00842,2021-10-04-T-021,842,Pritam Singh,"In the same month, March this year, the Member for Bukit Batok, Mr Murali Pillai quoted a speech by the Secretary-General at the 36th PAP Party Conference. Referring to the Prime Minister’s speech, he said that Singaporeans have expressed a desire to re-examine our basic assumptions, try new approaches and have greater checks and balances. This was preceded by the Honorable Member’s statement that it is important for each generation of leaders and people to find their own equilibrium of what people would accept without question, under what circumstances and towards what ends. This is a position that I accept."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00843,2021-10-04-T-021,843,Pritam Singh,"Looking at this as a statement by a Minister and a PAP member, it can be said to be highly contradictory if the Government acknowledges the desire of the people for more checks and balances but avoids public consultations on a Bill that will surely limit the civil rights of the Singaporeans, if it is passed by this Chamber and misused by the Government of the day."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00844,2021-10-04-T-021,844,Pritam Singh,"(In English)  Mr Speaker, the fourth part of my speech is on how the Government has been comparatively muted on the non-legislative measures to deal with foreign interference. Such measures should include educating the public to resist malignant information efforts and how to be vigilant against such interference that is commonly effected through business clans and cultural conduits, where the prospects of plausible deniability are high."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00845,2021-10-04-T-021,845,Pritam Singh,"Sir, this Bill is the final instalment in the series of legislative changes that arose out of the work of the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods. It was to be expected from the Committee's report that legislation would be used to address the problems identified. What is more difficult to grasp is the comparative lack of public knowledge on the non-legislative levers to address foreign interference."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00846,2021-10-04-T-021,846,Pritam Singh,"The Select Committee went through these non-legislative measures in a significant way. There have been a number of recommendations but the Government's response appears to have been focused on POFMA and now, FICA."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00847,2021-10-04-T-021,847,Pritam Singh,The S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) published a policy report in April this year on countermeasures against foreign influence. This has been circulated to Members by Parliament Library staff.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00848,2021-10-04-T-021,848,Pritam Singh,"The report said that to combat foreign interference, it is critical to build resilience, or in our Total Defence parlance, psychological defence – by raising awareness about information manipulation in both the Government as well as amongst the public."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00849,2021-10-04-T-021,849,Pritam Singh,"The paper noted that foreign campaigns to sway public opinion during the 2017 presidential campaign in France were unsuccessful. This was because the French government created awareness about information manipulation, built strong central organisations to counter this information and undertook a strategy to push counter narratives that blunted the effects of this information, such as focusing public attention on the perpetrators."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00850,2021-10-04-T-021,850,Pritam Singh,"Coming back to the Singapore Government's approach, the examples raised about foreign interference focused largely on long past attempts such as the Singapore Herald and Eastern Sun episodes and the Hendrickson affair."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00851,2021-10-04-T-021,851,Pritam Singh,"In a Straits Times article on 25 September, there were references to the impounding of SAF Terrex vehicles in Hong Kong and to reports of China's soft power efforts in Singapore through clan and business associations. This begs the question  how will this Bill, in particular, if enacted, address such examples of alleged foreign interference?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00852,2021-10-04-T-021,852,Pritam Singh,"The Straits Times, our newspaper, of record, does not make this very clear. What must Singaporeans do to heighten our sensitivity to such interference? And how is this Government ensuring that the message flows to the masses and new generations of Singaporeans, including new citizens, given that Singapore's destiny as an immigrant nation is almost certain?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00853,2021-10-04-T-021,853,Pritam Singh,"At best, the messaging is a bit unclear."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00854,2021-10-04-T-021,854,Pritam Singh,"In her Committee of Supply speech, Minister Josephine Teo spoke of a curious spike in 2018 and 2019 of online comments critical of Singapore, many from anonymous accounts, when there was a bilateral spat with Malaysia."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00855,2021-10-04-T-021,855,Pritam Singh,This spike in online chatter sought to give the artificial impression that there was significant and fundamental objections to Singapore's position. This episode was also covered in the 25 September Straits Times story.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00856,2021-10-04-T-021,856,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, this was a highly opportune moment to share the nature of the threat and to engage in a conversation with the public on foreign interference. But beyond these scanty details, no further clarity and communication on foreign interference have followed."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00857,2021-10-04-T-021,857,Pritam Singh,"More fundamentally, how does the Government distinguish between a genuine groundswell of sentiment and a dedicated hostile information campaign?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00858,2021-10-04-T-021,858,Pritam Singh,"I note that the MHA press release of the first reading of the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill dated 13 September 2021 anonymised this example, although it was clear that the MHA press release was referring to the same episode highlighted by Minister Josephine Teo in her parliamentary speech."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00859,2021-10-04-T-021,859,Pritam Singh,"Sir, the Government has placed such a high priority on combating foreign interference to the extent of introducing a Bill which in some important ways has no substantive judicial safeguards. But what does it say about the Government when it takes an arguably unclear approach to non-legislative responses?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00860,2021-10-04-T-021,860,Pritam Singh,"Surely, non-legislative responses that promote a more participatory and educated citizenry would inoculate the population in a whole-of-society way far better against foreign interference."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00861,2021-10-04-T-021,861,Pritam Singh,"This is an area I believe the Government needs to look into in a deliberate fashion across all levels of society. It is my argument that the Government needs to work with the public in a far more participative way so as to strengthen the resolve of the population against foreign interference. This apparent lack of integration of legislative and non-legislative measures to address foreign interference, in my view, is a critical omission in our public discourse of this subject."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00862,2021-10-04-T-021,862,Pritam Singh,"The conclusion of the RSIS paper is prescient insofar as the discussions we have undertaken today and, more importantly, the public response to this Bill."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00863,2021-10-04-T-021,863,Pritam Singh,"I quote the RSIS paper, ""The manner of application of these countermeasures must be fair and necessary both in terms of process and perception without perpetuating the image of an Orwellian state. Singapore must not appear to be taking sides in geopolitical rivalries or using foreign interference as a pretext to clamp down on local political discourse and responsible activism. Ultimately, Singapore's survival depends on both its foreign policy principle of neutrality and reputation of openness to global trade, talent, investment and ideas."""
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00864,2021-10-04-T-021,864,Pritam Singh,"As things stand, particularly on the grounds of perception and fairness, this Bill falls short. That is why the four Workers' Party Members of Parliament have filed amendments to this Bill."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00865,2021-10-04-T-021,865,Pritam Singh,"Mr Speaker, let me conclude. Public feedback should have been sought on this Bill. The Government failed to do so and does not appear minded to postpone this debate."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00866,2021-10-04-T-021,866,Pritam Singh,"There is an opportunity to commit the Bill to a Select Committee for public input and to review oversight mechanisms, amongst others. The Government should not close the door to this."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00867,2021-10-04-T-021,867,Pritam Singh,What is more perplexing is that we know that the Government had been mulling the introduction of this Bill for many months. Why was it so difficult to undertake a period of public consultation before it was tabled for First Reading?
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00868,2021-10-04-T-021,868,Pritam Singh,"The Government must also take immediate steps to implement non-legislative measures to tackle foreign interference, such as education and engagement of the public. Hopefully, the Government will introduce such measures with the same alacrity with which it introduced this Bill."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00869,2021-10-04-T-021,869,Pritam Singh,"Finally, the most critical issue today is the high level of executive power introduced by this Bill, which demands that there must be strong oversight mechanisms, namely, our Courts."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00870,2021-10-04-T-021,870,Pritam Singh,"I call on the Members of this House to seriously consider the proposed amendments and ask yourself whether you would want these amendments in place if the PAP was not in power. The amendments are in the best interest of Singapore and Singaporeans, regardless of who is in charge now or in the future. Say ""Aye"" to all the 44 amendments proposed by the Workers' Party."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00871,2021-10-04-T-021,871,Speaker,Mr Louis Ng.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00872,2021-10-04-T-021,872,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, foreign influence is the norm in Singapore. Whether you are reading the news, watching a TV show or doing your job, there is no escaping the influence of foreign ideas, foreign innovations and foreign interests."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00873,2021-10-04-T-021,873,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,This is the reality we as a cosmopolitan and small nation have no choice but to embrace.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00874,2021-10-04-T-021,874,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Today's Bill aims to push against this tide. It gives the Government new powers, first, to deem individuals and groups as politically significant and, second, to monitor and restrict these people's activities. The goal is to reduce foreign disruption of our domestic politics."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00875,2021-10-04-T-021,875,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"I agree that we should be concerned about such disruptions and I believe most people are. But at the same time, it is essential to be fair and transparent in how we restrict the activities of fellow Singaporeans. Designing and imposing restrictions the wrong way can itself worsen the trust and stability of our domestic politics."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00876,2021-10-04-T-021,876,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"With the goal of ensuring fairness and transparency, Sir, I have four points of clarification to make."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00877,2021-10-04-T-021,877,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,My first point is on the consultation process for this Bill. Some residents have shared their concerns with me on this and it would be good for the Minister to clarify some of their doubts.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00878,2021-10-04-T-021,878,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Can Minister share the consultation process for this Bill and whether it has integrated productive feedback from the consultation into this proposed law? Can the Minister also share how does the Ministry decide how much public consultation to hold for any proposed legislation?
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00879,2021-10-04-T-021,879,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, there were also some concerns about the interval between the First and Second Readings of the Bill. Some felt that the interval was too short and again, it will be good for the Minister to provide some clarifications on this as well."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00880,2021-10-04-T-021,880,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"My second point is on what it means to act with covertness, deception or concealment. This Act makes it an offence to undertake clandestine electronic communications activity on behalf of a foreign principal. The emphasis here is on ""clandestine""."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00881,2021-10-04-T-021,881,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Subsection 1(d) of section 17 requires that the person's action is ""covert or involves deception"". Similarly, subsection 1(d) of section 18 requires that the person's action ""conceals from or fails to disclose"" their relationship with a foreign principal. Can Minister shed light on how an organisation can avoid being considered as having been covert, deceptive or otherwise opaque? If they receive a grant from a foreign principal, would it suffice to state on their website with the dollar amount received, the name of the grant-maker and the terms of the grant?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00882,2021-10-04-T-021,882,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Would they need to print this material on all marketing material? Would it need to be in their Facebook posts and their Twitter profile?
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00883,2021-10-04-T-021,883,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,We should expect transparency and honesty. But this expectation is only fair if we make clear what reasonable compliance looks like. Will MHA release guidelines and illustrations that can help facilitate compliance by good faith actors?
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00884,2021-10-04-T-021,884,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,My third point is on the appeals process in this Bill. Section 48 allows individuals the opportunity to be heard before being designated as a politically significant individual. The exception is when the competent authority considers it not practicable or desirable to do so.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00885,2021-10-04-T-021,885,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Can Minister elaborate on when it would not be practicable or desirable for individuals to have the opportunity to be heard? It seems odd that an individual might be denied even the chance to present their side of the story.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00886,2021-10-04-T-021,886,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"In addition, will the individual receive written reasons to explain decisions made by the Ministry and by the Competent Authority?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00887,2021-10-04-T-021,887,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"There are three scenarios where written reasons should be provided  one, when the Ministry designates an individual as politically significant; two, when the competent authority decides that it is not practicable or desirable to hear an individual before they get designated as politically significant; and three, when the Minister determines an appeal under section 101."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00888,2021-10-04-T-021,888,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Providing written reasons to the politically designated person in all three scenarios would make clear that our process is transparent and fair.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00889,2021-10-04-T-021,889,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,My fourth and final point is on Reviewing Tribunals. Can Minister share more about the considerations that the Cabinet should take into account when recommending the appointment of members of the Reviewing Tribunal? What is the profile of members envisioned for appointment of the Reviewing Tribunal?
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00890,2021-10-04-T-021,890,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"This is important to clarify, as members of the Reviewing Tribunal may themselves be politically significant or otherwise at a heightened risk of hostile foreign influence."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00891,2021-10-04-T-021,891,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"In addition, section 99 allows the Minister to prescribe the practices and procedures for proceedings and appeals before a Reviewing Tribunal. Can Minister share if these practices and procedures will be derived from the Rules of Court, practices and procedures for Court proceedings? Will these practices and procedures follow the same principles for a fair hearing in the Rules of Court, practices, and procedures for Court proceedings? And finally, when the Reviewing Tribunal determines an appeal under Section 97, will the Reviewing Tribunal provide written reasons for their decisions?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00892,2021-10-04-T-021,892,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Sir, in conclusion I do stand in support of the Bill. I believe there is a strong need to tackle foreign disruptions of our domestic politics but, at the time, there needs to be safeguards in place and it is essential that we are fair and transparent in how we restrict the activities of fellow Singaporeans."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00893,2021-10-04-T-021,893,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) is strongly against foreign interference in our country's affairs. But the PSP cannot support the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act which I shall refer to as FICA, in its current form because of the insufficient evaluation by both parliamentarians and members of the public of its far-reaching implications. So, PSP calls upon the Government to delay the passing of the Bill, hold public consultations and appoint a Select Committee to scrutinise the Bill closely."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00894,2021-10-04-T-021,894,Leong Mun Wai,The Minister has just got through two hours in this Chamber on the possible amendments. These are exactly what should have been done in Select Committee. Is it realistic or fair to expect parliamentarians to understand the pros and cons of the amendments in just a few hours of debate?
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00895,2021-10-04-T-021,895,Leong Mun Wai,"So, our recommendation is based on three considerations."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00896,2021-10-04-T-021,896,Leong Mun Wai,"One, for such an important Bill, it should not be rushed through Parliament, disregarding proper legislative processes and the feelings of Singaporeans suffering under a worsening COVID-19 crisis."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00897,2021-10-04-T-021,897,Leong Mun Wai,"Two, countering foreign interference is an ongoing task and sufficient resources have already been deployed to it. Do we need to restrict our citizens' freedom further to achieve better outcomes?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00898,2021-10-04-T-021,898,Leong Mun Wai,"Three, is it wise to pass a legislation giving extensive power to a Minister without any judicial oversight? The possibility of abuse cannot be ruled out."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00899,2021-10-04-T-021,899,Leong Mun Wai,"FICA is a complex Bill with 127 sections over 249 pages and the content difficult to make sense of, even for senior lawyers. In spite of that, the Bill was only tabled at the last Parliamentary sitting on 13 September, barely three weeks ago and we are already rushing through its passage today. Many Members of this House are probably not adequately prepared for a thorough debate today."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00900,2021-10-04-T-021,900,Leong Mun Wai,It is difficult to understand why the Government is trying to rush the passage of this Bill or why the debate on this Bill cannot be postponed by three to six months to allow for proper scrutiny and consultation involving a wide range of stakeholders.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00901,2021-10-04-T-021,901,Leong Mun Wai,"Just earlier this year, the Government established a two-month long public consultation process for the Copyright Bill. The POFMA Bill also went through a long consultation, lasting more than a year and, in addition, through a Select Committee before it was passed into law."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00902,2021-10-04-T-021,902,Leong Mun Wai,"So, where is the Select Committee for FICA which arguably should be held to even greater scrutiny in light of the removal of judicial supervision of the Government's usage of FICA's powers and our citizens' constitutional rights?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00903,2021-10-04-T-021,903,Leong Mun Wai,"We should also delay the reading of this Bill because we should be now focusing our resources and attention on the worsening COVID-19 situation in our country. The number of infections has shot up exponentially and there are more and more distressed situations amongst many of us Singaporeans. This is a time when Members of Parliament should be busy helping constituents get through the many challenges in their lives due to the current COVID-19 crisis, instead of being distracted to mull through and digest this draconian Bill."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00904,2021-10-04-T-021,904,Leong Mun Wai,"On the other hand, the Government is not new to dealing with foreign interference for which it has been well-equipped to deal with after many years of experience."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00905,2021-10-04-T-021,905,Leong Mun Wai,"PSP recognises that foreign interference had existed in the past and will continue to exist. But countering foreign interference is an ongoing task and this Government already has substantial resources to deal with it. As I said, do we need to restrict our citizens' freedom further to achieve better outcomes?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00906,2021-10-04-T-021,906,Leong Mun Wai,"We deploy substantial resources to national security every year. For FY2021, we are spending $15 billion on defence; $6.5 billion on home affairs and $0.5 billion on foreign affairs, all for the purpose of upholding and protecting our sovereignty. This makes a total of $22 billion accounting for more than a quarter of our operating budget."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00907,2021-10-04-T-021,907,Leong Mun Wai,There are also tough laws in place to deal with internal security and public issues.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00908,2021-10-04-T-021,908,Leong Mun Wai,"To start with, we have the Internal Security Act (ISA) which was passed in 1960 when we were still part of Malaysia. The Court of Appeal's ruling that the ISA was subjected to judicial review was already overruled in a legislative amendment in 1988, giving the Government wide powers in administering the ISA. Incidentally, Malaysia had repealed its ISA in 2012 while our ISA is still in force."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00909,2021-10-04-T-021,909,Leong Mun Wai,"Then, we have the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act (NPPA) since 1975, which is designed to ensure there is no foreign control on Singaporean newspapers and limits the circulation of foreign printed media. There is also the Broadcasting Act 1994 which requires online sites discussing Singapore's political issues to register for a licence with conditions covering foreign funding and interference."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00910,2021-10-04-T-021,910,Leong Mun Wai,"The NPPA and Broadcasting Act allowed the Government to have almost monopoly control over the narrative on major policies and issues through the mainstream media. That was until the rise of social media, as a strong alternative platform from around 2010. As a result, the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) came into being in 2019 to allow the Government to tackle the spread of fake news and false information online."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00911,2021-10-04-T-021,911,Leong Mun Wai,"Between the ISA, NPPA, Broadcasting Act and POFMA, this Government already has extensive powers to deal with any internal security threat, manage public opinion and prevent the spread of false information online. So, is there a need to give this Government further powers to deal with foreign interference at the expense of our citizens' constitutional rights?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00912,2021-10-04-T-021,912,Leong Mun Wai,"As there is no urgency but ample reasons why we should delay the Bill, we should then make best use of the opportunity to evaluate the implications of FICA properly."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00913,2021-10-04-T-021,913,Leong Mun Wai,"We understand all that has been said about combating foreign interference. But we cannot ignore the basic principles of democracy, which is not based on a benevolent ruler but on separation of powers and checks and balances. A law like FICA, which ignores those principles, ought to be considered carefully and over a long period of deliberation."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00914,2021-10-04-T-021,914,Leong Mun Wai,"Just look at some of the frightening implications on people, on an accused person under FICA. It is possible that you may inadvertently commit an offence because the definition of an offence is broad and vague. There is no need to give you a reason to arrest you, and if evidence is offered later, the Government does not need to reveal the source and detention is non-bailable. You cannot choose your own legal Counsel and can be trialed in absence. And to cap it all, there is no judicial review for all the actions that are taken against you. Thus, FICA appears even worse than the Internal Security Act."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00915,2021-10-04-T-021,915,Leong Mun Wai,"There are many more provisions and, to me, all sounded like a joke for someone living in a modern democratic society, based on the Rule of Law. FICA can be described in Singlish. This also called law? Or in more accurate English, tyranny in the name of law."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00916,2021-10-04-T-021,916,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, in Chinese, please."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00917,2021-10-04-T-021,917,Leong Mun Wai,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] My Singapore compatriots, FICA, in name, is a law to prevent foreign interfere, but actually, it is a tiger in sheep's skin and may severely infringe on our democratic and civil rights. National security is of course something that we are very concerned about, and we also support giving the Government enough resources to deal with it. For example, in Financial Year 2021, $22 billion was allocated to maintain domestic and external security, accounting for a quarter of the total budget. Through the Internal Security Act, the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act, the Broadcasting Act and the POFMA, the Government has basically controlled threats to domestic security, public opinion and the transmission of fake news online."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00918,2021-10-04-T-021,918,Leong Mun Wai,"Hence, FICA is really a law that is unnecessary. It gives the Government the power to deal with citizens who hold dissenting views. We should learn from history, such as the lessons of Militarism in Japan and Germany. Every time a government moves towards authoritarianism, it can bring about disastrous consequences for the country. The country needs checks and balances between the Government and the people in order to have lasting peace and stability."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00919,2021-10-04-T-021,919,Leong Mun Wai,"FICA is a law that can could suppress public opinion and civil rights. We must guard against it. Do not think that FICA has nothing to do with our everyday life. This is because without freedom of speech, even discussions on employment and livelihood issues could be restricted. Therefore, PSP feels that the Bill should be postponed to give the people and the Special Committee sufficient time to scrutinise it thoroughly."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00920,2021-10-04-T-021,920,Leong Mun Wai,"(In English)  Mr Speaker, the excessive controls of FICA over civil rights would not stop a determined foreign state from conducting foreign interference. While our capable security agencies and diplomatic channels are dealing with it, the best defence against foreign interference is not more laws to control our own people but to raise the awareness of our people towards national security threats. Hence, the anti-terrorist awareness campaign, SGSecure, which is aimed at all Singaporeans, is a wise move."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00921,2021-10-04-T-021,921,Leong Mun Wai,"Like what the Leader of the Opposition has commented just now, this Government should be more proactive in educating Singaporeans on what is online foreign interference, so that every citizen can be its eyes and ears. Accordingly, we should not have laws to restrict and control Singaporeans' interaction with foreigners. But we should encourage more interactions so that we know firsthand if there are developments of concern to the interest of Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00922,2021-10-04-T-021,922,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, all things said, and to reiterate, is it wise to hastily pass a legislation, giving extensive power to a Minister without judicial oversight? I, as do many Singaporeans, urge you and all Members of this House, to delay the passing of this Bill and allow for public consultations and the appointment of a Select Committee to scrutinise the Bill. You have the power to do so, Mr Speaker, under Standing Order No 68. It can be done."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00923,2021-10-04-T-021,923,Leong Mun Wai,"And how each Member votes on this Bill will represent his or her legacy to the present and future generations of Singaporeans. All Singaporeans are watching you. A yes vote means the Member is willing to sacrifice the rule of law, which is the foundation of all democratic nations. For the sake of Singapore and Singaporeans, Mr Speaker, I urge you again to exercise your power, under Standing Order No 68 to refer the Bill to a Select Committee."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00924,2021-10-04-T-021,924,Leong Mun Wai,"Sir, I oppose the Bill. Singaporeans deserve better. And I just received a message from a Singaporean through my handphone which says, ""I want freedom of information. I don't want FICA."""
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00925,2021-10-04-T-021,925,Speaker,Ms He Ting Ru.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00926,2021-10-04-T-021,926,He Ting Ru,"Mr Speaker, we have today, before us, a mere 21 days after its First Reading, a 249-page wide ranging Bill which grants sweeping powers to the Minister and Competent Authorities to counteract foreign influence in our polices and direction. As my Workers' Party colleagues will point out, we believe in giving relevant authorities clearly defined and effective tools to counter actual acts of foreign interference. Our objections, however, are raised in both the drafting of wide ranging powers, the problems with oversight mechanisms and also the way the Bill has been presented."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00927,2021-10-04-T-021,927,He Ting Ru,"Outside this Chamber, Singaporeans are just starting a second week of yet another set of tightened COVID-19 rules while navigating a system of confusing quarantine and testing programmes and regulations, scrambling to adapt to more home-based working and learning. Our healthcare workers are strained and we have resorted to activating the SAF to assist the system that was overwhelmed only one month after we further loosened restrictions."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00928,2021-10-04-T-021,928,He Ting Ru,"Most of us are also receiving numerous requests for assistance from residents in dealing with the confusion of Quarantine Orders, the new Home Recovery Programme and also with pressing economic hardship suffered because of the latest round of tightened restrictions."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00929,2021-10-04-T-021,929,He Ting Ru,"And in the midst of many Singaporeans being preoccupied with such pressing concerns, this Bill has been tabled and put up for Second Reading within three weeks with no public consultations nor Select Committees convened for the purposes of scrutinising the powers that it gives the Minister. This is in stark contrast to POFMA, where a cross-party Select Committee convened public hearings over eight days, which saw 79 individuals and organisations testify. I also note that the Bill is 168 pages longer than the POFMA Bill and contains on the face of it, even broader powers which should logically mean that more scrutiny must be given before it is passed."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00930,2021-10-04-T-021,930,He Ting Ru,"I would therefore, like to seek clarification from the Minister about why the pressing need to forge ahead on this Bill now."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00931,2021-10-04-T-021,931,He Ting Ru,"While I reiterate that the Workers' Party agrees that appropriate measures need to be put in place to counter the threat of foreign interference, we would like to understand what is the real and imminent threat that Singapore faces that warrants such a rush in passing the Bill. How many instances of suspected foreign interference have there been in each of the last 10 years? And more crucially, why are the specific powers and tools contained under the Bill so urgently required by the Minister and various Competent Authorities that would mean the Bill needs to be rushed ahead and passed into law without further delay at this particular juncture?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00932,2021-10-04-T-021,932,He Ting Ru,"I also want to stress that this Bill is not an obscure one that once passed, will have minimal impact on the lives of Singaporeans. Already, we have seen numerous voices from a Senior Counsel, various NGOs, Singaporean academics, including a senior research fellow at IPS, speaking up to voice their grave concerns not only at the speed at which the Bill is to be passed, but also about the substantive provisions contained in the Bill. There is a fear from many that in the rush to pass the Bill to counter foreign interference, we may be throwing the baby out with the bath water and end up catching many legitimate and innocent people, entities and projects in the dragnet. A fear that has been repeated by numerous voices including those of, in particular, my colleagues Jamus Lim's and Gerald Giam's amendments."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00933,2021-10-04-T-021,933,He Ting Ru,"The impact of the Bill is not reserved just for the few who are active in politics. The way it has been drafted and passed has the potential to adversely affect ordinary Singaporeans in ways that may not be initially obvious. It is like a trojan horse that appears benign at first, but unravels upon passage in two main ways."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00934,2021-10-04-T-021,934,He Ting Ru,"Firstly, any uncertainty will create a chilling effect on political discussion and engagement. As a specific example, the wide discretion allowed by the drafting of the Bill to designate who is a Politically Significant Person (PSP) runs the risk of encouraging many to step away from conversation in the public space to avoid the onerous countermeasures that come with being a designated PSP. This means local content creators, local activists, local academics, their retraction from our public spaces will mean that we will be worse off, and this will dampen the richness of thinking and dialogue on issues that matter to all Singaporeans. It will also be damaging to our standing connection to the global commons, which has recently already been called into question with concerns raised over the closure of Yale-NUS College."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00935,2021-10-04-T-021,935,He Ting Ru,"Secondly, many have echoed our fears that this Bill represents power given to the Government which is not subject to the oversight of the Courts. It provides the Minister wide ranging powers that are largely unfettered with the only exception being a reviewing Tribunal that has a narrow scope. Could this be a slippery slope that would lead to less checks on how these powers are wielded? And ultimately, in the hands of possible future rogue Ministers and officials, damage Singapore's reputation of an open, global business hub where enforcement and application is predictable and certain?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00936,2021-10-04-T-021,936,He Ting Ru,"Together with the hasty passage of significant Bills such as this with limited or rushed debate, these would risk chilling investment and job opportunities in the process. I must also sound a note of caution. We must ensure that we do not end up being so shrill and fearful of the threat of foreign interference that we end up neglecting an even more insidious threat, one where domestic players could seize an easy opportunity to whip up nationalism and anti-foreign sentiment to further their own political goals, nefarious or otherwise, in the flimsy name of protecting national interest and sovereignty."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00937,2021-10-04-T-021,937,He Ting Ru,"We have seen this happening since 2016 in movements and campaigns like Brexit, Pegida and Make America Great Again. There has been a rise of far right governments from Brazil to central eastern Europe, formerly fringe parties such as the Front National and the Alternative für Deutschland, have acquired national platforms. All of them have built their success on twisted versions of patriotism and national identity and sovereignty. If similar homegrown ideas and movements are allowed to take root here, whether from the Ruling government of the day, Opposition parties or otherwise, the damage done to a small society like ours could be catastrophic."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00938,2021-10-04-T-021,938,He Ting Ru,"Moving on to the proposed amendments by the Workers' Party, I will speak on those standing my name, which are amendments to clauses 92 to 104, which fall under Part 8, Oversight Arrangements. These relate to two main points."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00939,2021-10-04-T-021,939,He Ting Ru,"First, the rights of appeal, and second, the judicial review of the clause."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00940,2021-10-04-T-021,940,He Ting Ru,"I turn first to clauses 92 and 93 which deal with the rights of appeal against decisions made by under the Act by both the Minister and the Competent Authorities. This section is important as it prescribes the methods and processes in place to protect citizens against an abuse of power by the government of the day. Clause 92 provides for the setting up of a reviewing Tribunal which comprises three individuals who each have to be Singaporeans and will serve a term of three years. The government appoints these individuals and the chair of the Tribunal has to be a Supreme Court Judge. There are no other specific requirements in the Bill relating to the remaining two members of the Tribunal. The renumeration and expenses of the Tribunal are paid for under money provided by Parliament, but the rules for tribunal proceedings are, under clause 99, made by the Minister and are only presented to Parliament after being gazetted."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00941,2021-10-04-T-021,941,He Ting Ru,"The Tribunal can hear appeals on too narrowly and clearly defined circumstances for a person issued with a Part 3 direction, that is a direction to counteract harmful foreign online communications activity of the proprietors of a Proscribed Online Location, which are locations that are declared by the Minister to be purveyors of hostile information content. It is notable that the drafting of this section shows that the draftsperson is able to very narrowly and precisely define parameters when it is desirable to do so."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00942,2021-10-04-T-021,942,He Ting Ru,"Additionally, all appellants must have first requested the Minister to reconsider the earlier decision before they can be taken to the Tribunal. In particular, it is not clear how, or even whether the Tribunal will be able to consider appeals on the substance of the exercise and the Minister's powers to issue Part 3 directions, given that there is no obligation in the Act for the Minister to explain how he exercises his powers of considering Part 3 directions issued by the Competent Authority under the Act."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00943,2021-10-04-T-021,943,He Ting Ru,"Also, I note that the Tribunal is only empowered to either dismiss the appeal or revoke the decision. It is not within the Tribunal's power to make any amendments. Finally, the decision of the reviewing Tribunal is final and there are no further rights of appeal."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00944,2021-10-04-T-021,944,He Ting Ru,"Individuals designated a Politically Significant Person on the Part 4 or issued directives under Part 5 or 6 around countermeasures for foreign donors and activities that are not donor activities, but may involve a foreign principal in Part 6 have no route of appeals through the Tribunal. Their only route is through the Minister himself and Minister's decision is final."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00945,2021-10-04-T-021,945,He Ting Ru,I	also	note	that	our	proposed	deletion	of clause 119(2) is a consequential amendment of having deleted the provisions relating to the Reviewing Tribunal.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00946,2021-10-04-T-021,946,He Ting Ru,"The Workers’ Party’s position to the approach taken above is that oversight mechanisms proposed are insufficient to ensure the Act is not abused. First, the Minister is in almost all cases the final decision-maker. Only a limited and very narrowly defined subset of cases are subject to appeal to the Reviewing Tribunal. Second, even the small number of cases which are eligible to appeal to the Reviewing Tribunal, are subject to further restrictions, including the provision under clause 99(b) which states that the Minister may prescribe Tribunal Rules that enables a Reviewing Tribunal to decline to give the appellant the full particulars of the reasons for why a decision was made. This would mean that he would effectively be asked to make his appeal partially blindfolded."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00947,2021-10-04-T-021,947,He Ting Ru,"In view of this, we propose that in line with the doctrine of the separation of powers, the judiciary is the appropriate organ of state to exercise oversight over the broad powers granted under this Bill. This proposal means that any person who is subjected to a determination order or decision under the Bill has a right of appeal to the judiciary, that is, to the High Court."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00948,2021-10-04-T-021,948,He Ting Ru,"The Reviewing Tribunal is clearly not an effective substitute for the Courts. Firstly, the composition of the Tribunal is decided by the Government and only one of them is a Supreme Court Judge who is qualified and experienced in scrutinising and determining such appeals."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00949,2021-10-04-T-021,949,He Ting Ru,"This is also problematic as the Tribunal effectively is appointed by the Cabinet, in what is effectively a check, by the executive, on an executive decision. This is a classic case of, in the words of the Leader of the Opposition, “Ownself Check Ownself”. The Tribunal is also, unlike the Courts, not part of the Judiciary established under our Constitution, whose independence is also enshrined in our Constitution."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00950,2021-10-04-T-021,950,He Ting Ru,"Under our Constitution, judicial power is vested in the Courts. Carving out matters that should be properly determined by the Courts for review by a Tribunal that cannot be held to account is deeply problematic."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00951,2021-10-04-T-021,951,He Ting Ru,"Additionally, decisions of both the Reviewing Tribunal and the Minister are not subject to correction by any higher authority, especially as the proposed clause 104 purports to oust judicial review on all but procedural grounds. There is also no mention of either the Tribunal or Minister being guided or bound by precedents of previous decisions which are often instructive and valuable."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00952,2021-10-04-T-021,952,He Ting Ru,"To address concerns that judicial trials may compromise national security because of the sensitive nature of a matter, our proposed amendment also allows for such hearings to be held in-camera, without the public being allowed to attend, if the Court is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00953,2021-10-04-T-021,953,He Ting Ru,"Next, I turn to the proposed clause 104, which is what is known as a judicial review ouster clause. The substance of this clause is that the Government seeks to protect the Minister’s decisions under FICA from review by the Courts. This offends Article 93 of the Constitution, which expressly states that “judicial power of Singapore shall be vested in a Supreme Court and in such subordinate courts as may be provided by any written law for the time being in force”."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00954,2021-10-04-T-021,954,He Ting Ru,The ouster clause is a breach of the principle of the separation of powers  the Government should not be using its legislative authority to oust the rightful constitutional oversight of a co-equal institution in the Singapore system.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00955,2021-10-04-T-021,955,He Ting Ru,"It means that no decision under FICA should be challenged through the process of judicial review, apart on the very narrow grounds of purely procedural compliance with the Act not being properly followed."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00956,2021-10-04-T-021,956,He Ting Ru,Many of our leading jurists have also expressed their discomfort with ouster clauses. The Court of Appeal has expressed concern in Per Ah Seng that ouster clauses “can be regarded as being incompatible with the rule of law because it should be within the Court’s purview to declare the legal limits of discretionary powers”.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00957,2021-10-04-T-021,957,He Ting Ru,"Our former Chief Justice Mr Chan Sek Keong too has suggested that ouster clauses, quote “may be inconsistent with Article 93 of the Constitution, which vests the judicial power of Singapore in the Supreme Court”, unquote."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00958,2021-10-04-T-021,958,He Ting Ru,"Crucially for our purposes today, the ouster clause does not allow for the courts to consider applications for judicial review of decisions taken by the Minister and Competent Authorities on the grounds of illegality and irrationality."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00959,2021-10-04-T-021,959,He Ting Ru,"The latter two limbs of judicial review are key in ensuring that, as captured in Chng Suan Tze v Minister for Home Affairs, quote “All power has legal limits and the rule of law demands that the Courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power”, unquote. And we must, as legislators, have the rule of law in mind as we consider the balance of, amongst others, natural justice, national security, and the separation of powers as we decide whether or not a judicial review ouster clause should stand."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00960,2021-10-04-T-021,960,He Ting Ru,"For illegality, this arises when a decision-maker exercises a power wrongly, or improperly purports to exercise a power that it does not have. The Courts, in their role to check and balance powers granted to bodies, ensure that nobody overreaches and goes beyond the powers given to them. For irrationality, it allows a party to challenge a decision by a public official or body if “it is so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could ever have come to it”."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00961,2021-10-04-T-021,961,He Ting Ru,"Disallowing judicial reviews on the grounds of illegality and irrationality takes away an important check on the powers granted to the Government. Imagine if one day, the Competent Authority designates a six-month-old baby a PSP under Part 4. This decision is final and cannot be set aside if the Minister upholds this upon appeal. It will not be allowed to be set aside on the grounds of irrationality since judicial review on these grounds are not possible! While this situation may be dismissed as outlandish and would never happen, it is theoretically possible under the provisions of the Bill. Stranger things have happened."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00962,2021-10-04-T-021,962,He Ting Ru,"While we might say that we have confidence in current policy-makers, intentions and policies. Yet, no one can guarantee the conduct of future Ministers and competent authorities and their commitment to acting rationally and legally. In fact, were we not told that the logic for the constitutional amendments surrounding the establishment of the Elected Presidency and, in 2016, changes in the remit of the Council of Presidential Advisers, have to do with putting in safeguards in place against the possibility	of	irrational	or	unreasonable	behaviour	by	top decision-makers? Why do these safeguards not apply here, especially as we are granting wide-ranging powers to the Minister?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00963,2021-10-04-T-021,963,He Ting Ru,I wish to also point out that judicial review does not review the merits of cases. It instead is a process by which the Courts exercise supervision over decisions made by Ministers and other public officials and bodies to ensure that legal limits are enforced where public power is exercised. It is an important part of the checks and balances to ensure that powers are wielded judiciously by the state.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00964,2021-10-04-T-021,964,He Ting Ru,We cannot repeat enough our position that greater powers need greater oversight and it is therefore with this in mind that our proposed amendments do away with the ouster of judicial review.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00965,2021-10-04-T-021,965,He Ting Ru,"In other words, we believe that the “sunlight of scrutiny”, to use the phrase of our esteemed colleague Mr Murali Pillai, is more crucial than ever in needing to be applied to this Bill and the broad and alarming powers it purports to introduce. This sunlight is what helps both shine a light on malicious foreign activity, and at the same time, assures all of us that we do not need to worry about the over-expansive use of Government powers."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00966,2021-10-04-T-021,966,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Mr Speaker, the proposed Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act (FICA) is an important Bill that could potentially better equip our nation to face up to the evolving nature of external threats in the 21st century. In particular, the Bill seeks to better protect Singapore from the risks of foreign principal interference in our domestic affairs. This principle of non-interference per se is unobjectionable, and the Workers' Party stands behind the notion that domestic political matters should indeed be determined by our own people."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00967,2021-10-04-T-021,967,Jamus Jerome Lim,"But the proposed language in a number of areas spelled out by the Bill are troubling. In this speech, I will provide justifications for the amendments that the Workers' Party has proposed in my name. These pertain to clauses that leave the scope of foreign interference troublingly vague and, relatedly, propose an insufficiently steep hurdle for the applicability of the law, one that we believe begins to border on the policing of thought. The common thread among these amendments is that we need to satisfy a reasonable standard of proof and intent, when we claim that an individual has acceded to the influence of foreign principals."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00968,2021-10-04-T-021,968,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Let me begin by stating a few propositions that I believe all in this House will have little difficulty agreeing with. We can all accept that there are threats out there, that have to be dealt with. We can all accept that some threats are subtle and, by design, evasive, and hence difficult to identify and prove with absolute certainty."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00969,2021-10-04-T-021,969,Jamus Jerome Lim,"And we can all accept that establishing facts, even by the strict legal standards upheld in a Court of law, will seldom be definitive. Memories may be hazy. Claims may be contradictory. Even eyewitnesses could easily differ in what they perceive – or believe to have observed – from an event. Film classics like Rashōmon and Virumaandi, and parables like the Blind Men and the Elephant, remind us that objectivity may be elusive, even in fair, carefully-litigated circumstances."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00970,2021-10-04-T-021,970,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Consequently, society – and the legal system – have allowed for a comparatively high burden of proof for claims and accusations, which (at the very least) requires a comparatively high probability of an outcome or event being true. We also have well-understood channels of appeal, to allow for the possibility of overturning rules that subsequently turn out to be false positives."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00971,2021-10-04-T-021,971,Jamus Jerome Lim,"But this does not appear to be the case in a number of clauses in this Bill, notably the amendments we have proposed to parts of clauses 17 through 18, 40, and 75. Clause 17(1)(c)(iii) of the Bill, for example, will charge an individual with an offence if he or she engages in electronic communications that involve activity that, I quote, “is or is likely to be prejudicial to the friendly relations of Singapore with other countries”."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00972,2021-10-04-T-021,972,Jamus Jerome Lim,"But what is “likely”? The dictionary definition only states that something that is likely “will probably happen or is expected”; it does not attribute any probability to this likelihood. Statistically, any outcome that has the greater probability of being realised could be anything ranging from 51% to 99%."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00973,2021-10-04-T-021,973,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Thus, establishing that a given action will amount to an offence will require an estimation of a likelihood. While courts have a long history of attributing just cause based on strong, credible evidence, this is an enormous leap of faith for any single, largely unchecked individual."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00974,2021-10-04-T-021,974,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Mr Speaker, nobody denies that foreign interference can occur, facilitated by the medium of electronic communications, that could be prejudicial to the security, public good, domestic harmony and international relations of Singapore. The desire to draft a law robust enough to capture such possibilities is a sound motivation."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00975,2021-10-04-T-021,975,Jamus Jerome Lim,"But at the same time, we cannot deny that the vast majority of such communications activity – even when framed in a manner that is potentially incriminating to its sender – could well be innocuous; the frivolous or unfiltered rantings of a troubled mind. Possibilities are insufficient, especially when they call for predictions of an uncertain future."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00976,2021-10-04-T-021,976,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Were this Bill be passed into law as it stands, we will require not just that our Ministers or relevant Competent Authorities speculate on the likely mindset and possible actions of individuals, but that such individuals themselves possess the ability to predict whether the information they communicate will affect security, public good, domestic harmony, or international relations. Experts can barely venture such forecasts successfully, much less an average person."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00977,2021-10-04-T-021,977,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Finally, it is worth adding that by further requiring, as in clause 17(1)(c) that an individual “knows or has reason to believe”, already rules out the possibility of willful ignorance; piling on the need for this selfsame individual to be speculative is excessive."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00978,2021-10-04-T-021,978,Jamus Jerome Lim,"In clauses 20 and 21 amendments were proposed to raise the level of proof required  from mere suspicion or belief, to at least some degree of evidence or actionable intelligence. This is justice on the basis of precrime, virtually straight out of the film Minority Report. It is the policing of thought."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00979,2021-10-04-T-021,979,Jamus Jerome Lim,"As much as I may be a fan of Tom Cruise, Stephen Spielberg and Philip K Dick, “suspicion” or a “reason to believe” does not rise to the level of actual crime, but represents anticipatory action. At its best, it runs the risk of abuse and misuse, short-circuiting the free will of individuals to change their minds before they act. At its worst, it rises to the level of thought policing, pinning on suspects actions that they have yet to be realised. Even conspiracy – a very indirect attribution of potential involvement in illegal activity – requires solid evidence."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00980,2021-10-04-T-021,980,Jamus Jerome Lim,"To be clear, the world can be an unpleasant place and there may well be instances where the risk of subsequent malicious activity would justify the execution of pre-emptive actions that would preclude the possibility of even more insidious outcomes."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00981,2021-10-04-T-021,981,Jamus Jerome Lim,"But the threshold for us to engage must at least be one where we possess evidence or, as we called for in the amendments to this Bill, actionable intelligence and a reasonable assessment of eminent harm. Short of this, we are relying on gut feeling and instinct to play with people's lives."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00982,2021-10-04-T-021,982,Jamus Jerome Lim,"One potential objection to this set of amendments is that the Minister or the relevant Competent Authority will always act judiciously and with care. This claims that bereft of the flexibility to act on their suspicions, we will compromise the ability of our authorities to properly protect our citizens."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00983,2021-10-04-T-021,983,Jamus Jerome Lim,But this calls for us to enshrine into law the propensity of a political office holder to always act in the public interest.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00984,2021-10-04-T-021,984,Jamus Jerome Lim,"This could well be the case today. But would it be always? What if, God forbid, an irresponsible party forms the government or someone in the government goes rogue? We are walking dangerously close to Manchurian candidate territory here – and I know I am citing a lot of movie references."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00985,2021-10-04-T-021,985,Jamus Jerome Lim,"The purpose of the law in any society guided by rule of law is to bind the hands of policymakers, regardless of their benefactions, from the most egregious exercises of arbitrary decision-making. Do these specific sub-clauses satisfy that standard or should the language of the law be rendered as clear as possible?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00986,2021-10-04-T-021,986,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that even an entirely well-meaning officeholder may carry suspicions, even firmly held ones, that could well turn out to be erroneous."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00987,2021-10-04-T-021,987,Jamus Jerome Lim,"In the press release accompanying the first reading of this Bill, MHA cited the example of ""an abnormal spike in online comments critical of Singapore on social media in late 2018 and 2019"". Yet, two executives at one major social media platform, Facebook, have publicly stated that it has uncovered no cases of coordinated, inauthentic behaviour by foreigners targeting Singapore since 2017."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00988,2021-10-04-T-021,988,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Given the apparent contradiction, would MHA share with this House why it believed that social media activity during that period was foreign influence?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00989,2021-10-04-T-021,989,Jamus Jerome Lim,"The proposed amendments to clauses 17(2) and 18(2) are meant to refine intent. While we agree that clandestine foreign interference may well involve multiple principals, expanding the applicability of the law to include instances where individuals ""need not have in mind any particular foreign country or principal"" veers uncomfortably into territory where we criminalise those who may have been deceived or misled."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00990,2021-10-04-T-021,990,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Yet, the explanatory notes of the Bill clearly express that covert activities are ""not intended to cover circumstances where a person undertakes an activity with no knowledge, awareness or direction from the foreign principal or where the relationship between the person's activities and the foreign principal's interest are merely coincidental""."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00991,2021-10-04-T-021,991,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Indeed, many disinformation campaigns operate via deception. Will we then charge those who have been unwittingly made to operate as pawns of a more sophisticated principal?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00992,2021-10-04-T-021,992,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Lest we rule out as the domain of the naive and hence, inapplicable to PSPs, it is useful to remind ourselves of how often even sophisticated experts may end up being duped. Just think of the victims of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme, the Envy Global nickel investment scam or Elizabeth Holmes' Theranos, currently playing out in US Courts. In the first half of this year, Singaporeans collectively lost a total of $168 million to con men."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00993,2021-10-04-T-021,993,Jamus Jerome Lim,"To compound matters, allowing for such possibilities would be extremely costly in terms of resources. Think of the time, energy and resource that would have to be expended to investigate and prosecute cases where it is unclear whether any specific foreign actor is even involved."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00994,2021-10-04-T-021,994,Jamus Jerome Lim,"It could also give rise to either an excessive number of frivolous accusations or, conversely, inhibit actual victims from stepping up to alert authorities if they suspect they may have been manipulated."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00995,2021-10-04-T-021,995,Jamus Jerome Lim,The Workers' Party believes that it is far better to strike the balance between efficiency and accountability by eliminating the most ambiguous language from the law while subjecting cases corroborated by actionable intelligence to judicial scrutiny.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00996,2021-10-04-T-021,996,Jamus Jerome Lim,"The coincidence of interest, another dimension highlighted as note, remains poorly excluded by the overall language of the Bill."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00997,2021-10-04-T-021,997,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Part 4 of clauses 5 and 48, where we have not proposed amendments, refer to the term ""collaboration"", which is undefined but as the notes explain takes on its ordinary meaning."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00998,2021-10-04-T-021,998,Jamus Jerome Lim,"While we understand that the purpose is to capture nefarious collaborations, perhaps inspired by the case of former Lee Kuan Yew School professor Huang Jing, such broad language raises both theoretical and practical concerns."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-00999,2021-10-04-T-021,999,Jamus Jerome Lim,"For starters, there is very little reason why the simple act of working together, the dictionary definition of ""collaboration"", with a foreign entity need give rise to subservience or, for that matter, even mild influence."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01000,2021-10-04-T-021,1000,Jamus Jerome Lim,"I am certain we all have had colleagues with whom we disliked but yet, we are forced to work together on projects and would never imagine nor wish to emulate or even learn from. Hence, there is little logical reason why one would link collaboration with influence or, more intrusively, interference."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01001,2021-10-04-T-021,1001,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Moreover, in any collaborative relationship, especially when parties carry equal standing, it is frequently impossible to attribute who actually exerts control."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01002,2021-10-04-T-021,1002,Jamus Jerome Lim,"By a similar token, it would not be unusual for working relationships dealing with public policy to venture into politically sensitive, controversial – this is the wording in the Bill – issues. Think matters such as climate change, vaccinations, free trade and gender issues, all of which are controversial and often evoke partisan leanings, regardless of whether there may have been any intent to direct such effort towards a political end."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01003,2021-10-04-T-021,1003,Jamus Jerome Lim,This could have a chilling effect on already guarded national discussions by constraining the ability of our citizens to work with foreigners on matters of national importance so long as they happen to be politically controversial.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01004,2021-10-04-T-021,1004,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Taken together, including the exceedingly vague term ""collaborations"", into the scope of activities subject to FICA, it becomes inherently problematic."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01005,2021-10-04-T-021,1005,Jamus Jerome Lim,Is it not sufficient for us to claim that casual transparent interactions do not entail collaboration but deep engagement does? How much must one actually work with another before they are deemed to have collaborated?
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01006,2021-10-04-T-021,1006,Jamus Jerome Lim,"In his response to Parliamentary Questions filed by then Nominated Members of Parliament Anthea Ong and Walter Theseira on foreign influence, Minister K Shanmugam explained that there is nothing to prevent politicians or political parties from engaging with foreign parties but you cannot take money from them."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01007,2021-10-04-T-021,1007,Jamus Jerome Lim,"To engage, however, includes the possibility of working with and, indeed, even working for somebody else. Surely, it must bother us that we are choosing to define into our laws the possibility of catching, in Minister K Shanmugam's words earlier, on a one in 1,000 chance but glossing over the far greater likelihood of throwing up many, many more false positives."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01008,2021-10-04-T-021,1008,Jamus Jerome Lim,"These theoretical observations are further compounded by the fact that in practice, Singaporeans routinely collaborate with non-Singaporeans on all manner of critical and non-critical operations."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01009,2021-10-04-T-021,1009,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Top generals conduct joint military exercises on a regular basis and we often send our best civil servants on overseas assignments where they may gather knowledge and experience from citizens of other nations. Our Political Officeholders are often called to perform global public service, serving on committees in international organisations where they collaborate with high-level officials from other countries."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01010,2021-10-04-T-021,1010,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Mr Speaker, there are additional instances where intent on the part of the alleged agent remain uneasily vague."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01011,2021-10-04-T-021,1011,Jamus Jerome Lim,"For example, clause 5(3) states that activities will be covered as long as both person and the foreign principal knew or expected that the person would or might undertake such an activity."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01012,2021-10-04-T-021,1012,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Surely, it is possible that an individual might independently choose to pursue a given course of action, bereft of external influence. Yet, this choice could still be common knowledge."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01013,2021-10-04-T-021,1013,Jamus Jerome Lim,"By a similar token, the definition of foreign principals may be excessively broad. While we do not wish to constrain the Government's ability to act on a wide range of potential actors, the existing definitions of ""foreign business"" and ""foreign political organisation"" could encapsulate perfectly innocuous ties."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01014,2021-10-04-T-021,1014,Jamus Jerome Lim,"While we understand that malicious intent is subsequently captured by clauses 5 through 7, exclusionary language, especially for these two very general categories, may be warranted – something to the effect of a sub-clause that explicitly spells out how these entities are engaged in political activities. Alternatively, examples and counter examples could be provided of businesses and political organisations that would be captured or not by said definition."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01015,2021-10-04-T-021,1015,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Mr Speaker, up till now, the proposed amendments we have flagged speak to what we as a party believe to be flaws of commission, notably, instances where we believe the Bill over reaches in its attribution of perceived risk, unwarranted suspicion and intentionality behind motivations."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01016,2021-10-04-T-021,1016,Jamus Jerome Lim,"In contrast, the amendments we have proposed for clause 120 are ones of omission, namely, the fact that the law fails to incorporate public assurances by MHA. The purpose is to ensure that these assurances are actually written into the law."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01017,2021-10-04-T-021,1017,Jamus Jerome Lim,"This is notwithstanding how clause 105(5) does provide accommodation for this by stating that competent authorities must not exercise any power under this Act for the purpose of furthering or harming the interest of any particular political party. Yet, simultaneously, the language in the Bill that will criminalise the diminution of Government."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01018,2021-10-04-T-021,1018,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Given how there is always by definition at least one political party in Government, these proposed amendments serve to clarify some of the distinction in the text of the law, not with this current administration or Minister but potentially, with future ones."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01019,2021-10-04-T-021,1019,Jamus Jerome Lim,Ensuring that political speech is legally protected goes beyond guaranteeing that citizens can speak freely about political matters that are near and dear to their hearts.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01020,2021-10-04-T-021,1020,Jamus Jerome Lim,"As a child, I learned how ""boh sumpah, buey pasar"". Children, evidently, intuitively, understand the importance of codification of promises."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01021,2021-10-04-T-021,1021,Jamus Jerome Lim,The proposed amendments to clause 120 essentially do the same for the guarantees promised by MHA rather than leaving it to the vagaries of enforcement by the government in power.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01022,2021-10-04-T-021,1022,Jamus Jerome Lim,"I shall close, Mr Speaker, with a more general reflection of what FICA could mean for a globalised city state such as Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01023,2021-10-04-T-021,1023,Jamus Jerome Lim,"In our Sitting just a mere three weeks ago, we spent enormous amounts of time debating on the merits of economic openness, both historically and for the future of the survival of our nation. This openness comes at a cost, of course, and it is one that we must surely manage."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01024,2021-10-04-T-021,1024,Speaker,"Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, if you can wrap up."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01025,2021-10-04-T-021,1025,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Yes, I have 30 seconds, thank you."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01026,2021-10-04-T-021,1026,Jamus Jerome Lim,"This month, as we debate how to manage threats from foreign interference, we must likewise not lose sight of the bigger picture, one where our people, companies and policymakers are deeply and inevitably embedded in the rich mesh of cross-border relationships."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01027,2021-10-04-T-021,1027,Jamus Jerome Lim,"I suspect and have reason to believe that FICA, as it is written, is likely to be inadvertently detrimental to our public interest."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01028,2021-10-04-T-021,1028,Speaker,Mr Seah Kian Peng.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01029,2021-10-04-T-021,1029,Seah Kian Peng,"Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a Bill which guards Singaporeans against interferences and influences which are unseen and mostly unknown."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01030,2021-10-04-T-021,1030,Seah Kian Peng,"It does not engage in petty partisan politics. It leaves aside all disagreements among ourselves. It leaves undisturbed poor ideas, ignorant views. It respects the naive and the mistaken. Any harm arising from these are of our own making. After all, it is the mark of all free societies that we take this form of rough with the smooth."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01031,2021-10-04-T-021,1031,Seah Kian Peng,"Accepting these rough edges, we must therefore accept that we will continue to make mistakes. There will be those who believe their ideas are good when they are poor."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01032,2021-10-04-T-021,1032,Seah Kian Peng,"The Bill is no arbiter in this contest. What it will do is to make sure that all ideas to come into our political arena do so through the front door, through an open political contest and that they cannot sneak in through the back, under technological cover, wearing a false face and pretending to serve the public interest when they are in the back pocket of foreign or private actors."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01033,2021-10-04-T-021,1033,Seah Kian Peng,"This Bill stands against those who are knowingly malicious, and against those who have been unknowingly used. It is the latest in a long line of effort to keep Singapore free."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01034,2021-10-04-T-021,1034,Seah Kian Peng,"""Freedom"" is a word not used lightly in Singapore. The idea of freedom means something specific to a small country in a volatile neighbourhood. It means an often taken-for-granted, but still slightly-cherished power to decide our own fate, because this freedom is hard won and because the battle remains as fierce today, as it did in 1965. We must see what laws can best serve to protect it."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01035,2021-10-04-T-021,1035,Seah Kian Peng,This Bill targets the enemies of this freedom so that we can fully exercise the larger internal freedoms that I spoke of earlier – to ensure that our civil liberties and our political contests remain our own.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01036,2021-10-04-T-021,1036,Seah Kian Peng,"Sir, to recognise the hidden hands requires no small skill because the seduction is so slight, the pushes so subtle. We might sometimes think we are exercising free will, when we are mere catspaws."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01037,2021-10-04-T-021,1037,Seah Kian Peng,"I speak today with some experience of POFMA having been a member of the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods which was formed in January 2018. So, that is more than three years ago. And where we considered 169 written representations and oral evidence from 65 individuals and organisations. Some of these were shared by the Minister earlier in his speech. There were also public hearings held from 14 March to 29 March 2018. In fact, it lasted eight days in all. So, when the hon Mr Leong Mun Wai says there was not enough evidence gathered or consultations done, I am not sure what he makes of this 169 written representations and the 65 oral evidence from individuals and organisations."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01038,2021-10-04-T-021,1038,Seah Kian Peng,"The issue of foreign interference is complex and enduring one, made more powerful in recent years by technological platforms. We must be clear that these technologies are not neutral between public good and harm. We cannot leave these untended and expect ordinary citizens, who already have so much cognitive tax in their daily lives, to be inoculated against these malicious campaigns."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01039,2021-10-04-T-021,1039,Seah Kian Peng,"Our digital lives have opened many new possibilities, but along with the sunlight, we have an infestation of lies."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01040,2021-10-04-T-021,1040,Seah Kian Peng,"In 2019, then Senior Minister of State for Law Mr Edwin Tong foreshadowed this Bill when he said that the Government was considering legislation against foreign interference. Let me quote him. He said, ""Today, information can easily be weaponised by foreign actors, at low cost, and with anonymity and impunity. No country is immune. This is asymmetric information warfare, fought in a theatre and era with no distinction between war and peace. In this battlefield, Singapore, an open, democratic, digitally-connected and diverse country, is especially vulnerable. We are a young country with sensitive fault lines that foreign actors can exploit to foment distrust and ill-will among our various communities."""
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01041,2021-10-04-T-021,1041,Seah Kian Peng,"Sir, at the time, Mr Tong was responding to a Parliamentary Question. This was again, let me repeat that, 2019. But the stage had already been set a few years earlier."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01042,2021-10-04-T-021,1042,Seah Kian Peng,"We have heard these issues discussed deeply at the Select Committee hearings. We have heard evidence from experts during the Select Committee hearings that hostile information campaigns are becoming cheaper to mount and becoming more prevalent. The point of these campaigns is to weaken the target country, turn brother against brother, countrymen against each other, race against race, undermining social cohesion with fights constructed with false sticks and stones."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01043,2021-10-04-T-021,1043,Seah Kian Peng,"The Select Committee also received evidence, including through private hearings, that state-sponsored information operations have been carried out against Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01044,2021-10-04-T-021,1044,Seah Kian Peng,A third foreshadowing of this Bill happened at the Committee of Supply in 2019 and again in 2021. The Government Ministers then spoke about how foreign interference laws would need to be introduced and its efforts in tracking the legislative response in other countries.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01045,2021-10-04-T-021,1045,Seah Kian Peng,"Fourth, this has been a hot issue discussed among our think tanks and at the Universities – most notably, at the Foreign Interference conference organised by Nanyang Technological University (NTU)'s RSIS in September 2019."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01046,2021-10-04-T-021,1046,Seah Kian Peng,This topic has certainly long been on the radar both of the Government and of the people. It is not new and certainly does not lack for airing or consultation.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01047,2021-10-04-T-021,1047,Seah Kian Peng,"So, really for those who ask why are we ""rushing"" through this Bill and ask for more consultation, I hope we realise this Bill has been in the works for some time already, a few years in the making actually and there has certainly been no lack of consultations and feedback."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01048,2021-10-04-T-021,1048,Seah Kian Peng,"To the Leader of the Opposition, hon Mr Pritam Singh who referred to Christopher de Souza's Parliamentary Question in March this year and Second Minister for Home Affairs, Mrs Josephine Teo's reply, let me remind him that this was the Committee of Supply 2021 debate. I should reiterate this process started way before March 2021 and this was also not the first time that MHA has stated the need for such a Bill."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01049,2021-10-04-T-021,1049,Seah Kian Peng,"My second point has to do with the signature of our defence against external threats. Unity has been our clarion call since the nation began. Against the call of race, religion, against the multiplicity of the babel tower of languages, we formed our own tribal instincts."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01050,2021-10-04-T-021,1050,Seah Kian Peng,"Today, we have more need than ever for such instincts – this communitarian commitment which is not natural, but chosen by all of us who have decided to call this place home. This injunction to think beyond oneself, this seeking for things that matter, this Singaporean spirit is one that we must seek to grow and nourish."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01051,2021-10-04-T-021,1051,Seah Kian Peng,"We cannot do this if we keep using the infantilising versions of these words of ""safety and protection"", which can degenerate into nothing more than an entitled demand for special accommodation, for ""care” for oneself and a refusal to follow the same rules that apply to everyone else."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01052,2021-10-04-T-021,1052,Seah Kian Peng,"To see what true public interest comprise, against a private, self-regarding clamour, we must have space for open, transparent and accountable debates. We must see that all disagreements among ourselves are taken seriously and welcomed, and that it is our joint duty to ensure that such debates reflect our own views, rather than those of outside agents."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01053,2021-10-04-T-021,1053,Seah Kian Peng,"This Bill is not a molly-coddle of resources to ""protect"" and bubble wrap Singaporeans, but a sword, so that we are armed against those who seek to harm us. It is a true countermeasure, a necessary response to attacks, attacks which I am quite sure will come. So, the earlier we are prepared for it, the better."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01054,2021-10-04-T-021,1054,Seah Kian Peng,"FICA does not increase the reach of the law in substance. It merely provides the adaptor allowing the law to operate in a more targeted and precise manner. In this way, its reach is narrower and would, in fact, increase freedoms."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01055,2021-10-04-T-021,1055,Seah Kian Peng,"FICA is not more authoritarian than other similar laws, for example, what is in the United States now."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01056,2021-10-04-T-021,1056,Seah Kian Peng,FICA is a sword that stays in its sheath most of the time. It has a high threshold which will not be awaken until activities attack the public interest of Singapore. This Bill gives us the power towards early detection and exposure. We have always relied on this sunlight in the past and we must do so again.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01057,2021-10-04-T-021,1057,Seah Kian Peng,"As for the criticism on this Bill from activists and academics, MHA, the Minister himself has already responded to some of these. As a Member of Parliament in this House, let me say this with ample evidence from our own history – there can be no civil liberties if activists can be bought or sold; and there can be no academic freedom if our Universities are homes for foreign agents. It will be naive to believe that all activists are high-minded patriots, just as it is mere pretence that all academics are cultivating young minds for the good of Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01058,2021-10-04-T-021,1058,Seah Kian Peng,"In the real world, there are active, hostile and intentional actors working against the public interest of Singaporeans. All of us, in both sides of this House, would have failed in our duty if, in the face of such clear and present danger, we stand by and fold our hands. Sir, I support the Bill."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01059,2021-10-04-T-021,1059,Speaker,Order. I propose to take the break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 5.45 pm.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01060,2021-10-04-T-021,1060,Speaker,Sitting accordingly suspended
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01061,2021-10-04-T-021,1061,Speaker,at 5.25 pm until 5.45 pm.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01062,2021-10-04-T-021,1062,Speaker,Sitting resumed at 5.45 pm.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01063,2021-10-04-T-021,1063,Speaker,[(proc text) Debate resumed. (proc text)]
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01064,2021-10-04-T-021,1064,Speaker,Dr Tan Yia Swam.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01065,2021-10-04-T-021,1065,Tan Yia Swam,"Mr Speaker, Sir, Members of Parliament, preparing to debate on the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill was a challenge. I am a doctor. I do not know much about espionage other than what I read from newspapers or James Bond movies."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01066,2021-10-04-T-021,1066,Tan Yia Swam,"I had not intended to speak, until a few doctors and Singapore Medical Association (SMA) staff approached me privately and separately to raise their concerns. So, how could FICA affect those of us in medicine?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01067,2021-10-04-T-021,1067,Tan Yia Swam,"Firstly, many doctors volunteer or lead various NGOs, mostly on medical and humanitarian missions, but also for social goals. Some doctors have patients who are political office holders in other countries. The SMA is part of the Medical Association of South East Asian Nations (MASEAN), Confederation of Medical Associations in Asia and Oceania (CMAAO) and the World Medical Association. The SMA also works closely with MOH on local healthcare decisions."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01068,2021-10-04-T-021,1068,Tan Yia Swam,"As many of you here would know, Dr Poh Soo Kai was one of the founders of the SMA and served as its first Honorary Secretary from 1959 to 1961. He was also arrested and detained without trial during Operation Coldstore in 1963, and under the Internal Security Act in 1976."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01069,2021-10-04-T-021,1069,Tan Yia Swam,"I was born in 1980 and grew up without much knowledge of such matters. What is past is history and I do not question it here. My being here now, as an Nominated Member of Parliament and being the current president of the SMA, has made the wearing of multiple hats complicated. I state for the record that I speak now, as an individual, to seek clarity on the intent, and the extent of the FICA Bill."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01070,2021-10-04-T-021,1070,Tan Yia Swam,"I agree that there should never be foreign interference in a country’s politics. As an ordinary citizen, I have remained blissfully unaware of how threats to Singapore have manifested, except for what is reported in mainstream news. Arresting a human agent with proof of radicalisation or obvious threats to the stability of Singapore is easy for us to accept. But in the modern world, it is scary to learn that modern threats can be subtle, through social media. Bots, ads, sponsored articles and posts to erode trust in the government, to take advantage of social fault lines and sow discord."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01071,2021-10-04-T-021,1071,Tan Yia Swam,"This is a real threat, and we as a nation, have to learn to defend ourselves against these threats."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01072,2021-10-04-T-021,1072,Tan Yia Swam,"Where my opinion differs is how best to tackle it. The Bill grants extensive powers to the Minister to enforce and regulate anyone or any organisation with an online presence, from the content produced down to the operations. While this may scare off the malicious, I am afraid that it may also scare away people who are genuinely interested in improving our nation. How can we recognise the difference between an activist for human rights from one whose motivations are political in nature?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01073,2021-10-04-T-021,1073,Tan Yia Swam,"I list three key concerns  one, regulating and restricting the political space further may deter genuine individuals; two, organisations may want, or even need, collaborations and support with other foreign entities to survive and thrive; three, the Minister will be granted extensive discretion in addition to existing power under ISA and POFMA."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01074,2021-10-04-T-021,1074,Tan Yia Swam,"Section 8 provides a very broad definition of what activities “directed towards a political end in Singapore” means. This is of concern as any organisation engaging in such could be designated a Politically Significant Person under Part 4 of the Bill, and will be subject to multiple additional requirements, such as the reporting of foreign donations, and being subject to declare, and may be directed to stop taking in foreign volunteers."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01075,2021-10-04-T-021,1075,Tan Yia Swam,"This brings me to my first concern that we need to leave some space for people to participate as active citizens in shaping our future. Desiring to influence public opinion or decisions is part and parcel of advocacy. Increasing reporting requirements opens up a small organisation to potentially being targeted and increases the barrier for a citizen who wants to participate and contribute, or just to simply air their views. Ground-up initiatives may think twice."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01076,2021-10-04-T-021,1076,Tan Yia Swam,"My next concern is about how Singapore relates to the wider world. The Bill empowers the Minister to direct a person to account for all donations, possibly return donations and even stop taking volunteers who are not Singaporean Citizens."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01077,2021-10-04-T-021,1077,Tan Yia Swam,"I feel this is unrealistic. Singapore is an open country with organisations forming many collaborations, especially NGOs that might need the scale to ensure that their services are accessible by others. It seems impossible to expect that people should be deterred from seeking sponsorships beyond Singapore, and also that volunteers and manpower should only be limited to Singapore Citizens. Singaporeans may ourselves, shy away from working for NGOs for fear of being unwittingly implicated, real or imagined. I would like to believe that for every malicious person out there, there are way more well-intentioned people who want to support Singapore in its growth, not hinder it."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01078,2021-10-04-T-021,1078,Tan Yia Swam,But this requires a lot more trust and faith in the people to do the right thing. This Bill equally asks for a lot of trust and faith in the Minister to do the right thing.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01079,2021-10-04-T-021,1079,Tan Yia Swam,"There is great discretion given to the Minister on how to exercise the extensive powers under the Bill. It is a lot of power in one man’s hands. How can we protect it from future abuse? Could it be spread out? Not just to the different branches in the judiciary, but also across the people. Let them call for accountability and transparency in organisations they work with. Let organisations regulate amongst themselves who are the right people to seek sponsorships or volunteer work from. Let safeguards be what they are  limited protections for the worst case scenario, not pre-emptive strikes against people who may be just trying to do the right thing."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01080,2021-10-04-T-021,1080,Tan Yia Swam,"Quoting the MINDEF website, Total Defence involves every Singaporean playing a part, individually and collectively, to build a strong, secure and cohesive nation. The six pillars are military, civil, economic, social, digital and psychological defence. In this digital age, foreign interference is no longer a problem that should only be left to the Government to guard against. Every citizen should be empowered to step up to be vigilant and to hold each other accountable."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01081,2021-10-04-T-021,1081,Tan Yia Swam,"I believe that public education is essential. An educated population will be able to better discern right from wrong, facts from myth."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01082,2021-10-04-T-021,1082,Tan Yia Swam,"Before this Bill is passed, I ask Minister to give us some assurance on the appropriate use of FICA, so that the ordinary citizen like myself, can serve and work for the betterment of Singapore, without undue fear."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01083,2021-10-04-T-021,1083,Speaker,"Minister of State, Sun Xueling."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01084,2021-10-04-T-021,1084,Sun Xueling,"Mr Speaker, Sir, in Mandarin please."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01085,2021-10-04-T-021,1085,Sun Xueling,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Like many Singaporeans, I also desire world peace. Most of us have no quarrel with the rest of the world and try to be kind to others. However, we live in a complicated world. The adage that one does not hurt others, does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that others will not seek to hurt us."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01086,2021-10-04-T-021,1086,Sun Xueling,"Across the span of history, there has always been strife between different countries. Even in relatively peaceful times in the world today, foreign forces do often seek to influence the policies and affairs of other countries for their own political, economic, or military purposes. With the development of science and technology, these interference methods have become more sophisticated, and have the potential to cause significant and destructive impact in a short period of time. I think the comparison made by Mr Leong Mun Wai just now is rather inappropriate. The Nazis was a totalitarian government whereas ours is an elected government; what the Nazis did was ethnic cleansing whereas we have been advocating racial harmony all along."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01087,2021-10-04-T-021,1087,Sun Xueling,"Singapore is a democratic, independent, and autonomous country. To have autonomy means to be able to make decisions freely and independently without being coerced or influenced to do so. The Bill before us today is to ensure that Singapore's affairs should be decided by Singaporeans."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01088,2021-10-04-T-021,1088,Sun Xueling,"However, foreign forces can use various hidden tactics to manipulate our country’s policies, public opinion, and exploit existing faut lines amongst our people. As the saying goes ""It is easy to dodge a spear from the front, but hard to avoid an arrow from behind."" These actions directly jeopardise our ability to make independent and autonomous decisions. To protect our basic rights, we must consider ways to effectively resist foreign interference."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01089,2021-10-04-T-021,1089,Sun Xueling,"Today, I will give my opinion on the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01090,2021-10-04-T-021,1090,Sun Xueling,"Singapore's geographical location is a unique one. It exists in a zone that has seen perennial disputes between major and regional powers. Located in the Straits of Malacca, Singapore is an important international waterway connecting the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It operates the most important energy supply line in the world and is therefore one of the most strategically significant cities in the Pacific."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01091,2021-10-04-T-021,1091,Sun Xueling,"Today, with globalisation, Singapore has become an important transportation, trade, financial, and information hub in Asia. In today's international environment where competition among major powers is intensifying, Singapore is inevitably a contested space and platform among major powers jockeying for strategic superiority. Holding Singapore under control is tantamount to holding the lifeblood of Asia's transportation, trade, finance, and information."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01092,2021-10-04-T-021,1092,Sun Xueling,"In recent years, disputes over territorial sovereignty and hegemony in the Pacific have been common, and countries involved have been looking to meet their own needs. Against this backdrop, and in this complex international environment, other countries will pay attention to the attitudes and propositions held by Singapore and will even influence or interfere through various ways."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01093,2021-10-04-T-021,1093,Sun Xueling,"Therefore, we must defend our country’s autonomy. Only in this way, can we independently and freely determine our future."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01094,2021-10-04-T-021,1094,Sun Xueling,"There are various forms of external intervention, and the new Bill covers two of them  first, the practice of interfering in internal affairs through local agents; second, hostile information propaganda."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01095,2021-10-04-T-021,1095,Sun Xueling,"These practices are not mere imaginations, they have been happening in fact. For instance, in 2017, an Australian senator resigned because he was found to have accepted donations from foreigners. He disclosed confidential state information to them and advocated the positions of other countries on sensitive issues of national security."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01096,2021-10-04-T-021,1096,Sun Xueling,"In Singapore, in December 2018, tense bilateral relations between Singapore and our neighbours became a hot topic. During this period, we noticed a sudden surge in online comments posted on social media from accounts with fake avatars, which were anonymous accounts that did not show the user's real faces. Most of these anonymous comments were critical of Singapore. Clearly, these anonymous users were attempting to create and spread the illusion of popular opposition by our own people to Singapore’s position, at a time of bilateral tension."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01097,2021-10-04-T-021,1097,Sun Xueling,"Covert foreign intervention efforts can change individuals, institutions, and even entire societies, in an unnoticed manner. The cohesion of a nation, the fighting spirit of a people, can be corrupted and defeated without a fight."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01098,2021-10-04-T-021,1098,Sun Xueling,"Let us imagine what would happen, if Singapore allows other countries to interfere in Singapore’s affairs and influence public opinion, and our autonomy was really manipulated by foreign forces."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01099,2021-10-04-T-021,1099,Sun Xueling,"Singapore would very likely become a puppet at the mercy of foreign countries’ manipulation. Our nation-building philosophy, lifestyle, safety, and interests may all be weakened or subverted."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01100,2021-10-04-T-021,1100,Sun Xueling,"For example, if foreign forces intentionally drive a wedge along racial lines, can our racial harmony be maintained? Would our racial and religious equality still be possible? If foreign forces were to use Singapore’s land and resources to meet the needs of their own countries, could we then continue to protect the interests of our people? If foreign forces try to involve Singapore in geopolitical disputes, or become a battlefield for wars between other countries, wouldn’t our children also get involved and be sacrificed?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01101,2021-10-04-T-021,1101,Sun Xueling,"Just now, some MPs said that there was no need for a new law to counter foreign interference. I hope that these MPs can realise that Singapore’s unique characteristics make us more vulnerable to external interference."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01102,2021-10-04-T-021,1102,Sun Xueling,"First, Singapore is a multi-racial, multi-religious and multi-cultural society. Instigating inter-ethnic, inter-religious, and inter-cultural relations is a likely avenue of intervention by foreign forces. At the same time, people of different races or religions may have stronger cultural and historical ties with some countries. They may have a sense of friendliness or belonging to a certain country or a spiritual leader, which makes it easier for other countries to target these people and make use of them."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01103,2021-10-04-T-021,1103,Sun Xueling,"Second, Singapore is a very open society, and maintains a high internet penetration rate, which allows other countries to achieve their propaganda purposes through anonymous, fast and efficient information dissemination. Many countries have the technological and financial capability to expertly create misleading information, incite intimidation, and sway the minds of men. Through highly paid mercenaries and the use of sophisticated tools such as software and hackers, they are able to penetrate into our society and sow discord."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01104,2021-10-04-T-021,1104,Sun Xueling,"Third, Singapore is a small country, which is like a small boat in the sea. If we do not pay attention and endeavor to resist foreign interventions, it will be as if someone is jumping around, and our boat can be easily overturned."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01105,2021-10-04-T-021,1105,Sun Xueling,What preventive measures should we take to minimize the risks of foreign intervention?
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01106,2021-10-04-T-021,1106,Sun Xueling,"First, the ""Foreign Interference Countermeasures Act"" will strengthen existing management measures for politically significant individuals and organisations, and also make them public. Since foreign influence is often covert and executed secretly through proxies, the way to deal with is to be transparent and open."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01107,2021-10-04-T-021,1107,Sun Xueling,"""Politically significant"" mainly refers to political parties, public officials, members of parliament and other people who have influence on national policies, as well as those individuals and organizations who are classified as ""politically significant."" This Bill does not target ordinary people. As such, there is nothing to worry about for most people and entities, as the Bill will not affect their daily activities."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01108,2021-10-04-T-021,1108,Sun Xueling,"Obviously, political parties, people holding political office, and members of parliament are defined as ""politically significant"". Their actions can directly influence national policies and public opinion. However, we also cannot rule out the possibility that some individuals and organisations whose main activities involve political goals and public interests, may be under the influence of foreign powers, and may harm Singapore’s interests. These individuals or organisations may also be listed as ""politically significant."""
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01109,2021-10-04-T-021,1109,Sun Xueling,"Even if they are listed as ""politically significant"", they can still accept foreign donations, provided that their source of funding is transparent."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01110,2021-10-04-T-021,1110,Sun Xueling,"As the saying goes, ""One who stands upright does not fear a crooked shadow."" Such persons and entities should have nothing to worry about if they do not harm Singapore’s public interest."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01111,2021-10-04-T-021,1111,Sun Xueling,"Second, the Bill is not intended to prevent individuals, companies, and organizations from establishing international relationships."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01112,2021-10-04-T-021,1112,Sun Xueling,"Singapore is a global city. We strongly encourage individuals, companies and organisations to participate in international exchanges and international cooperation to make our country more dynamic. I used to work for Business China. It organised cultural exchanges, education and training activities throughout China, Southeast Asia and other regions, reflecting the importance we attach to overseas connections. We continue to encourage companies, associations, social organizations to visit overseas, and conduct cooperation projects with other countries."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01113,2021-10-04-T-021,1113,Sun Xueling,"To do business abroad, our companies will inevitably deal with local governments or government-related organisations. The building of such relationships is important. Of course, we should also abide by their local rules when dealing with them."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01114,2021-10-04-T-021,1114,Sun Xueling,"If a Singaporean businessman interacts with a foreign government or government-related organisation and discusses national policies, that is not an issue. However, if the other part tries to get the businessman to lobby a Singaporean Member of Parliament or asks the businessman to widely spread the other side’s position in Singapore, then the businessman ought to be more vigilant."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01115,2021-10-04-T-021,1115,Sun Xueling,"In addition, if a Singaporean organisation organises an exchange event and receives sponsorship from a foreign party, the general approach should be to be transparent about the sponsorship in the event materials, so that the process is transparent. Some local individuals may also accept titles granted by overseas governments and institutions. Where these titles directly involve political positions, they would need to be disclosed."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01116,2021-10-04-T-021,1116,Sun Xueling,"The purpose of this Bill is to prevent foreign interference and protect Singapore’s interest. It does not target personal, business, and cultural exchanges outside of these areas."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01117,2021-10-04-T-021,1117,Sun Xueling,"Third, the Bill will not affect free speech."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01118,2021-10-04-T-021,1118,Sun Xueling,True freedom of speech is when people can speak freely without interference. Free speech is undermined if foreign actors use hostile information to manipulate and influence public opinion.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01119,2021-10-04-T-021,1119,Sun Xueling,"Singaporeans can still express their personal opinions about our politics. For example, if a businessman is dissatisfied with Singapore’s policies and believes that it has affected the industry he is involved in, he is free to express his views and provide feedback to the government. In this case, the new Bill does not apply."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01120,2021-10-04-T-021,1120,Sun Xueling,The Bill is not aimed at personal opinions and is not meant to curb freedom of speech. Its purpose is to ensure transparency of information and create an environment where discussions in the public sphere is free from foreign interference and manipulation.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01121,2021-10-04-T-021,1121,Sun Xueling,"Fourth, the Bill targets hostile information."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01122,2021-10-04-T-021,1122,Sun Xueling,"Malicious foreign forces may incite controversial debates in order to sow discord between different groups, sway public opinion towards their intended narrative on sensitive issues, confuse people or weaken the public’s trust in the state’s institutions, thereby undermining the security and stability of the target country."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01123,2021-10-04-T-021,1123,Sun Xueling,"Hostile information can sometimes involve Singapore’s national defence, security, and diplomatic issues through intelligence and other means. Therefore, it is necessary for us to protect sensitive information needed for Government decision-making, and we cannot make hasty conclusions through common legal procedures. We must formulate a customized legal framework to protect sensitive information and the individuals who provide the information."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01124,2021-10-04-T-021,1124,Sun Xueling,"The Bill proposes to establish an independent tribunal to hear appeals. Compared with the High Court, it is more appropriate for appeals to be heard by the tribunal as this includes a Supreme Court judge and others who have expertise in the security and technology sectors. The members of the independent review tribunal have the necessary expertise and security clearances to deliberate on issues concerning our national security."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01125,2021-10-04-T-021,1125,Sun Xueling,"For issues involving national security, state secrets, and diplomatic relations, we should all focus on the broader context."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01126,2021-10-04-T-021,1126,Sun Xueling,"Singapore is not the first in putting national security matters outside the court system for independent review. For example, in the United Kingdom, the review of investigations by British intelligence agencies is placed in a review court independent of the court system to protect sensitive evidence from being disclosed. Israel also has an appeal procedure hosted by a special court to protect sensitive evidence provided by the state during the review of administrative detention."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01127,2021-10-04-T-021,1127,Sun Xueling,The discussions on how to effectively guard against foreign interference has been discussed for quite some time.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01128,2021-10-04-T-021,1128,Sun Xueling,"One of the two main features of the Bill is to prevent hostile information campaigns. An important means of hostile information campaigns is false information on the internet. In fact, as early as January 2018, the Government commissioned a Select Committee to study the dissemination of online falsehoods. I was also a member of the committee then. We invited the public to submit feedback, and nearly 200 people submitted written feedback. In March 2018, we held an eight-day hearing to listen to public feedback. Among the 65 people who came to the select committee, 18 spoke about the use of hostile information campaigns intervening in domestic affairs. For more than three years since, different institutions and scholars have participated in discussions on foreign interference. There have also been frequent discussions in the newspapers. At the same time, other countries are also actively enacting legislation."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01129,2021-10-04-T-021,1129,Sun Xueling,"After such lengthy discussions, we need to take action. I hope everyone will be united in our efforts to guard against foreign interferences."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01130,2021-10-04-T-021,1130,Sun Xueling,"In the face of foreign interference, it is important that we stick to our principles and put the interests of the Singaporean people first. If we were to learn from the history of other countries, the most important lesson will be to counter foreign interference and extreme ideologies. Singapore, as an independent country, must stay clear-headed, focus on the big picture, learn lessons from history, and resist all forms of foreign interference."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01131,2021-10-04-T-021,1131,Sun Xueling,"Not only should we stress the importance of personal ethics and responsibility so as not to be used by external forces, but we must also ensure that our government, social organisations, and individuals will not be tempted or misled by foreign forces to harm our independence and the foundation of our democracy."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01132,2021-10-04-T-021,1132,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a question for the Minister of State. Is it okay?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01133,2021-10-04-T-021,1133,Speaker,"Yes, you have a clarification, Mr Leong?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01134,2021-10-04-T-021,1134,Leong Mun Wai,(
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01135,2021-10-04-T-021,1135,Leong Mun Wai,"First, the Government has been scaremongering. Can you give an example where a country in Asia was affected by strong foreign interference?"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01136,2021-10-04-T-021,1136,Leong Mun Wai,"Secondly, what kind of principle is it? If you have no intention to commit a crime, then no matter how harsh the law is, it does not concern you. The Minister has been talking about this principle, and now MOS is also talking about this. May I know what kind of legal principle it is?"

2021-10-04-T-021-S-01139,2021-10-04-T-021,1139,Leong Mun Wai,"(In English)  Okay, the saying that if you had no plans to be against the law, so the law should not concern you. What reasoning and what principle is that?"

2021-10-04-T-021-S-01142,2021-10-04-T-021,1142,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, can I —"
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01143,2021-10-04-T-021,1143,Speaker,I am calling Mr Gerald Giam. Can you make it later?
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01144,2021-10-04-T-021,1144,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Mr Speaker, since the FICA Bill was tabled just three weeks ago, we have seen a flurry of criticism by lawyers, NGOs, academics and journalists, with some wondering if it will affect perceptions of Singapore as a global hub. Some of my constituents have written to me expressing their concern with the Bill's over-reach."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01145,2021-10-04-T-021,1145,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"These criticisms are not unfounded. They are reflective of the disquiet felt by many. The root of this disquiet is that FICA enacts many broad and sweeping measures in an attempt to prevent Singaporeans from being misled by hostile information campaigns over the Internet. If these draconian measures are not properly limited, they could have a chilling effect on freedom of speech and the exchange of information among Singaporeans."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01146,2021-10-04-T-021,1146,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"At the same time, FICA seems to be lacking a sharper approach to deal with real threats that Singapore might face. The Bill does not provide enough countermeasures against elite capture, which is the clandestine foreign lobbying of Singaporeans holding positions of influence. Elite capture can potentially have a far more negative impact on public policies than influence campaigns on the general public."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01147,2021-10-04-T-021,1147,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Fundamentally, no legislation can effectively counter foreign interference in our politics by itself. Public education and a freer press are also needed to inoculate our population against these risks."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01148,2021-10-04-T-021,1148,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Let me now elaborate on these three points.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01149,2021-10-04-T-021,1149,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"First, on protecting public debate. The definition of public interest in clause 7 includes the prevention of any foreign influence or interference directed towards a political end in Singapore. In turn, clause 8 defines an activity to be directed towards a political end in Singapore if its purpose includes influencing public opinion on a matter of public controversy or if it promotes or opposes views on a subject of a political debate in Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01150,2021-10-04-T-021,1150,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Public interest is one of the basis for the Minister to authorise Part 3 directions, anticipatory directions, designations of Politically Significant Persons or entities, Technical Assistance Directions or directives regarding donors."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01151,2021-10-04-T-021,1151,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"With the inclusion of clause 8F and G, the Bill's interpretation of political end covers an extremely wide variety of policy matters and issues which may be discussed by Singaporeans. Public discussions on these issues invariably involve the views and voices of foreigners."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01152,2021-10-04-T-021,1152,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"FICA sets a low bar on what constitutes public interest. It empowers the Minister to block public discussions if it is, in his opinion, in the public interest to take action. This gives the Minister for Home Affairs a very wide discretion to authorise Part 3 directions or designate PSPs."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01153,2021-10-04-T-021,1153,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"It could stifle genuine political debate by discouraging Singaporean Citizens or local non-governmental organisations (NGOs) from speaking up, even in good faith, for fear of being issued a directive under FICA or designated as a PSP."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01154,2021-10-04-T-021,1154,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"While the Government might argue that having a directive issued against, say, a Facebook post, is not a death warrant, it carries a reputational risk to the target of that directive. It would be very unfortunate if an NGO engaged in advocacy work, for example, speaking up on migrant workers' rights, is designated as a politically significant entity."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01155,2021-10-04-T-021,1155,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"I note that MHA has tried to give assurances that this type of activity will not be stopped. But these assurances are not in the letter of the law. This is why the Member of Parliament for Sengkang, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim tabled amendments to clause 120, to codify MHA's assurances in this Bill."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01156,2021-10-04-T-021,1156,Gerald Giam Yean Song,I tabled amendments to subsections F and G under clause 8 to be removed. Removing these two subsections will not hinder the Minister from applying the brake on hostile foreign influence operations that could harm Singapore.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01157,2021-10-04-T-021,1157,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Clause 7 already has a list of actions that are contrary to the public interest which the Minister is authorised Part 3 directions against. These include threats to public health, finances, safety, tranquilly, peace and order as well as incitement of feelings of enmity, hatred or ill will between different groups of people in Singapore which may endanger the public peace and public order of Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01158,2021-10-04-T-021,1158,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Let me address the scenarios given by the Minister in his speech earlier.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01159,2021-10-04-T-021,1159,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Setting one race against another or using religion to drive a wedge between religious groups could be considered incitement of feelings of ill will between different groups of people in Singapore and will already fall under clause 7D. A foreign agent promoting harmful falsehoods, for example, about approved vaccines, could be reined in to protect public health under clause 7B."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01160,2021-10-04-T-021,1160,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"In short, our amendments to the Bill will not prevent the Minister from acting against foreigners seeking to do harm to Singapore but they will go some way in preventing genuine political discussions from being stifled either deliberately by the government of the day or inadvertently, due to their mere presence."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01161,2021-10-04-T-021,1161,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Next, I wish to highlight an area where the Bill does not do enough of, which is preventing elite capture."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01162,2021-10-04-T-021,1162,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"While high-profile influence campaigns tend to hog the limelight, clandestine foreign lobbying of individual elites is by definition done in secret. The most likely targets of this secret influence operations are our political elites."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01163,2021-10-04-T-021,1163,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Many democracies have countermeasures in place to deal with the risk of such influence operations.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01164,2021-10-04-T-021,1164,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"The US has the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) enacted in 1938, which requires agents of foreigners to register or risk prosecution under federal law. These agents must disclose their agreements with foreign principles, report the funding they have received and provide a log of all activities performed on behalf of the foreign principles."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01165,2021-10-04-T-021,1165,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"The Singapore Government would be familiar with FARA because agencies like EBD, STB, Temasek Holdings and the Government itself have already been registered as foreign principals. These registrations are transparent to the public and can be downloaded from the FARA website."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01166,2021-10-04-T-021,1166,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Australia has the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act, which has the registry of interests. Taiwan has the Sunshine Acts, which require public officers from the President all the way down to the administrator for company registrations and their immediate family members to make public declarations of their assets, which helps combat both graft and foreign influence operations."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01167,2021-10-04-T-021,1167,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"In addition, most of these democracies provide for independent legislative review through regular select committee hearings."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01168,2021-10-04-T-021,1168,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Policymaking in Singapore is highly concentrated in the top ranks of the Government and the Civil Service. Many policymakers regularly exchange ideas with each other in informal settings like golf courses and exclusive clubs like the Pyramid Club. These are places where informal discussions on policies may take place well before they are discussed in the media or drafted into law.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01169,2021-10-04-T-021,1169,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Yet, in the Bill, the list of defined PSPs excludes senior public officers. This could make it easier for malign foreign actors to co-opt local elites to use their influence either wittingly or unwittingly for the benefit of foreign powers."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01170,2021-10-04-T-021,1170,Gerald Giam Yean Song,This is why I tabled the amendments to the Bill to add several more classes of people to the list of defined PSPs under clauses 14 and 78.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01171,2021-10-04-T-021,1171,Gerald Giam Yean Song,My proposed additions to the list include permanent secretaries (PSes) and deputy secretaries (DSes) in Government Ministries.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01172,2021-10-04-T-021,1172,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"These officials lead the formation in drafting of legislation. They are the subject matter experts who provide important policy advice to Ministers almost on a daily basis. The Minister has argued that civil servants are subject to the Instruction Manual and various rules and declaration requirements, which are cumulatively stricter than the FICA requirements on PSPs."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01173,2021-10-04-T-021,1173,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"This is even more reason to include PSes, DSes and Statutory Board CEOs as PSPs. FICA will provide a stronger layer of public transparency, accountability and oversight without making it more onerous on them. Their names will be made public on the register of PSPs and any foreigner dealing with them will know that they are PSPs and vice versa."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01174,2021-10-04-T-021,1174,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"The chairpersons, board members and chief executives of Statutory Boards also have important roles in influencing and implementing Government policies. I cannot agree with the Minister that it is impractical to define this group as PSPs just because some of them are foreigners."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01175,2021-10-04-T-021,1175,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Statutory Boards are not private firms. The fact that many Statutory Board members are foreigners is even more reason to impose transparency requirements so that the public and the Government can be more confident that they are acting in the best interest of Singapore.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01176,2021-10-04-T-021,1176,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Our list also includes the board members and chief executives of Temasek, GIC, MAS and CPF Board. These individuals provide directions on policies and long-term asset allocations that involve hundreds of billions of dollars of our national reserves. Surely, we can all agree that these decisions must be guarded against any malign foreign influence."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01177,2021-10-04-T-021,1177,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"All these influential individuals should be subject to the same level of scrutiny of their foreign connections as election agents and candidates, the latter of whom are already on the list of defined PSPs but are much less influential in policymaking."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01178,2021-10-04-T-021,1178,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Lastly, central executive committee members of registered political parties are included because they have a role in setting the policy and political positions that parties take into elections and Parliament."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01179,2021-10-04-T-021,1179,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"While this expanded list of defined PSPs does not cover every possible person who can influence policies, it provides for additional scrutiny over interactions between Government elites and foreign principals. It will require them to disclose foreign affiliations, reportable arrangements and migration benefits with foreign principals, all of which have the potential to colour their decisions on domestic and foreign policies, which affect all Singaporeans."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01180,2021-10-04-T-021,1180,Gerald Giam Yean Song,The last part of my speech will focus on the other actions that are essential to our efforts to combat foreign interference and protect our core national interests.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01181,2021-10-04-T-021,1181,Gerald Giam Yean Song,We need to focus much more on public education and avoid over-relying on legislative measures to curb hostile foreign interference. This is a point made by the Leader of the Opposition earlier.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01182,2021-10-04-T-021,1182,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Back in 2019, Minister Chan Chun Sing also said that a discerning electorate is the best defence against foreign influence. I could not agree more."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01183,2021-10-04-T-021,1183,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Given the growing sophistication in the way foreign powers conduct their influence operations, which Minister K Shanmugam has taken us through in his handouts, we need a whole-of-society approach to counter them."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01184,2021-10-04-T-021,1184,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Sustained public education of both the young and old will help remind us that we are a sovereign nation with our own core interests. This requires a consciously planned and sustainable approach so that Singaporeans are aware that other countries have their own agenda and our national interests are not necessarily aligned with theirs.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01185,2021-10-04-T-021,1185,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"For example, some countries, to further their own agenda, may insidiously play up their cultural affinity card. They may, for example, appeal to Singaporeans of a particular ethnicity to share with their friends their pride in that country's military and economic progress and they might even chastise their own Government for not showing sufficient deference to them."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01186,2021-10-04-T-021,1186,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"This goes against our national interest. Yet, the vectors of this campaign may not even realise it. Issuing directions under FICA to block the transmission of their messages may be like cutting off the head of the mythical hydra. A new head will grow again until these Singaporeans are convinced that they have been deceived."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01187,2021-10-04-T-021,1187,Gerald Giam Yean Song,This is not something that a legislative hammer like FICA can easily achieve. We need more frank and open discussions about the tactics used by foreign powers to influence our population so that Singaporeans will recognise them and will not unknowingly spread foreign propaganda without realising their goals and origins.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01188,2021-10-04-T-021,1188,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"As a small country which seeks to be friends with all countries large and small, it is sometimes inconvenient for the Government to fund public discussions and education of this nature. Some countries might bristle at being called out by the Singapore Government and this could impact diplomatic relations."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01189,2021-10-04-T-021,1189,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Academic institutions, NGOs, researchers and even school teachers should step forward to play a greater role in this national effort."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01190,2021-10-04-T-021,1190,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"These independent organisations and individuals will have more freedom to educate the public or their students without being seen by foreign powers as Government spokespersons. They can therefore be more candid in sharing their views, even in public forums without Singapore incurring the ire of other countries."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01191,2021-10-04-T-021,1191,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Government agencies, especially MFA, MINDEF and MHA, should regularly engage these groups and individuals in closed-door sessions to share the Government's perspectives on our core interests but without dictating what they should or should not do."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01192,2021-10-04-T-021,1192,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Many incidents of foreign influence operations in other countries like Australia, Sweden and US came to light because of investigative reporting by their free press."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01193,2021-10-04-T-021,1193,Gerald Giam Yean Song,A former US National Security adviser resigned after journalists investigated and reported about his contacts with Russia. He was later charged and pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01194,2021-10-04-T-021,1194,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Sweden's ambassador to China was recalled and investigated after the daughter of a Chinese-Swedish bookseller, jailed in China, made a blog post, which was reported in the media revealing that the ambassador had commissioned businessmen to negotiate a sensitive case involving her father without the knowledge of the Swedish ministry of foreign affairs. The ambassador was later prosecuted in Sweden but acquitted due to insufficient proof."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01195,2021-10-04-T-021,1195,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"The PAP Government has rejected the notion of the press being the fourth estate which scrutinises the actions of public officials and public institutions in the public interest, calling for accountability for their actions. This could handicap our efforts to weed out hostile foreign influence."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01196,2021-10-04-T-021,1196,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"We cannot rely only on legislation or law enforcement or intelligence agencies to stem foreign influence. Given the risk that foreign interference poses to a small and open country like Singapore, we need to use more tools in our arsenal to counter it by drawing on a wider range of intelligence, including research and exposure by the press."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01197,2021-10-04-T-021,1197,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"We are made more secure, not less. A free press which invest in investigative journalism can shine the light on shady activities as well as inform and educate the public and policymakers about hostile information campaigns taking place on our shores."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01198,2021-10-04-T-021,1198,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Mr Speaker, the approach taken by FICA amounts to using a sledgehammer to crack one bad nut at the expense of perhaps a dozen good ones. Yet, in the area of preventing elite capture, it falls short compared to foreign lobbying laws in other countries."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01199,2021-10-04-T-021,1199,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"My Workers' Party colleagues and I have proposed some very reasonable amendments to the Bill to prevent over-reach, ensure greater transparency and provide more judicial oversight."
2021-10-04-T-021-S-01200,2021-10-04-T-021,1200,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"With these amendments, FICA will retain all its teeth to keep foreign interference at bay while assuring Singaporeans that its fangs will not be used unjustly on our own citizens. I appeal to this House to seriously consider these amendments and approve them for the benefit of all Singaporeans and our future as a country."

2021-10-04-T-023-S-01205,2021-10-04-T-023,1205,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I declare my interest as a practising lawyer. In 2018, I submitted written and oral representations to the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods. I raised the need for us to be mindful of the power of lobbyists with political or commercial objectives, who may fund the spread of falsehoods online and cause divisions in our society."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01206,2021-10-04-T-023,1206,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,I expressed that social media and online news websites should be transparent on its funding and/or political affiliations.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01207,2021-10-04-T-023,1207,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"I was concerned about sinister campaigners meant to spread disinformation, evoke emotions and provoke reactions to advance a certain agenda."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01208,2021-10-04-T-023,1208,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Intrinsic in what I said, was how easy it was for any foreign principals to interfere in our social compact and political institutions if there are no checks on transparency or accountability. This Bill seeks to address that."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01209,2021-10-04-T-023,1209,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"There has been many discussions on this Bill outside this Chamber. However, I think, as Singaporeans, all of us can agree on the following two fundamental principles  first, that Singaporean politics must be determined and decided by Singaporeans alone; second, Singaporeans all want open and transparent discourse in politics, one that is accountable to Singaporeans and not motivated or interfered in a covert or deceptive manner."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01210,2021-10-04-T-023,1210,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In this speech, I will focus on foreign interference by electronic communications activity. My speech will be in three parts  first, my thoughts on the threshold proof required to best protect our national interest; second, my clarifications in relation to the mechanism to safeguard our collective interest; and third, the importance of maintaining trust and defending the institutions of our country, which I will deliver in Malay."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01211,2021-10-04-T-023,1211,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"The foreign interference threat that Singapore faces, can take various forms and employ different tactics. These tactics evolve over time and are difficult to track."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01212,2021-10-04-T-023,1212,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In New Zealand, the Ministry of Justice in a statement on mitigating foreign interference stated that  ""… due to its covert nature, direct evidence of foreign interference on our democratic system, and its impacts, can be difficult to obtain, and often emerges post-facto."""
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01213,2021-10-04-T-023,1213,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"The situation in Singapore is no different. By the very nature of foreign interference, direct evidence of the same is very difficult to find, much less to prove. Often times, if we wait for such direct evidence, it would be too late."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01214,2021-10-04-T-023,1214,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Against this backdrop, I am concerned about the amendments proposed by Member Jamus Lim as I fear that in actual reality and practice, these amendments may potentially blunt the protection under the Act and weaken the steps that our civil servants can take to protect Singapore and Singaporeans from covert foreign interference."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01215,2021-10-04-T-023,1215,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,There are two main categories of amendments which I am concerned with  a
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01216,2021-10-04-T-023,1216,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"first, the amendments relating to the mental state of mind of the perpetrators in clauses 17, 18, 20, 40 and 75 of the Bill; second, the proposal to introduce a new threshold of proof in clause 21."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01217,2021-10-04-T-023,1217,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"On the proposal to amend the mental state of mind in the offences to require actual knowledge, it would be difficult to prove that a person actually knows that his action is prejudicial to Singapore’s national interest. It will be too easy for perpetrators to just disclaim knowledge that something is for example prejudicial to the security of Singapore. This may have the unintended effect of weakening the protection of our national interests under the Bill. Such knowledge or belief must be pegged I think to an objective standard of likelihood which any reasonable person ought to have in the circumstances, which is what the current wording in the Bill suggests."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01218,2021-10-04-T-023,1218,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Specifically, on the proposal to remove clause 17(2)(a) and clause 18(2)(a), this effectively means that a perpetrator must have in mind a particular foreign country or principal during the activity. However, in reality, foreign state or principals are likely to disavow any links to Hostile Information Campaigns (HICs). I think it matters less who that foreign principal is, so long as we know that the perpetrator is acting on behalf of a foreign principal. The fact that one is a puppet on a string is enough; without needing to know or prove who the puppet master is."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01219,2021-10-04-T-023,1219,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In relation to the powers of the Minister to issue anticipatory directions, I can understand that given the urgency and covert nature of foreign interference, the authorities may require action to be taken on the basis of reasonable suspicion, which is a standard well established in law. This means that the Reviewing Tribunal or the Courts can be guided by past case law and decisions to assess if indeed the Minister has fulfilled the legal threshold to issue such anticipatory directions."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01220,2021-10-04-T-023,1220,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"On the contrary, there is no established standard for an “evidence or actionable intelligence” test in the common law or commonwealth jurisdiction. Ultimately, I think the Member and all of us here want the same thing – which is greater certainty and clarity before the issuance of such directions."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01221,2021-10-04-T-023,1221,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In practice, the test on reasonable suspicion is objectively met if there is a reasonable suspicion or belief and that it is in the public interest to do so. This is based on Court of Appeal cases that have construed the meaning of reasonable suspicion test. This is not Hollywood. This is based on case law with a Judiciary that carries out its duty with no fear or favour."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01222,2021-10-04-T-023,1222,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,I now move on to my second part on the clarifications to further safeguard our national interest and Singaporeans. I have five clarifications in this regard.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01223,2021-10-04-T-023,1223,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"First, in relation to clauses 17 and 18 of the Bill, is it a requirement for the perpetrator or accused to actually know that the proxy was indeed acting on behalf of a foreign principal? What if he or she does not even know that the proxy was acting for a foreign principal?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01224,2021-10-04-T-023,1224,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Alternatively, he or she may not know that the proxy was acting on behalf of an undisclosed principal. What would the approach be then?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01225,2021-10-04-T-023,1225,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,I ask these questions because it should not be made easy for perpetrators to disclaim actual knowledge in situations when they could or ought to have made reasonable enquiries with the proxy regarding the principal.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01226,2021-10-04-T-023,1226,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,This is not an ordinary crime or offence we are talking about here. The stakes are too high given the harm and prejudice that can be caused to our country.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01227,2021-10-04-T-023,1227,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Second, with regard to clause 16 on determining the purpose of an activity or conduct having regard to the intention or belief of the persons involved, what is the threshold of determining such intention or belief? Does such belief need to be objectively ascertained on a reasonable basis? Also, what is the approach, assuming there is more than one or competing beliefs or intentions?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01228,2021-10-04-T-023,1228,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Third, on what is to be determined as covert or clandestine, may I ask the Minister, what about communications over WhatsApp or other end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms or communications through VPNs? These are widely available and platforms commonly used."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01229,2021-10-04-T-023,1229,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Do we consider the varying degrees of concealment? On the flipside, if there was no attempt at all to hide the prejudicial interference, then I think the perpetrators should still not be allowed to get away with it."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01230,2021-10-04-T-023,1230,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Fourth, on the Reviewing Tribunal and judicial proceedings, clause 112 makes every offence in Part 3 arrestable and non-bailable and the rest of the offences arrestable. In this regard, what are the measures that will be in the subsidiary legislation or otherwise to ensure that the Reviewing Tribunal proceedings can be concluded expeditiously?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01231,2021-10-04-T-023,1231,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Also, given that such proceedings will touch on matters on national security and interest, what are the safeguards in place to ensure the confidentiality and secrecy of the information or any evidence produced in those proceedings, whether under the OSA or other applicable legislation?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01232,2021-10-04-T-023,1232,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Fifth, I feel that it would be useful for the public to know on a periodical basis the types of threats and attempts of foreign interference made. I can understand that full disclosure would be extremely sensitive to the mission success of any intelligence operations. However, perhaps MHA can consider, from time to time, giving a report on the FICA offences or directions without the need to go into the specific details or naming the individuals or foreign principals involved."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01233,2021-10-04-T-023,1233,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In this way, Singaporeans and the public can appreciate the good work done behind the scenes by the men and women of our public service to protect our national interests and at the same time, maintain and increase public confidence in the Public Service and Government."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01234,2021-10-04-T-023,1234,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, Sir, for the final part of my speech, in Malay, please."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01235,2021-10-04-T-023,1235,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Every country takes part in activities to influence, shape perceptions and make decisions in other countries. This is the nature of international diplomacy."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01236,2021-10-04-T-023,1236,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"However, these activities reach the level of interference when it is deliberately done in an irresponsible manner to damage the sovereignty of other nations."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01237,2021-10-04-T-023,1237,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In a study by the Strategic Research Institute at the French Military College, or IRSEM, which was published just last week, Singapore was found to be highly exposed to foreign interference. First, our country’s high level of digital literacy means that online intervention campaigns can be carried out very easily. Secondly, because we are a plural society, those with nefarious intentions can attempt to divide us."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01238,2021-10-04-T-023,1238,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Therefore, it is right that we, as one country, seek to further strengthen our solidarity and our mutual trust with the Government by reviewing the legal framework to combat elements that want to divide us. The Act seeks to achieve this goal."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01239,2021-10-04-T-023,1239,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In my English speech, I recounted my experience as a community leader and lawyer when I was providing evidence at the Select Committee on Online Falsehoods in 2018. I stated my concern that social media and online news websites should be transparent in their sources of funding or political links. What was inherent in my evidence was my worry that any foreign actor can easily interfere in our country’s politics and disrupt the stability of our social and political institutions. In fact, many other observers and individuals have voiced similar concerns to the Select Committee, as what was listed by the Minister earlier."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01240,2021-10-04-T-023,1240,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In my role as Vice Chairerson of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Home Affairs and Law, I have also been involved in various discussions and consultations on the issue of foreign interference as reflected in this Act. Therefore, the discussion on the threat of clandestine foreign interference has been going on for more than three years and not just recently as portrayed by the hon Leader of the Opposition, Mr Pritam Singh. In fact, Mr Singh was also a panel member of the Select Committee in 2018 and he was present during my testimony on March 27, 2018."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01241,2021-10-04-T-023,1241,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Mr Speaker, this Act will allow the Ministry to take strategic measures against the mastermind or proxy, who is like a snake in the grass within our country. Their activities or plans are difficult to detect and sometimes we should take immediate action before it is too late."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01242,2021-10-04-T-023,1242,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"This is not new. As a lawyer in international cases in court and arbitration, I had to often accept urgent orders to preserve certain evidence or assets temporarily before the case goes to court for trial. As for this Act, in order to balance the rights of an individual with our public and national interests, the Act provides the space and opportunity for the accused to submit appeals and provide evidence to the tribunal that reviews MHA orders or the Reviewing Tribunal."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01243,2021-10-04-T-023,1243,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"I feel that the proposed process in this Act is reasonable. This is in view of the pressing situation to prevent interference by foreign parties and the adverse consequences to our country and citizens if such interference are implemented successfully. In this way, no clandestine enemy can divide our plural society."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01244,2021-10-04-T-023,1244,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"The Ministry must also meet the prescribed conditions before it can issue an order through this Act. This is based on the definition grounded in previous caselaw. In fact, the court still has the power to establish a judicial review in certain cases according to the existing court's inherent jurisdiction."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01245,2021-10-04-T-023,1245,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Singapore also has an excellent reputation and high degree of trust in the police and Government, a robust legislative system and an independent judiciary. If an individual is truly not involved, it is very easy for him to refute the accusation with strong evidence. But in my experience, for serious criminal cases especially against the country and our entire society, the Ministry will not simply accuse a person without any reasonable cause or proof. There is no smoke without fire."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01246,2021-10-04-T-023,1246,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"We have gone through decades of independence. However, the battle to colonize the minds of our people still exists. Let us unite and strengthen the trust between us and within our institutions."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01247,2021-10-04-T-023,1247,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"(In English)  Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, the law and our public officers operate in the light to protect us, while sinister clandestine actors operate in the shadows against our collective interest and our country."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01248,2021-10-04-T-023,1248,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Hence, we should even the odds in this fight. Let us put our trust in the men and women of our public service and grant them the tools that they need to uphold their sworn duty to protect our lives and our Singaporean way of living."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01249,2021-10-04-T-023,1249,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Notwithstanding the clarifications, I stand in support of this Bill. [Applause.]"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01250,2021-10-04-T-023,1250,Speaker,Mr Darryl David.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01251,2021-10-04-T-023,1251,Darryl David,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act (FICA) broadly aims to counter foreign attempts to influence domestic politics of Singapore through information campaigns that shape public’s opinions on topics of interest to Singapore and the use of local proxies to influence political outcomes."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01252,2021-10-04-T-023,1252,Darryl David,"Given the nature of FICA, there are expectedly numerous questions from various quarters on what FICA is, what does it cover or not cover, who or what is affected by it, how will it change the current operating models of NGOs that are part of a larger global body, or whether FICA will end up as a political muzzle on active citizenry and citizens’ participation in politics. These questions are clearly important and should be thoroughly addressed and debated so that all Singaporeans will have a clear understanding of what the Act entails."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01253,2021-10-04-T-023,1253,Darryl David,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the interference of foreign actors in the affairs of other countries is not new. History is replete with examples of how different states and state-sponsored actors had tried to influence the course of political and social development in other states."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01254,2021-10-04-T-023,1254,Darryl David,"In modern times, foreign influence might take the overt form of Embassies and Foreign Chambers of Commerce lobbying and advocating for their interests. It may also take the covert form of actions such as state-sponsored actors conducting black ops and clandestine disinformation campaigns that sow discontent and distrust between the government and people and discord among citizens on contentious social issues. Such ops can also create an impression of mass support among the country’s citizens for a foreign country’s position on important bilateral issues."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01255,2021-10-04-T-023,1255,Darryl David,"Such pernicious foreign influence creates a drip effect that can change the attitudes of citizens towards their own government and even towards their own fellow citizens, leading to the destabilisation of the country in the long run, and the weakening of its position vis-à-vis that of the foreign country that could be behind, exerting the covert influence. This is why an open economy and a small country like Singapore needs intelligence and counter-intelligence resources to help manage such threats."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01256,2021-10-04-T-023,1256,Darryl David,"In the hyperconnected world that we are in today, everyone, individuals, organisations and governments, are susceptible to online attacks. Such attacks can be conducted by hackers who are motivated by monetary gains or by state-linked groups that are trying to make a political statement. For example, the hacking of Sony Pictures, an entertainment company, in 2014 by the “Guardians of Peace” who supposedly had links with a North Asian nation. Cyberattacks can even be sponsored by foreign states as part of political espionage to retrieve embarrassing information about politicians or classified government information from rival states."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01257,2021-10-04-T-023,1257,Darryl David,"Of course, we all know about the biggest attack that Singapore was subject to in 2018 where the personal particulars of more than 1.5 million patients were stolen and the health records of Prime Minister Lee was also targeted specifically by hackers."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01258,2021-10-04-T-023,1258,Darryl David,"While it has never been officially reported, it was hinted, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the cyberattack then was likely to have been orchestrated by state-linked hackers. So, my question is, if there is sufficient evidence that a foreign entity, be it a government or organisation, is behind certain activities that are deemed harmful or detrimental to Singapore, how transparent will the Government be in making that information known to Singaporeans?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01259,2021-10-04-T-023,1259,Darryl David,"I know that Singapore has always tried to be diplomatically sensitive when disclosing information on foreign influence. I do understand the need to diplomatically sensitive, but if we were to act against the agent of that particular foreign entity, then should we also not make that entity’s identity and activities known so that we can, as a country, take a particular united position against that particular other country?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01260,2021-10-04-T-023,1260,Darryl David,"For example, if Country X is behind certain activities that could be deemed detrimental to Singapore and Country X is known to be popular with Singaporeans, either as a tourist destination or perhaps a country that that Singaporeans tend to purchase goods and service from, then exposing this country as a country that does not have Singapore's and Singaporeans' interests at heart might allow us, as Singaporeans, as one people, to take a stand of solidarity and take a position against Country X."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01261,2021-10-04-T-023,1261,Darryl David,"After all, why would we want to contribute to the economy of a country who is determined to affect Singapore negatively? I said earlier that Singapore is a small country, and as a small country, we might not have much of an impact on that particular country’s economy, but it is important to take a principled stand, in a show of collective Singaporean solidarity that you cannot mess with us, you should not mess with us."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01262,2021-10-04-T-023,1262,Darryl David,My next point is countermeasures from donor activities funding from overseas sources for NGOs.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01263,2021-10-04-T-023,1263,Darryl David,"Overseas funding for Politically Significant Persons (PSPs), political parties or for organisations involved in political activities are clearly undesirable. They are clearly undesirable. Clearly, we should not allow foreign entities to indirectly influence or get involved in Singapore’s politics via donations they make to PSPs. I believe every Member of this House would agree with me broadly on this point."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01264,2021-10-04-T-023,1264,Darryl David,"However, I would like to seek clarifications from the Minister on the position regarding NGOs, especially if these NGOs are local chapters of a global NGO. What would the Government’s position be if the local chapters of global NGOs happen to be supporting a particular cause that might be regarded as not being fully in alignment with what is best for Singapore? Because, sometimes, those issues are a bit grey, they are matters that are open to debate and interpretation. With FICA in place, would these NGOs be classified as agents of influence and be ordered to cease their operations here?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01265,2021-10-04-T-023,1265,Darryl David,"I would also like to seek clarifications on the Government’s position regarding local chapters of global NGOs that are currently receiving regular funding support from overseas donors and their parent NGOs. With FICA, would these NGOs then be forbidden from accepting funding from those channels, thus affecting the ability of these local chapters to operate in Singapore?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01266,2021-10-04-T-023,1266,Darryl David,"I ask this, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, because there are NGOs that might be receiving overseas funding or support that are doing work, good work, that is beneficial to Singaporeans and the Singaporean community as a whole, and we would not want them or the work they are doing to be inadvertently affected by this Act."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01267,2021-10-04-T-023,1267,Darryl David,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the threat of foreign interference is real, more so in today’s hyperconnected world where we are bombarded every day by an overwhelming amount of information on social media and on digital media. Some of this information could be deliberate attempts by nefarious foreign entities to shape and influence our opinions on certain social and political topics."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01268,2021-10-04-T-023,1268,Darryl David,"In an ideal world, we would be discerning enough to differentiate between genuine information versus attempts to influence. But sadly, we are living in a less than ideal world. Although not perfect, FICA is still useful legislation to help safeguard Singapore against foreign interference."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01269,2021-10-04-T-023,1269,Darryl David,"Mr Deputy Speaker, the debates over FICA could be polarising. However, we must not let the debates over the form of the Act or partisan politics detract us from the spirit of what the Act intends to do. We need to acknowledge that the core spirit of the Act is aimed at protecting our country from foreign influences that might destabilise our society or undermine the national interest of Singapore. With that in mind, I end my speech in support of the Act."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01270,2021-10-04-T-023,1270,Deputy Speaker,Mr Leon Perera.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01271,2021-10-04-T-023,1271,Leon Perera,"Mr Speaker, Sir, five Workers' Party Members of Parliament are speaking on the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act and four have filed amendments to the Act to bring balance to this Bill. Why?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01272,2021-10-04-T-023,1272,Leon Perera,"Some Singaporeans might think that this is an arcane and obscure bill that will probably only impact those politicos who comment on or get involved in politics. Should we not be spending the time talking about COVID-19 jobs and other bread-and-butter matters? We should talk about bread-and-butter matters and Workers' Party Members of Parliament make parliamentary interventions on these matters even during the Sittings such as Parliamentary Questions on COVID-19. But this Bill is important too. It is important not only because there have always been malicious foreign actors who seek to twist our politics to their own ends and always will be, it is also important because the Bill the Government has placed before Parliament today promises to give yet more levers of power to the Ruling party, which can potentially be abused for partisan purposes, to limit criticism and disadvantage political opponents, plus corroding the very functioning of our hard-won democratic society."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01273,2021-10-04-T-023,1273,Leon Perera,"Mr Speaker, Sir, since entering this Chamber in 2016, I have had the privilege of participating in debates on the Constitution Amendment Bill, the Administration of Justice Bill and POFMA, all of which altered the rules of our politics in significant ways to increase broad discretion held by the Government to affect political outcomes. Sir, sometimes in life changes happen bit by bit."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01274,2021-10-04-T-023,1274,Leon Perera,"They are subtle and we do not notice them and, like the proverbial frog boiling in water, one day after many of these changes, will we wake up and find that we are no longer living in a democratic society envisaged in that most Singaporean of documents, our pledge."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01275,2021-10-04-T-023,1275,Leon Perera,"If our rules become more and more and more tilted by a skew towards the ruling party, the government of the day, against critics, alternative parties, or even independent minded citizens, who simply have a point to make in the public square, even at a time when our citizenry is more educated and politically aware than ever before, we love Singapore. What will happen is that our politics will become less accountable, less contestable, less meaningful. The ideas that get raised in the public square may become more and more limited to a narrow field of opinion. Abuses, mistakes, may not come to light, or will get glossed over in public debate when they do. Fear of the enormous discretionary power of the government may poison political discourse. And if all of these things happen to our politics then that will affect our policy outcomes on COVID-19, on jobs, on HDB lease decay, on retirement adequacy, reducing inequality and much else."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01276,2021-10-04-T-023,1276,Leon Perera,"Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs earlier spoke about the political philosophy behind such legislation that the risk of a rogue government is perhaps less than the risk of foreign interference or words to that effect among other arguments. The thing about giving the executive government more and more and more power in exchange for stability and economic benefits, is this  it is that if that government turns rogue one day and that stability and those benefits no longer get delivered, well-meaning patriots and alternative parties may struggle to change that entrenched government because the legal and institutional tools to bring about that change are all stacked against them and by then it will be too late."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01277,2021-10-04-T-023,1277,Leon Perera,"Some may say that such new laws, like POFMA, have not stifled debate. There is still debate and criticism of the Government in the public square. Sir, I will make two points here. It is hard to know what the effect of these laws has been in the past from the quantity and quality of debate versus if these had not been passed. Secondly, hobbling genuine debate is something that could still happen if future governments decide to use these laws to a greater extent than has thus happened. That could well happen one day if a Ruling party in the future, for example, faces a political crisis of confidence and decides to use the most draconian provisions latent in these laws to suppress criticism so as to stay in power."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01278,2021-10-04-T-023,1278,Leon Perera,"Sir, when we face a danger, fake news, foreign interference, whatever, the first impulse should not be to simply give more and more and more discretionary power to the government of the day. That could well backfire and create ammunition for those who want to disrupt our society, those who want to turn people against the state, those who want to turn people against one another. No, the first impulse should be to build independent institutions and education amongst our citizens so that we respond as a society to meet that threat, as the Leader of the Opposition alluded to and he spoke of non-legislative measures."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01279,2021-10-04-T-023,1279,Leon Perera,"Sir, let me move on to the provisions of the Bill. Overall, as my colleagues have elaborated on, this Bill fails on three counts. The three overs, if I may, namely insufficient oversight, executive over-reach and overlooking some areas of policy where foreign interference could act, but which this Bill does not provide clear remedies for."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01280,2021-10-04-T-023,1280,Leon Perera,"Firstly, it provides no independent oversight of the Government, save for the flawed mechanism of a Government-appointed Tribunal that does not meet the standard of independent oversight that is seen to be independent, a standard that is embodied in our judiciary. The Leader of the Opposition and my colleague Sengkang Member of Parliament Ms He Ting Ru had elaborated on this and explain why we propose to allow High Court appeals and judicial review on FICA matters."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01281,2021-10-04-T-023,1281,Leon Perera,"Secondly, it over-reaches by giving the Executive Government too much power to act, based on suspicions about likely eventualities rather than evidence and with no obligations to state reasons publicly. This creates the potential for abuse of power, especially when we recall that the Minister, like all Ministers regardless of Party, is still a political partisan at the end of the day, with a vested interest in winning arguments over critics and opponents and winning elections. The Minister is also subject to error, even with the best of intentions, as are all of us. I am not singling out any Party or Minister for blame here, my point is about system design."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01282,2021-10-04-T-023,1282,Leon Perera,"The Government may respond to such arguments by providing assurances that they will not use the broad powers in FICA in ways that are inappropriate. Sir, that is unsatisfactory. It is a bit like saying that I should give you a blank cheque but I assure you that I will not write a figure on that cheque that is more than what you agree to pay. The fact is you can. The language of the Bill should reflect intent; language of the Bill, not assurances given outside of that language."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01283,2021-10-04-T-023,1283,Leon Perera,"Thirdly, Sir, it overlooks the potential for foreigners to interfere by influencing senior government figures or even a Minister for Home Affairs himself or herself one day. Who checks the checkers? Or to follow the Latin expression ""quis custodiet ipsos custodes"", who watches the watchman? Surely foreigners with malicious intent would seek influence over those holding more power first of all, and that means Ministers."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01284,2021-10-04-T-023,1284,Leon Perera,"Oversight, over-reach and unmet needs overlooked are what the Workers' Party’s amendments and speeches seek to address today."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01285,2021-10-04-T-023,1285,Leon Perera,"In the rest of my speech, Sir, I will touch on three broad themes."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01286,2021-10-04-T-023,1286,Leon Perera,"Firstly, on the theme of overlooking needs. What redress does Singapore have in cases where malign foreign influence succeeds in influencing Government Ministers or even the Prime Minister, and Minister for Home Affairs himself or herself?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01287,2021-10-04-T-023,1287,Leon Perera,"Secondly, on the theme of overreach, a number of miscellaneous clarifying questions."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01288,2021-10-04-T-023,1288,Leon Perera,"Thirdly, on the theme of oversight, I shall explain the rationale for the amendments I have moved to this Bill."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01289,2021-10-04-T-023,1289,Leon Perera,"First of all, Sir, I would like to speak on the danger of foreign interference, or FI, successfully directed at Ministers or even the Prime Minister or Minister for Home Affairs. Of course, I am not suggesting that that has happened in the past or is happening now, but it could. How does this Bill address that? What recourse do Singaporeans have were that to happen? And this is a subject my hon colleague Mr Gerald Giam also spoke about."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01290,2021-10-04-T-023,1290,Leon Perera,"This Bill does not create an independent investigative authority that could look into all cases of malicious FI, whether directed at the Ruling Party or Opposition, nor does it specify a clear route of complaint and follow-up action in cases where a member of the public, be they an NGO, a researcher or an ordinary citizen, has formed suspicions that a Minister is under inappropriate foreign influence. Instead, the Bill, like other Bills in the past, vests broad discretionary powers with the Minister for Home Affairs to act against FI directed at others. What is to be done if the FI is directed at him or her and succeeds?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01291,2021-10-04-T-023,1291,Leon Perera,"Some academics refer to such a scenario as elite capture. It is not hard to understand why this can happen. A malicious foreign actor bent on interference may find that they have more power to influence Singapore’s politics if they can bring a Minister or even the Minister for Home Affairs himself under their influence rather than an Opposition politician. For a malicious foreign actor, influencing the Prime Minister and his or her Ministers brings more bang for the buck. This scenario is not academic, arcane or improbable. In the USA, one popular narrative that became a significant political issue, and I am not stating that this is ever true, was that the previous President of the United States had been suborned by a foreign power."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01292,2021-10-04-T-023,1292,Leon Perera,"I would like to ask the Minister, how does this Bill enhance Singapore’s ability to check FI directed at Ministers, Minister for Home Affairs and the Prime Minister? This unpacks itself into a few distinct questions."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01293,2021-10-04-T-023,1293,Leon Perera,"Firstly, can the Minister for Home Affairs under this Bill apply prescribed actions like transparency directives to his Ministerial colleagues and even the Prime Minister, notwithstanding the fact that the Prime Minister, could, presumably, remove him from his job as a consequence but at least the public would see that action before that happens?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01294,2021-10-04-T-023,1294,Leon Perera,"Secondly, what is the recourse if the Minister for Home Affairs himself falls under foreign influence?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01295,2021-10-04-T-023,1295,Leon Perera,"Thirdly, is there going to be a FICA Office under this Bill, along the lines of the POFMA office, staffed by trained professionals who could in theory investigate Ministers? And if so, how would their independence be established in cases where MHA office-holders are themselves the target of investigation?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01296,2021-10-04-T-023,1296,Leon Perera,"I would like to conclude on this topic by suggesting that the answer to all of these questions could lie in a proposal that has been put forth to this House in the past by Workers’ Party Members of Parliament – the creation of the office of an independent Ombudsman. I do not have the time to elaborate on this here but this is a WP Manifesto proposal and I spoke about it at length during the debate in this House last year on access to justice, including rebutting objections to the idea."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01297,2021-10-04-T-023,1297,Leon Perera,"The office of a public Ombudsman would, if properly designed and resourced, be a good receptacle for public complaints of FI directed at Ministers and would have the organisational independence and separation from the government of the day to be able to investigate Ministers credibly."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01298,2021-10-04-T-023,1298,Leon Perera,"Before I leave this subject, I would like to pose two very distinct questions to the Minister for his reply during this debate."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01299,2021-10-04-T-023,1299,Leon Perera,"Firstly, does the Minister, in the exercise of his powers under FICA as the Bill stands, agree that he and his office will apply FICA directives and actions equally to foreigners who improperly intervene in domestic partisan politics whether they intervene on the side of the Ruling Party or the Opposition or other Parties?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01300,2021-10-04-T-023,1300,Leon Perera,"Let me offer an illustration. Media reports have described the work of a gentleman residing in Europe who runs a Facebook page that makes frequent interventions concerning partisan politics in Singapore, often to defend the Ruling Party and criticise the Opposition in Singapore. Just a short quote from one of his more recent posts  “People often accuse me of bias because I never criticise the Government in Singapore. As I explained many times, it would be a bit like criticising Usain Bolt for not running fast enough.”"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01301,2021-10-04-T-023,1301,Leon Perera,"To be sure I am not calling for action to be taken against this person under FICA and I would argue for a more liberal approach towards debate in general, so long as there is transparency. However, does the Minister agree that he will apply FICA directives and actions equally to foreigners who improperly intervene in our domestic politics whether on the side of the Ruling Party or the Opposition."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01302,2021-10-04-T-023,1302,Leon Perera,"Secondly, the Bill allows for the Government to require reports on foreigners volunteering in political capacities. Does this extend to volunteering for the People’s Association or PA? The PA works with grassroots advisors who are Ruling Party Members of Parliament or individuals associated with the Ruling Party. It does not formally work with Opposition Members of Parliament. Much of the work of the PA serves to build political capital and visibility for the Ruling Party by way of the Ruling Party Member of Parliament or individual gracing events as the Guest of Honour, being featured in publicity materials and so on. Given these political connotations and corollary political effects associated with some of the PA’s activities involving Ruling Party figures, will foreigners volunteering for the PA also be subject to foreigner volunteer reporting? This could be one route along which foreign interference directed at the Ruling Party travels."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01303,2021-10-04-T-023,1303,Leon Perera,"I would like to move to the second broad theme of my speech, Sir, which is clarifications on miscellaneous points, and I would like to pose four clarifying questions for the Minister's replies and, hopefully, assurances."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01304,2021-10-04-T-023,1304,Leon Perera,"Firstly, the subject of a Part 3 direction or POL declaration can apply, within a 30-day timeframe, to the Minister for a reconsideration of his or her decision under clause 23(1). That is as the Bill stands. However, it appears that the Minister does not have a corresponding deadline against which he or she has to come to a decision on the application for reconsideration. This is problematic given the potentially deleterious effects which such a Part 3 direction could have on the reputations of individuals and entities. Will the Minister commit to such a timeframe?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01305,2021-10-04-T-023,1305,Leon Perera,"Secondly, clause 76(1) requires that all PSPs disclose every reportable arrangement during a reporting period to a competent authority. These reportable arrangements are defined broadly and could cover arrangements where the PSP, in her private sector capacity, secures a new foreign client for her business, for example. The language of the Bill repeatedly states that such arrangements are reportable even if not directed at political ends. This would be very onerous to PSPs who depend on doing business with foreigners for a living or for certain individuals who work with foreigners frequently, like academics, for example."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01306,2021-10-04-T-023,1306,Leon Perera,What will the Government do to minimise the onerousness while maintaining the flow of information that is potentially actionable?
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01307,2021-10-04-T-023,1307,Leon Perera,"For example, can the reporting arrangements be made to report on classes of foreign clients and partners, such as, for example, multinational companies in France or academics in Italian business schools, rather than being required to specify each and every one of the names of the foreign individuals or entities which the PSPs have dealings with? This still flags out the countries that the PSP has dealings with. At this point, I declare my interest as the CEO of an international research consultancy."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01308,2021-10-04-T-023,1308,Leon Perera,"Thirdly, pursuant to clause 93, those who are designated as PSPs or PSEs or issued directives under Parts 5 and 6, may only appeal against that decision to the Minister. They have no right of appeal to the Tribunal, unlike those who are issued Part 3 directions. What is the basis for this? I ask this question notwithstanding the fact that my colleague Sengkang Member of Parliament Ms He has argued for replacing the Bill’s Review Tribunal mechanism with appeals to the Courts, a proposal I agree with."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01309,2021-10-04-T-023,1309,Leon Perera,"Fourthly, in the Explanatory Note on page 205 on defining the offence of clandestine acts of foreign interference by electronic means, one example cited might suggest covert links to a foreign principal would be if the person moves communication with the foreign principal to encrypted communication platform. Sir, many communication platforms nowadays are encrypted end-to-end, such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook, Messenger and Signal. Does communicating with a foreigner on such a platform like WhatsApp, for example, in and of itself constitute proof that the communication is covert and clandestine?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01310,2021-10-04-T-023,1310,Leon Perera,"To turn to my third and last broad theme, Sir, I have moved amendments to this Bill, specifically clauses 47, 48, 78, 79, 81, 84 and 85. I do not propose to repeat these amendments here word for word. These are set out in the Order Paper Supplement."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01311,2021-10-04-T-023,1311,Leon Perera,"The overall thrust of these amendments is to require the Government to publicise all of its decisions under this Bill, in terms of designating PSPs, issuing directives and taking other actions. The amendments also require that the Government publish the reasons why decisions are taken, including reasons for designating persons or entities, PSPs as dealt with in clause 48 or PSEs as dealt with in clause 47. This will allow the public to understand the reasons behind the Government's actions to form their own conclusions about the justifications for those actions. This is important because how FICA's powers are used is a matter of public interest and deserves scrutiny."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01312,2021-10-04-T-023,1312,Leon Perera,"These amendments require the Government to publish this information over the internet in a searchable, sortable and downloadable manner without charge, in the words of my amendment to clause 81 to which other amendments make reference, and this is for the sake of transparency and should be self-explanatory. An exception to transparency in publicising the register of PSEs and PSPs is made for national security grounds, but under the amendments moved by my colleague Ms He, this would be subject to appeals to the High Court and judicial review."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01313,2021-10-04-T-023,1313,Leon Perera,"In clause 48(1)(b), I have moved an amendment to add the word ""reasonable"" for the Government’s ability to designate someone a PSP if their employment and activities are not obviously political. This enables a person to apply for judicial review of executive action taken against them under clause 48(1)(b)."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01314,2021-10-04-T-023,1314,Leon Perera,The amendment to clause 78 requires reportable arrangements to be made public. I would add that our call here is for such publicity to be made with due cognisance taken towards commercial sensitivities and individual privacy. This call should be seen in conjunction with my earlier suggestion to make these reportable arrangements less onerous.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01315,2021-10-04-T-023,1315,Leon Perera,"In general, published information should be concise and focus on key types of foreign interests associated with PSPs and PSEs."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01316,2021-10-04-T-023,1316,Leon Perera,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Government has previously said that it would publish some of these details. So, why am I moving these amendments? Are they redundant? No, for a few reasons."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01317,2021-10-04-T-023,1317,Leon Perera,"First, the Government did not say that it would publish the reasons behind their FICA decisions, which my amendments to clause 47, 48, 81, 84 and 85 require the Government to do."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01318,2021-10-04-T-023,1318,Leon Perera,"Second, there is an amendment to clause 48 that requires the Government to exercise its executive discretion in designating PSPs reasonably."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01319,2021-10-04-T-023,1319,Leon Perera,"Third, the amendments call on the manner of publishing to be over the internet in a searchable, sortable and downloadable manner without charge, centralised for ease of use by stakeholders and for accountability."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01320,2021-10-04-T-023,1320,Leon Perera,"Fourth and, most importantly, Sir, notwithstanding the Government’s public assurance that it would publish information about FICA, we believe that this should be codified in law, so that this Government and future governments are obligated to do this under the law. There must be rule of law, not rule by law."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01321,2021-10-04-T-023,1321,Leon Perera,"In conclusion, Sir, I have no doubt that there is a need to safeguard Singapore against foreign interference and I think we are all in agreement of that. However, the Bill as it stands has insufficient independent oversight, enables government overreach and overlooks real dangers like foreign interference directed at Ministers."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01322,2021-10-04-T-023,1322,Leon Perera,"Like all dangers Singapore faces, the solution should never be to simply give the Government more and more and more broad discretionary powers that can be used against citizens, critics and opposition parties among others."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01323,2021-10-04-T-023,1323,Leon Perera,"By staking so much on strengthening state discretionary powers in this manner, we diminish the role of education and trust in the political maturity of our citizens, who are better educated than ever."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01324,2021-10-04-T-023,1324,Leon Perera,"We also risk executive over-reach and abuse, and the risk of that overreach or abuse diminishes trust in our institutions potentially, turns our citizens against one another potentially and harms national unity in the face of these foreign threats potentially."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01325,2021-10-04-T-023,1325,Deputy Speaker,"Mr Perera, could I invite you to wrap up your speech, please."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01326,2021-10-04-T-023,1326,Leon Perera,"Mr Deputy Speaker, you are just in time, so, my last sentence. Sir, I beg to move my amendments as described in the Order Paper Supplement."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01327,2021-10-04-T-023,1327,Deputy Speaker,Mr Xie Yao Quan.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01328,2021-10-04-T-023,1328,Xie Yao Quan,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, youths in Singapore are concerned about FICA. I wished to be about their concerns today. I will focus instead on two issues  one, the apparently sweeping scope of powers provided in this Bill; and two, the desire for transparency in the Government's administration of these powers."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01329,2021-10-04-T-023,1329,Xie Yao Quan,"Zooming straight into clause 5 of the Bill, there are concerns that this clause defines activities or conduct ""on behalf of a foreign principal"" too broadly, to include those ""in collaboration with"" a foreign individual or entity."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01330,2021-10-04-T-023,1330,Xie Yao Quan,"Youths are understandably worried if their everyday interactions with foreign friends will run afoul of this Bill. And more precisely, whether any activity or conduct critical of the Government or Government policies and with any shade of foreign involvement, will be hit by FICA. If one reads the proposed legislation with its plain meanings, one can quite naturally come to these conclusions and concerns."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01331,2021-10-04-T-023,1331,Xie Yao Quan,"But at the same time, a foreign principal with malicious intent to interfere with our affairs can very well exploit, or may already be exploiting, the cover of seemingly innocuous day-to-day activities or conduct, to achieve its insidious objectives. That is the whole point of artful interference and manipulation  to operate under cover. And this could certainly involve a seemingly innocent collaboration with another party."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01332,2021-10-04-T-023,1332,Xie Yao Quan,"Let us take an example, a foreign principal can collaborate on a song about vaccines. We already have a song, a collaboration, may I add, about 菜饭, Economical Rice, so I think we can all agree that a song about COVID-19 vaccines is entirely conceivable. The song could be about the supposed superiority of certain vaccines and/or the alleged risks of certain other vaccines. If the song is catchy, if it is funny, engaging and sung with passion, it will have the potential to viral, no pun intended. And the foreign principal can very well do this in collaboration with some other parties. A foreign principal can also exploit the pretext of collaboration to create memes, videos, articles, even games, essentially, any number of platforms to achieve its sinister objectives."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01333,2021-10-04-T-023,1333,Xie Yao Quan,"And so, herein lies the central paradox that we have to deal with when we discuss our approach as a people to counter foreign interference. Because the tactics of foreign interference can be so sophisticated, so clandestine, these efforts slide themselves effortlessly into our everyday lives and can so easily masquerade as normal activities and conduct. And so to counter these, we really need to fight these forces where they are, in other words, our laws and actions will have to operate within the realm of everyday activities and conduct in order to be effective. But this grates against our basic sensibilities, It touches a raw nerve and it causes worry, rightly so."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01334,2021-10-04-T-023,1334,Xie Yao Quan,"But the basic point I am making is that ultimately, we are contemplating laws like FICA, which can intersect so much with the realm of our daily lives, only because the very threats that FICA seeks to counter have invited themselves into our daily lives first, whether we want it or not and the powers of FICA scoped on the basis of these fundamental reality."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01335,2021-10-04-T-023,1335,Xie Yao Quan,I would like to suggest three key principles as we contemplate what is the right balance in the scope of powers.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01336,2021-10-04-T-023,1336,Xie Yao Quan,"First, the enemy is without, not within. The real and only threat is insidious foreign interference from overseas, not alternative voices, whether domestically or abroad. Second, to deal with this external enemy, the purpose of FICA is in fact very narrow, even if the range of tactics provided for in this Bill is indeed quite broad. So, there is a whole toolkit of directions and directives and countermeasures, but all these tactical modalities are ultimately to serve a very narrow purpose that FICA is intended for. Third, the principles of FICA are neither unique nor novel. In other words, Singapore is neither the only nor the first country moving such laws."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01337,2021-10-04-T-023,1337,Xie Yao Quan,"Australia, for example, has the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme (FITS) since 2019. Their definition of activities ""on behalf of"" a foreign principal is similarly broad. An applicable arrangement with a foreign principal under FITS could be ""formal or informal, written or verbal. It could be a contract, understanding or agreement of any kind."""
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01338,2021-10-04-T-023,1338,Xie Yao Quan,"As illustration, if Company A and a foreign government make plans to import Australian foods into the foreign country and Company A lobbies the Australian government on export regulations, Company A is deemed to be acting ""on behalf of"" the foreign government, even if it is also acting for itself. One can also certainly say that Company A in this illustration is working ""in collaboration with"", in its plain meaning, the foreign government. So, Australia has defined these activities quite broadly and the principles behind FICA are really no different."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01339,2021-10-04-T-023,1339,Xie Yao Quan,"I will also note that none of the amendments that the Workers' Party has moved actually touches on clause 5, on what constitutes activities or conduct ""on behalf of"" a foreign principal. So, I am glad to see that the Workers' Party agreed on the definitions in clause 5 of the Bill."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01340,2021-10-04-T-023,1340,Xie Yao Quan,"Having said all these, how can we then assure Singaporeans nonetheless and keep their confidence in the Government's judicious administration of FICA?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01341,2021-10-04-T-023,1341,Xie Yao Quan,"I have three suggestions. First, and most fundamentally, we should recognise that the ultimate check and balance on Governmental powers is not in more and more legislative guard rails, but rather, in the democratic vote in our own hands. We should recognise that any government, today or in future, as Executive of this and other laws of the land, will be held accountable to the people and by the people in Singapore. And in turn, we the people should have a key interest to choose suitable persons who will exercise these powers, any legislative powers, discretionary powers under the laws, judiciously and wisely."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01342,2021-10-04-T-023,1342,Xie Yao Quan,"Notwithstanding this, secondly, I think transparency and timely disclosure by the Government to the public in its Executive actions under FICA will go a long way towards modulating the Government's administration of the law and keep trust with the public. In this light, I agree with the spirit of the amendments to clauses 78, 79, 81, 84 and 85 moved by Mr Leon Perera. I agree with the spirit of Mr Perera's proposed amendments."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01343,2021-10-04-T-023,1343,Xie Yao Quan,"I am heartened to hear the Minister reiterate his Ministry's commitment made to the media last week that any designation of Politically Significant Persons, any stepped-up countermeasures for these Persons, any transparency directive to publish on political matters with foreign links and any Part 3 Direction against harmful foreign online communications except for Technical Assistance Directions will be made public. These commitments generally go further than Mr Perera's proposed amendments which do not cover Part 3 Directions and do not cover some of the stepped-up countermeasures for Politically Significant Persons."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01344,2021-10-04-T-023,1344,Xie Yao Quan,"Except for the public disclosure of individuals who are reporting to the Government on their involvement in foreign political organisations and public disclosure of individuals and entities reporting certain arrangements to the Government, these are what Mr Perera has proposed to disclose, but I agree with the Minister that information reported by individuals and entities in general to the Government should not be publicly disclosed if the key intent of transparency is really to hold the Government accountable for its actions."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01345,2021-10-04-T-023,1345,Xie Yao Quan,"At it stands now, clause 116 of the Bill already provide that authorities may make public any designation of Politically Significant Persons and and any stepped-up countermeasures for these Persons, and any transparency directive. So, the commitment that the Minister has expressed on transparency goes even further than the clause 116 in the Bill itself. In that number one, the Ministry will make public these actions and two, it will include Part 3 Directions against harmful foreign online communications with one exception."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01346,2021-10-04-T-023,1346,Xie Yao Quan,"To this end, I am glad to note that the Minister has also served notice in his speech just now, to move an amendment to clause 116 itself, with the new language reading, ""...it must prepare a notice informing about every Part 3 Direction except the Technical Assistance Direction given, every designation made under Part 4 or every directive given under Parts 5 or 6"". These proposed amendments will capture the Government's definitive commitment to public disclosure and transparency under FICA and I look forward to the passing of these amendment at the Committee Stage later."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01347,2021-10-04-T-023,1347,Xie Yao Quan,"At this point, I would like to seek some clarifications. One, the Ministry has mentioned a Registry of Foreign and Political Disclosures for Parts 4, 5 and 6 in its interview with the media last week. So, my question is, where will Part 3 directions be published? Two, will the reasons for actions taken under Parts 3, 4, 5 or 6 also be published, as much as practicable? Three, will the Registry or Registries be accessible online, free of charge, searchable, sortable and downloadable, so as to maximise its intended potential for public education and awareness? And four, will appeals made and decided under FICA be similarly published?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01348,2021-10-04-T-023,1348,Xie Yao Quan,"Sir, my third suggestion to better assure Singaporeans and keep their confidence in FICA is that the Government needs to constantly communicate the law's intended purpose and the Government's commitment to this intent. This is difficult to do, as the concerns that Singaporeans may have towards the Bill can be very visceral, as I noted at the start of my speech."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01349,2021-10-04-T-023,1349,Xie Yao Quan,"So, to this end, can the Minister give definitive assurance, in this House, once again, that the youth climate activist working with regional and or international friends to advance their joint vision for climate justice has nothing to worry about as regards FICA and can indeed look forward to continuing and growing his or her work?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01350,2021-10-04-T-023,1350,Xie Yao Quan,"Can the Minister assure that the Singaporean youth working overseas and writing, posting from overseas about his or her racialised experience with previous job searches or employers in Singapore will not be deemed a vector of a Hostile Information Campaign and thus, slapped with some Part 3 Direction under FICA?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01351,2021-10-04-T-023,1351,Xie Yao Quan,"Can the Minister assure that indeed, students, lecturers, academics in our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning here, interacting with foreign students, discussing, exchanging views on any number of political issues will not find themselves subject to designation as Politically Significant Persons?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01352,2021-10-04-T-023,1352,Xie Yao Quan,"Can the Minister assure that patriots, well-meaning Singaporeans who want to lend their own voices to civic discourse here, no matter how critical of the Government and Government Policies, will not be caught by FICA, simply on account of any actual or suspected interaction with a foreigner?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01353,2021-10-04-T-023,1353,Xie Yao Quan,"Sir, let me conclude. The Select Committee on Online Falsehoods heard evidence in 2018 on a troll farm cottage industry in Macedonia. Macedonian teenagers worked in these farms and subverted the US presidential elections in 2016."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01354,2021-10-04-T-023,1354,Xie Yao Quan,"They might very well have zero actual interest in US politics and it is unclear if they were taking directions from other foreign state players. But it was clear that they did this to earn money through advertisements. One teenager reportedly earned US$16,000 – more than 40 times the average monthly salary in Macedonia."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01355,2021-10-04-T-023,1355,Xie Yao Quan,There were even dedicated classes to train young Macedonians in this trade.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01356,2021-10-04-T-023,1356,Xie Yao Quan,"There are two points to note here. One, the content created by this troll farm were not all ""fake news"" or falsehoods per se. So, not everything can be caught by POFMA. Second point and equally fundamental is that the Select Committee report came out in 2018. We are debating FICA today, three years later. Indeed, it would be fair to ask, what actually took us so long?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01357,2021-10-04-T-023,1357,Xie Yao Quan,"Mr Speaker, the threat of foreign interference is real and urgent and the broad powers provided by this Bill are necessary. But Singaporeans, including youths, are concerned and I implore the Government to double down on transparency commitments as well as constantly communicate on the narrow intent of FICA so as to assure Singaporeans while ensuring that the Government has the wherewithal to effectively protect us against a common threat."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01358,2021-10-04-T-023,1358,Xie Yao Quan,"Ultimately, each government will be held to account by Singaporeans through the exercise of our individual democratic rights."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01359,2021-10-04-T-023,1359,Xie Yao Quan,"To end, I would like to touch on Mr Gerald Giam's proposed amendments to clause 8 on what is defined as being ""directed towards a political end in Singapore""."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01360,2021-10-04-T-023,1360,Xie Yao Quan,"Mr Giam has proposed to remove limbs (f) and (g) of the definition in the Bill, namely, (f) on public opinion about a matter of public controversy in Singapore and (g) on political debate."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01361,2021-10-04-T-023,1361,Xie Yao Quan,"Now, I have listened to the Minister explain the philosophy behind clause 8 and Mr Giam's argument for the proposed omissions."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01362,2021-10-04-T-023,1362,Xie Yao Quan,"Sir, clause 8 sets out the entire political landscape, the entire surface area that foreign threat vectors can and will operate on to subvert our affairs. I therefore like to ask Mr Giam if he would not agree that the real effect of his proposed omissions will not so much scope the powers of the executive to limit the potential for over-reach and abuse of power but rather the real effect will be to curtail the real powers that the executive needs to counter the real and highly complex threats that FICA is exactly designed to counter?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01363,2021-10-04-T-023,1363,Xie Yao Quan,"Would Mr Giam not agree that his proposed omissions defang FICA and strip it of its basic effectiveness to fight foreign interference? It is a bit like saying, let us fight with one arm tied behind our backs, or maybe more, because we are worried about the power of having two arms."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01364,2021-10-04-T-023,1364,Xie Yao Quan,"Sir, lastly, I would also point out that the definition of what is ""directed towards a political end in Singapore"" in clause 8 of FICA is already found in existing laws such as the Public Order Act amended in 2017. In that debate in 2017, the Workers' Party had expressed no concern about the very same definition. So, it is not clear to me why the Workers' Party would have a concern now about the same definition four years on."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01365,2021-10-04-T-023,1365,Speaker,Mr Gerald Giam.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01366,2021-10-04-T-023,1366,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Sir, I thank Mr Xie for his questions on my speech."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01367,2021-10-04-T-023,1367,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"I believe I actually explained that quite clearly in my speech as to why I think that even with the removal of clause 8F and G, the Minister will still have all the powers he needs to stem hostile foreign interference."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01368,2021-10-04-T-023,1368,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"I mentioned that clause 7, which defines what public interest is, already gives the Minister the power, in the public interest, to take actions if it is necessary to ensure the public health, public finances, public safety, public tranquility, public peace and public order. All those are already in clause 7 and so there is no reason why the Minister cannot use those clauses to invoke directions in the public interest."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01369,2021-10-04-T-023,1369,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"I do not believe it is necessary to have such a broad and wide sweeping catch-all clause, which is what we believe parts (f) and (g) are, in order to give the Minister the power that he needs. He has already all the power that he needs."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01370,2021-10-04-T-023,1370,Speaker,Mr Xie Yao Quan.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01371,2021-10-04-T-023,1371,Xie Yao Quan,"Sir, I thank Mr Gerald Giam for his clarification."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01372,2021-10-04-T-023,1372,Xie Yao Quan,"The Public Order Act as amended in 2017 deals with foreign organisation and participation in activities directed towards a political end in physical spaces in Singapore. So, as we debate FICA, I think it is quite clear and we can all agree that the same logic and the same definition should apply to even more nefarious and insidious threats in the online space that can apply to both Singaporeans and foreigners."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01373,2021-10-04-T-023,1373,Xie Yao Quan,"Mr Gerald Giam mentioned clause 7 in FICA, specifically, I think, clause D. He cited as an example and I would read out clause D – ""to prevent incitement of feelings of enmity, hatred or ill will between different groups of people in Singapore""."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01374,2021-10-04-T-023,1374,Xie Yao Quan,"I would point out that the Public Order Act has exactly the same clause 7(2)(E). In fact, it has an additional word, ""hostility""."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01375,2021-10-04-T-023,1375,Xie Yao Quan,"I think the construct of the Public Order Act and FICA are essentially the same and I do not see why the Workers' Party, who had no issue four years ago, should have the issue today."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01376,2021-10-04-T-023,1376,Speaker,"Mr Giam. Keep it brief, please."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01377,2021-10-04-T-023,1377,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Sir, I would like to point out that the Workers' Party opposed the Public Order Act and with respect to Mr Xie's specific points on part E of the Public Order Act, yes, it is. But the Public Order Act does not have clause 7F – to prevent any foreign interference directed towards a political end in Singapore. Clause 7F leads on into clause 8, where it defines the political end in Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01378,2021-10-04-T-023,1378,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"So, I think it is important for us to understand that we want to scope down the Bill to make sure that we focus on the acts that actually cause harm to Singapore, not provide a catch-all phrase inside the Bill for the Minister, if he cannot find anything else to use, to use that as a tool against harm. There are specific qualifications for what qualifies as harm against public interest, against public health and so on."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01379,2021-10-04-T-023,1379,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"I have given examples on how, let us say, if there is a threat to public health, the Minister can take action on that. There is nothing preventing him in this Bill from taking action and the Bill has many other strong clauses to give the Minister the power to be able to take action. So, nothing is preventing him from doing that just because (f) and (g) are removed."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01380,2021-10-04-T-023,1380,Speaker,Mr Murali Pillai.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01381,2021-10-04-T-023,1381,Murali Pillai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, in my first speech in this session of Parliament, I said that I saw building consensus as an important outcome of our work here. The outcome of such a process where areas of agreement are identified would possess the unique legitimacy of all voices in this House."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01382,2021-10-04-T-023,1382,Murali Pillai,"The hon Leader of the Opposition started his speech by observing that there are quarters outside this House whose views on this Bill are diametrically different from the Government. That may or may not be so. But what is more important is to make it clear, as elected representatives of our people, where we stand, either together or apart on matters under deliberation – not just the broad strokes but the detailed issues as well. That is accountability."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01383,2021-10-04-T-023,1383,Murali Pillai,I had carefully reviewed the proposed amendments of the Workers' Party. We only have a few matters upon which we disagree.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01384,2021-10-04-T-023,1384,Murali Pillai,Both sides of the House are aligned with the aim of the Bill.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01385,2021-10-04-T-023,1385,Murali Pillai,"The hon Leader of the Opposition agreed that intrusive powers may have to be vested with the Minister to deal with this scourge of foreign interference, subject, of course, to checks and balances, which I will come to later. I thank the hon Leader of the Opposition for recognising this."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01386,2021-10-04-T-023,1386,Murali Pillai,Both also agree on what constitutes public interest under clause 7 of the Bill.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01387,2021-10-04-T-023,1387,Murali Pillai,"Clause 7 represents the heart of FICA. It enumerates the areas of public interest, including to prevent any foreign interference directed towards a political end in Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01388,2021-10-04-T-023,1388,Murali Pillai,"The hon Member Mr Gerald Giam wants to be more specific about what is meant by the meaning of this clause. In my mind, we should equally be mindful of the agreed position of what is not the intention of the clause. It is not to curtail political activity by Singaporean civil society or politicians."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01389,2021-10-04-T-023,1389,Murali Pillai,"There is also consensus on what constitutes Politically Significant Persons and the responsibilities they should assume. Such persons, because they carry political weight, there is a need to ensure they do not become pawns for foreign influence."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01390,2021-10-04-T-023,1390,Murali Pillai,Clause 14 deals with defined PSPs. It is noteworthy that the hon Member Mr Gerald Giam wishes to enlarge this list in the clause further to include more classes of people.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01391,2021-10-04-T-023,1391,Murali Pillai,"The Bill, as it stands, requires the Government to make a case if there is any other person outside the list it feels should be designated as PSPs. The hon Member Mr Gerald Giam's rendering puts even more people on this list. That is to say, this Bill has a net which the hon Member Gerald Giam wants to make larger."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01392,2021-10-04-T-023,1392,Murali Pillai,"On the issue of criminalising conduct amounting to foreign interference and influence operations under clauses 17 and 18, there is broad consensus. There should be little controversy over this. We are, after all, talking about actions of spies and saboteurs."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01393,2021-10-04-T-023,1393,Murali Pillai,The hon Member Assoc Prof Jamus Lim wishes to limit the ambit of the clauses to only criminal acts that the accused knew would be prejudicial to the security of Singapore as opposed to acts that are likely to be prejudicial to the security of Singapore.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01394,2021-10-04-T-023,1394,Murali Pillai,"The focus here is on the impact of the accused's action. But before that, he has to be proven to be acting on behalf of a foreign principal. So, that is a narrow issue."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01395,2021-10-04-T-023,1395,Murali Pillai,I turn now to the proposed authorisation of the Minister to issue Part 3 directions under clauses 20 and 21.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01396,2021-10-04-T-023,1396,Murali Pillai,"There is, again, broad consensus to allow the Minister to issue directions, including anticipatory directions where in his opinion there is online communication activity being undertaken by or on behalf of a foreign principal in or accessible in Singapore to protect public interest."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01397,2021-10-04-T-023,1397,Murali Pillai,"Here, the hon Member wishes to limit the Minister's powers to circumstances where he secures a higher threshold of evidence of foreign interference instead of reasonable belief or suspicion."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01398,2021-10-04-T-023,1398,Murali Pillai,"Given the protean nature of foreign interference, this has to be resolved on the basis on which wording protects Singapore's interest."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01399,2021-10-04-T-023,1399,Murali Pillai,"Currently, the Police powers of investigations are triggered as long as there is reasonable suspicion of a commission of a crime. The question arises as to why should there be a higher bar to trigger appropriate action when it comes to foreign interference affecting Singapore's security interests?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01400,2021-10-04-T-023,1400,Murali Pillai,"This House is unified on the point of vesting in the Minister the power to issue the 14 types of directions to various entities – known as Part 3 directions – in particular, to social media companies described in clause 29 to protect public interest."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01401,2021-10-04-T-023,1401,Murali Pillai,I now come to powers of proscription. There is consensus to vest in the Minister the power under clause 24 to Proscribe Online Locations which would be subject to Part 3 directions.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01402,2021-10-04-T-023,1402,Murali Pillai,There is agreement to criminalise behaviour that involves the making of money or providing financial support to Proscribed Online Locations.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01403,2021-10-04-T-023,1403,Murali Pillai,"The only difference here, again, based on the proposed amendment by the same hon Member is on the ambit of evidence required to make out the offence."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01404,2021-10-04-T-023,1404,Murali Pillai,"Again, this issue is a narrow issue that has been dealt with on the basis of which wording would better protect Singapore's interest."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01405,2021-10-04-T-023,1405,Murali Pillai,"On the measures of designating an entity or person as a PSP under clauses 80 and 81, there is full agreement on the ability of a competent authority to designate an entity or person as politically significant entities or Politically Significant Persons."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01406,2021-10-04-T-023,1406,Murali Pillai,"The additional point here, as proposed by the hon Member Mr Leon Perera is that the public list of politically significant entities and persons be maintained unless there is a national security ground, not to name these persons or entities."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01407,2021-10-04-T-023,1407,Murali Pillai,I agree with the suggestion. I understand that MHA had earlier indicated that it had intended to do this based on its response dated 25 September 2021 to queries from The Straits Times.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01408,2021-10-04-T-023,1408,Murali Pillai,"There is consensus in this House on the provisions dealing with political donations. There is full consensus to impose on politically significant persons during election period, a requirement that they declare that they are not subject to foreign influence. There is broad consensus to require these persons to make disclosures of any dealing with/or on behalf of foreign principals or foreign political organisations under clauses 78 and 79, even if the Acts are not directed towards a political end in Singapore, as well as benefits received from these principals."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01409,2021-10-04-T-023,1409,Murali Pillai,"What is proposed here again by the hon Member Mr Perera is for such disclosures to be made publicly available. From a practical perspective, it seems to me the sting behind this provision will be to deal with the consequence on the part of the PSP for failing to file the report. I say this because if a PSP files a report stating that he has dealings with a foreign principal, directed to a political end in Singapore, it is likely to spell the death knell of his political career. In other words, the publicness of the report maybe neither here nor there."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01410,2021-10-04-T-023,1410,Murali Pillai,"Turning to the arena of requiring disclosure of foreign involvement in publication of political matters, I know again there is consensus in vesting with the competent authority the power to issue transparency directives to newspapers, broadcasting services and PSPs requiring a disclosure of foreign principals and links. The hon Member, Mr Perera suggested that such directives be made public. I agree but I think the suggestion is already present in the current version of the Bill which specifically provides that the subjects of the directives must make disclosure conspicuously."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01411,2021-10-04-T-023,1411,Murali Pillai,"There is consensus in the ability on the part of the competent authority to issue directives to PSPs to end their afflictions with foreign principals and foreign volunteers. The additional suggestion made by the hon Member Mr Perera that is being made here is that to have these directives together with any other modification of cancellation made public. In this regard, I understand MHA had issued a statement on making public such countermeasures issued against PSPs."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01412,2021-10-04-T-023,1412,Murali Pillai,"There is broad agreement on what constitutes exempt activities, that is activities that should not be covered under this Act. The hon Member Assoc Prof Lim proposed adding in this list an exemption on the part of Singaporeans exercising their right to discuss politics and foreign individuals and publications commenting on Singapore politics in an open, transparent and attributable way. I do not disagree that such acts should be outside the jurisdiction of this Bill. The only issue is whether it is necessary, given that the structure of this Bill already makes it clear that it is not intended to stifle such activities."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01413,2021-10-04-T-023,1413,Murali Pillai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I accept the hon friends across aisle feels strongly about the differences with the Government which are set out in the Notice of Amendments. My objective here is simply to point out to the fact that there is much more agreement on significant matters than disagreement. This may not be apparent to members of public outside this House."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01414,2021-10-04-T-023,1414,Murali Pillai,"In my view, the most substantive area of difference lies with the redress mechanism under the Bill which I now turn to."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01415,2021-10-04-T-023,1415,Murali Pillai,"Under the Bill, it is proposed that appeals made to the Reviewing Tribunal and the Minister with limited judicial review by the Supreme Court. The hon Member Ms He Ting Ru, proposed that appeals be heard hurt by the High Court, with the right of further appeal. I appreciate that her motivation is to provide checks and balances. I would respectfully demur with her suggestion although I must acknowledge there are merits to the broad rationale behind her proposal. As for my reasons for demurring, I need only refer to my Adjournment Motion speech made recently this House when I spoke about judicial review in March 2021."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01416,2021-10-04-T-023,1416,Murali Pillai,"Both the hon Leader of Opposition and the hon Member Ms He, kindly referred to some parts of my speech today. I said then that each generation of political leaders and people must find their own equilibrium on what is acceptable. They will also recall that in my same speech, I went on to state that, in my view, the status quo should be preserved for the ISA. I recounted the point made in 1991 by Prof S Jayakumar, the former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs in this House that when it comes to issues of national security, putting a Court to scrutinise exercise of powers would be tantamount to giving the Court, an unelected body, the final say on such matters. That, in the scheme of things, was not desirable."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01417,2021-10-04-T-023,1417,Murali Pillai,"To me, FICA raises the same issues. It is preferable, when it comes to assessment of what action is to be taken, to counter foreign interference affecting public interest, the Minister must be held responsible and accountable through the political process. Also, in my respectful view, since we are dealing with issues of foreign interference affecting public interest, as defined under this Bill, a different form of procedure to ensure the swift and agile handling of cases and judicious safeguarding of sensitive information will be needed."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01418,2021-10-04-T-023,1418,Murali Pillai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I seek your permission to make a short speech in the national language."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01419,2021-10-04-T-023,1419,Murali Pillai,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Speaker, first I would like to thank the hon Leader of the Opposition, Mr Pritam Singh for commenting on the speech that I delivered in March."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01420,2021-10-04-T-023,1420,Murali Pillai,"I said that each generation of political leaders should find and achieve their own equilibrium, of what our people would accept."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01421,2021-10-04-T-023,1421,Murali Pillai,"The Leader of the Opposition would probably remember that I also said, with regard to the ISA, I am of the opinion that there is a reasonable reason to maintain the status quo as it is a bill that is crucial for the security and stability of our country."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01422,2021-10-04-T-023,1422,Murali Pillai,"FICA is a similar Act like the ISA, because we are discussing about national interests and the country's sovereignty being threatened by foreign interference."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01423,2021-10-04-T-023,1423,Murali Pillai,"Due to this, I can understand why the Reviewing Tribunal should hear appeals in FICA instead of the courts. This does not mean that there is no protection for an individual. The courts may still hear appeals and the case if there an overreach in power or in certain matters."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01424,2021-10-04-T-023,1424,Murali Pillai,"Sir, may I resume my speech in English?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01425,2021-10-04-T-023,1425,Murali Pillai,"(In English)  The hon Member Ms He referred to the point I made in my speech in March this year on the need for sunlight of scrutiny of Government action. I thank her for remembering my speech. She may also remember that I stated then in my speech that ISA did not act and does not act in darkness, having regard where checks and balances embedded in the Act and the Constitution."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01426,2021-10-04-T-023,1426,Murali Pillai,"Similarly, having regard to the subject matter of FICA, establishment of the appellate process in the Bill to set up the Review Tribunal and the preservation of the Supreme Court's powers of judicial review on the issue of procedure as well as when there is an excess of jurisdiction and political accountability of the Minister to our people, I am similarly of the view that there are sufficient checks and balances in place for FICA. The Bill does not confer unlimited power to the Executive, which is a concern of the hon Leader of Opposition."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01427,2021-10-04-T-023,1427,Murali Pillai,"I think it is worthwhile holding up again this handout, page 36, which the hon Minister Mr Shanmugam showed us earlier. There are already general powers. You can see that in light green. What FICA aims to do is to give targeted powers, and you see that in dark green. I heard the hon Member Mr Perera saying just now a theory about FICA having some latent powers being embedded which can be used later on by a Government which is malevolently intending to use these powers. If that is really the case, it will be better to use the latent powers already embedded in the current Acts. You do not have to pass FICA for that. So, with respect, I have difficulty following his argument."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01428,2021-10-04-T-023,1428,Murali Pillai,"Notwithstanding what I said, I have a few questions on the redress mechanism concerning the Reviewing Tribunal under clause 92 of the Bill. The Reviewing Tribunal deals with appeals against an authorisation of a Part III direction. I note it is contemplated that the chairperson of the Reviewing Tribunal must be a Supreme Court Judge. I also note that the decision is to be made by the President on the advice of the Cabinet. To me, the President should be consulting the Chief Justice, who heads our Judiciary in deciding who should be the chairman. This is the case under Article 151(2) of the Constitution which provides the chairman and two members of the Advisory Board which deals with preventive detention under the ISA shall be appointed by the President after consulting the Chief Justice. I seek the hon Minister's explanation on this matter."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01429,2021-10-04-T-023,1429,Murali Pillai,"Next, may I ask if the Reviewing Tribunal will be a standing tribunal that is appointed at the outset for a period of time or will it be an ad hoc tribunal that is created as and when there is an appeal? My preference is that it should be a standing tribunal to ensure transparency."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01430,2021-10-04-T-023,1430,Murali Pillai,"Moving on to the powers of the Reviewing Tribunal, is it contemplated that the Tribunal will have powers to compel the appearance of witnesses and production of documents? This does not appear to be specifically referred to in the clauses that I have reviewed."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01431,2021-10-04-T-023,1431,Murali Pillai,"I now turn to appeals to the Minister against decision of competent authority's decision, designating a person as a PSP or given a directive to comply with on that basis. May I please ask what is the rationale of designating the Minister as the primary Appellate body as opposed to designating the Reviewing Tribunal as the Appellate body?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01432,2021-10-04-T-023,1432,Murali Pillai,"To clause 102, I note that the Minister may appoint an Advisory Committee for consultation purposes but he may not follow the advice. May I ask if the appointments will be gazetted and made public, without going to merits of the case, which is obviously sensitive? How would the public know that the Minister is not following the Advisory Committee's advice in making the determination on an appeal?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01433,2021-10-04-T-023,1433,Murali Pillai,"Mr Speaker, Sir, in my speech, I have noted that the hon Opposition Members have raised some points of disagreement. I have argued, however, there is a lot more agreement on the main issues. I have seen more that unites than divides us. I acknowledge there is one major sticking point on whether the review should be a political or legal matter. I argued that, like other matters of national security, it ought to be a political matter and hence should rest with the Minister."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01434,2021-10-04-T-023,1434,Murali Pillai,"An important point of agreement, however, is where and how we disagree in such matters, such as public interest. The PAP and the Workers' Party may disagree on what this interest is, both in substance and form and in the matters, both trivial and significant. But we both agree that such discussions must remain our own. These discussions must enjoy the most important freedom of all, that they be free of interference from foreign principals who ought to have no voice in this House. That is all, Sir. [Applause.]"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01435,2021-10-04-T-023,1435,Speaker,Leader of the Opposition.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01436,2021-10-04-T-023,1436,Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I just have one question for the hon Member Mr Murali Pillai and that pertains to the reference he made in his speech about his earlier Adjournment Motion on the sunlight of scrutiny and I will repeat the quotation where the hon Member says, ""It is important for each generation of political leaders and people to find their own equilibrium of what our people would accept without question, under what circumstances and towards what ends."""
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01437,2021-10-04-T-023,1437,Pritam Singh,Would the Member not agree that the Bill in question introduces an ouster clause. It is a new piece of legislation and this is one more piece of legislation for which we have an ouster course. And would the Member also not agree that there has been no equilibrium sought from the people by virtue of an absence of public consultation as to whether this ouster clause has been considered by the public?
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01438,2021-10-04-T-023,1438,Speaker,Mr Pillai.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01439,2021-10-04-T-023,1439,Murali Pillai,"Obliged, Sir. I thank the hon Leader of Opposition for asking the question. And the question, as I understand, posed to me, is whether there has been an equilibrium reached within the present generation of political leaders and the people of Singapore on the matter involving FICA, which contains an ouster clause."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01440,2021-10-04-T-023,1440,Murali Pillai,"The point I wish to make is this. In my earlier speech in March 2021, I have already stated that when it comes to issues of national security, a different approach should be taken. I found instructive, the speech made by Prof Jayakumar about why the powers dealing with national security should be sited with the political leaders. So, in my personal view, the equilibrium is still the same vis-a-vis FICA because here, we are dealing with issues of national security. Additionally, I would add that FICA does not contemplate detention without trial."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01441,2021-10-04-T-023,1441,Murali Pillai,"And the powers of FICA is actually quite targeted. What you see here are powers that are already reposed with the Executive. And as I said earlier in my speech, the focus of FICA is to give targeted powers so that you could better deal with national interest. So, in those circumstances, I would say, having regard to the fact that this is an area that has been traversed and the need to provide targeted directives, the equilibrium that we have in ISA would be the equilibrium that I am comfortable with vis-a-vis FICA and there is no contradiction."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01442,2021-10-04-T-023,1442,Speaker,Dr Shahira Abdullah.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01443,2021-10-04-T-023,1443,Shahira Abdullah,"Mr Speaker, Sir, the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act recognises that Singapore remains vulnerable to foreign interference. In cyberspace, the cyberattacks and hostile information campaigns have increased in complexity and have become more illicit, masking themselves in seemingly innocuous ways. Therefore, these risks should be actively pre-empted and addressed for the national security of Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01444,2021-10-04-T-023,1444,Shahira Abdullah,"I believe in the legislative intent of the Bill. However, I have concerns about certain aspects, namely transparency and the need for more checks and balances. Is there a way we can realise and uphold the good intentions of the Bill while at the same time provide some amendments which can address the concerns?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01445,2021-10-04-T-023,1445,Shahira Abdullah,"I will speak on three points. First, on the possible avenues of check and balances that can be incorporated into the Bill. Second, on how we can increase the transparency of this Bill. Thirdly, I will speak on how the definition of foreign principal may bring about potential discrimination which may affect Singapore’s reputation as a global hub."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01446,2021-10-04-T-023,1446,Shahira Abdullah,"First, the Bill grants considerable powers to the Government. For example, section 21 allows the Minister to give anticipatory directions even when the Minister only suspects or has reason to believe that the person is “preparing for, or planning to undertake, online communications activity by or on behalf of a foreign principal”. The substance of these decisions under the Bill are not subject to judicial review."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01447,2021-10-04-T-023,1447,Shahira Abdullah,"I understand that in cases of foreign interference, speed may be of the essence and information received must be acted upon quickly. Moreover, this information may be sensitive and require confidentiality to be preserved. However, provisions can be enacted in the Bill to require that sensitive information be sealed or otherwise not disclosed in the Court hearing such as to allow a judicial review to still be carried out. We have seen some precedent for this in the treatment of whistleblowing information and whistleblowers' identity in court proceedings. If time is of the essence and there is need for judicial reviews under this Bill to be expedited, surely this can also be provided for in the Bill as well. A reviewing Tribunal, even if presided by a High Court judge cannot replace the role of judicial oversight. We must strive to maintain Singapore’s reputation of holding and protecting the rule of law while recognising the ills of foreign interference."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01448,2021-10-04-T-023,1448,Shahira Abdullah,"Second, there have also been concerns about the transparency of the Bill. One example is the criteria on who can be designated a Part 4 PSP. In the Bill, a Part 4 PSP is a person or organisation whose activities are directed in part towards a political end in Singapore and the Competent Authority opines that it would be in the public interest to impose countermeasures on the entity. This is further elaborated on in sections 7 and 8 of the Bill. These definitions, though, are still broad and not easily understood by the community."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01449,2021-10-04-T-023,1449,Shahira Abdullah,"Section 20 will also grant the Minister for Home Affairs powers to issue directions to various entities such as social media services, relevant electronic services, internet access services, as well as persons who own or run websites, blogs or social media pages, to help the authorities investigate and counter hostile communications activity that is of foreign origin. Although it does not apply to Singaporeans expressing their own views on political matters, unless they are agents of a foreign principal and it may not be the intent of the Bill to stifle political speech, there are some members of the community, for example, members of academia or humanitarian and advocacy groups who have genuine concerns about this. These groups have many foreign connections due to their nature that encourages cross-border collaboration. The fear is that their work, which may touch on complex local political issues, and their ties with foreign entities, foundations and states as well as associated funding, may mean that they are at risk of running afoul of the law."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01450,2021-10-04-T-023,1450,Shahira Abdullah,"It may be argued that this does not cross the threshold of “public interest”. However, there is a sense of unease on the ground and reasonable concern that the current non-exhaustive way that “public interest” is defined in section 8 would still mean that their activities fall under it. Could more be done in the wording of the Bill to provide greater certainty to organisations on the types of entities that would be designated a Part 4 PSP and subject to directives, such that it avoids casting a shadow on their activities? After all, unless winter is coming in Singapore, surely it would be in the country's best interest to avoid casting a chilling effect on such complex cross-border research and activities."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01451,2021-10-04-T-023,1451,Shahira Abdullah,"I am also concerned about how our youths have received this. Youths include Singaporeans, foreigners and PRs among them, interacting together. And our youths value the ability to talk about potentially politically sensitive and difficult topics and is increasingly comfortable doing so on an online platform. Would these regulations give the impression that the Government is discouraging this? If it does, it will cast a shadow on the trust that the youths have for the Government which is something we should guard against. Youths are our future and trust is essential for governments to effectively lead."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01452,2021-10-04-T-023,1452,Shahira Abdullah,"Third, section 4 has defined the meaning of “foreign principal” very broadly to capture any and everything that is remotely foreign in nature, regardless of whether such foreign nature is political or government-related or has a public interest. A foreign principal includes a foreigner even if he or she is a Permanent Resident of this country. This is understandable, as foreign interferences may masquerade as normal foreign entities when in essence they are not."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01453,2021-10-04-T-023,1453,Shahira Abdullah,"However, I would like to caution and remind, in the wake of these broad definitions and this House's very recent extensive debates on foreign manpower and CECA, to guard against inadvertently enacting legislation that is potentially discriminatory in nature. This may have unintended effects on Singapore’s reputation as a hub for global trade and investments that upholds its constitutional values of equality and fairness. This is something we should always be vigilant about."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01454,2021-10-04-T-023,1454,Shahira Abdullah,"Mr Speaker, Sir, at the end of it all, the fundamental question that needs to be asked is if the needs of national security outweigh the needs of checks and balances and transparency. A balance must be struck and its consequences understood as it also has a bearing on the trust Singaporeans may have in the Government and its systems. I fully agree that Singapore must always be prepared against the threat of foreign interference. This is something I recognise and that no one can deny. However, I do hope that in the implementation of this Act, we do not inadvertently lose public trust, discourage local political discourse or advocacy, or affect Singapore’s reputation as an open trading hub."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01455,2021-10-04-T-023,1455,Speaker,Mr Sharael Taha.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01456,2021-10-04-T-023,1456,Sharael Taha,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. I would like to declare my interest as an employee in a global MNC."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01457,2021-10-04-T-023,1457,Sharael Taha,"In 2018, the Select Committee of Online Falsehood, which comprises of members from both sides of this House, concluded that “this phenomenon (of foreign interference) is real and a serious problem in Singapore,” and that the “Committee received evidence that state-sponsored information operations have been carried out against Singapore” and the Committee provided 22 recommendations which included implementing specific countermeasures to combat state-sponsored disinformation operations."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01458,2021-10-04-T-023,1458,Sharael Taha,"Hence, I am glad that three years later, after the recommendations of the Select Committee, discussions in Parliament, conferences, publication and speeches during the Committee of Supply, we are ready to debate this piece of legislation to protect our national interest."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01459,2021-10-04-T-023,1459,Sharael Taha,"The threat of foreign interference is a global problem and the threat to Singapore is real, is growing and we need to enact strong safeguards to protect our “national sovereignty and security, social cohesion and democratic institutions”."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01460,2021-10-04-T-023,1460,Sharael Taha,"In protecting ourselves from foreign interference, there are several factors that makes it even more important for this Bill to be enacted."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01461,2021-10-04-T-023,1461,Sharael Taha,"Firstly, Singapore has a small and digitally connected population with IMDA citing 87% of our four million resident population having access to the internet. Unfortunately, a recent IPS survey also found that our digital literacy rates are worryingly low with 6 in 10 respondents believing false information to be true and found that no one is immune to false information regardless of age, socio-economic status and educational background. The IPS study also found that more than two-thirds of over 2,000 respondents trusted a manipulated ""news article"" presented to them as part of the study."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01462,2021-10-04-T-023,1462,Sharael Taha,"Secondly, the existence of fault lines in our society is undeniable. Sensitive issues of race, religion, foreign workforce versus local hires, can be easily manipulated to sow social discord. We cannot allow others the chance to destabilise the delicate balance that we have continuously been working on."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01463,2021-10-04-T-023,1463,Sharael Taha,"Lastly, our open economy. It keeps us relevant and competitive globally. International investors from various industries are attracted to set up operations in Singapore. Facebook, Google, Twitter, Tencent, Alibaba, Huawei, Wechat. These are all foreign companies that have established substantial operations in Singapore. We value the partnerships we have forged with each one of our trading partners and we seek to continue to be able to balance their needs while propelling our national interest forward."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01464,2021-10-04-T-023,1464,Sharael Taha,"However, the increased Sino-US tensions will invariably affect Singapore. We will have to be able to assert our neutrality and independence to maintain the balance that we have. We must prevent foreign interference from destabilising what we have. We must keep in mind to pursue what is best for Singapore. As Minister Vivian aptly said in a CNA interview, there is a big difference between “being useful” and “being made use of”."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01465,2021-10-04-T-023,1465,Sharael Taha,"We are not isolated from the impact of foreign interferences, as Minister Shanmugam had mentioned earlier. With the rise of technology and even more ubiquitous use of social media, these interferences are expected to be more frequent and more sophisticated and they will attempt to sway public opinions and even destabilize the precious balance that we have so carefully cultivated."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01466,2021-10-04-T-023,1466,Sharael Taha,"I understand that there are some reservations to this Bill. However, let me just point out that such legislation to ensure non-interference by foreign agents are currently already in place in countries such as Australia, EU, US and Canada. They have laws to prevent, detect and disrupt foreign interferences conducted through hostile information campaigns and the use of local proxies in their domestic politics. For example, in June 2018, Australia passed laws targeting foreign interference in politics and other domestic affairs and the European Commission is proposing a new Digital Services Act which will, among other things, regulate online platforms by transposing what is already illegal offline to the online space."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01467,2021-10-04-T-023,1467,Sharael Taha,These examples serve to illustrate the fact that it is only expected that states will have to protect their self-interests and prevent foreign intervention especially when its intention is to harvest protest potential.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01468,2021-10-04-T-023,1468,Sharael Taha,"Notwitstanding the above, I wanted to share a concern which was addressed by the Minister in his speech earlier. One concern was from foreign businesses and Singaporeans working in MNCs on whether discussions between a Singaporean and non-Singaporean individual on policies which may affect their business may be seen as foreign interference and captured within the scope of the Bill especially if it is done on an online platform."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01469,2021-10-04-T-023,1469,Sharael Taha,"This has been of particular concern, especially in light of the current labour crunch causing delays and pushing up the cost of doing business. This labour crunch is brought about by border restrictions, the lack of access to foreign labour and the perceived increasingly anti-foreigner sentiments exacerbated by the current COVID-19 environment. Rightfully, foreign businesses and MNCs are concerned that such discussions on the impact of our policies on their businesses may run them foul of the law. I am glad to hear that Minister has reiterated that discussions of this nature does not meet the threshold to be foul of the law. Mr Speaker, in Malay, please."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01470,2021-10-04-T-023,1470,Sharael Taha,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] The Select Committee on Online Falsehoods was established three years ago and comprises Members of Parliament from both sides of the House. After considering 169 written representations and oral evidence from 65 individuals and organisations, it has concluded that the spread of online falsehoods is a ""real and serious problem"" in Singapore. The Select Committee was also presented with evidence that information operations sponsored by foreign countries were carried out against Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01471,2021-10-04-T-023,1471,Sharael Taha,"Since 2018, the threat of foreign interference has been discussed repeatedly in this Chamber and in online media and publications. It is time that our laws deal with the threat of foreign interference which is increasingly threatening our national security."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01472,2021-10-04-T-023,1472,Sharael Taha,"There are other factors that make it important for this law to be implemented. A survey by the Institute of Policy Studies, or IPS, found that our digital literacy rate was low, with two-thirds of respondents believing in a manipulated article. Imagine, two-thirds of respondents inadvertently believed an article that was manipulated by the study! And imagine if article is manipulated by those who seek to divide our society. We should and must overcome such online falsehoods, especially when it is done through foreign interference."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01473,2021-10-04-T-023,1473,Sharael Taha,"The spread of online falsehoods through foreign interference is a real and growing problem around the world. One of the ways it is done is by using fake social media accounts to influence and divide a harmonious society by using sensitive matters such as racial and religious issues. In one case in the United States, an organisation from a foreign state used fake accounts that promote Islamic objectives, as well as fake accounts that spread anti-Islam messages, in order to start a protest against the building of an Islamic library – at the same time and place! This prompted many Americans to attend the protest with one protester reportedly carrying a gun."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01474,2021-10-04-T-023,1474,Sharael Taha,"In Singapore, we are not immune from the impact of foreign country intervention. For example, in 2018 and 2019, amidst disputes with neighbouring countries over airspace and maritime issues, online comments on social media were found to be made by anonymous accounts aimed at creating fake opposition against Singapore's stance."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01475,2021-10-04-T-023,1475,Sharael Taha,"As we strive to improve the law to address this problem, we should also realise that we can play a role as Singapore citizens. We must be more careful and sceptical of what we read on social media including the comments and we must not be easily influenced that is not based on truth; especially on sensitive issues which are more easily manipulated to heighten racial discord. We should check the source of information so that we can get the accurate information."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01476,2021-10-04-T-023,1476,Sharael Taha,"If in doubt, we should not share the messages in case we spread the wrong information. Therefore, this law is an important step that should be taken to protect our national interests and also protect ourselves from being used by those with nefarious intentions."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01477,2021-10-04-T-023,1477,Sharael Taha,"(In English)  In summary, Mr Speaker, Sir, since 2018, the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehood provided 22 recommendations, which included implementing specific countermeasures to combat state-sponsored disinformation operations."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01478,2021-10-04-T-023,1478,Sharael Taha,We have sensitive issues like race and religion which can be easily manipulated by foreign actors to fracture our social cohesion.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01479,2021-10-04-T-023,1479,Sharael Taha,"Our status as an open economy attracting investments globally implies that we must balance the needs of all stakeholders while putting forward our national interest. We need to enact strong safeguards to protect our national sovereignty and security, protect our social cohesion and protect our democratic institutions."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01480,2021-10-04-T-023,1480,Sharael Taha,"As we chart the path for Singapore forward, we need to have open conversations, open conversations with all Singaporeans but protected from foreign interferences which may not be in the best interest of Singapore. As such, Mr Speaker, Sir, this is an important step to take. I support the Bill."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01481,2021-10-04-T-023,1481,Speaker,Mr Liang Eng Hwa.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01482,2021-10-04-T-023,1482,Liang Eng Hwa,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I will speak from the businesses' perspective. As a sovereign country, we must always ensure that there is no foreign interference in our politics and in our political process, whatever the intentions. As citizens of this land, we are solely and ultimately responsible for the governance and the future of this country, and we live with whatever the political outcomes and its consequences."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01483,2021-10-04-T-023,1483,Liang Eng Hwa,"In an increasingly digitised world and given Singapore's global interconnectedness, it is necessary to update our laws from time to time to deal with the new threats that may infiltrate our shores and destabilise or divide us. Many countries like the US, Australia, New Zealand, Germany and India have done so in various forms in recent years and so must we."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01484,2021-10-04-T-023,1484,Liang Eng Hwa,"Sir, the business community can understand why the Government needs to institute new safeguards against foreign interference and to jealously defend our political sovereignty."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01485,2021-10-04-T-023,1485,Liang Eng Hwa,"As key stakeholders in the economy and society, it is in the businesses' interest to see political and social stability in the country and that the democratic processes are carry out in an orderly, transparent and legitimate manner."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01486,2021-10-04-T-023,1486,Liang Eng Hwa,"While the intent and purposes of FICA is clear, there are some who still felt that this Bill could make Singapore seem less welcoming of others."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01487,2021-10-04-T-023,1487,Liang Eng Hwa,"In a Business Times article on 1 October titled ""FICA could affect perceptions of Singapore as global hub"", it raised a number of concerns."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01488,2021-10-04-T-023,1488,Liang Eng Hwa,"Firstly, among others, the article cited a hypothetical example of an international pharmaceutical company funding Singapore-based academic research on a drug that may be caught as ""influence(s) or seek(s) to influence Singapore Government's decision"" under section 8(c) of FICA."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01489,2021-10-04-T-023,1489,Liang Eng Hwa,"The article also questioned a situation in which a multinational company's (MNC) employee is vocal about Singapore politics and policy, whether that would be construed as undertaking on behalf of the MNC and hence will come under the ambit of FICA."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01490,2021-10-04-T-023,1490,Liang Eng Hwa,"Thirdly, the article also mentioned that FICA ""is designed such that there will be little opportunity for the Courts to interpret and define the scope of its provisions"", unlike the Common Law."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01491,2021-10-04-T-023,1491,Liang Eng Hwa,"Can I ask the Minister if he could address those issues raised and whether there is a basis to be concerned that FICA could impact our status as a global hub? Sir, in Mandarin."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01492,2021-10-04-T-023,1492,Liang Eng Hwa,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Speaker, having heard the speeches of several Members of Parliament, my overall feeling is that we have one key consensus on this Bill, and that is  we do not want external forces to interfere with our internal affairs and weaken our sovereignty as an independent country. Our own affairs should be resolved by ourselves and there is no need for foreign political forces to interfere. Some of them may even harbour ill intentions."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01493,2021-10-04-T-023,1493,Liang Eng Hwa,"Singapore is not the first country to put in place a preventative mechanism to prevent foreign interference. Many countries such as the US, Australia, India and Israel have different types of legal and administrative means to deter foreign interference."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01494,2021-10-04-T-023,1494,Liang Eng Hwa,"In the recent US elections, we have seen from media reports of alleged foreign interference during the elections. During the 2018 Yellow Vest movement in France, the French government was also aware of the presence of clandestine foreign interference that exploited existing social conflicts to stir up public resentment and incite riots. During the 2019 unrest in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government repeatedly mentioned that the demonstrators had received funding from foreign organisations."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01495,2021-10-04-T-023,1495,Liang Eng Hwa,"Mr Speaker, the business community recognises the need for Singapore to introduce FICA and understands that this Bill is not targeted at any country."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01496,2021-10-04-T-023,1496,Liang Eng Hwa,"Of course, the business community also hopes that Singapore's economy and society, as well as the democratic process can develop steadily, and that our society will operate according to the rule of law and public opinions, and not be influenced by external forces."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01497,2021-10-04-T-023,1497,Liang Eng Hwa,"However, some business, especially those that often do business overseas, still have concerns about this Bill."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01498,2021-10-04-T-023,1498,Liang Eng Hwa,"Singapore is a small island state, lacking a large and high growth domestic market. Hence, our economic development strategy must be open and connected to the world. It is only natural for local companies to seek business and growth opportunities through internationalisation and cross-border operations."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01499,2021-10-04-T-023,1499,Liang Eng Hwa,"Singapore companies that do business overseas will inevitably have dealings with organisations that are connected to the local Government or semi-Government organisations. Sometimes, they may also have exchanges with these local entities in cultural, educational or ancestral matters."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01500,2021-10-04-T-023,1500,Liang Eng Hwa,"Some of these companies support various exchanges between the two countries in the form of sponsorship, charity or donations. For example, at anniversary celebrations, trade associations or clan associations may receive congratulatory support from foreign organisations or receive goods, sponsorships and donations according to etiquette."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01501,2021-10-04-T-023,1501,Liang Eng Hwa,Not all businesses are familiar with the intricacies of FICA. Some are concerned that they may inadvertently be caught under the new law.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01502,2021-10-04-T-023,1502,Liang Eng Hwa,"We all know that in the eyes of law, ignorance does not mean you are not guilty. Hence, they are worried that their past interactions and future engagement with overseas organisations might cause them or their company to be listed as being politically influenced."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01503,2021-10-04-T-023,1503,Liang Eng Hwa,"I hope that the Minister can give a more detailed and simpler explanation of the coverage of this Bill, what is allowed and not allowed. It is best to illustrate with situations that we often encounter, for example, how the authority designates individuals or organisations as ""politically significant persons/entities"". This will require MHA's further clarifications. Given that the conditions in different countries are different, will there be room for flexibility under the Bill?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01504,2021-10-04-T-023,1504,Liang Eng Hwa,"Will the Government set up a consultative mechanism to allow companies to discuss and communicate with relevant authorities so that the business community can better understand the purpose of the Bill? In this respect, I feel that if trade associations can participate more in the communication, the objective of the Bill can be better achieved."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01505,2021-10-04-T-023,1505,Liang Eng Hwa,"Lastly, I would like to ask the Minister for his view on the medals, honorary degrees and awards conferred to Singapore businessmen by overseas governments."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01506,2021-10-04-T-023,1506,Liang Eng Hwa,"Businesses in overseas markets often have to follow local customs and contribute in many ways to the local community and society. These acts of kindness are sometimes recognised by the local government. Some Singaporean businessmen or enterprises will also receive awards or medals from the local government. Here, I would like to seek clarification on these matters too."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01507,2021-10-04-T-023,1507,Liang Eng Hwa,"(In English)  Sir, notwithstanding the points above, I support the Bill."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01508,2021-10-04-T-023,1508,Speaker,Minister Shanmugam.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01509,2021-10-04-T-023,1509,K Shanmugam,"Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Members for their questions."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01510,2021-10-04-T-023,1510,K Shanmugam,"I will first address some of the points made by Members of the Workers' Party. Mr Pritam Singh spoke about the need for engagement and responding to feedback, but it appears to me that the Workers' Party has really not substantively engaged with anything that I have said."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01511,2021-10-04-T-023,1511,K Shanmugam,We studied their proposals. I explained in detail in my opening speech where we agreed and also where we disagreed and why. I replied on many of the points and why some of the proposed amendments will not work.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01512,2021-10-04-T-023,1512,K Shanmugam,Mr Pritam Singh cites the jurist Albert Dicey to remind us of the doctrine of separation of powers and that the rule of law requires a system of checks and balances on the exercise of executive power. He also referred to the concepts that were recently affirmed by the Court of Appeal in Nagaenthran a/l Dharmalingam.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01513,2021-10-04-T-023,1513,K Shanmugam,"Sir, I can tell him, and Members know, these principles are fundamental to us. These are the principles that underpin much of our success. I said in my speech, the starting point is that the rule of law is fundamental to our existence and our well-being as a country."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01514,2021-10-04-T-023,1514,K Shanmugam,And that is shown in our consistently high rankings on law and order indices and our good international standing.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01515,2021-10-04-T-023,1515,K Shanmugam,It is also fundamental to ensure that we have good investments; low unemployment; healthy economy.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01516,2021-10-04-T-023,1516,K Shanmugam,"But as I also have explained, we have never taken an absolutist approach. And if you take a dogmatic absolutist approach, it will not work for us and it is not working for many other countries."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01517,2021-10-04-T-023,1517,K Shanmugam,"Rhetoric alone does not solve problems. You can come to this House and have soaring rhetoric. Rhetoric has not solved the Gitmo problem of the United States. President Obama said, ""The choice between liberty and freedom or security. Liberty and security is a false choice"". Did he close down Gitmo? Why is it that we continue to be colonised in our minds that there is only one way of doing things properly?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01518,2021-10-04-T-023,1518,K Shanmugam,"I said what is the answer to the problems we have – practical answers, not just rhetoric. I said we need to see how checks need to be made suitable for the context and the risks we face. I have not heard any answer."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01519,2021-10-04-T-023,1519,K Shanmugam,I said how are you going to deal with the risks of leaks in open Court hearings or in-camera? No answer. I would say not a squeak.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01520,2021-10-04-T-023,1520,K Shanmugam,What are the objections to the Tribunal chaired by a High Court Judge? No real answer.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01521,2021-10-04-T-023,1521,K Shanmugam,"So, what we had was not a debate because we are not dealing with these points. Parliament is not just a forum for reading out speeches with an intent of putting it out in social media eventually. We need to engage on the issues."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01522,2021-10-04-T-023,1522,K Shanmugam,What are the powers? What are the risks? How are the risks being dealt with in the context of the overall legal landscape?
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01523,2021-10-04-T-023,1523,K Shanmugam,"So, listening to Mr Singh and Ms He, does that mean that they also suggest we do away with the ISA, the CLTPA, the Land Acquisition Act and various other pieces of legislation?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01524,2021-10-04-T-023,1524,K Shanmugam,"Or do they accept that these are needed? And, if so, why do they say we should not deal with the issues relating or covered by FICA, some part of it, through a Tribunal, given the National Security considerations? The answer may be yes. The answer may be no. But we need to engage. What are the reasons?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01525,2021-10-04-T-023,1525,K Shanmugam,Is it the Workers' Party's position that all these tribunals established under all these laws that Parliament has approved should be abolished because it offends the principles of separation of powers and the rule of law?
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01526,2021-10-04-T-023,1526,K Shanmugam,"We accept separation of powers. If we did not and if we did not have the rule of law in Singapore, I would not be here, Mr Singh would not be here, this Chamber would not look this and Singapore would not be like this. In fact, none of you would be here."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01527,2021-10-04-T-023,1527,K Shanmugam,The reason we are all here is because this is a country run according to the principles of rule of law. We do not mind listening to lectures on rule of law but we subscribe to them too. But we also deal with real problems.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01528,2021-10-04-T-023,1528,K Shanmugam,"If the Workers' Party’s position is taken to its extreme, as I have said, we would have to do away with the CLTPA, the ISA, the MRHA and the Land Acquisition Act. All the laws that have worked well for us."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01529,2021-10-04-T-023,1529,K Shanmugam,"We would have to subject all our laws to judicial review. Will that alone work for us? In matters of national security, immigration, religious harmony? What is the position? So, it is not a reflexive answer each time there is a problem to say that there is only one solution. The point is, as I have said, what is the problem? Identify it. What is the best solution for this particular problem? How do you make sure that the Government is given sufficient powers and how do you make sure that there are checks and balances? So, there are the risks, and the checks and balances. In the end, what is workable?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01530,2021-10-04-T-023,1530,K Shanmugam,"Why are countries in Western Europe, the United States being opened up by foreign adversaries? All the evidences that we have seen in our list. Why is it that they are so open to foreign attacks? Is it because they do not have the technology?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01531,2021-10-04-T-023,1531,K Shanmugam,There is such thing called political will and political courage and there will have to be a recognition that judicial process will not be appropriate.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01532,2021-10-04-T-023,1532,K Shanmugam,"So, Parliament is not just a place where you come and because you see that there are some people who are saying certain things, you resort to rhetoric without offering real suggestions. It requires some courage to say this is a problem and we will deal with it. This is the way we will deal with it and offer solutions. Alternate solutions."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01533,2021-10-04-T-023,1533,K Shanmugam,"And in so far as I have seen, the solutions  I have explained why the High Court process, open court process does not work, and I have heard nothing in response."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01534,2021-10-04-T-023,1534,K Shanmugam,A judicial process will not be appropriate in matters where we rely heavily on sensitive intelligence and collaboration with foreign counterparts. Many things cannot be publicly disclosed.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01535,2021-10-04-T-023,1535,K Shanmugam,"The Courts themselves, have recognised their limitations in such matters. In Chng Suan Tze, the Court of Appeal recognised that where a decision – say the ISA detention – was based on national security concerns, judicial review of that decision would be precluded."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01536,2021-10-04-T-023,1536,K Shanmugam,"The Court acknowledged that what national security requires has to be left to those responsible for national security, that would be the Executive. And in such situations, we have found alternative ways of providing for checks and balances with the view that we must maintain accountability."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01537,2021-10-04-T-023,1537,K Shanmugam,Mr Perera asked who checks the checkers? What happens if the Prime Minister or the Minister for Home Affairs are suborned?
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01538,2021-10-04-T-023,1538,K Shanmugam,"Well, what happens in any other country if a prime minister or minister for home affairs or any other minister is suborned? Do the Courts intervene? In the case of the US, have we seen the United States Supreme Court intervene?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01539,2021-10-04-T-023,1539,K Shanmugam,The ultimate check are the people. But do you expect the people as a collective body to deal with day-to-day problems of foreign interference? That is why we are elected and we are in Parliament here to debate what is the best way possible for the people.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01540,2021-10-04-T-023,1540,K Shanmugam,"We talk about consultation. We have had consultations for three years now. Mr Singh read out an answer given by Second Minister Josephine. Yes, she said we will consult. We have to bring people in, and this is what we have been doing from the Select Committee hearing. For three years we have been doing that  conferences, Select Committee hearings for over eight days, if I recall rightly, discussions in Parliament, speeches, extensive discussions."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01541,2021-10-04-T-023,1541,K Shanmugam,"So, we agree entirely on the principles. In fact, if this Government had not stuck to those principles, fundamentally, and had not recognised that that is the foundation of our existence – rule of law, separation of powers, doing things according to the law – we would not be here. Not just the PAP. PAP would have been long out of power but Singapore would not be here."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01542,2021-10-04-T-023,1542,K Shanmugam,"So, yes, Executive powers must be subject to checks and balances. The question is in what form and that depends on what is appropriate for the situation. When the Courts are not suitable, we have introduced other types of bodies or tribunals with statutory imposed safeguards. The further safeguards here, like requiring a Supreme Court Judge to consider the matter."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01543,2021-10-04-T-023,1543,K Shanmugam,"I have taken this House through various pieces of legislation, where we have vested powers in tribunals as an alternate to the Courts as a form of check and balance."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01544,2021-10-04-T-023,1544,K Shanmugam,And we also have a series of cases where ouster clauses have been upheld by the Courts. These relate to areas which are traditionally regarded as non-justiciable. National security and foreign relations are classic areas.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01545,2021-10-04-T-023,1545,K Shanmugam,Ms He Ting Ru made some points on the Tribunal  the scope of what they can review and their independence.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01546,2021-10-04-T-023,1546,K Shanmugam,"First, on the scope of its review. She seems to be under the mistaken impression that the Tribunal’s remit is narrow. That is incorrect. The Tribunal can consider any appeal brought against a Part 3 Direction and there can be a review of the merits of the decision. It is not confined to procedural compliance or legality. And the Tribunal, chaired by a Supreme Court Judge, will look at sensitive intelligence and information."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01547,2021-10-04-T-023,1547,K Shanmugam,"Mr Perera, I think, called it the Government-appointed Committee. I mean, again, rhetoric. Let us please not insult our High Court Judges. Please. And this Tribunal has powers to overrule the Minister’s decision."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01548,2021-10-04-T-023,1548,K Shanmugam,"The Tribunal has been, as I said, expressly vested with the powers to override the Minister's decision and it is useful to point out clause 95(2) of the Bill insulates the members of the Reviewing Tribunal from pressure and states very clearly that the Minister cannot reduce the salary and terms of office once they are appointed by the President."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01549,2021-10-04-T-023,1549,K Shanmugam,"Mr Singh pointed out that under clause 99(2)(b), the Tribunal will be able to consider a matter, without the appellant being given full particulars of the conduct which is the subject to the appeal. He talked about natural justice. I accept. But I also explained why sometimes we cannot give the full evidence. I said that in my opening speech which Mr Singh did not refer to at all. There might be times when the evidence would have to be given to the Tribunal for it to look at and decide for itself whether it makes sense to make the orders and it is proportionate to the kind of orders that can be made. We are not talking about the liberty of the individual. Also, clause 99(2)(f) allows the Tribunal to give a summary of any evidence to the appellant."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01550,2021-10-04-T-023,1550,K Shanmugam,Mr Singh highlighted the importance of education about foreign interference and its dangers. We agree with that. I have explained that FICA is part of a comprehensive strategy to deal with foreign interference. Powers under FICA are only part of the picture and I have said that it is a calibrated piece of legislation to allow us to act surgically against threats.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01551,2021-10-04-T-023,1551,K Shanmugam,"Besides legislation, we have been and will continue to strengthen other defences – detection and response capabilities, Singaporeans’ ability to discern legitimate and artificial online discourse, though that is going to be very difficult, to counter the threat of foreign interference."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01552,2021-10-04-T-023,1552,K Shanmugam,"Our security agencies do their best. On public education, the Government has introduced various programmes."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01553,2021-10-04-T-023,1553,K Shanmugam,Let me give some examples. The Digital Media and Information Literacy Framework was launched by MCI in 2019. It educates the public on using information responsibly and the risks and benefits of technology.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01554,2021-10-04-T-023,1554,K Shanmugam,"The Source, Understand, Research, Evaluate Programme by the NLB educates the public to be responsible producers and consumers of information."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01555,2021-10-04-T-023,1555,K Shanmugam,The Media Literacy Council also runs programmes to promote responsible online behaviour.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01556,2021-10-04-T-023,1556,K Shanmugam,"And we have had extensive communications efforts over the past three years, which I have detailed. We will continue our efforts. But Government cannot do this alone."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01557,2021-10-04-T-023,1557,K Shanmugam,"Mr Giam is right that a whole-of-society effort is required for public education. So, we will welcome everyone's assistance in helping to engage and educate the population."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01558,2021-10-04-T-023,1558,K Shanmugam,"But these efforts have to be complemented with laws, which is the focus of FICA."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01559,2021-10-04-T-023,1559,K Shanmugam,"At the same time, this is something that has been considered at length for at least three years. We have engaged the media to put out examples to increase awareness of the threats happening around us. For example, in CNA and others."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01560,2021-10-04-T-023,1560,K Shanmugam,"We have also engaged various stakeholders since 2019 and their feedback had been incorporated into conceptualising the Bill  Internet companies – over a period since 2019 and senior lawyers, academics, security experts, students – many of them were closed-door discussions; some were open Panel discussions. So, it has been going on for three years which is what Minister Josephine Teo mentioned."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01561,2021-10-04-T-023,1561,K Shanmugam,"I think, perhaps, Mr Singh misunderstood that to mean that it will be post whatever she said some months ago. What she meant was during this entire period."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01562,2021-10-04-T-023,1562,K Shanmugam,"Local academics have also written various commentaries and these were published online. Some of them were mentioned in Annex F which was distributed earlier. Articles have been published, written by security experts from RSIS."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01563,2021-10-04-T-023,1563,K Shanmugam,"Moving on to foreigners who comment on Singapore politics and whether they are liable. Mr Perera mentioned someone. Again, I think he either missed it or was not listening to my speech, I dealt with it in my opening speech. A foreign commentator putting out his name and commenting is unlikely to be called ""covert"" per se. Depends on the facts and I said this arose from something that Assoc Prof Jamus Lim had put out in the context of his amendments. So, I addressed it."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01564,2021-10-04-T-023,1564,K Shanmugam,"If a foreigner puts his name, writes articles, people can assess for themselves what is the weight to be attached. It probably will not come within the proportionality test. But depending on the facts, there is some covert action, some other factors, or the intensity or the nature of the matter, there are a variety of factors to be considered."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01565,2021-10-04-T-023,1565,K Shanmugam,"For those who have pointed out that the Bill is 249 pages long; in the interest of accuracy, it is 189 pages long. The other 60 pages are the Explanatory Statement which is to help Members and Members will know more than half it, as I said, is based on the Political Donations Act (PDA)."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01566,2021-10-04-T-023,1566,K Shanmugam,"Now, I will go on to the points made by other Members that I have not touched on."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01567,2021-10-04-T-023,1567,K Shanmugam,"Members brought up questions and suggestions in five main areas. First, the impetus for FICA. Second, the scope of the Bill and its application. Third, on the rules for the Tribunal. Fourth, the implementation of the Bill. Finally, specific clarifications to clauses of the Bill. I will deal with these issues."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01568,2021-10-04-T-023,1568,K Shanmugam,"Mr Leong Mun Wai asked why is FICA necessary when we already have extensive powers and substantial resources to deal with foreign interference. I have, in my speech, pointed out how the Internet has opened an entirely new front for hostile action. Information forces are seen as a fourth branch of armed service. This Bill is about updating our powers to ensure that they are fit for the Internet age. Given the threats, we think there is a clear and present danger that justifies us acting now."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01569,2021-10-04-T-023,1569,K Shanmugam,"Assoc Prof Jamus Lim asked how MHA came to the conclusion that Singapore was being attacked in 2018 when Facebook’s assessment was that there had been no cases of foreign influence operations targeting Singapore since 2017. We do not know how Facebook makes its assessment and whether it depends only on Facebook. We look at the wide variety of communication tools. Based on the information we have available to us, we reached a different conclusion. And I would say to Assoc Prof Lim, matters of our national security should not be outsourced to private companies and they should not be made to decide what our fate ought to be."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01570,2021-10-04-T-023,1570,K Shanmugam,"Dr Tan Yia Swam and Dr Shahirah made the point that there are extensive powers given to the Minister and that provisions are not clearly defined. Mr Xie Yao Quan asked that we explain the targets of the Bill and how the law will be applied, especially with regard to young people. Various Members, several Members have asked if FICA would affect various types of foreign interactions with academics, businesses, NGOs, clan associations, whether there will be a chilling effect on freedom of speech."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01571,2021-10-04-T-023,1571,K Shanmugam,"The short answer really is no. I mentioned this in my speech earlier; I will just summarise. FICA will not stop individuals, businesses and organisations in Singapore from building overseas partnerships, soliciting overseas business, networking with foreigners, sourcing for donations, discussing government policies or political matters that affect their businesses with foreign colleagues or business partners or supporting charities. As long as these are done in an open and transparent manner and not part of an attempt to manipulate our political discourse or undermine public interest such as security."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01572,2021-10-04-T-023,1572,K Shanmugam,It will also not cover Singaporeans expressing their own views. It goes without saying Singaporeans have every right to speak up on our domestic politics. They are also free to engage in advocacy. That is not touched by FICA.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01573,2021-10-04-T-023,1573,K Shanmugam,Mr Louis Ng and Mr Zhulkarnain asked how the Government decides what is covert or deceptive. It is an assessment that has to depend on many factors. No different from many of the other things that the Government does.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01574,2021-10-04-T-023,1574,K Shanmugam,"Primarily, we have to examine the behaviour of the actor involved. Indicators of covert or deceptive behaviour will include attempts to mask their tracks, misrepresent their identity, attempting to launder their narratives by having them amplified by sympathetic or unwitting locals. And these can never be exhaustive. Tactics will continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, and I even attempted to set out the full list of tactics or factors that might be used or need to be considered."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01575,2021-10-04-T-023,1575,K Shanmugam,"In response to Mr Zhulkarnain and Mr Perera's questions on the use of encrypted messages, VPNs and so on, use of such services is common. The fact that communications is private, on its own, would not make it hidden or covert. The use of such messages or VPN to intentionally avoid detection could be a factor in an assessment but it really must be taken into account with all the other facts and circumstances and the legal requirements set out in the law including proportionality."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01576,2021-10-04-T-023,1576,K Shanmugam,"Mr Zhulkarnain asked in relation to the offences in clauses 17 and 18, why we should allow an individual to ""get away” if there is no covert or deceptive behaviour."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01577,2021-10-04-T-023,1577,K Shanmugam,"I had previously said that this Bill was calibrated, and this is one example of how. There is a line, a fine one, between a campaign to persuade and a campaign to manipulate. When campaigning is done openly, Singaporeans know who the content is from. They are able to make up their own minds and are free to agree, disagree, depending on whether they are persuaded. So, in our view, that should not be criminalised. But separately, directions can be given against a foreign party, depending on whether the thresholds have been crossed, which I explained earlier."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01578,2021-10-04-T-023,1578,K Shanmugam,"Mr Leong Mun Wai said someone can be arrested, no reasons given, and if the evidence is offered later, the Government is not entitled, or not obliged to reveal a source. So, you can be detained, trialed in absence, and there is no judicial review for all the actions taken against you"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01579,2021-10-04-T-023,1579,K Shanmugam,"Now, this one, of all the things that have been said today, this one takes the cake. I do not know if he has read the Bill. Or if he has read it, I do not know if he has understood it, because I think we are talking about two different Bills. All of these statements are completely untrue, so I do not know what Mr Leong has read. I will ask him to read the Bill carefully and also ask him to make some preparation before he comes to Parliament and also listen to what is going on in Parliament, including the Minister's speech."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01580,2021-10-04-T-023,1580,K Shanmugam,"In the Bill, the powers of arrest relate to specific offences which need to be proven in Court like any other offence, and proven beyond reasonable doubt. Those will be prosecuted in open court. I specifically said so in my speech. There is no detention without trial in this Bill. So, to suggest that someone can be detained, trialed in absence, no judicial review? All of that is utter nonsense. I do not know where he got these ideas from. It brings to mind another debate we had a few weeks ago, but this one goes further."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01581,2021-10-04-T-023,1581,K Shanmugam,"So, we are talking about, I think, completely different things. I can tell Mr Leong, there is no power for detention without trial in this Bill. There is the power to give some directions, so perhaps that might help him change his mind on the Bill now that we know that he has been talking about some other Bill."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01582,2021-10-04-T-023,1582,K Shanmugam,"These clarifications also address Assoc Prof Jamus Lim’s concerns on whether we will charge those who were duped into committing harmful activities. In such circumstances, the elements of an offence would not be made out. There would be no basis for any criminal action."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01583,2021-10-04-T-023,1583,K Shanmugam,"Now, we come to the Tribunal. The question really is what kind of powers are needed and how we make the processes work. Mr Murali Pillai and Mr Louis Ng asked how do we select and appoint members of the Tribunal and the rules that will be set out, including whether the Tribunal will provide written reasons for their decisions."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01584,2021-10-04-T-023,1584,K Shanmugam,"Mr Zhulkarnain asked if there are safeguards to ensure that the Tribunal does not disclose information they have access to during the proceedings. The Reviewing Tribunal will be a standing Tribunal. There will be a few discrete and fixed panels set up, members will be selected for their areas of expertise, they will have to undergo security vetting because they will be receiving highly classified and highly confidential information. They must be people with experience and standing, just like any other tribunals or independent committee, like the ISA Advisory Board. Members will be given the same protection and privileges as a Supreme Court Judge and they must protect secret information, under the Official Secrets Act."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01585,2021-10-04-T-023,1585,K Shanmugam,"Mr Pillai raised the concern on separation of powers and suggested consulting Chief Justice for the appointment of the Chairperson rather than for the Cabinet to advise the President. While it is not written in law, that is the way Supreme Court Judges are appointed to panels. We consult the Chief Justice and he suggests some names. I have spoken to the Chief Justice to suggest some names."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01586,2021-10-04-T-023,1586,K Shanmugam,We will work out the specific rules for the Tribunal in the coming months as subsidiary legislation. These rules will be public. Some broad principles  (a) the Government will have to present the evidence to convince the Tribunal; (b) Tribunal will have powers to call witnesses and compel the production of documents; (c) information will be disclosed to the appellant to the extent that it is not sensitive from a national security perspective; (d) the Tribunal can take an inquisitorial approach when the information cannot be given to the appellant and (e) the Tribunal will decide whether to uphold or overturn directions.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01587,2021-10-04-T-023,1587,K Shanmugam,"Mr Zhulkarnian asked about the expeditious proceedings of the Tribunal. The Tribunal can consolidate and hear similar appeals as a single case, or they can take one case as a reference point that will apply to other similar cases. They can also dismiss frivolous or vexatious appeals."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01588,2021-10-04-T-023,1588,K Shanmugam,Rules of the Tribunal will be set out in subsidiary legislation and the key features drawn from reviewing bodies in other laws.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01589,2021-10-04-T-023,1589,K Shanmugam,"Mr Pillai asked why is the Minister, and not a reviewing tribunal, the appealing authority for PSP decisions, and why there is no requirement, similar to the Tribunal, for the Minister to review the appeal expeditiously. I think Mr Perera may have raised the same question."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01590,2021-10-04-T-023,1590,K Shanmugam,The level of authorisation required for various powers is calibrated based on the impact of the directions and countermeasures. PSP directions are targeted in their applications and scope. They are issued to a specified individual or entity. The impact of the directives are limited to that person or entity and compared with a HIC.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01591,2021-10-04-T-023,1591,K Shanmugam,"So, the authorisations are accordingly calibrated. HIC directions authorised by the Minister and PSP designations and countermeasures by a civil servant within MHA."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01592,2021-10-04-T-023,1592,K Shanmugam,The appropriate appellate authority is therefore framed by reference to the level of authorisation and the respective direction appealable to the next level of authority.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01593,2021-10-04-T-023,1593,K Shanmugam,"Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked for more details on the process to how a Competent Authority can designate someone as a PSP, and whether businesses can take rectification measures to remove their designation as PSPs."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01594,2021-10-04-T-023,1594,K Shanmugam,The processes for designation and appeal are spelt out in clauses 47 to 49 and clauses 100 to 102 of the Bill. Operational details on the designation and appeals process are still being worked out and will be introduced in subsidiary legislation and as Regulations.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01595,2021-10-04-T-023,1595,K Shanmugam,"Being conferred with an honorary title or degree by a foreign state or University alone is unlikely to be sufficient grounds for designation as a PSP. It is not FICA's intent to stop these types of interactions and activities. But, again, we will look to see whether there is an attempt by a foreign actor to cultivate a Singaporean to undermine our national interest."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01596,2021-10-04-T-023,1596,K Shanmugam,Mr Murali Pillai asked if the appointments to the advisory committee to advise the Minister on PSP appeals will be gazetted and make public and how would the public know that the Minister is not following the advisory committee's advice. We have no issues with making the appointments public. The committee will comprise third parties to render advice to the Minister.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01597,2021-10-04-T-023,1597,K Shanmugam,"In response to Mr Louis Ng's question on whether individuals will receive written responses to explain decisions made by the competent authority on designating PSPs, this would be done as the specific activities that qualified them for designation will have a direct impact on how the controls will apply to them. For instance, a designated NGO that advocates on a variety of issues will have to report donations that it specifically receives for its activities that are directed towards a political end. The explanation will be important in setting out which are its activities of concern and those would be the donations that have to be disclosed."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01598,2021-10-04-T-023,1598,K Shanmugam,"Mr Louis Ng asked if MHA will release guidelines and illustrations that can facilitate compliance by good-faith actors. Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked if there will be engagement to help businesses navigate how FICA applies to them. Non-compliance is an offence. A recipient of a direction who fails to comply, can be prosecuted. We agree with the intent of Mr Ng's and Mr Liang's questions, there is a need to help good faith actors comply. We will continue to engage stakeholders including tech companies and Internet access service providers to understand their capabilities and constraints, identify suitable modes of compliance and we will continue to work with our stakeholders to operationalise."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01599,2021-10-04-T-023,1599,K Shanmugam,The exact mode of compliance with disclosure and declaration obligations and other requirements from counter-measures that they may be subjected to will be articulated in subsidiary legislation. But the vast majority of foreign dealings between Singaporean companies and their business counterparts will continue unchanged.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01600,2021-10-04-T-023,1600,K Shanmugam,"Mr Xie Yao Quan asked where will Part 3 directions be published and whether the reasons for actions taken under Parts 3, 4, 5 and 6 will be published. Mr Zhulkarnain suggested giving a report on the FICA offences or directions without the need to go into specific details or naming the foreign principals. Mr Darryl David suggested informing the public when there is sufficient evidence that there is foreign interference and said we should make the entity's identity and activities known so that we can take a united position against such a country."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01601,2021-10-04-T-023,1601,K Shanmugam,"We have taken the approach to not name the foreign state actors whom we suspect to be involved in these foreign attempts. There are wider national and foreign policy considerations in doing so. However, we will alert Singaporeans when such communications activity has been detected and if FICA directions were issued to block and contain such foreign interference. All Part 3 directions, except for the Technical Assistance Direction, will be published on a website accessible to the public."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01602,2021-10-04-T-023,1602,K Shanmugam,"As Mr Xie has pointed out, national security concerns may make it impracticable to publish the reasons for actions taken. Where possible, we will inform the public on the broad grounds for issuance of directions. In response to Mr Xie's question on whether appeals made and ruled under FICA would be published, we can consider, although it would depend on the facts and circumstances of the case. The more sensitive the information used, the less likely we are able to do so."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01603,2021-10-04-T-023,1603,K Shanmugam,"Mr Xie suggested making the Registry of Foreign and Political Disclosures accessible online, free of charge, in a searchable, sortable and downloadable format, to maximise its potential for public education and awareness. We will consider his suggestions."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01604,2021-10-04-T-023,1604,K Shanmugam,"Mr Zhulkarnain pointed out that it is easy for a person to deny that he is aware of the purpose of undertaking an activity and asked for the threshold in clause 16 in determining that a person has intention or belief to undertake the activity for a particular purpose. He also asked if a person would be held liable if he was not aware that he is acting on behalf of a foreign principal. The short answer is no. The Member can refer to clause 5(1)(b). The starting point is indeed we want to make it an offence to conduct or abet a HIC. But we cannot remove intentionality from the offence elements, otherwise we will end up making criminals out of Singaporeans who unknowingly aid an HIC by sharing content without knowing better. Given the sophistication of threat actors, this is more than likely."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01605,2021-10-04-T-023,1605,K Shanmugam,"A deliberate perpetrator may of course deny, which is why we need to set the offence threshold at a reasonable level, ""is or is likely to"", for example. And making out that case would be the job of our law enforcement agencies."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01606,2021-10-04-T-023,1606,K Shanmugam,"Referring to clause 49, Mr Louis Ng asked for clarification on what would not be practicable or desirable for individuals to have the opportunity to be heard. If the designated individual is a Singaporean based overseas and not planning on returning to Singapore, it may not be practical to delay his or her designation until he or she is given an opportunity to be heard."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01607,2021-10-04-T-023,1607,K Shanmugam,"Also, if we have received intelligence that a target for designation may already be compromised and counter measures are required immediately to mitigate the threat, it may not be desirable to wait for the hearing before designation."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01608,2021-10-04-T-023,1608,K Shanmugam,"Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill is intended to address a serious threat that concerns Singapore national security and sovereignty. These are important to ensure that Singaporeans continue to make our own choices on how we should govern our country and live our lives."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01609,2021-10-04-T-023,1609,K Shanmugam,"There is also the question of the Petition as I said in my Second Reading speech. Sir, I will ask that this be treated as being dealt with during this debate, so that we do not have to postpone that to some other time. Sir, with that, I beg to move."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01610,2021-10-04-T-023,1610,Speaker,Clarifications. Leader of Opposition.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01611,2021-10-04-T-023,1611,Pritam Singh,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister for closing speech. I have three clarifications."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01612,2021-10-04-T-023,1612,Pritam Singh,"I will start with the first which covers the Second Minister for Home Affairs, Minister Josephine Teo's comments at this year's Committee of Supply. Sir, I do not believe I misread that speech. Mr Christopher de Souza filed a cut, asking MHA what it would do to deter foreign interference in our domestic affairs. Minister replies, quite an extensive reply. It goes on for about a page, and right at the end, she says, ""Given the experience of other countries, we need to consider further measures"". This is post-Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods' findings, post some other seminars that have been referred to. And she says, ""We need to consider further measures to guard against foreign subversion, what levels of transparency, support, leadership are appropriate for home and the public has to play a big part in this to shape proposals and to give safeguards the strongest support"". It seems to me that it is not a misunderstanding of this but it is probably more accurate to say that, that does not seem to be an answer as to why the Bill could not be put before public consultation, like other Bills are. This is an omission for which I do not think we have heard any responses yet."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01613,2021-10-04-T-023,1613,Pritam Singh,"The second point pertains to the role of the Courts, which I think is the fundamental disagreement between the Government and the Workers' Party (WP)'s position is the oversight mechanism. I think there is scope to discuss some of the other points and I think Minister has agreed with some of our amendments but Minister referred to the case, the 1988 case of Chng Suan Tze v Minister for Home Affairs. Let me refer to it and try to capture the spirit of the WP's approaches to oversight mechanisms the way we see them vis-à-vis this Bill."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01614,2021-10-04-T-023,1614,Pritam Singh,"I refer to the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill. A debate that took place on the 25 of January 1989 and it also dealt with, the main debate also dealt with Internal Security Act (ISA) (Amendment) Bill, which sought to abolish appeal to the Privy Council in case of review of ISA cases."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01615,2021-10-04-T-023,1615,Pritam Singh,"Then, Minister K Shanmugam, as a backbencher said the following and I would start with the reference to Chng Suan Tze and Minister said, ""It will be useful to consider exactly what the Court of Appeal said. It did not say that it can itself decide whether or not the detainee posed a threat. The Court said that it can consider, within broad parameters, whether or not there was any ground at all for the detention. It will set aside the detention only if there were absolutely no grounds for the detention, that is, it takes the view that no one in his right mind could possibly have concluded that the detainee posed any threat to national security. Otherwise, it will not interfere with the Minister's decision."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01616,2021-10-04-T-023,1616,Pritam Singh,"Sir, the amendments will deny the Courts that power. This Government believes it has never abused the ISA and there is nothing to fear. The Government works on the basis that the persons in Government should be upright, moral and only do what is good for the country. Thus, the people have nothing to fear, despite the powers that the Government has. These powers will never be abused because they are so effective, they help the Government govern effectively for the greater good of all. So, that has worked."""
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01617,2021-10-04-T-023,1617,Pritam Singh,"And Minister says this, ""But can we be sure that down the road, the situation will be the same? We cannot guarantee that the future government will comprise of honourable men."" Minister then goes on, ""An argument, therefore, can be made out that there must be checks and balances within the system. The Minister in taking his decision can arguably be made to realise that if his decision is so unreasonable that one look at the facts will show that he could never have considered the detainee a threat, then his decision should be reversed by the Courts."""
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01618,2021-10-04-T-023,1618,Pritam Singh,"Insofar as FICA is concerned and as it is drafted with the limited judicial review clause, what we are taking away is precisely what the Minister was warning about in 1989. Illegality, irrationality are not grounds for judicial review consideration in this Bill, only procedural impropriety. And I was listening very carefully to the other People's Action Party (PAP) Members who spoke and I compared the speeches of those Members with the PAP Members who spoke in 1989. The Minister was not the only one who was concerned about an appeals mechanism or other appeals mechanism and that there be appropriate checks and balances. There were a few other PAP Members."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01619,2021-10-04-T-023,1619,Pritam Singh,"I am not going to go through the entire debate, but I think the point is, the WP does not understand at the very base level, why it has to be limited judicial review in this case. I think Minister gave some reasons and the Minister referred to leaks – that there could be leaks in the system, when you go to Court. Sir, I do not mean to just facetiously give a counter response, but there could be leaks in the reviewing tribunal as well."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01620,2021-10-04-T-023,1620,Pritam Singh,"So, that question, I think if you ask me on balance, should a Court at least look into and review the decision of the Minister? Should judicial review be allowed to be captured in its entirety by a Court of Law? I think the answer is yes and that is a fundamental difference. Notwithstanding this, Minister makes the point about national security and so forth, which is why the Workers' Party Members have proposed potential in-camera hearings and files can be sealed after that as well."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01621,2021-10-04-T-023,1621,Pritam Singh,"My third clarification, Sir, is a bit more specific and this pertains to designated PSPs. I am not sure it is appropriate for me to direct this question at Minister because it would probably be more appropriately directed at the other office holders in MHA who spoke on the Bill and this is with regard to designated PSPs. I will give an example, a hypothetical."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01622,2021-10-04-T-023,1622,Pritam Singh,"Let us assume there is a cause-based, a single cause-based NGO in Singapore. Their cause is, they are very aghast at the idea of foreign workers being transported at the back of hard-top lorries. This is their single cause, they are all Singapore members and they regularly write to their Members of Parliament and encourage their Members of Parliament to bring this issue up in Parliament. Let us assume this NGO receives foreign funding. It receives foreign funding from another International Organisation, whose main object is that they seek to ensure and uphold the human rights of foreign workers all over the world. They are prepared to extend funding to anyone."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01623,2021-10-04-T-023,1623,Pritam Singh,"Now, one reading of FICA, by virtue of a clause 8(f) and (g) and even (e) perhaps, will suggest that, this Singapore NGO could be classified as a Politically Significant Entity (PSE). My question is, will such a PSE be barred at the first instance, at the baseline, from continuing to accept foreign funding. That means will the Competent Authority say, ""No, sorry, you cannot receive this funding."" Because, I know under stepped-up countermeasures, you can do that."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01624,2021-10-04-T-023,1624,Pritam Singh,"At the baseline, I believe it says you cannot accept impermissible donations. I believe the Bill in clause 55 tells you what a permissible donor is. Are we to read that in the opposite, as in everybody who is out of that range is an impermissible donor?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01625,2021-10-04-T-023,1625,Pritam Singh,"Because this has knock-on implications for other arguments that the Government and other Members of Parliament have made. If you work with climate activists, for example, there is an international solidarity movement on certain issues. How will this be addressed and considered by FICA?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01626,2021-10-04-T-023,1626,Pritam Singh,"This, I hope explains Mr Gerald Giam's amendments for clause 8(f) and (g), as to how do we balance this exercise. Because if you compare clause 8(a) to (e), there is a very clear target – legislature, presidential counsels, trying to change the laws – but the last two limbs are far more broad and that also explains why the Workers' Party proposed additional oversight arrangements."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01627,2021-10-04-T-023,1627,K Shanmugam,"Mr Speaker, I will deal with the first two points and one of my colleagues will deal with this last point on NGOs and designations."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01628,2021-10-04-T-023,1628,K Shanmugam,"On what the Second Minister said, I thought I was quite clear. What she was saying and this is an answer I myself looked at, previously. We have seen the experiences of other countries. We have to consider what further measures are necessary. For example, what levels of transparency in funding, support and leadership and for whom? The public has a big part in this to shape the proposals on these further measures to give the eventual safeguards their strongest support."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01629,2021-10-04-T-023,1629,K Shanmugam,"What does that relate to? What have we been doing with the public for the last three years? We have been engaging in extensive consultations. In fact, we have taken into account the viewpoints that have been given to us by a wide variety of actors."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01630,2021-10-04-T-023,1630,K Shanmugam,"But if we talk about whole-of-society, this is not the end. It is the beginning. We will face a major attack at some point. We need to bring the entire society together. We need to do a lot more to bring and shape public thinking."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01631,2021-10-04-T-023,1631,K Shanmugam,"So, there is a long haul ahead of us and the public has to be involved in that. The public has been involved, primarily, experts, in the thinking through of the Bill too."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01632,2021-10-04-T-023,1632,K Shanmugam,"On the second point. To take that and say – that means for the drafting of the Bill, the public will be involved and how come it was not involved – that is a misreading of that statement."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01633,2021-10-04-T-023,1633,K Shanmugam,"Let us go to the second question, which I think is the crux of the difference between the Government and Mr Pritam Singh and his party."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01634,2021-10-04-T-023,1634,K Shanmugam,"He quoted what I said in 1989. I did not only say it in 1989. If you went back and checked, I think I have said it at various points – 1989, 1990. I have said it just for the record since it is all in Hansard anyway. I have said it in respect of the original MRHA. I have said it in respect of the CLTPA and I have said it in respect of the Internal Security Act."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01635,2021-10-04-T-023,1635,K Shanmugam,"Why? This is fundamental. This is important. I have given this answer to your colleague, Mr Dennis Tan, when he asked me, probably trying to suggest that I am being inconsistent. A person who is prepared to be thinking about issues sometimes has to change his views when he is faced with the real world and experiences."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01636,2021-10-04-T-023,1636,K Shanmugam,"In 1989, I was a lawyer four years out of law school, four years after being called, and like many other lawyers, my assumption was every problem, the solution is in the Courts. Just like Mr Pritam Singh and others, I also take the separation of powers very seriously. The constitutional principles, the independence of the judiciary, all of these, I take very seriously. We imbibed this in law school."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01637,2021-10-04-T-023,1637,K Shanmugam,"I believed in it, I believe in it and I believe we try and uphold it. So, any time when there is an approach that seeks to cut back on judicial review or take away the powers of the judiciary, my instinctive reaction is negative. I do not like it, I do not want to do it and I instinctively try and see if there is a different way of doing it."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01638,2021-10-04-T-023,1638,K Shanmugam,"Which is why when the MRHA was originally brought in, I expressed my discomfort within the bounds of what is possible for the backbench Members of Parliament of the ruling party. Likewise, I expressed my concerns about the CLTPA. Likewise, I expressed my concerns about the Internal Security Act."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01639,2021-10-04-T-023,1639,K Shanmugam,"Likewise, today, I said, if we can find a better model, I will be the first one to do it. Tell me a better model. Going to the High Court for FICA is not a better model."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01640,2021-10-04-T-023,1640,K Shanmugam,"I think, Mr Pritam Singh, based on what he says, he obviously does not deny that there will be leaks. Do you want us to take the risks?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01641,2021-10-04-T-023,1641,K Shanmugam,"Will there be a possibility of a leak with a Tribunal? Much, much, much less. To the point of being close to zero. That is the big difference."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01642,2021-10-04-T-023,1642,K Shanmugam,"What has made me change my mind? If a man looks at the facts, the real world and refuses to change his mind, he is either stupid or he is ideological. I am neither. I think. Even if I say that of myself."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01643,2021-10-04-T-023,1643,K Shanmugam,"So, you see 9/11. You look at the way the Americans have dealt with it. You see the issues in Western Europe. You see the issues around the world where lip service is paid to all these grand concepts but the societies live in utter misery, where rule of law is a concept for lawyers but it does not operate in the real world. And you ask yourself."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01644,2021-10-04-T-023,1644,K Shanmugam,"So, I look at all of this experience practising in the Courts and too many years as a Member of Parliament. Long conversations with the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, discussing, I would say arguing though it is not easy to argue with him, discussing, tough discussions and then I began to understand the meaning of his original speech to the Law Society when he said, ""Law and order, I reverse it. Order first, before law."" Because if you do not have order, you cannot have law."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01645,2021-10-04-T-023,1645,K Shanmugam,"When we all read it, we think we understand it. But I do not think we really do. You need to really imbibe what is the meaning of that. If you cannot have the CLTPA and arrest the gangsters, how are you going to have law? It will be a paper law. But if you can bring order into society, then your law will take full effect."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01646,2021-10-04-T-023,1646,K Shanmugam,"Look at the state of our society. Look at the number of people under the CL today compared to the number of people under the CL even 10 years ago. It is halved and the reason is as society develops, as society progresses, as there is stability, as there is order, the law takes stronger and stronger roots. If you get that wrong, you will neither have law nor order."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01647,2021-10-04-T-023,1647,K Shanmugam,"So, I began to understand why we have a strong commitment to the rule of law, a strong commitment to the separation of powers and at the same time, in specific areas, there are some exceptions. For example, I said the Land Acquisition Act. Your property could be worth millions of dollars. The Government could acquire it and you could be asked to leave. It is socialism in action. It is a social policy and there is a need for that. Even today."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01648,2021-10-04-T-023,1648,K Shanmugam,Would we in Singapore be where we are if we had taken the Indian approach and every matter goes up to the Supreme Court on land acquisition and it takes years to deal with it?
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01649,2021-10-04-T-023,1649,K Shanmugam,"So, I saw the genius in the adaptations that our system has made or the founding generation has made, being very strict in building up our judiciary."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01650,2021-10-04-T-023,1650,K Shanmugam,"You look at all the countries in the post-colonial world. They inherited the institutions from the British – a civil service, a judiciary, laws, schools, education. What have they done with it? Most of them have gone down the tube while they have grand rhetoric."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01651,2021-10-04-T-023,1651,K Shanmugam,"What has Mr Lee and his team done with it? Built up the judiciary. If we do not have a commitment to the rule of law, do you think our judiciary will be ranked as it is today? Internationally?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01652,2021-10-04-T-023,1652,K Shanmugam,"Built up our civil service so that it is a strong, outstanding, excellent civil service. Built up the other institutions, including SAF, the Police force, our education system, our middle class. All of these were built up with the foundations of bringing order first and making sure that the law and the commitment to the rule of law are there."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01653,2021-10-04-T-023,1653,K Shanmugam,But making the exceptions where necessary and I took you through the exceptions.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01654,2021-10-04-T-023,1654,K Shanmugam,"To me, the best example of how this operated in practice is when I saw how the Americans were struggling with it. They had an ideological commitment to due process. Everyone must be tried. Everyone must have a lawyer. Everyone must be given a full trial."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01655,2021-10-04-T-023,1655,K Shanmugam,"But then, they have these, I do not know, hundreds or a thousand plus terrorists whom they do not want to give a trial to. America was never under an existential threat as a result of 9/11; never like the threat that we faced. But when they did it, they said Guantanamo Bay is in Cuba, our rules and laws do not apply there, there is no due process, we lock them up and we throw away the keys."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01656,2021-10-04-T-023,1656,K Shanmugam,"That is why I said, let us get out of this colonisation of our minds. Let us look at what works, what is fundamental. Checks and balances are important. But what is wrong with the checks and balances we have built in here?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01657,2021-10-04-T-023,1657,K Shanmugam,"So, yes, I am not embarrassed to say that I had certain views, straight out of law school the first four years. The only mistake is I should not have become a Member of Parliament when I was 29 years old. I should have waited a bit longer."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01658,2021-10-04-T-023,1658,K Shanmugam,"But I am not embarrassed to say those were my views and those views have changed because of the realities of life, not because I became a Minister but because over time, long before I became a Minister, I saw how laws are meant to operate and where the exceptions have to be made."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01659,2021-10-04-T-023,1659,K Shanmugam,"So, as I sat with my officers and drafted this and with the AGC, yes, there were parts that I wished were different. But that threat we face, as I said, are people armed with bazookas and I described this legislation as a toy gun. Because Singapore believes in the law, so we put forward the law, we give ourselves legal powers, but in reality, the kind of threats we face, the kind of adversaries and the resources they have in terms of manpower are far greater than what we have."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01660,2021-10-04-T-023,1660,K Shanmugam,"So, that, and our people have not even begun to realise what the problem is and the nature of the problem despite all the speeches and the conferences and the seminars and the Select Committee hearings."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01661,2021-10-04-T-023,1661,K Shanmugam,"If anybody else from the Workers' Party wishes, I will give you the references to my different speeches where I have expressed my views so that I do not have to keep coming back to the speech once every year or two years. [Applause.]"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01662,2021-10-04-T-023,1662,Speaker,Minister of State Desmond Tan.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01663,2021-10-04-T-023,1663,Desmond Tan,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, I just want to respond to Leader of Opposition's question with regard to a Singapore NGO that is designated as a Politically Significant Entity (PSE). Will it therefore be required to cease the foreign funding at the onset of the designation? So, the short answer to the question is no. At the onset of designation, the PSE will only be required to declare the foreign donors and where the funding is coming from. Only when there are reasons and it meets certain conditions will it be required to step up the countermeasures, the further measures to require the NGOs to then beyond declaring, to have to cease the funding, only when certain conditions are met. I hope that answers the question."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01664,2021-10-04-T-023,1664,Speaker,Leader of the Opposition.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01665,2021-10-04-T-023,1665,Pritam Singh,I thank the Minister and Minister of State Desmond Tan.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01666,2021-10-04-T-023,1666,Pritam Singh,"Minister, I have heard you carefully. On the first point about Second Minister Josephine Teo, I stick to my position that I do not believe it was a misreading. Minister has a different view. I think I can leave that at that."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01667,2021-10-04-T-023,1667,Pritam Singh,"The point about judicial review, again, that reflection of how one's views changes over time is not something that I take lightly. I think all of us go through such a catharsis in our lives as we build up a crucible of experience."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01668,2021-10-04-T-023,1668,Pritam Singh,"But I would like to ask whether the Ministry considered judicial review in the usual sense and not limited judicial review. Why was it that illegality and irrationality were deemed, that they ought not to play a part in this Bill. It is not the ISA. We are talking of a different sort of threat. Yes, it could be ""ISA-like"". I would concede that point. But we are only asking the Court to just look at the lawfulness of a decision. Nobody is asking the Court to substitute the Minister's decision. And this, I believe is an important matter because we cannot use the experience of having legislation with ouster clauses to justify new legislation with ouster clauses. So, I think each legislation must be unpacked to why judicial review has to be limited."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01669,2021-10-04-T-023,1669,K Shanmugam,"I will answer that shortly. The reason is, our assessment was that here, a lot of the evidence we will rely on would probably be based on highly sensitive information that comes from our partners; by definition, partners meaning from outside. They could be from a variety of different intelligence sources. As I said, I am not saying we have the human assets but a variety of different types of assets."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01670,2021-10-04-T-023,1670,K Shanmugam,"And our view was this. While the actions we take are nowhere near as serious as the Internal Security Act, nevertheless, in some ways, the Internal Security Act is often focused on the people within and we will be able to have our own evidence that would be able to be used. Here, we would have to depend on other types of evidence, other sources, whether our sources or partner sources, and there is a great deal of requirement for secrecy and confidentiality and this should not go to the Court process at all."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01671,2021-10-04-T-023,1671,K Shanmugam,"But we all agree there needs to be a robust process for making sure that the process we set up can properly look at what the Minister has done. So, the direct answer to the question is we assess that that the kind of information we will be looking at and assessing on deciding would be much, much, much more confidential and secret."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01672,2021-10-04-T-023,1672,K Shanmugam,"And really, in ordinary circumstances, it would be known to no more than one or two persons. And we have to rely on that kind of information, sometimes for this."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01673,2021-10-04-T-023,1673,K Shanmugam,"But if there are suggestions on how we can make it more robust, because we want it to be robust. That is why we have a High Court Judge sitting there. As I said, even though it is not in the Bill, I have asked the Chief Justice for names. So, he will give us the names. The President will appoint. And if there are other suggestions to make it robust without affecting the secrecy and confidentiality, we will be very happy to consider."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01674,2021-10-04-T-023,1674,Speaker,Assoc Prof Jamus.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01675,2021-10-04-T-023,1675,Jamus Jerome Lim,"Thank you, Speaker. And I thank the Minister for his extensive discussion about our questions. I have three clarification questions for the Minister. The first is to ask if in referring to the events of 2018-2019, whether he continues to believe that there was indeed malign foreign state influence in that case. And if I appreciate the point that he raised, that we should not outsource our national security to a private company. But by the same token, I am sure he will appreciate that the tools available to large and sophisticated Internet companies such as Facebook might indeed throw additional light on an issue."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01676,2021-10-04-T-023,1676,Jamus Jerome Lim,"So, for me, the question is, does this apparent disagreement not already raise caution about how the Competent Authority's suspicions may not always be correct? Or does the Minister believe that MHA will always retain its own Counsel on what he believes to be true."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01677,2021-10-04-T-023,1677,Jamus Jerome Lim,"My second clarification has to do with the standards of suspicion embedded in the Bill. Does this always refer to the term reasonable suspicion, a point that I believe Members of Zhulkarnain and Murali also mentioned."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01678,2021-10-04-T-023,1678,Jamus Jerome Lim,"I ask this because for starters, this was not codified specifically in this form in the Bill. Second, while we do have a long history of, as other Members have said, of using this term in case law, lest we forget the Bill as it stands, does exclude judicial review. So, any such precedent strikes me as a largely advisory and informative rather than binding."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01679,2021-10-04-T-023,1679,Jamus Jerome Lim,"And third, I think it is worth remembering that the types of actions typically afforded by reasonable suspicion tend to be much more limited than those associated with probable cause. And that is part of the reason why, for me at least, this hurdle remains a little too low for establishing offence."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01680,2021-10-04-T-023,1680,Jamus Jerome Lim,"And my last question has to do with whether the Minister continues to believe that there is a misunderstanding of the law by those who have raised reservations. I mention this because the reservations brought by scores of academics, activists, other lawyers who have all scrutinised the Bill and thought that the language was vague. So, for me, it seems like either the language is indeed vague as claimed and hence subject to misunderstanding. Or it is not vague, in which case, then these individuals should not be accused of misunderstanding."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01681,2021-10-04-T-023,1681,K Shanmugam,"Let me try and deal with those points. On the first point, do we believe that there was a foreign state involved response. We believe it to be so. So I think Assoc Prof Lim's real point is, ""Facebook says, there is no such thing. You say there is. Doesn't that throw into question your credibility of assessment?"""
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01682,2021-10-04-T-023,1682,K Shanmugam,"Let me try and give Mr Lim some examples, or at least one example. At many stages, Facebook has denied something only to come back and reverse itself. I am not saying, therefore, they do not really mean what they say when they have not seen any state attack. I also pointed out that Facebook is not the only medium. There are a variety of other medium, other than Facebook. And I do not know if they have considered a complete survey. We were watching all the different media that was used."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01683,2021-10-04-T-023,1683,K Shanmugam,"Now, in Sri Lanka, and I think this was 2017 or 2016, on Facebook, Sinhalese were calling to gather together to go and kill Muslims. The Minister for Communications in Sri Lanka called up Facebook to say, can you do something about this? This is a riot being organised on Facebook in order to kill other people. Facebook told him this does not affect our community standards. So, I do not know. Their definition of what is or is not a foreign hostile activity, may well be different from ours. So, if I organise a pogrom to go and kill people, that apparently does not breach Facebook's community standards. And Muslims were killed."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01684,2021-10-04-T-023,1684,K Shanmugam,"Does Assoc Prof Lim think that a responsible state authority should outsource the way it handles law and order to Facebook, whose primary concern is, how much money it can make with the best thrill in the world?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01685,2021-10-04-T-023,1685,K Shanmugam,"When someone took Nancy Pelosi's speech and re-did it to make it look as if she was drunk and slurring, Facebook also felt that in the interests of free speech, that does not breach their community standards."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01686,2021-10-04-T-023,1686,K Shanmugam,"When attacker in the New Zealand mosque was killing people and livestreaming his attack, Facebook said it did not breach its community standards and it felt that attack should continue to be livestreamed, until there was such a furore and uproar that they reversed course. So, I do not know. I do not know what their definitions are. I do not know what are the different types of medium they considered."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01687,2021-10-04-T-023,1687,K Shanmugam,"So, I cannot comment exhaustively, nor can I take it at face value that if they say, so it must be so. Maybe they do not know what happened. But we noticed activity, we draw certain lines. We have intelligence experts. We have people and they have come to the conclusion that the sudden spike in activity on a variety of platforms, specifically targeted for specific messages to be absorbed by our Mandarin speaking population was a very clear indication. And I am not going to all the details."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01688,2021-10-04-T-023,1688,K Shanmugam,"As I said, we are a price taker, we do not name countries, we cannot afford to."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01689,2021-10-04-T-023,1689,K Shanmugam,"Another question by Assoc Prof Jamus Lim is, do I believe there is a misunderstanding by all those who have raised issues? Or is the language indeed vague. There are different points. I think in any debate, again, after long years of experience in Parliament, my view is on any debate, it broadly breaks out into some who are honest and they understand; a large group who do not follow very carefully and may have views which are not accurate."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01690,2021-10-04-T-023,1690,K Shanmugam,How many people read very closely? How many people look at Bills? How many people look at even the detailed newspaper reports? And viewpoints tend to be impressionistic; and often impressionistic viewpoints tend to be inaccurate. But for good reasons – people have busy lives and they have a limited bandwidth. They absorb whatever they can absorb.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01691,2021-10-04-T-023,1691,K Shanmugam,"I do not know about Assoc Prof Lim, but if I was not doing this job and I was a lawyer in private practice, I would also have very limited time to understand what is going on in Parliament, which Bills are coming up. I will probably have, perhaps, a little bit more than the average layperson's understanding. But all our viewpoints tend to be impressionistic on areas that we are not directly dealing with because we all have busy lives."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01692,2021-10-04-T-023,1692,K Shanmugam,"And then, there will be a small group which will go out to deliberately misinform and confuse the population. There will always be that group and I have indicated that some of that has been happening too."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01693,2021-10-04-T-023,1693,K Shanmugam,"Quite apart from that, on language, let me try and explain to Assoc Prof Lim one more time. It is going to be 10 o'clock but I will try again. I said in my Opening Speech, I think I said out of 10,000 people, you are trying to catch that one case. Even in that one case, the foreign agency will try and make it look like it is a normal case. So, the facade will be normal, everything will look normal. In fact, if they are worth anything, they will make it look very normal. So, you have to have definitions; just because it looks normal does not mean that you do not have the powers. How do you go behind that, how do you deal with it."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01694,2021-10-04-T-023,1694,K Shanmugam,"So, that is why you say it is to foreigners' involvement affecting public interest. The way in which it is done, I have explained the framework. If the idea is hostile information campaign, foreign state agency, payments, covert activities, I think it is quite clear. But there are also situations where it is not so clear, and that is where you build in the proportionality test."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01695,2021-10-04-T-023,1695,K Shanmugam,"And it seems to me quite a few of the commentators do not understand the proportionality test. That is why I made it a point to say AGC advised me; that test is there. When you do not understand the proportionality test, then you say, ""Oh dear, it says 'collaboration', so, any collaboration with a foreigner on a matter that is of importance to Singaporeans could potentially run afoul"", because you misunderstand the proportionality test."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01696,2021-10-04-T-023,1696,K Shanmugam,"Beyond that, there is a second vein. Again, there are people who fall into those who deliberately push this line but there are also a large number, genuine people, honest people, who are genuinely concerned."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01697,2021-10-04-T-023,1697,K Shanmugam,"I would not say a large number of people are concerned with this Bill. In fact, our assessment is that, by and large, a large number of people understand, a vast majority of Singaporeans understand the need for FICA. So, of the very small group who are concerned, a significant number you can put down as honest people who, either for impressionistic reasons or other reasons, may have had some misunderstanding and like the two Nominated Members of Parliament who spoke up, say, is there a possibility of abuse."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01698,2021-10-04-T-023,1698,K Shanmugam,"And that lies behind some of the points that have been made outside. Yes, if you apply the law as you say it should be, and if you apply the proportionality test correctly, yes, then it will be done properly. But what if you abuse your power? And my answer to that, I gave an extended analysis this morning about how abuse can take place under any legislation. Your question is, do you give the power and what are the checks you put in. So, we have put in, we think, a strong check through the appointment of a High Court Judge with extensive powers. We have drafted this to deal with a very large threat which is clear and present here. It is not in the future. It has happened, it is happening all around us and it will happen to us. It is not for nothing that the French study Singapore and showed it as a test case or one of the case studies."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01699,2021-10-04-T-023,1699,K Shanmugam,"So, our task is to continue to explain to people how this law works and, over time, just as with the many other pieces of legislation, if the Government operates it properly and honestly, it will be understood. If it operates it wrongly, the people will express their views in a variety of ways."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01700,2021-10-04-T-023,1700,K Shanmugam,"I think Mr Perera said, ""Trust in institutions should be built up"". I think listening to Mr Perera over the years, his ideal state, if you take the UK or the US, they have all the things that he says we should have – Freedom of Information Act, they have all these other bodies, many things go to the courts, they do not have an Internal Security Act. Can anyone tell me why the trust in their Congress in the US, I think, is now down to, perhaps, a single digit or maybe low double digits? Why is the trust in the Government in Singapore so much higher?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01701,2021-10-04-T-023,1701,K Shanmugam,"So, let us, again, get real. Trust depends on how you exercise your power and your track record. Trust depends on whether people's lives have really improved and whether you work to improve people's lives. Trust depends on whether you have the courage of your convictions, in the face of some opposition, to say this is the right way, this is the way I will explain and I will do it for the benefit of people. Trust does not depend on putting in a series of legislation, just copying others whose trust levels are abysmally low."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01702,2021-10-04-T-023,1702,K Shanmugam,"Assoc Prof Lim asked me about the phraseology ""the authorisation by Minister for anticipatory direction"". I think the phrase used is ""suspects or has reason to believe""."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01703,2021-10-04-T-023,1703,Speaker,Mr Leong Mun Wai.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01704,2021-10-04-T-023,1704,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister three questions. One, basically, the question revolves around what the Leader of Opposition has also been asking. I do not think the Minister has given enough convincing arguments about what is the hurry, why FICA is needed and why the judicial review is not needed."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01705,2021-10-04-T-023,1705,Leong Mun Wai,"First of all, my first question, what is the hurry. The Minister has been saying for hours that three years of consultation has been done, they have done a lot of things and all that. But what we have heard here is that those things are about identifying what need to be done and what are the threats, what are the foreign interference threats and all that. But just now he mentioned something that, oh, he also consulted some Singaporeans. But at the end of the day, I think we can all agree that there is little consultation of the general public. And what the Minister was trying to say just now is that it seems to be – I mean that is how I interpret it – let us have the law first and then Singaporeans will understand the law, that the law is good for them and all that. That is not the way the law should be implemented. So, since there is not enough consultation of the general public, should the Minister not consider postponing the passage of the Bill? That is my first question."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01706,2021-10-04-T-023,1706,Leong Mun Wai,"The second question, is FICA effective in protecting us much more than all the resources and the laws we have before this? We already have them, they are all there. Can the Minister point out a few examples, do not quote all the foreign countries example, quote Asian countries example, examples of Asian countries that have suffered from foreign interference. Because as an ordinary citizen watching the TV and all that, all the foreign interferences in Taiwan and Australia, for example, seem to be a joke. It was just a theatre of actions and all that but in the end, all the foreign interference seems to be unravelled. So, I ask the Minister to quote us some examples and educate us."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01707,2021-10-04-T-023,1707,Leong Mun Wai,"The third question is, we spend a lot of time talking about judicial review. What the Minister seems to be saying is ""Trust me, trust me"". I ask two questions with regard to that. The Tribunal is appointed by the Minister, right, under this FICA? Two, if judicial review can be done in other country, even with respect to national security issues, why can we not do it?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01708,2021-10-04-T-023,1708,K Shanmugam,"Well, Sir, I will answer to the extent that I understand the questions. On the first point, what is the hurry? I assume now, Mr Leong, we are talking about the same legislation because the legislation you talked about just now seemed to be a very different one. Do you understand that almost everything you said earlier about this Bill is actually untrue and inaccurate?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01709,2021-10-04-T-023,1709,Leong Mun Wai,"Minister, you want me to respond now?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01710,2021-10-04-T-023,1710,K Shanmugam,"Yes, please."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01711,2021-10-04-T-023,1711,Leong Mun Wai,"Okay, what I have said is according to the legal advice that my Party had gotten from senior lawyers. So, you say those are not accurate, they are not right. Then, that is exactly what we have been saying or I have been saying in this Parliament. The discussion and the debate in this Parliament actually should not be conducted in a way that is just interpretation by you. Let us have a Committee, let the experts trash it out and then bring it to this main Chamber. We might as well call this legislative Chamber, legal Chamber. The legal experts who are advising me disagree with you."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01712,2021-10-04-T-023,1712,Speaker,If I can request both Members to direct your comments through me.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01713,2021-10-04-T-023,1713,K Shanmugam,"Yes, I am sorry, Sir. Sir, can I ask through you for Mr Leong to show me which clause allows for detention without trial in FICA, please, as he suggested? Detention without trial, trial in absence and no judicial review for such detention. Since his senior lawyers have advised it, he should be able to tell me which clause."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01714,2021-10-04-T-023,1714,Speaker,Mr Leong.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01715,2021-10-04-T-023,1715,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, there the Minister goes again. I am not going to go into all these legal interpretation. If we want to argue, we argue out of this. But most of the things that I have said is in section 99, and I did not say detention without trial. I say he can arrest you, of course, through due process, but after he arrests you, you are not bailable and all that, those are provided in section 99. But, anyway, I am not going down that line. Minister, let us go on with the other questions."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01716,2021-10-04-T-023,1716,Speaker,Minister.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01717,2021-10-04-T-023,1717,K Shanmugam,"Sir, I was listening very carefully when Mr Leong spoke and my blood pressure went up quite significantly when he said detention without trial. That phrase is there, I am sure it is captured in the Hansard. Detention without trial, trial in absentia and no judicial review. So, I just order and the person is arrested and detained, and he has got no rights of review."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01718,2021-10-04-T-023,1718,K Shanmugam,"And now, Mr Leong says clause 99. He reads English, I read English, I can tell him that neither clause 99 nor any other clause in the Bill has detention without trial. Not just that, he says ""There he goes again"". When Mr Leong refers to provisions in FICA, I asked him which provisions. When Mr Leong says you can detain without trial, he says it, I asked him which clauses."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01719,2021-10-04-T-023,1719,K Shanmugam,"So, we will take it that his position is that clause 99 allows the Minister to detain without trial. I can assure the House, he is reading something which I do not know anything about."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01720,2021-10-04-T-023,1720,Speaker,"Mr Leong, would you like to respond to that?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01721,2021-10-04-T-023,1721,Leong Mun Wai,I have no response.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01722,2021-10-04-T-023,1722,Speaker,"Minister, carry on."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01723,2021-10-04-T-023,1723,K Shanmugam,"Thank you, Sir. Sir, I do not want words put in my mouth. I did not say there was little consultation with Singaporeans nor did I say let us have the law first and then, go and explain to Singaporeans. I think I said a number of things in context and I would ask Mr Leong not to misquote me. I did not say it in those terms nor did I mean it in those terms."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01724,2021-10-04-T-023,1724,K Shanmugam,"The second the question is, is FICA effective in protecting us, given all the other resources that the Government has at its disposal? And Mr Leong says give us examples of Asian countries which have suffered such an attack. Sir, again, I am not usually at a loss for words. But is the suggestion that somehow because we are Asian, Asian countries will not be affected by foreign interference?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01725,2021-10-04-T-023,1725,K Shanmugam,"Is that the suggestion? I will suggest Mr Leong reads the French report and that he reads the Select Committee report. And I can tell him in the annexes we gave out this afternoon, while the names are not there, some of those countries are Asian."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01726,2021-10-04-T-023,1726,K Shanmugam,"It is absolutely shocking to hear that the suggestion of foreign interference in Taiwan and Australia are jokes. I think, in the case of Taiwan, of course, it is a territory, or it is said to be a territory; in the case of Australia, it is a country. Those places will be very surprised that someone in Singapore thinks the attacks on them, for which Australia has passed legislation, very draconian legislation on reporting requirements. I said this afternoon, you are an ex-parliamentarian, your obligations are very onerous."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01727,2021-10-04-T-023,1727,K Shanmugam,"I think no one who knows the facts will say what Mr Leong has said, that it is a joke that these places have suffered foreign interference."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01728,2021-10-04-T-023,1728,K Shanmugam,"Whether they have suffered it from the countries they have named, we do not express a view because it is not our business to go and say they were attacked by X or Y or Z. But all the evidence that was laid out this afternoon – I talked about an Australian parliamentarian who was said to have been suborned by foreign money and making a statement on South China Sea that is contrary to his own party's position – what do you call that?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01729,2021-10-04-T-023,1729,K Shanmugam,"When we say that Singapore itself has been subject to foreign interference recently, are you saying that what we are saying is untrue?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01730,2021-10-04-T-023,1730,K Shanmugam,"There are reports that the Indian electric infrastructure was brought down as a result of an attack from outside of India. There are reports of foreign inspired attacks in a number of Asian countries, which I think you can see both in the Select Committee report and if you read the newspapers."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01731,2021-10-04-T-023,1731,K Shanmugam,"The third point he makes is, well, the Judge is appointed by the Minister and basically the approach is, trust me."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01732,2021-10-04-T-023,1732,K Shanmugam,"No. The Tribunal is appointed by the President, on the advice of the Cabinet. It is headed by a High Court Judge, who has security of tenure, and he is a Judge of the Supreme Court. He does not owe any obligation to the Government."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01733,2021-10-04-T-023,1733,K Shanmugam,"Mr Leong asks why is it possible that other countries can have judicial review and we cannot. Well, I gave an answer. It is a question of what those countries can do and if you look at New Zealand, they have not had to face very severe threats. For the first time now, they are facing different types of threats. In the absence of an Internal Security Act, they have to allow this man to be free for years outside and one day, he goes into a supermarket and knifes people. Do you want to wait for that?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01734,2021-10-04-T-023,1734,K Shanmugam,"If you take France, I said 80% of the attackers were known to the security forces. Ninety-seven percent were on their radar. How many people have been killed? I said there were 22 incidents, including the Charlie Hebdo incident. Scores of people have been killed. The entire country brought to a standstill. Paralysed with fear."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01735,2021-10-04-T-023,1735,K Shanmugam,"These are choices. There are trade-offs. So, I explained the trade-offs we make."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01736,2021-10-04-T-023,1736,Speaker,Mr Leong Mun Wai.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01737,2021-10-04-T-023,1737,Leong Mun Wai,"Sir, I would like to clarify further with the Minister. One is that the appointment of the tribunal is recommended by the Cabinet, right, t o the President? In that case, does the President have the power to reject the appointment? First question."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01738,2021-10-04-T-023,1738,Leong Mun Wai,"Second question is, just now I asked for some examples of Asian countries that are affected by foreign interference. I am looking for examples where there are more permanent damage, like really affected a national election and things like that. But what the Minister has pointed is this one senator being found with connections with a country."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01739,2021-10-04-T-023,1739,Leong Mun Wai,"Those things in the normal course of our security operation, we can identify already. Do we need an extra law?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01740,2021-10-04-T-023,1740,Leong Mun Wai,"Secondly, is that Minister talked about the Indian electric infrastructure and all that? Similarly, our healthcare system data was compromised some years ago. Is FICA needed before we can prevent all these things? Or even with FICA, are we going to be able to prevent these kind of events? Minister, please."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01741,2021-10-04-T-023,1741,K Shanmugam,"Sir, I do not intend to keep repeating my opening speech. I think Mr Leong has got to, I would suggest he goes and listen again or reads and the answers are all there. And it is not just one senator. I suggest he read some material that has been given. Thank you, Sir."

2021-10-04-T-023-S-01743,2021-10-04-T-023,1743,Leong Mun Wai,"Minister, Mr Speaker —"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01744,2021-10-04-T-023,1744,Speaker,"Mr Leong, I called Mr Leon Perera."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01745,2021-10-04-T-023,1745,Leong Mun Wai,"Mr Speaker, Sir."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01746,2021-10-04-T-023,1746,Speaker,You could wait your turn.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01747,2021-10-04-T-023,1747,Leong Mun Wai,Minister did not answer my question. I asked a question.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01748,2021-10-04-T-023,1748,Speaker,Mr Leong. I called Mr Leon Perera. Kindly sit down.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01749,2021-10-04-T-023,1749,Leong Mun Wai,"Okay, he did not answer my question."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01750,2021-10-04-T-023,1750,Speaker,Nor did you answer his questions when he asked you earlier.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01751,2021-10-04-T-023,1751,Leong Mun Wai,"No, but I can ask —"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01752,2021-10-04-T-023,1752,Speaker,"You can sit down now, I will call you again later. Thank you."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01753,2021-10-04-T-023,1753,Leon Perera,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. I know the hour is late, I will try and keep it short."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01754,2021-10-04-T-023,1754,Speaker,It is late.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01755,2021-10-04-T-023,1755,Leon Perera,"Four supplementary questions. The first two are actually related to my speech and I do not think the Minister answered them, that is, unless I missed them. The first one is the subject of a Part 3 Direction or POL declaration can apply within a 30-day timeframe to the Minister for an appeal for reconsideration. But does the Minister have a timeframe within which he must respond on that; so, would the Minister commit to that?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01756,2021-10-04-T-023,1756,Leon Perera,"The second question is relating to clause 93, those who are designated as PSPs or PSEs issued directives on the Parts 5 and 6 may only appeal against that decision to the Minister. They have no right to appeal to the Tribunal, I believe, unlike those who are issued Part 3 Directions. So, what is the basis for that?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01757,2021-10-04-T-023,1757,Leon Perera,"The third question is in relation to what the Minister mentioned about my speech and speeches that I have made over the years. He talked about the trust deficit in countries like the UK and the US which have things like ombudsman and Freedom of Information Act, and so on and so forth. I would like to ask the Minister, would he agree that perhaps the trust deficit in the UK, the US and other countries which have those kinds of institutions that he is referring to may not be because of those institutions. It could be for other factors. And would he not agree that maybe if we took some of the kind of laws that we have in Singapore and applied it to those countries, it may not necessarily increase trust in those countries? And would he not agree that perhaps in Singapore, if we put in place laws a little bit more balanced, along the lines that we have argued today in Parliament, that might possibly increase the trust levels that we have here, even though those trust levels, you think are high. So, that is sort of the third question."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01758,2021-10-04-T-023,1758,Leon Perera,"The fourth question and the last one, is on the part of my speech where I talked about who checks the checkers. I think it is a big subject. Essentially, I asked what recourse does a concerned citizen have in Singapore if they feel that very senior officials – Prime Minister, Minister of Home Affairs himself – has been suborned by a foreign power? What is their channel to redress that, to have that addressed? As far as I could discern, the Minister responded by saying that the form of redress would be the same as it is in other countries, which is through other people. So, actually, I would like to put this back to the Minister and say that in the spirit of coming to Parliament, not with rhetoric, but with concrete and practical solutions, could you expand on really what is the redress in that kind of scenario, very practically speaking?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01759,2021-10-04-T-023,1759,K Shanmugam,"First, on the first four questions. On the first question, 30 days and whether there will be a time limit. It is difficult to commit to a time limit for the Minister to respond, simply because it depends on the facts and the kind of evidence that needs to be assessed. But what we can commit to is that it will be done as expeditiously as possible. On the stepped-up measures, I explained it in my speech, I responded."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01760,2021-10-04-T-023,1760,K Shanmugam,"On the trust levels, I think finally we are beginning to get to some sort of narrowing of the gap. So, let us agree, you have all these institutions, Freedom of Information and the kind of media that they have and the ombudsman, does not automatically mean trust levels go up. In fact, trust levels have been declining. It may be because of other problems. And I think there is a kernel of accuracy in what Mr Perera said. And the kernel that I extract is this  each country has got to look at its own situation and decide what works for it."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01761,2021-10-04-T-023,1761,K Shanmugam,"A country like China with 5,000 years and a single race – different considerations. A country like the US – different considerations. A country like Singapore with 700 square kilometres – different consideration. I think if we can agree on that and that therefore, we need to factor in what works for us, then the next question is, why have trust levels been so high in Singapore? They are very high. Why have they been high? There is a trust based on performance. There is a trust based on probity. There is a trust based on how leaders behave. There is a trust based on how powers are exercised."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01762,2021-10-04-T-023,1762,K Shanmugam,"So, anytime there is abuse, there is corruption, there is lack of probity, there is a performance deficit, trust will dissipate. I believe in Singapore, it will dissipate very quickly because we are such a small place, everyone understands everything pretty much in broad terms."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01763,2021-10-04-T-023,1763,K Shanmugam,"Whether bringing in some of these institutions will add to trust is a conversation we can have as long as it is not a priori argument  if you have it, trust will increase. That is just not true. You have to ask, is it really going to? Why? Why do you say that? Or is it actually going to affect the performance of the Government in such a way that actually trust will go down?"
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01764,2021-10-04-T-023,1764,K Shanmugam,"Finally, who checks the checkers. I think Mr Perera must be aware the CPIB can investigate anyone including the Prime Minister. When the CPIB wants to investigate the Prime Minister, there is a higher authority they report to, independently. The CPIB can investigate me and any Minister. And the man who was considered – or Mr Lee Kuan Yew had publicly said, ""Where will I get another Teh Cheang Wan?"" because he solved the housing crisis."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01765,2021-10-04-T-023,1765,K Shanmugam,"If you were to consider one of the inner core of Ministers, Mr Teh Cheang Wan would have been in the inner core of Ministers. Powerful, heavyweight Minister. What happened when there were allegations? Mr Lee Kuan Yew told him, when Mr Teh wanted to see him, ""I am not speaking with you. Let the CPIB investigate."" That is Singapore. That is why our trust levels are high. [Applause.]"

2021-10-04-T-023-S-01769,2021-10-04-T-023,1769,K Shanmugam,"Sir, the position is clear. When the law says ""on the recommendation or advice of the Cabinet"", then the President acts in accordance with the advice given by Cabinet."
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01770,2021-10-04-T-023,1770,K Shanmugam,"The point I made is that the High Court Judge who will head the tribunal is independent, has security of tenure, is someone whose job is in the Supreme Court.

Standing Order No 68 requires me to refer a Bill to a Select Committee if I am of the opinion that it is a hybrid Bill. A hybrid Bill is one that prejudicially affects individual rights and interests.
2021-10-04-T-023-S-01795,2021-10-04-T-023,1795,Speaker,"Some of you will recall, as an example, the Kwong-Wai-Shiu Free Hospital (Transfer of Undertaking and Dissolution) Bill in 2016, which specifically affected the Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital. The Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill now before the House applies to the public at large and does not specifically apply to an individual. It is therefore, not a hybrid Bill and Standing Order No 68 does not apply. I do not have such power as the Member would like to bestow upon me. Minister for Home Affairs."

2021-10-04-T-025-S-02102,2021-10-04-T-025,2102,Wan Rizal,"Mr Speaker, it has been almost a year since I raised my first Adjournment Motion on ""Eradicating Mental Health Stigmatisation"". During that speech, I shared the acronym L-A-S-T. Apparently, it was not my last Adjournment Motion. But, briefly, ""L"" stands for Literacy – to include mental health literacy in schoos and workplaces. ""A"" for Accessibility – to increase accessibility for people to come and seek help easier. ""S"" for Screening – like how we go for regular physical health screening, there should be one for mental health too. And ""T"" for Time-outs – to allow individuals to take a break and come back recharged."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02103,2021-10-04-T-025,2103,Wan Rizal,"Mr Speaker, we continue to see a lot of effort being rolled out by the Government, community partners and ground-up groups to destigmatise mental health issues. I would like to highlight that I am not the first to talk about this issue. PAP Members of Parliament have been championing it in Parliament long before I had. It dates back to the mental health blueprint in 2007."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02104,2021-10-04-T-025,2104,Wan Rizal,"From time to time, PAP Members of Parliament have risen in this House to ensure that policies on mental health are up to date and relevant. We have been consistent in our approach that progressive legislation can effectively promote access to mental healthcare and protect the rights of persons with mental health issues."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02105,2021-10-04-T-025,2105,Wan Rizal,"Therefore, I welcome recommendations put forth by the COVID-19 Mental Wellness Task force in August 2021 to provide a whole-of- Government strategy to address the psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ground-up campaigns such as Beyond The Label, the Honest Cookie by Samaritans of Singapore and ThisConnect, to name a few, have not gone unnoticed."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02106,2021-10-04-T-025,2106,Wan Rizal,"Even among our own PAP Members of Parliament, we embarked on our own #452TooMany Campaign last month to bring together our community partners, volunteers and residents to discuss issues on mental health. Although discussions and engagements are still ongoing, I would like to share some of those findings and recommendations today."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02107,2021-10-04-T-025,2107,Wan Rizal,"Mr Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified and made a significant impact on the mental health cases here in Singapore. Our suicide rate reached its all time high of 452, a 13% increase from 2019, with an increase across all age groups. If we picture a pyramid structure of mental health issues, certainly suicide is at its peak. What I want to bring forth today is not just the peak but the different ways we can come together to overcome issues surrounding mental health."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02108,2021-10-04-T-025,2108,Wan Rizal,"Mental health issues can affect anyone, from children to the elderly, students to teachers, workers to retirees. No one is spared in that manner."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02109,2021-10-04-T-025,2109,Wan Rizal,"Efforts to curtail the spread of the pandemic are necessary but unfortunately, have impacted the mental health of Singaporeans in different magnitudes. Measures to reduce social gatherings since the pandemic have increased stress and loneliness levels amongst our elderly and youths. This reduction of meaningful social engagement, coupled with stressors of the pandemic and adapting to technology and HBL, have understandably taken a toll on their mental well-being."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02110,2021-10-04-T-025,2110,Wan Rizal,"Another group of concern is our local Singaporean workers, our frontline healthcare professionals, teachers and public service officers have seen an increase in workload since the onset of the pandemic."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02111,2021-10-04-T-025,2111,Wan Rizal,"At its simplest form, those working from home faced the blurring of lines between work and personal time. For example, educators have had to adapt to the fluid COVID-19 situation tailoring their lesson plans and materials at short notice on top of the regular administrative duties, juggling various stakeholders' expectations and putting their students' first, always."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02112,2021-10-04-T-025,2112,Wan Rizal,"As an educator I feel overwhelmed, frustrated and of course, worried. So, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our teachers for their commitment, their dedication for being our fortress in such turbulent times."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02113,2021-10-04-T-025,2113,Wan Rizal,"On that note, I urge everyone as part of our “Whole of Society Approach” to change our mindset on how we view children's development, from daily school issues to major examinations."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02114,2021-10-04-T-025,2114,Wan Rizal,"It is about time we change this ""Assessment of Learning"", culture to a ""Journey of Learning"". If we can create a culture of appreciating the joy of learning and the challenges that such journey presents be it easy or difficult, whether we succeed or fail in something and accepting that there are multiple paths to achieve success, we can nurture an optimal mental health environment from the onset."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02115,2021-10-04-T-025,2115,Wan Rizal,"Hopefully, this would lead to a positive effect on the ""parent-teacher-child"" relationship and the positivity trickle down to our society."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02116,2021-10-04-T-025,2116,Wan Rizal,"Our Singaporean workers, from healthcare professionals to teachers to public service officers, need our continued care and support. Therefore, reviewing their workscope may be useful for a quality work life balance, but, most importantly, we must continue to create and upgrade channels for meaningful communication and this does not include the biannual staff appraisal."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02117,2021-10-04-T-025,2117,Wan Rizal,"Finally, we need to encourage and normalise mental health screening for all Singaporeans through key touchpoints like schools and IHLs, in workplaces and hospitals, and of course, the clinics. Anyone screened for being at risk or having symptoms of mental health issues should promptly be referred to a Mental Health Practitioner. We want to engage early, before mental health issues disrupts their lives and risks them doing something harmful."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02118,2021-10-04-T-025,2118,Wan Rizal,"Mr Speaker, my second point is regarding our mental health infrastructure to support mental health needs of our fellow Singaporeans."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02119,2021-10-04-T-025,2119,Wan Rizal,"Firstly, I call on the Government to expand our infrastructure by equipping all polyclinics, general practitioners (GPs) and social service agencies with the necessary expertise and resources. By expanding our community mental health touchpoints, we can make mental health screening accessible to more Singaporeans."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02120,2021-10-04-T-025,2120,Wan Rizal,"But beyond the hardware, it is the software that matters too. Diagnosing or sensing mental health issues takes time getting to know the patient, building trust and delving into the situation can make a difference. Therefore, it could be useful to consider and budget for longer consultation times in the future healthcare system."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02121,2021-10-04-T-025,2121,Wan Rizal,"Secondly, we need to develop our resources to respond to our community's increasing mental health needs and here, I offer two approaches. The first approach is to review expanding existing programmes or creating equivalent ones in IHLs so that more mental health professionals can be produced. The second, is to develop a community support network of trained staff and volunteers. They can be our first point of contact to attend distress calls and walk in consultations. Therefore, I welcome the Task force’s recommendation to develop a national mental health competency framework with a common set of training standards and clearly defined degrees of competencies expected of professionals and para professionals."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02122,2021-10-04-T-025,2122,Wan Rizal,"I hope this framework can be extended to students in IHLs as part of a module, so they too can be a ready-resource for the community support network. Similarly, I hope the training can also be extended to working professionals to develop their competencies and be their organisation's resource person at work."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02123,2021-10-04-T-025,2123,Wan Rizal,"Mr Speaker, lastly, I would like to touch on cost. For mental health patients seeking help, the financial costs of treatment, especially over a long period, can be prohibitive. For example, the annual Medisave limit is $700 a year from the year 2022. However, this may be fully used after a few consultations."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02124,2021-10-04-T-025,2124,Wan Rizal,"Perhaps the Government could explore increasing the Medisave claim limit for mental health consultations given that such consultations can be a bit more more regular for those who need more help. The Government could also provide greater subsidies for those who are under the Pioneer or Merdeka Generations, as well as those having CHAS cards."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02125,2021-10-04-T-025,2125,Wan Rizal,"Although insurance policy providers have started to offer insurance policies that provide coverage for mental health conditions, there are many other providers who have not begun. Thus, I am heartened to know when Senior Minister of State Janil previously told this House that there are ongoing efforts to make treatment more affordable and MOH is also working with insurance companies and other stakeholders to further optimise the coverage process. Mr Speaker, in Malay, please."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02126,2021-10-04-T-025,2126,Wan Rizal,"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mental health is a very critical issue faced by Singaporeans. Last year, our country recorded 452 suicide cases, and this is very worrying. In my English speech earlier, I suggested three broad aspects in our efforts to prioritise mental health in Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02127,2021-10-04-T-025,2127,Wan Rizal,"First, identify the most vulnerable groups and give them support as soon as possible."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02128,2021-10-04-T-025,2128,Wan Rizal,"Second, reviewing the mental health infrastructure."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02129,2021-10-04-T-025,2129,Wan Rizal,"And third, reducing the cost of mental healthcare."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02130,2021-10-04-T-025,2130,Wan Rizal,"So far, many activities and programmes are carried out to enhance awareness on mental health, and I personally support and welcome such efforts. However, our journey is still a long one."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02131,2021-10-04-T-025,2131,Wan Rizal,"My hope is that with this suggestion, Singaporeans who are suffering from mental health issues are no longer ashamed to come forward to get support, and also view mental health as no less important than physical health."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02132,2021-10-04-T-025,2132,Wan Rizal,"(In English)  Mr Speaker, I have touched on three broad points as part of our efforts to prioritise mental healthcare and support for Singaporeans  identification, infrastructure and cost. We need to focus our efforts on identifying the vulnerable groups so that we can intervene quickly, review our current mental health infrastructure and explore how we can make mental health consultations affordable for those in need."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02133,2021-10-04-T-025,2133,Wan Rizal,"We need to take affirmative action now, beyond just performative activism and populist rhetorics. To this end, I would like to thank my fellow PAP Members of Parliament colleagues for joining me in the #452TooMany Campaign. A special thanks to our community partners, volunteers, residents, mental health practitioners and researchers, like Devan from Mental Act and Jonathan from Total Wellness Initiative, for contributing their ideas and suggestions to strengthen our resolve to support Singapore's mental health movement."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02134,2021-10-04-T-025,2134,Wan Rizal,"Special mention also goes out to four inspiring individuals  Xavierlyn, Athena, Afiqah and Devan who shared their experiences on mental health issues with me. I am heartened to hear their sharing and I believe that conversations like these must continue and so that we can destigmatise mental health."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02135,2021-10-04-T-025,2135,Wan Rizal,"This act of solidarity will not just end here. I am inviting Members of this House, community leaders, activists, influencers and the public to join me and my 18 Members of Parliament on 10 October in conjunction with World Mental Health Day. Let us post on our socials, this 10.10 at 10.10 am a message of hope and commitment with the hashtag #452TooMany to signify that we acknowledge and care about mental health in Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02136,2021-10-04-T-025,2136,Wan Rizal,"Mr Speaker, to those out there grappling with mental health, I would like to end with a n online quote that I have adapted"
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02137,2021-10-04-T-025,2137,Wan Rizal,"""You are bent but not broken."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02138,2021-10-04-T-025,2138,Wan Rizal,You are sad but not hopeless.
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02139,2021-10-04-T-025,2139,Wan Rizal,You are tired but not powerless.
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02140,2021-10-04-T-025,2140,Wan Rizal,"You are depressed but not giving up."""
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02141,2021-10-04-T-025,2141,Wan Rizal,We are not giving up and you are not alone. We  will stand by you. [Applause.]
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02142,2021-10-04-T-025,2142,Speaker,"We do have some time. Would any Members like to chip in? Not that you need to, given that it is 11.30 pm, just saying. No one? Really? Ms Rahayu Mahzam."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02143,2021-10-04-T-025,2143,Rahayu Mahzam,"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for highlighting the importance of prioritising mental healthcare and support for Singaporeans. The Government is committed to do this."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02144,2021-10-04-T-025,2144,Rahayu Mahzam,The Member raised three points for our consideration  (a) identify vulnerable groups or persons who are at risk and provide proactive support; (b) review our mental health infrastructure and (c) review of the mental health consultation cost. I will address these points as I highlight the efforts which the Government has carried out and areas which we continue to build on.
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02145,2021-10-04-T-025,2145,Rahayu Mahzam,"The Government adopts a comprehensive and multi-pronged approach towards mental healthcare and support. The key strategies cover mental health promotion and upstream prevention, early detection and intervention, disease management, care integration and social support across different settings."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02146,2021-10-04-T-025,2146,Rahayu Mahzam,"Over the years, the Government has been reviewing the range of mental health services and programmes available to the public on a regular basis to ensure that they meet the needs of the population."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02147,2021-10-04-T-025,2147,Rahayu Mahzam,"In 2007, MOH developed the National Mental Health Blueprint to promote mental health, build resilience and reduce the impact of mental illness. Under the Blueprint, we began developing community capability, a key shift that entailed moving from an acute-centric institutionalised model to a community-based model. While acute care remains an important component of the system, only the acutely ill, disturbed or those with high risk of harm to self or others need to be hospitalised. For those whose conditions have stabilised, they should be discharged and allowed to recover and reintegrate back into the community."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02148,2021-10-04-T-025,2148,Rahayu Mahzam,"The Community Mental Health (CMH) Masterplan, launched in 2012, builds on the 2007 Blueprint and further strengthens mental health care in the community, to enable persons with mental health needs to be well supported in the community. Through establishing more community-based services, we hope to facilitate greater acceptance of treatment, lower the stigma of mental illness and increase community outreach for early identification of mental health needs. In 2017, we have committed a further $160 million to enhance and expand community mental health services over the next five years. These national mental health plans have expanded the community touch-points to promptly identify and assess at-risk persons with mental health needs and link them to relevant services. These efforts will address the Member’s concerns of ensuring that those who are most vulnerable or at-risk are identified early and interventions are in place to protect them from doing something harmful."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02149,2021-10-04-T-025,2149,Rahayu Mahzam,"The Member had also called for an expansion of the infrastructure by equipping all polyclinics, General Practitioners and social service agencies with the necessary expertise and resources."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02150,2021-10-04-T-025,2150,Rahayu Mahzam,"In this regard, I would highlight that under the CMH Masterplan, we have also increased the accessibility of mental health services in primary and community care sectors. As at end 2020, 14 polyclinics offer mental health and/ or dementia services and, over 220 General Practitioner (GP) partners are trained to diagnose and treat mental health conditions. They are supported in the community by our 21 community intervention teams, which comprise trained allied health professionals to provide psycho-social therapeutic interventions."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02151,2021-10-04-T-025,2151,Rahayu Mahzam,"MOH will continue to work with the healthcare providers and social services agencies to expand and improve mental health services in the primary and community care settings, including training of frontline staff and community partners."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02152,2021-10-04-T-025,2152,Rahayu Mahzam,"The Member also raised the issue of cost. MOH has put in place various support measures to ensure access to affordable mental health services. The Government provides up to 75% subsidies for outpatient treatment at polyclinics and public specialist outpatient clinics (SOCs). All Singaporeans regardless of income are also eligible for subsidies under the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) for treatment of mental health conditions under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP) at participating private General Practitioner (GP) clinics. Pioneer and Merdeka Generation cardholders are eligible for additional subsidies at all polyclinics, public SOCs and CHAS GP clinics. Patients can also tap on their MediSave to pay for outpatient treatment of CDMP conditions."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02153,2021-10-04-T-025,2153,Rahayu Mahzam,"Based on the latest available data, about three in 10 patients who utilised MediSave for the treatment of CDMP mental health conditions reached the yearly $500 MediSave withdrawal limit. Nevertheless, in recognition that patients with complex conditions may have higher needs, we increased the MediSave withdrawal limit to $700 for patients with complex chronic conditions in January 2021, in recognition that these patients have higher needs. The withdrawal limit for patients with simple chronic conditions remain at $500. Those who are 60 years old and above can additionally tap on the Flexi-MediSave scheme for outpatient expenses. The Flexi-MediSave annual withdrawal limit was also raised from $200 to $300 in June 2021."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02154,2021-10-04-T-025,2154,Rahayu Mahzam,"To ensure that no Singaporean is denied access to appropriate treatment due to inability to pay, MediFund is available at public healthcare institutions as a safety net to assist Singaporeans who are unable to afford their mental health treatments despite Government subsidies, insurance and MediSave. MOH will continue to review the various financial schemes regularly to ensure that they meet the needs of Singaporeans with mental health needs."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02155,2021-10-04-T-025,2155,Rahayu Mahzam,"The Government is aware that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about unprecedented shifts in the way we live and work, and resulted in stressors that impact our mental well-being. It is in anticipation of the increase in mental health needs in our population that the Government and various agencies have expanded or newly introduced over 40 mental health-related initiatives last year. Besides targeting the general population, many of these initiatives are targeted at specific population segments such as parents and families; children and youth; workplaces and working population; and seniors."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02156,2021-10-04-T-025,2156,Rahayu Mahzam,"It is indeed important for us to create awareness on these issues, or as the Member puts it, to enhance mental health literacy, in our community."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02157,2021-10-04-T-025,2157,Rahayu Mahzam,"The COVID-19 Mental Wellness Task force (CoMWT), co-chaired by MOH and the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), was set up to address the psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the population. The task force has completed its work and announced its findings and recommendations. More details can be found in the task force report which has been published on the MOH website."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02158,2021-10-04-T-025,2158,Rahayu Mahzam,"To better prepare for the future, MOH and MSF have also set up the new Inter-agency task force on Mental Health and Well-being, which will oversee mental health and well-being efforts, focusing on cross-cutting issues that require inter-agency collaborations. The new task force will form workgroups to review cross-cutting gaps and issues for example specific measures targeted at those that are more vulnerable or at risk, to identify potential solutions. We will develop an overarching National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy. The task force will engage the public on the development of this strategy through a public consultation exercise next year."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02159,2021-10-04-T-025,2159,Rahayu Mahzam,"Notwithstanding the efforts by the Government and agencies, a whole of society approach is necessary to address the population’s mental well-being. Every one of us has a role to play. We can start by learning more about mental health and how we could support other in dealing with mental health challenges, reach out and do regular check-ins on the people we care about, and most importantly, practice self-care."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02160,2021-10-04-T-025,2160,Rahayu Mahzam,"The Government is committed to supporting this. For example, to better reach out to youths, the Government has launched the Youth Mental Well-being Network in February 2020 to bring together the wider society to identify opportunities and gaps to work on to improve youth mental well-being. To date, there are over 1,500 passionate like-minded individuals including mental health professionals, practitioners, parents and youths in this Network. The network members have been working on over 20 projects to support youth mental health, ranging from enhancing youths’ emotional resilience to strengthening support among peers, and within the family, workplace and community. We look forward to seeing the fruits of their labour."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02161,2021-10-04-T-025,2161,Rahayu Mahzam,I thank the Member for sharing the findings of the #452TooMany Campaign’s mental health dialogues with the community. We will factor these findings into the work of the Taskforce and its supporting workgroups.
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02162,2021-10-04-T-025,2162,Rahayu Mahzam,"On this note, I urge my fellow Singaporeans to stand together and support one another, to ensure mental well-being and resilience especially in such unprecedented times."
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02163,2021-10-04-T-025,2163,Speaker,Are there any clarifications?
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02164,2021-10-04-T-025,2164,Speaker,"[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]"
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02165,2021-10-04-T-025,2165,Speaker,"[(proc text) Resolved, ""That Parliament do now adjourn."" (proc text)]"
2021-10-04-T-025-S-02166,2021-10-04-T-025,2166,Speaker,Adjourned accordingly at 11.38 pm.
2021-10-04-T-026-S-02167,2021-10-04-T-026,2167,Joan Pereira,"asked the Minister for Manpower regarding migrant domestic workers (MDWs), whether the Ministry can provide an update on the recourse that employers have against false accusations by MDWs."
2021-10-04-T-026-S-02168,2021-10-04-T-026,2168,Tan See Leng,"MOM takes a firm stance against migrant domestic workers (MDWs) who file a false employment complaint or claim against their employers. MOM investigates all complaints and claims thoroughly and fairly, to determine if the allegations are substantiated. This includes interviewing both the MDW and the employer to establish the facts of the case, and reviewing other objective evidence, such as CCTV recordings where available, and accounts from witnesses. Actions have been taken against MDWs who were found to have provided false information, including being fined, imprisoned, or both. MDWs found guilty of false allegations have also been barred from working in Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-027-S-02169,2021-10-04-T-027,2169,Rachel Ong,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many workers have been displaced from the closure of SMEs since March 2020; and (b) how many have found new jobs since their displacement.
2021-10-04-T-027-S-02170,2021-10-04-T-027,2170,Tan See Leng,"The Government stands ready to support workers who have been displaced from their jobs, including those displaced from the closure of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)."
2021-10-04-T-027-S-02171,2021-10-04-T-027,2171,Tan See Leng,"The number of retrenchments rose to about 26,000 in 2020, although the incidence of retrenchment remained lower than past recessionary years. Retrenchment numbers have improved since the fourth quarter of 2020, and decreased to 2,340 in the second quarter of 2021. This is comparable to levels seen in 2018 and 2019. We also closely monitor post-retrenchment outcomes – amongst all retrenched residents, the six-month re-entry rate was 64.4% in the second quarter of 2021, an improvement from 61.6% in 2020. This is also comparable to pre-COVID re-entry rates in 2018 and 2019."
2021-10-04-T-027-S-02172,2021-10-04-T-027,2172,Tan See Leng,"The tripartite Retrenchment Taskforce follows up with every notified retrenchment, by proactively reaching out to the affected workers and offering them employment assistance. This includes providing information kits on career resources, briefings on available employment facilitation, and one-one-one coaching by career coaches from Workforce Singapore and NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute."
2021-10-04-T-028-S-02173,2021-10-04-T-028,2173,Rachel Ong,"asked the Minister for Manpower with regard to older workers aged 60 years old and above (a) whether there will be further measures to help these older workers in staying employed during the pandemic; (b) since March 2020, what is the percentage of these older workers who have been successfully placed in new jobs after being displaced; and (c) what is the breakdown of job types by sector that these older workers are placed in."
2021-10-04-T-028-S-02174,2021-10-04-T-028,2174,Tan See Leng,"The prospects of senior workers have improved in line with the overall measured recovery. The six-month re-entry rate among senior retrenched residents has improved from a low of 39.3% in the third quarter of 2020 to around 43.8% in the second quarter of 2021. Our senior workers are finding jobs in a wide range of sectors, with seven in 10 in Administrative & Support Services, Wholesale & Retail Trade, Accommodation & F&B Services, and Community, Social & Personal Services. Notwithstanding the recession, the employment rate of those aged 60 and above increased slightly from 38.5% in 2019 to 39.0% in 2020."
2021-10-04-T-028-S-02175,2021-10-04-T-028,2175,Tan See Leng,The Government continues to support senior workers to stay in their current jobs or to pivot to new jobs in other industries. The Senior Worker Support Package introduced in 2020 supports employers in hiring and retaining senior workers. It includes
2021-10-04-T-028-S-02176,2021-10-04-T-028,2176,Tan See Leng,"The Senior Employment Credit, which provides employers wage offsets of up to 8% for hiring senior workers aged 55 and above."
2021-10-04-T-028-S-02177,2021-10-04-T-028,2177,Tan See Leng,"The Senior Worker Early Adopter Grant, which encourages employers to implement a higher internal retirement age and re-employment age, above the statutory minimum."

2021-10-04-T-029-S-02181,2021-10-04-T-029,2181,Wan Rizal,asked the Minister for Defence whether any of the support services and protocols will be updated to pay more attention to the mental health of full-time National Servicemen during the COVID-19 pandemic.
2021-10-04-T-029-S-02182,2021-10-04-T-029,2182,Ng Eng Hen,"MINDEF/SAF has in place a Mental Health Support System comprising education, prevention, detection and intervention measures that support our full-time servicemen’s mental well-being. Additional support is provided to those who face challenges."
2021-10-04-T-029-S-02183,2021-10-04-T-029,2183,Ng Eng Hen,"During Basic Military Training, recruits are taught to recognise distress signs and practise self-care as part of their psychological resilience training. They are paired with buddies who offer peer-level support, and may also approach orientation officers for further advice and assistance. At our training schools and units, SAF commanders are trained to recognise mental health issues, and interview their servicemen regularly to identify potential problems and render assistance. Servicemen who need professional help receive support from para-counsellors, counsellors and psychologists through their units or centralised resources such as the SAF Counselling Centre, Psychological Care Centre and anonymous 24-hour counselling hotline."
2021-10-04-T-029-S-02184,2021-10-04-T-029,2184,Ng Eng Hen,"These measures continue to be available during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, recognising the unique challenges brought about by COVID-19, the SAF has introduced new initiatives to support our servicemen’s mental well-being."
2021-10-04-T-029-S-02185,2021-10-04-T-029,2185,Ng Eng Hen,"Since the pandemic began, the SAF has provided information and advice to servicemen on self-care and team-care under the COVID-19 environment. Commanders were encouraged to monitor stress levels and organise mental well-being activities in their units. A dedicated well-being campaign was also conducted earlier this year to encourage discussion of mental health issues and promote healthy habits. Remote channels of mental health support such as tele-counselling and online resources were added so that servicemen can continue to access timely services during periods when physical interactions are constrained. Survey and monitoring efforts have also been stepped up so that we can assess how our servicemen are adapting to the COVID situation."
2021-10-04-T-029-S-02186,2021-10-04-T-029,2186,Ng Eng Hen,"Despite these measures, some with mental health issues may not overtly show signs, or even if they do, only sporadically. We therefore encourage the social contacts of our servicemen, for example, their family members and friends, to contact MINDEF/SAF if they notice any of our servicemen in difficulty. They may call the NS Call Centre at 1800-367 6767."
2021-10-04-T-029-S-02187,2021-10-04-T-029,2187,Ng Eng Hen,The COVID-19 situation is an evolving one. We will continue to monitor the challenges it brings and render support to our servicemen’s mental well-being.
2021-10-04-T-030-S-02188,2021-10-04-T-030,2188,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,asked the Minister for Health (a) how many clients have been actively served by the IMH Community Mental Health Team in the last two years; and (b) what sort of critical conditions and situations will prompt the mobile crisis team to conduct a home visit.
2021-10-04-T-030-S-02189,2021-10-04-T-030,2189,Ong Ye Kung,"The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) Community Mental Health Team (CMHT) is a multidisciplinary team that provides psychosocial rehabilitation for discharged patients, in their homes."
2021-10-04-T-030-S-02190,2021-10-04-T-030,2190,Ong Ye Kung,"The CMHT has served about 2,300 patients since August 2019. The mobile crisis team delivers crisis interventions to individuals with a known or suspected mental health condition who are at risk of harm to self or others, or are impaired such that they are unable to look after themselves."
2021-10-04-T-030-S-02191,2021-10-04-T-030,2191,Ong Ye Kung,
2021-10-04-T-031-S-02192,2021-10-04-T-031,2192,Wan Rizal,asked the Minister for Health with regard to HPB’s development of a one-stop online portal for national mental health resources (a) what are the reasons for developing this portal instead of building on the existing one-stop mental health platforms; (b) how will the new portal be different from the existing one-stop mental health platforms; (c) how will the Government prevent or reduce duplication of such one-stop platforms from emerging; and (d) how does developing a new portal reduce the number of existing information sources on mental health.
2021-10-04-T-031-S-02193,2021-10-04-T-031,2193,Ong Ye Kung,"Currently, there are numerous online resources on mental health and well-being by government agencies and private providers, which can be confusing and overwhelming for those who are searching for information. In addition, the information at some of these online resources may not be relevant, current or credible. In view of this, the COVID-19 Mental Wellness Taskforce (CoMWT) had recommended for a one-stop online portal for mental health resources to be developed."
2021-10-04-T-031-S-02194,2021-10-04-T-031,2194,Ong Ye Kung,"The one-stop portal does not aim to reduce the number of online information sources or portals on mental health. Rather, it aims to serve as a trusted resource that will allow Singaporeans to access reliable, comprehensive and current information that have been curated by experts and various agencies, in an easy and convenient manner. The portal will be developed on HealthHub, which is an existing one-stop platform offering Singaporeans access to a wide range of health content, rewards and e-services."
2021-10-04-T-031-S-02195,2021-10-04-T-031,2195,Ong Ye Kung,
2021-10-04-T-032-S-02196,2021-10-04-T-032,2196,Cheng Li Hui,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the current status of the four complaints that have been lodged with the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment (TAFEP) against the property management company of Hillview Heights; (b) what are the findings; and (c) whether there has been an increase in the number of complaints received by the Ministry since the complaints were made public.
2021-10-04-T-032-S-02197,2021-10-04-T-032,2197,Tan See Leng,"There have been a total of four complaints lodged this year at TAFEP against the property management firm of Hillview Heights. They relate to clauses in tender documents that discriminate against the age and language of security officers. For the first three complaints, TAFEP engaged the firm, which then took steps to rectify. Following the third complaint, TAFEP assessed that the occurrences were not isolated, and advised the firm to review their system. The fourth complaint, which arose from the tender for Hillview Heights, indicated that TAFEP’s advice had not been followed. TAFEP thus referred the case to MOM for further investigation which is ongoing."
2021-10-04-T-032-S-02198,2021-10-04-T-032,2198,Tan See Leng,"We would like to assure Ms Cheng Li Hui and also Mr Edward Chia, who has filed a similar question stemming from this incident, that MOM and TAFEP take a serious view of workplace discrimination, including the use of age as a selection criteria. Other than requiring employers to attend corrective workshops conducted by TAFEP, MOM will not hesitate to take enforcement actions against discriminatory employers, such as curtailing their work pass privileges. While we have not observed an increase in the number of workplace discrimination complaints received arising from this episode, we urge workers who face any form of workplace discrimination to approach TAFEP or MOM for assistance."
2021-10-04-T-032-S-02199,2021-10-04-T-032,2199,Tan See Leng,
2021-10-04-T-033-S-02200,2021-10-04-T-033,2200,Edward Chia Bing Hui,asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry can consider providing financial subsidies for HDB flat buyers to rent interim housing in the open market given the additional construction delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the limited supply of flats available under the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme.
2021-10-04-T-033-S-02201,2021-10-04-T-033,2201,Desmond Lee,"We recognise that delays to the completion of Build-To-Order (BTO) flats have caused inconvenience to flat buyers and affected their plans. HDB is working closely with contractors and relevant government agencies to keep construction work on track to meet the revised timelines, while ensuring that project quality and safety standards are not compromised."
2021-10-04-T-033-S-02202,2021-10-04-T-033,2202,Desmond Lee,"Not all flat buyers require assistance with interim housing, as many are able to find alternative housing arrangements with family members or on the open market. The Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS) provides an additional option for those who need help with accommodation while awaiting the completion of their BTO flats. HDB will be increasing the supply of PPHS flats starting from this year and over the next two years. HDB has also finetuned the PPHS eligibility conditions and allocation process to prioritise families in greater need of subsidised temporary housing."
2021-10-04-T-033-S-02203,2021-10-04-T-033,2203,Desmond Lee,"Given the COVID-19 situation, many other families looking for temporary housing may also be turning to the open market for rental. Providing direct subsidies may induce demand and drive up market rentals. Such a move would be counter-productive, as it makes renting more expensive. As such, HDB currently has no plans to provide direct subsidies for open market rental."
2021-10-04-T-033-S-02204,2021-10-04-T-033,2204,Desmond Lee,"For low-income households with no family support and no other housing option, other than PPHS, HDB will consider offering Interim Rental Housing (IRH) on a case-by-case basis. HDB will also consider waiving the forfeiture and the one-year wait out period for flat buyers who have been affected by these delays and, as a result, choose to cancel their BTO flat booking to buy a resale flat, based on an assessment of the flat buyers’ specific circumstances."
2021-10-04-T-034-S-02205,2021-10-04-T-034,2205,Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) since January 2020, how many hair and beauty salons previously reported for unfair practices, particularly for engaging in pressure sale tactics, have signed Voluntary Compliance Agreements or have been investigated by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore respectively; (b) how many of such firms have opened a new outlet or relocated an existing outlet; and (c) how many of such new outlets are in HDB heartlands."
2021-10-04-T-034-S-02206,2021-10-04-T-034,2206,Gan Kim Yong,"Since January 2020, eight hair and beauty salons have signed Voluntary Compliance Agreements (VCA) with the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) or been investigated by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS). Of these, six firms have opened new outlets or relocated an existing outlet. There were four such new outlets in HDB heartlands."
2021-10-04-T-034-S-02207,2021-10-04-T-034,2207,Gan Kim Yong,Three of the eight salons are under active investigations. These are listed on CASE’s Company Alert List. CASE monitors salons that have entered into VCAs very closely and will not hesitate to refer them to CCCS for investigation under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act. We urge consumers to exercise extra caution in dealing with firms on the Company Alert List. Those who have encountered suppliers with egregious conduct should approach CASE as the information will help CCCS with investigations.
2021-10-04-T-035-S-02208,2021-10-04-T-035,2208,Edward Chia Bing Hui,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development how will the Ministry assist resource-low families in the anticipated rise in basic essential services such as cleaning and food services given that consumers may have to pay more for basic necessities.

2021-10-04-T-035-S-02210,2021-10-04-T-035,2210,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The recent recommendations by the Tripartite Workgroup on Lower-Wage Workers, as accepted by the Government, will expand the coverage of Progressive Wages, include enhancements to the Local Qualifying Salary (LQS), and introduce the Progressive Wage Mark. The Government has also committed to enhancing the Workfare Income Supplement scheme by 2023. Collectively, these efforts will help to uplift the wages of lower-wage workers. While some businesses may pass on some of the additional costs to their consumers, lower-wage workers and their households are expected to see an overall improvement in their financial circumstances as a result of these changes."
2021-10-04-T-035-S-02211,2021-10-04-T-035,2211,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"ComCare assists lower-income households who require support for their basic living expenses. ComCare Long-Term Assistance (LTA) is provided to those who are permanently unable to work due to old age, illness or disability, and have little or no means of income and family support. Households that require help to tide over temporary financial difficulty are provided with ComCare Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance (SMTA). The income criteria for ComCare schemes are not hard thresholds. Rather, our Social Service Offices (SSOs) assess the applicants’ circumstances and needs, and exercise flexibility as needed to provide the necessary financial assistance and community support. With the expanded Progressive Wage approach, including the new LQS requirements, we expect more families to see an improvement in their financial circumstances and achieve self-reliance in the long run."
2021-10-04-T-035-S-02212,2021-10-04-T-035,2212,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MSF regularly reviews the ComCare eligibility criteria and cash assistance rates. In our review, we look at expenditure data for daily living expenses of low-income families, as well as national statistical data collected by the Department of Statistics (DOS), including the prices of essential items. We also consider input from community stakeholders such as social workers and frontline officers who work with low-income families, as well as beneficiaries. The last review was conducted in 2019, and the next review will be in 2022. If there are any cost increases to the basket of goods and services purchased by households, these will be reflected in the review."
2021-10-04-T-035-S-02213,2021-10-04-T-035,2213,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Building an inclusive and caring society is a collective effort. The community plays an important role and has continued to step up and partner the Government in helping those in need. If you come across individuals or families who require support, please reach out to us at our ComCare hotline at 1800-222-000, or approach the nearest SSO, so that we can follow up and offer the appropriate support."

2021-10-04-T-036-S-02215,2021-10-04-T-036,2215,Abdul Samad,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether there will be efforts to study the current wage for Singaporeans to acquire a decent living for themselves and for also raising a family.
2021-10-04-T-036-S-02216,2021-10-04-T-036,2216,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Government is committed to creating an uplifting society, where all Singaporeans have opportunities to do well for themselves and their families. To this end, we have progressively strengthened our social safety nets and have increased support for Singaporeans in key domains of need over the years."
2021-10-04-T-036-S-02217,2021-10-04-T-036,2217,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We recognise that the income required to support individuals and their families varies depending on their needs and circumstances, and that we can help them with their aspirations. Therefore, our approach is one where the Government provides multiple lines of assistance and extends support to individuals and families in a targeted and holistic manner. These range from broad-based and right-sizing of subsidies in housing, healthcare, and education, to more targeted forms of support like ComCare financial assistance for those who require additional support for their basic living expenses. MSF regularly reviews the ComCare eligibility criteria and guidelines for assistance quantum based on national statistical data by the Department of Statistics (DOS), and input from relevant stakeholders and beneficiaries. The amount of Government transfers has also increased over the past year, with resident households in HDB 1-2 room flats receiving the highest amount at $13,670 per household member on average last year."
2021-10-04-T-036-S-02218,2021-10-04-T-036,2218,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Ultimately, we agree with our union leaders that the best welfare is work. In addition to being gainfully employed, we are also taking active steps to enable our lower-wage workers to attain higher wages. The Progressive Wage Model (PWM) and Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme are key strategies that will help us to achieve this. The PWM will be extended to more sectors and occupations starting next year, to put them on a wage growth trajectory that outpaces that of the median worker in the years ahead. As PM had announced at his National Day Rally speech, Workfare will also be enhanced from 2023 to provide higher payouts to all recipients, and to support younger lower-wage workers from age 30."
2021-10-04-T-036-S-02219,2021-10-04-T-036,2219,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In addition, from 1 September 2022, firms that hire foreign workers will have to pay all their Singaporean employees at least the Local Qualifying Salary (LQS) of $1,400. Together with Workfare, this means that employees who benefit from the LQS will receive an income of at least $1,540 to $1,730 per month, depending on their age."
2021-10-04-T-036-S-02220,2021-10-04-T-036,2220,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We have also put in place a comprehensive Marriage and Parenthood Package to support families. Married parents of citizen children receive financial support through the Baby Bonus Cash Gift and Government contributions to the Child Development Account (CDA). This year, we increased the cap on the Government’s dollar-for-dollar co-matching of parents’ savings in the CDA for the second child from $3,000 to $6,000. In 2016, we introduced the CDA First Step Grant, which is a $3,000 deposit by the Government when the CDA is opened without parents having to save first. It is especially beneficial to lower-income families. Other benefits given to all citizen children, regardless of their parents’ marital status, include healthcare subsidies, MediSave Grant for Newborns, MediShield Life coverage from birth, and the Migrant Domestic Worker Levy Concession."
2021-10-04-T-036-S-02221,2021-10-04-T-036,2221,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Government is also committed to ensuring that every family has access to affordable and quality preschool. We ensure that fees at government-supported preschools are kept affordable, and have enhanced preschool subsidies in January 2020. With enhanced subsidies, low-income families earning $3,000 or less per month pay $3 a month for full-day childcare at an Anchor Operator preschool. This is because we want to give every child the best start in life, regardless of their family background or circumstance. Providing them with an enabling environment, where they can flourish and achieve their fullest potential."
2021-10-04-T-036-S-02222,2021-10-04-T-036,2222,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In sum, the Government will continue to support Singaporeans in employment, and in starting and raising their families, whether through measures that provide direct financial support, or more targeted measures in key aspects such as preschool, education, healthcare, and housing. Everyone has a part to play in this effort, from employers enabling efforts to uplift the wages of lower wage workers, to the community looking out for each other. If you come across individuals or families who require support, please reach out to us at our ComCare hotline at 1800-222-000, or approach the nearest SSO, so that we can follow up and offer the appropriate support."
2021-10-04-T-037-S-02223,2021-10-04-T-037,2223,Poh Li San,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how will the port closures in China affect the shipment of raw material for businesses, in particular, the construction and electronics sectors; (b) whether these impacts affect the economic growth projection and inflation rate in Singapore; and (c) how can the Ministry assist companies in alleviating the impact of supply chain disruption and rising cost pressures."
2021-10-04-T-037-S-02224,2021-10-04-T-037,2224,Gan Kim Yong,"Due to the detection of COVID-19 cases, China imposed partial and temporary closures at the Yantian International Container Terminal at the Port of Shenzhen and the Meidong Container Terminal at the Port of Ningbo-Zhoushan for 34 days and 14 days respectively. Both ports collectively accounted for 8% of Singapore’s imports from China in 2020."
2021-10-04-T-037-S-02225,2021-10-04-T-037,2225,Gan Kim Yong,"We have not received any feedback from companies on supply chain disruptions due to these port closures. We expect the overall impact to be manageable, as our companies have been strengthening their business continuity and supply chain resilience plans since the outbreak of COVID-19. The direct impact of these port closures on Singapore’s GDP growth and inflation rate is therefore also expected to be limited."
2021-10-04-T-037-S-02226,2021-10-04-T-037,2226,Gan Kim Yong,"The Government will continue to work closely with industry partners to build stronger supply chain risk management practices, to minimise the risk and impact of future supply chain disruptions."
2021-10-04-T-038-S-02227,2021-10-04-T-038,2227,Desmond Choo,"asked the Minister for Transport in view of the recent spate of COVID-19 clusters involving public transport nodes, what measures can the Ministry take to (i) ensure the resiliency of public transport services to loss of manpower from COVID-19 infections and quarantines and (ii) assure commuters that our public transport system is appropriately maintained for hygiene, especially after discovery of COVID-19 cases."
2021-10-04-T-038-S-02228,2021-10-04-T-038,2228,S Iswaran,I thank the Member for his questions. I have addressed them in my reply to Question No. 56 for oral answer on the Order Paper for 14 September 2021.
2021-10-04-T-039-S-02229,2021-10-04-T-039,2229,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,asked the Minister for Transport (a) when does the Government expect to conclude the review of public transport fares for 2022 and the fare adjustment formula; and (b) what is the projected effect on public transport fares arising from the review and potential revision of the Network Capacity Factor (NCF) component in the fare adjustment formula.
2021-10-04-T-039-S-02230,2021-10-04-T-039,2230,S Iswaran,"Due to the evolving COVID-19 situation, the Public Transport Council (PTC) is taking more time to carefully consider all relevant information as part of its annual fare review exercise. At last year’s fare review exercise, the PTC also announced that it would review the Network Capacity Factor (NCF), because the drop in ridership from the COVID-19 pandemic will significantly affect the NCF. The review is currently underway. The PTC will announce its decision for this year’s fare review exercise in due course."
2021-10-04-T-039-S-02231,2021-10-04-T-039,2231,S Iswaran,"The current fare formula is valid until the fare review exercise in 2022. The review of the fare formula will be completed in 2023, for implementation for fare review exercises from 2023 onwards."
2021-10-04-T-040-S-02232,2021-10-04-T-040,2232,Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment out of the 300,000 eligible HDB households benefiting from the Climate-Friendly Households (CFH) Programme (a) how many households have utilised the e-vouchers to date, with specific breakdowns for purchases of (i) climate-friendly refrigerators (ii) water efficient shower fittings and (iii) energy-efficient LED lights; and (b) whether the CFH Programme can be extended to the purchase of energy-efficient and climate-friendly air-conditioners, water heaters or washing machines to promote a better take-up rate of the programme."
2021-10-04-T-040-S-02233,2021-10-04-T-040,2233,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"More than 65,700 or 20% of households eligible for the Climate-Friendly Households (CFH) Programme have registered for the e-vouchers as of August 2021. About 14,000 vouchers have been utilised so far, of which 6,600 were for the purchase of energy-efficient refrigerators, 5,200 for LED lights, and 2,200 for water-efficient shower fittings. The vouchers are valid till 31 December 2023 so that households may choose to use them only when their appliances are due for replacement."
2021-10-04-T-040-S-02234,2021-10-04-T-040,2234,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"There is currently no plan to extend the programme to cover other types of appliances, as the programme is intended to help lower-income households take climate action while saving money and is targeted at essential household appliances. We will continue to monitor the take-up rate of the vouchers and review the programme at an appropriate juncture. Meanwhile, NEA and PUB have been working with community partners to conduct outreach efforts to residents on the programme."
2021-10-04-T-041-S-02235,2021-10-04-T-041,2235,Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Prime Minister whether the Government will consider additional measures and support for families with young children in childcare when both parents have consumed all their annual leave and their children need to be looked after at home.
2021-10-04-T-041-S-02236,2021-10-04-T-041,2236,Indranee Rajah,"Today, each working parent of a Singaporean child can take up to six days of paid childcare leave if their child is under seven years old. In addition, almost half of all employees in Singapore are entitled to more than 14 days of annual leave. Taken together, these leave provisions are generally sufficient for parents to care for their young children."
2021-10-04-T-041-S-02237,2021-10-04-T-041,2237,Indranee Rajah,"However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we appreciate that there may be more instances when parents have to care for their children at home, such as when schools shift to home-based learning, or when a child is issued with a Leave of Absence."
2021-10-04-T-041-S-02238,2021-10-04-T-041,2238,Indranee Rajah,"A more sustainable solution is for employers to adopt progressive workplace practices, such as Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs), to better support parents. This is because such arrangements are better tailored to the needs and context of each workplace. The Government, together with unions and employers, have introduced various Tripartite Standards to promote progressive workplace practices. These cover FWAs, Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs, and Work-Life Harmony."
2021-10-04-T-041-S-02239,2021-10-04-T-041,2239,Indranee Rajah,"Our employers are generally supportive and FWAs have become more of a norm. The proportion of employers that provided some form of FWAs has increased from 85% in 2019 to 93% in 2020. With the launch of an Alliance for Action on Work-Life Harmony in February 2021, tripartite partners are building a community of stakeholders to promote the importance of work-life harmony, and support the implementation of good work-life practices. This includes providing resources to help companies to implement work-life practices that are suitable for their sector. We hope that more employers will come on board to implement such practices, and continually enhance them to enable employees to fulfil their aspirations and responsibilities both at home and in the workplace."
2021-10-04-T-041-S-02240,2021-10-04-T-041,2240,Indranee Rajah,"Parents also rely on their social support network to care for their children. Grandparents are an important source of such support. The Government recognises this and has introduced the Proximity Housing Grant (PHG) to help Singaporeans buy a resale flat, with or near their parents or married child, for mutual care and support. This provides couples with a grant of up to $30,000 for their purchase of a resale flat to live with their parents or married child, or up to $20,000 for a resale flat to live close to their parents or married child."
2021-10-04-T-041-S-02241,2021-10-04-T-041,2241,Indranee Rajah,"What we want is to build a Singapore that is Made for Families. This has to be a whole of society effort, and go beyond what individual parents, their family members, and employers do. Everyone can contribute to creating a safe and supportive environment for families. We will continue to work closely with our partners to achieve this."
2021-10-04-T-042-S-02242,2021-10-04-T-042,2242,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Prime Minister whether the Government will consider extending the current childcare leave entitlement to those with children between seven and 12 years old (inclusive) in light for the increase home-based learning.
2021-10-04-T-042-S-02243,2021-10-04-T-042,2243,Indranee Rajah,"We fully empathise with the challenges faced by working parents when schools shift to home-based learning (HBL) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Working parents with children aged seven to 12 years old can each take two days of paid Extended Childcare Leave, in addition to their annual leave entitlements."
2021-10-04-T-042-S-02244,2021-10-04-T-042,2244,Indranee Rajah,"Primary schools and student care centres also remain open during HBL days, to care for students whose parents are unable to secure alternative care arrangements."
2021-10-04-T-042-S-02245,2021-10-04-T-042,2245,Indranee Rajah,"The Ministry of Education (MOE) has also developed a set of practical tips as part of the ""Parent Kits"" accessible on MOE’s website, to help parents in supporting their child’s HBL."
2021-10-04-T-042-S-02246,2021-10-04-T-042,2246,Indranee Rajah,"It would be difficult to extend childcare leave to cover all HBL days. Currently, HBL for primary schools is implemented to curb the transmission of COVID-19. Given that the number of HBL days required depends largely on the national COVID-19 situation, extending childcare leave to cover all these days would not be feasible. As explained in my earlier replies to Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mr Louis Ng’s previous parliamentary questions on childcare leave, we need to take a practical approach to calibrating leave provisions, to avoid affecting parents’ employability. At the same time, extending childcare leave by anything less would not address the underlying concern, which is the parents’ ability to be present at home to care for the child during HBL."
2021-10-04-T-042-S-02247,2021-10-04-T-042,2247,Indranee Rajah,A more sustainable solution would be to increase the adoption of flexible work arrangements to enable employees to better manage both work and family commitments. The Government will continue to work with stakeholders to shape and promote family-friendly workplace and social norms.
2021-10-04-T-043-S-02248,2021-10-04-T-043,2248,Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the current number of home-based food businesses operating in Singapore; (b) what has been its growth trend in the last three years; and (c) how can such businesses be supported with some form of licensing requirements tailored to home kitchens to support the sustainable growth of this sector.
2021-10-04-T-043-S-02249,2021-10-04-T-043,2249,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) in the past five years, what is the annual number of food poisoning cases that have occurred as a result of consuming food sold by home-based food businesses; and (b) what are the food hygiene safety standards imposed on home-based food businesses."
2021-10-04-T-043-S-02250,2021-10-04-T-043,2250,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"To supplement the household income of residents, home-based businesses are permitted to operate under the Housing & Development Board’s (HDB) and Urban Redevelopment Authority’s (URA) home-based business schemes, for residents living in HDB and private residential premises respectively. The scale of home-based businesses is limited by conditions under these schemes. For instance, the business should not materially change the residential nature of the premises. Residents must also not employ any persons outside the household, use non-domestic heavy equipment, move goods by vans and trucks, and inconvenience their neighbours, amongst others. HDB and URA do not have records of the number of home-based businesses, including those engaged in food, as approval is not required for these activities."
2021-10-04-T-043-S-02251,2021-10-04-T-043,2251,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) takes a risk-based approach in regulating food businesses. As the food safety risks associated with small-scale home-based food businesses are low, SFA does not require them to be licensed. Home-based food businesses are, however, subject to the Environmental Public Health Act and the Sale of Food Act and are required to ensure that the food they sell is prepared in a manner that is safe for human consumption. They should comply with SFA’s guidelines on good food safety handling practices. SFA will investigate feedback or food safety incidents linked to the home-based food businesses and take enforcement or other necessary action in the event of food safety breaches."
2021-10-04-T-043-S-02252,2021-10-04-T-043,2252,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The number of food poisoning-related feedback linked to home-based food businesses which the Ministry of Health (MOH), National Environment Agency (NEA) and SFA received over the past five years remain low, at less than five cases on average per year. Of these, investigations found that only one case from 2019 could be attributed to consumption of food prepared by a home-based food business. SFA took action against the home-based food business owner, by prohibiting commercial food preparation and distribution from the unit. With regard to the recent suspected food poisoning case involving a home-based food business, The Peachy Sugarmaker, investigations into the cause of the food poisoning incident are still ongoing."
2021-10-04-T-043-S-02253,2021-10-04-T-043,2253,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The completion of the Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) Food Safety Course Level 1 is currently a requirement for all food handlers working in licensed food premises. SFA is considering the need to make it mandatory for home-based food business owners to undergo training and certification under the WSQ Food Safety Course in order to uplift the standards of their food safety practices, and will consult the public."
2021-10-04-T-043-S-02254,2021-10-04-T-043,2254,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"If home-based food businesses are keen to expand operations beyond what their homes can support, they should set up licensed food premises outside their homes."
2021-10-04-T-044-S-02255,2021-10-04-T-044,2255,He Ting Ru,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in relation to the appointment of the new Chief Executive Officer of the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) from December 2021 (a) how many candidates were considered for the role; (b) what were the factors and qualifications considered for the candidates; and (c) why was the final decision made to appoint a CEO with no early childhood or educational experience.
2021-10-04-T-044-S-02256,2021-10-04-T-044,2256,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In coordination with the Public Service Division, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) had considered several qualified candidates to be appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA). Mr Tan Chee Wee was assessed to be the most suitable among the candidates. Mr Tan is not unfamiliar with the social sector as he had previously served in the then-Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports from 2006 to 2008, where he supervised the macro-planning of government-funded social services and development of the social service sector, building up capabilities and human resources."
2021-10-04-T-044-S-02257,2021-10-04-T-044,2257,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,
2021-10-04-T-045-S-02258,2021-10-04-T-045,2258,Gerald Giam Yean Song,asked the Prime Minister (a) how many currently retired SAF officers with the rank of colonel or ME7 and above have held senior positions in public sector organisations; (b) how does PSD determine which officers have sufficient competencies to lead these organisations despite not having had civilian work experience; and (c) whether PSD has considered requiring these officers to spend several years building up sectoral knowledge and skills before taking the helm of these organisations.
2021-10-04-T-045-S-02259,2021-10-04-T-045,2259,Chan Chun Sing,"As at 24 September 2021, there are 15 officers formerly from the SAF who are currently holding senior leadership appointments in the Public Service (e.g. Permanent Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries and Chief Executives). They form around 10% of these appointments. Looking at the figures another way, of the SAF personnel holding the rank of Colonel or ME7 and above who retired between 2010 and now, about 7% went on to assume senior Public Service appointments."
2021-10-04-T-045-S-02260,2021-10-04-T-045,2260,Chan Chun Sing,"In line with recruitment for other positions in the Public Service, we adopt the principle of ""best available person for the job"" in recruiting for senior appointments. Agencies typically consider candidates from within the ranks of their organisations, the wider Public Service including the Uniformed Services, and where relevant, the private sector. When it comes to former Uniformed Services officers, agencies would take a considered view of the officer’s career experience and competencies/qualities, together with other available candidates, before deciding on the best person for the senior role."
2021-10-04-T-045-S-02261,2021-10-04-T-045,2261,Chan Chun Sing,"Candidates from the SAF, or the Uniformed Services in general, including the Home Team, would have served in roles that have developed in them a range of competencies, such as strategic leadership, organisation transformation, policy formulation, running of large-scale operations, and technology management, that are generally relevant to senior management positions in the Public Service. They also have valuable experience in working with, understanding, motivating, and winning the confidence of Full-time and Operationally Ready National Servicemen who are Singaporeans from all walks of life. Officers who demonstrate the capacity to assume top leadership positions are tested and prepared through challenging postings and leadership programmes. In addition, these officers are provided opportunities to develop Whole-of-Government perspectives through inter-agency projects, board directorships and external postings to the Public Service during their military careers. These experiences prepare the officers to assume senior appointments in the military, and also provide them with the background and perspective to take on senior leadership positions in the wider Public Service, if called upon and found suitable."
2021-10-04-T-045-S-02262,2021-10-04-T-045,2262,Chan Chun Sing,"Sector-specific knowledge and skills are part of the considerations, but not the only consideration. Public Service leadership teams are expected to comprise leaders who bring diverse experiences to the table and operate cohesively as a team, tapping on each other’s skills and experiences."
2021-10-04-T-046-S-02263,2021-10-04-T-046,2263,Desmond Choo,asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what is the Ministry’s guidance to public sector agencies and private companies who are victims of ransomware; (b) how many cases have been reported to the Ministry over the last three years; (c) whether the Ministry can consider setting standards for cybersecurity; and (d) what are the Ministry’s plans to upgrade Singapore’s and SMEs’ capabilities against ransomware.
2021-10-04-T-046-S-02264,2021-10-04-T-046,2264,Josephine Teo,"Ransomware has become an issue of increasing concern for Singapore, and the world."
2021-10-04-T-046-S-02265,2021-10-04-T-046,2265,Josephine Teo,"Ransomware incidents have increased significantly in Singapore – we saw a more than fourfold rise in ransomware incidents reported between 2018 and 2020, from 21 to 89 cases. In the first half of 2021 alone, 68 cases were reported to the SPF and the Singapore Computer Emergency Response Team (SingCERT). It is likely that there were more cases that were not reported. This trend mirrors the rise of the ransomware threat globally, with increasing use of digital devices and growing sophistication of cyber criminals."
2021-10-04-T-046-S-02266,2021-10-04-T-046,2266,Josephine Teo,"If you fall victim to a ransomware attack, the Government does not recommend the payment of ransoms. These attackers are criminals, and the payment of ransom does not guarantee that the victim will be able to restore its systems, or that the data will be decrypted as promised; or that the data that was stolen will not be published eventually. The payment of ransom also encourages these cyber criminals to continue their malicious activities and target more victims. Cyber criminals may view organisations that have paid up as a soft target, and attack them again. Instead, we encourage everyone to adopt good cyber hygiene practices to minimise the risk of falling victim to ransomware."
2021-10-04-T-046-S-02267,2021-10-04-T-046,2267,Josephine Teo,"To this end, prevention is key. SingCERT issues advisories on measures that businesses and individuals should adopt to better secure their systems. These include regularly updating software, using strong passwords, and enhancing monitoring to detect anomalous activity."
2021-10-04-T-046-S-02268,2021-10-04-T-046,2268,Josephine Teo,"However, attackers are always looking out for weak points to exploit, and businesses need to be prepared so that they can recover from an attack and restore businesses operations with minimal delay. Businesses should identify their business-critical assets and functions, and ensure that they perform back-ups of critical data and operating systems regularly. Importantly, these back-ups should be kept offline to allow rapid restoration of systems. Businesses should also practice their incident response and business continuity plans to ensure that employees know the required responses to any form of cyberattack. This is similar to running fire drills. More details on these measures are available on SingCERT’s website."
2021-10-04-T-046-S-02269,2021-10-04-T-046,2269,Josephine Teo,"The public sector takes a tiered approach to defending our systems and data. First, Government agencies have cybersecurity measures in place to prevent malicious attacks, including ransomware. Second, agencies closely monitor their networks and systems for anomalous activities, to detect and arrest security breaches that manage to overcome these preventive measures. Finally, business continuity measures, including data backups, are in place to enable speedy recovery. These measures are exercised regularly to familiarise public officers in handling ransomware incidents."
2021-10-04-T-046-S-02270,2021-10-04-T-046,2270,Josephine Teo,"The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) is working towards raising the cybersecurity posture of enterprises in Singapore. Under the SG Cyber Safe Programme, CSA is developing Cybersecurity Toolkits, which serve as a starting point for businesses to implement appropriate cyber measures. CSA is also developing a SG Cyber Safe Trustmark, which will help customers and partners identify enterprises with good cybersecurity measures. Details of these will be made known in due course."
2021-10-04-T-046-S-02271,2021-10-04-T-046,2271,Josephine Teo,"The Government takes the ransomware threat very seriously. The recent Colonial Pipeline incident in the US is an example of a ransomware attack that has spillover effects into the physical world, and can cause significant disruptions to our daily lives. It is important for enterprises to put in place measures to safeguard their systems and networks to minimise the risk of falling prey to ransomware attacks, and also be able to recover quickly should they suffer a ransomware attack. This is why the Government is developing information resources to empower businesses to better protect their systems and networks. But we cannot do this alone. Cybersecurity is a team sport and we need everyone to play their part. We encourage all enterprises to make use of these resources once they are made available."
2021-10-04-T-047-S-02272,2021-10-04-T-047,2272,Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether HDB has the organic expertise and capabilities to identify root causes of persistent water seepage and leakage situations at older HDB flats and to provide holistic and longer-term solutions; and (b) whether HDB and BCA can work in concert with the building maintenance contractors to strengthen industry capabilities and improve overall cost efficiencies and productivity in repairing seepages and leakages at older HDB flats.
2021-10-04-T-047-S-02273,2021-10-04-T-047,2273,Desmond Lee,"Water may penetrate through joints or cracks in external walls or roofs due to natural deterioration, and wear and tear. The external walls and roofs of HDB blocks are common property managed by the Town Councils. Town Councils are advised to keep them in good condition by carrying out regular maintenance and repairs. HDB can provide technical advice to Town Councils on the root causes of leaks and appropriate repair methods, which could vary from case to case. To enhance Town Councils’ technical competence and to guide Town Councils in maintenance-related works, HDB also provides training to Town Councils on a series of topics, including repair of external wall seepage."
2021-10-04-T-047-S-02274,2021-10-04-T-047,2274,Desmond Lee,"Similarly, ceiling leaks that occur in HDB flats generally arise due to wear and tear of the waterproofing membrane over time. In such cases, the responsibility for repairs is shared jointly between the upper and lower-floor flat owners. HDB provides assistance to residents via the Goodwill Repair Assistance (GRA) Scheme, where HDB co-pays 50% of the repair cost, with the remaining 50% co-shared equally between the upper and lower-floor flat owners. For complex and recurring issues which contractors are unable to rectify, HDB will assist in the investigations and provide advice where required."
2021-10-04-T-047-S-02275,2021-10-04-T-047,2275,Desmond Lee,"HDB has also worked with contractors to improve on current repair methods for ceiling leaks, and has identified two new repair methods – nanotechnology waterproofing system and overlaying waterproofing membrane system. These technologies provide alternative repair options for residents who do not wish to hack their toilet tiles or who prefer to keep the existing finishes in their toilets. The nanotechnology waterproofing system is currently offered under the GRA Scheme, and HDB is reviewing the overlaying waterproofing membrane system with contractors."
2021-10-04-T-048-S-02276,2021-10-04-T-048,2276,Desmond Choo,asked the Minister for Education (a) what is the Ministry's approach to working with families on students' unsupervised consumption of digital content; and (b) how can the Ministry help to mitigate against the unintended effects of over-consumption especially amongst younger students.
2021-10-04-T-048-S-02277,2021-10-04-T-048,2277,Chan Chun Sing,"Cyber Wellness has been identified as an area of focus for students, and MOE has enhanced its Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum to highlight safe and healthy online usage, while using scenario-based learning to help students better understand harmful online influences. That said, it is important that parents work closely with schools to inculcate good online habits and help manage their child’s use of devices at home. To support parents to manage their child’s online habits, MOE has shared Cyber Wellness resources for parents, through platforms such as the MOE Parent Kit Website and social media pages on Facebook and Instagram."
2021-10-04-T-048-S-02278,2021-10-04-T-048,2278,Chan Chun Sing,"To mitigate against the unintended impact of technology use, Cyber Wellness lessons in CCE nurture students to be safe, respectful and responsible users of cyber space and to be a positive peer influence. Students are also taught to seek help from trusted adults should they or their friends require support or guidance on cyber issues. This includes issues such as cyber bullying, online harassment and online grooming."
2021-10-04-T-048-S-02279,2021-10-04-T-048,2279,Chan Chun Sing,"For secondary students who have been equipped with personal learning devices under the National Digital Literacy Programme, schools can set screen time limits to prevent over-use by students. These limits can be further customised by parents. Such measures are part of schools’ efforts to ensure that the use of devices is well-balanced and supports students’ holistic learning experiences."
2021-10-04-T-048-S-02280,2021-10-04-T-048,2280,Chan Chun Sing,"Healthy online habits require a whole of society effort to inculcate. Schools collaborate with community partners to emphasize efforts and increase outreach.  Organisations like TOUCH Community Services, for example, reach out to parents, to equip and empower them with the necessary digital and parenting skills to support their children in navigating the digital space."
2021-10-04-T-048-S-02281,2021-10-04-T-048,2281,Chan Chun Sing,
2021-10-04-T-049-S-02282,2021-10-04-T-049,2282,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Education (a) whether concussion-related injuries are common among students involved in contact sports as part of their co-curricular activities (CCAs); and (b) what are the safeguards put in place to ensure the long-term health of students who engage in such sports.
2021-10-04-T-049-S-02283,2021-10-04-T-049,2283,Chan Chun Sing,"Concussion-related injuries are not common among students involved in contact sports. On average, less than eight cases of concussion-related injuries have occurred each year in contact sports in schools and National School Games (NSG) from 2017 to 2019. Due to disruptions and cancellations of sports CCAs and NSG competitions, only two cases of concussion-related injury were reported in 2020 with none reported in 2021, to date."
2021-10-04-T-049-S-02284,2021-10-04-T-049,2284,Chan Chun Sing,"MOE takes a comprehensive approach when managing safety in physical sports activities in schools, with measures covering pre-activity, during-activity, and post-activity management. Schools are provided with physical sports CCA safety resources on sports concussion and safety management guides for six high-contact sports training (basketball, football, hockey, judo, rugby, taekwondo). These guides provide sport-specific information required to ensure the safety of student athletes. For example, all students participating in rugby CCA must learn how to execute different tackling techniques correctly to minimise injury risks."
2021-10-04-T-049-S-02285,2021-10-04-T-049,2285,Chan Chun Sing,"Additionally, MOE provides resources to guide schools in recognising concussion injuries in our students. A set of sports concussion management guidelines has also been provided to guide schools on managing the recovery process if a concussion-related injury occurs."
2021-10-04-T-049-S-02286,2021-10-04-T-049,2286,Chan Chun Sing,"Schools follow standard procedures to protect the long-term health of students involved in high-risk sports. When a student is suspected of a concussion injury, he would cease participation immediately and be advised to seek medical attention. For students who have incurred a concussion injury, clearance from a medical practitioner would be necessary before returning to competitive sports. In preparation to return to competitive sports, a Graduated Return-To-Sport (RTS) strategy, which guides the progressive increment in the intensity of physical activities, is practised."
2021-10-04-T-049-S-02287,2021-10-04-T-049,2287,Chan Chun Sing,"To better safeguard students against potential head injuries in sports like Taekwondo and Softball, head guards and helmets are compulsory for all students. In addition, paramedics trained in head-spine injury management are present at the competition venues for Rugby and Judo at the NSG."
2021-10-04-T-049-S-02288,2021-10-04-T-049,2288,Chan Chun Sing,
2021-10-04-T-050-S-02289,2021-10-04-T-050,2289,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"asked the Minister for Education (a) whether there is a standardised protocol and tracking process across post-Primary educational institutions to intervene for youths who stop going to school; and (b) whether there is centralised assistance available for such youths who are not in education or employment, who may wish to go back to school."
2021-10-04-T-050-S-02290,2021-10-04-T-050,2290,Chan Chun Sing,"The Ministry of Education, schools and partner agencies adopt an integrated approach towards enabling students to complete their secondary education. Hence the attrition rate has been reduced from 3.6% in 2002 to less than 1% in the past 10 years."
2021-10-04-T-050-S-02291,2021-10-04-T-050,2291,Chan Chun Sing,"Early upstream intervention in school is provided to strengthen at-risk students’ engagement and sense of connectedness to school. Once students show early signs of disengagement, they are individually tracked and supported. Form teachers and School Counsellors reach out to these students to understand and address their challenges. Student Welfare Officers will also conduct home visits and work with Family Service Centres (FSCs) to engage parents and encourage the student who have been absent to return to school. Secondary schools have also set up after-school programmes to provide mentoring and learning support to students."
2021-10-04-T-050-S-02292,2021-10-04-T-050,2292,Chan Chun Sing,"Under UPLIFT (Uplifting Pupils in Life and Inspiring Families Taskforce), the UPLIFT Community Pilot addresses absenteeism issues early through school-based and community-based support. Schools refer students with emerging signs of absenteeism and their families to an UPLIFT Town-Level Coordinator (TLC) based at the Social Service Office (SSO) who will assess their needs and refer them to appropriate agencies, local programmes and resources."
2021-10-04-T-050-S-02293,2021-10-04-T-050,2293,Chan Chun Sing,"Every effort is made to counsel and dissuade at-risk students from dropping out of school. For students with chronic absenteeism and who drop out notwithstanding the school’s efforts, MOE taps on partners such as the Social Service Offices (SSOs), FSCs, Self-Help Groups and Social Service Agencies (SSAs) to continue supporting them. For example, they may be referred to the Enhanced STEP-UP Programme where youth workers in appointed SSAs engage the students to support their continued education."
2021-10-04-T-050-S-02294,2021-10-04-T-050,2294,Chan Chun Sing,"School drop-outs can resume their education by approaching MOE or the school they were last enrolled in. Their needs will be assessed and the student will be re-admitted appropriately. Upon re-admission, students will receive additional support to smoothen their return and enable them to complete their education."
2021-10-04-T-051-S-02295,2021-10-04-T-051,2295,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the countries and the number of countries that Singapore is pursuing Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTLs) with; (b) what are the considerations and factors used to determine these countries; and (c) what are the factors and threshold levels used for the expansion or suspension of active VTLs once they are introduced.
2021-10-04-T-051-S-02296,2021-10-04-T-051,2296,S Iswaran,The Government is taking a careful and calibrated approach in re-opening our borders. We consider various public health and operational risk factors to determine which countries or regions to establish Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTLs) with.
2021-10-04-T-051-S-02297,2021-10-04-T-051,2297,S Iswaran,"We commenced our first VTLs with Germany and Brunei last month, and MOT is actively working on expanding the VTL scheme to more countries and will announce the details when ready."
2021-10-04-T-051-S-02298,2021-10-04-T-051,2298,S Iswaran,We will adjust the VTL protocols if necessary as the COVID-19 situation in Singapore and overseas evolves.
2021-10-04-T-052-S-02299,2021-10-04-T-052,2299,Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for Health with regard to the recent Court convictions of nurses from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for committing offences against mentally ill in-patients at IMH, what steps are being taken to ensure the safety and dignity of these in-patients and, at the same time, provide for sufficient support of IMH psychiatric nurses and health attendants to deal with challenges that they face in caring for mentally ill in-patients."
2021-10-04-T-052-S-02300,2021-10-04-T-052,2300,Ong Ye Kung,"Patient safety and well-being is a top priority of our public healthcare institutions. We do not tolerate any inappropriate behaviour against patients and will take action where necessary, as with the recent IMH case."
2021-10-04-T-052-S-02301,2021-10-04-T-052,2301,Ong Ye Kung,"Within IMH, staff are trained to care professionally for mental health patients, and staff work in teams to support one another. Care and clinical protocols are also in place to manage challenging situations. Some patients who are well enough participate to improve ward safety through feedback and suggestions during weekly discussions with IMH’s nursing management. Internal nursing auditors carry out monthly audits of staff knowledge, documentation and the environment to ensure the safety of patients and staff. Any unexplained injuries and reported incidents will be thoroughly investigated."
2021-10-04-T-052-S-02302,2021-10-04-T-052,2302,Ong Ye Kung,Working in the mental healthcare setting can be challenging. IMH looks after the mental well-being of its team by ensuring that staff are equipped with knowledge and skills to de-escalate difficult situations and by instituting peer support for daily work with a team-based work structure. Individualised assistance is also offered to staff who require emotional and psychological support after experiencing work-related challenges. Supervisors and staff are reminded to look out for their fellow colleagues who may be stressed or burnt out and extend support to them.
2021-10-04-T-052-S-02303,2021-10-04-T-052,2303,Ong Ye Kung,The Ministry will continue to work with our public healthcare institutions to care for the well-being of our patients and healthcare workers.
2021-10-04-T-052-S-02304,2021-10-04-T-052,2304,Ong Ye Kung,
2021-10-04-T-053-S-02305,2021-10-04-T-053,2305,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Health based on data from the total burden of disease, for each year in the past five years, what is the number of deaths attributable to second-hand smoke."
2021-10-04-T-053-S-02306,2021-10-04-T-053,2306,Ong Ye Kung,"Based on the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study, the annual total number of deaths attributable to second-hand smoke for Singapore was estimated to be 261 in 2015, 266 in 2016, 271 in 2017, 284 in 2018, and 296 in 2019. However, after adjusting for the effect of an ageing population, a reduction in the age-standardised death rate was observed from 4.32 per 100,000 population in 2015 to 4.00 per 100,000 population in 2019."
2021-10-04-T-054-S-02307,2021-10-04-T-054,2307,Gan Thiam Poh,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in the past 10 years, what is the number of work pass holders who have been arrested for overstaying after the expiry of their passes; and (b) how many of these individuals have subsequently been charged and convicted."
2021-10-04-T-054-S-02308,2021-10-04-T-054,2308,K Shanmugam,"From 2011 to 2020, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority investigated a total of 1,746 work pass holders for overstaying offences. Of these, 1,027 were subsequently charged and convicted."
2021-10-04-T-054-S-02309,2021-10-04-T-054,2309,K Shanmugam,"For the others, depending on the facts, such as whether they had reasonable cause for overstaying, and the duration they overstayed, ICA had imposed a composition fine or issued a warning."
2021-10-04-T-055-S-02310,2021-10-04-T-055,2310,Tan Yia Swam,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in the past five years, how many cases of hate crime have been investigated; and (b) of these cases, how many have been (i) issued warning letters (ii) issued compound fines (iii) prosecuted and fines issued and (iv) prosecuted and jail terms issued respectively.  ."
2021-10-04-T-055-S-02311,2021-10-04-T-055,2311,K Shanmugam,"'Hate crime' can refer to any crime where victims are targeted because of an attribute that they hold, such as their race, religion, nationality, gender, age, or any other form of identity or belief."
2021-10-04-T-055-S-02312,2021-10-04-T-055,2312,K Shanmugam,"In our crime statistics, we do not track the offenders’ motivation behind targeting their victims."
2021-10-04-T-055-S-02313,2021-10-04-T-055,2313,K Shanmugam,"That said, we can use sections 298 and 298A of the Penal Code – which cover acts that affect racial and religious harmony – as proxies for racial and religious hate crime."
2021-10-04-T-055-S-02314,2021-10-04-T-055,2314,K Shanmugam,"In the last five years, Police investigated a total of 143 cases under sections 298 and 298A of the Penal Code. Of these, 55 cases resulted in warning. None were compounded. Two cases were fined, five cases were jailed, and five cases were fined and jailed. These figures do not include cases where investigations are still ongoing, or where no further action was taken."
2021-10-04-T-056-S-02315,2021-10-04-T-056,2315,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs in view of the growing complexity of international developments, including the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan, the creation of the Australia-UK-US alliance and the assertiveness of China, whether the Government (i) conducts regular assessments of public sentiment among Singaporeans in response to international developments and (ii) plans to conduct a sustained public education process to educate Singaporeans, both young and old, on Singapore’s core national interests."
2021-10-04-T-056-S-02316,2021-10-04-T-056,2316,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Foreign policy begins at home. Our diplomacy is only credible if we could maintain a domestic consensus on Singapore’s core interests and our foreign policy priorities. This is why MFA has undertaken sustained efforts to engage Singaporeans on our foreign policy through different means. For example, MFA works with MOE to engage our students in Junior Colleges, Millennia Institute and Integrated Programme Schools through sharing sessions by our retired ambassadors. These sessions cover our core national interests and how Singapore conducts foreign policy as a small city state in Southeast Asia. Such sessions promote two-way communication and allow our younger generation to share what foreign policy issues are top-of-mind. Through regular dialogues, we hope that our younger generation of Singaporeans can better understand the considerations when formulating and implementing our foreign policy."
2021-10-04-T-056-S-02317,2021-10-04-T-056,2317,Vivian Balakrishnan,"In addition, MFA’s political office holders, senior management and our foreign service officers regularly engage institutes of higher learning, think tanks, media and other fora on Singapore’s foreign policy and other geopolitical developments. MFA also regularly communicates key messages on Singapore’s foreign policy in a variety of formats and vernacular languages, through media interviews and digital media platforms, to reach out to Singaporeans across all age groups. What we aim for is a Singaporean public that is well-informed, that recognises the geostrategic forces at play and understand our national interests."
2021-10-04-T-056-S-02318,2021-10-04-T-056,2318,Vivian Balakrishnan,MFA does not conduct regular polling of public sentiment in response to international developments.
2021-10-04-T-057-S-02319,2021-10-04-T-057,2319,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) whether he can provide an update on the situation in Afghanistan from a foreign policy perspective; and (b) how does the change in government impact the bilateral ties that Singapore has with Afghanistan especially given the past involvement of the SAF in Afghanistan.
2021-10-04-T-057-S-02320,2021-10-04-T-057,2320,Vivian Balakrishnan,"The situation in Afghanistan remains challenging and difficult, especially the humanitarian impact on civilians. The United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said that Afghanistan is ""on the verge of a dramatic humanitarian disaster""."
2021-10-04-T-057-S-02321,2021-10-04-T-057,2321,Vivian Balakrishnan,"There have been active discussions on the situation in Afghanistan at the multilateral level, including on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. These discussions have included a focus on improving the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan."
2021-10-04-T-057-S-02322,2021-10-04-T-057,2322,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Singapore will continue to monitor developments in Afghanistan closely. We hope that all parties, including the Taliban, will protect the safety of civilians and allow humanitarian assistance to reach the intended recipients. While the future of Afghanistan must be determined by the Afghan people, it is also in the international community’s interest to see an Afghanistan at peace with itself and the world. To this end, Singapore welcomes United Nations Security Council Resolution 2593 (2021) which called for Afghanistan to, inter alia, ""not be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or to finance terrorist acts, and reiterates the importance of combating terrorism in Afghanistan""."
2021-10-04-T-057-S-02323,2021-10-04-T-057,2323,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Mr Dennis Tan had referred to Singapore’s past contributions as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan from 2007 to 2013. We did so because Afghanistan was a key battlefront in the global fight against terrorism. This posed a security threat to Singapore as the Jemaah Islamiyah group had direct links to Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. The counter-terrorism efforts of the coalition, including Singapore, have contributed to our security over the past 14 years. As terrorism remains a threat to Singapore, we certainly hope that Afghanistan will not revert to becoming a safe haven for any terrorist groups."
2021-10-04-T-057-S-02324,2021-10-04-T-057,2324,Vivian Balakrishnan,"On the impact on bilateral ties, our engagement with Afghanistan has been limited to technical assistance through our Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP). Prior to the collapse of the previous government, Afghanistan accounted for the highest number of SCP participants amongst countries in Central Asia, with 837 officials having attended our training courses. As and when the situation permits, we hope to continue this assistance through our SCP."
2021-10-04-T-058-S-02325,2021-10-04-T-058,2325,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Defence what is the Ministry's assessment on the Australia-UK-US pact and whether the proposed Australian nuclear submarines will be allowed to use Singapore's port facilities.
2021-10-04-T-058-S-02326,2021-10-04-T-058,2326,Ng Eng Hen,"Multilateral security groupings in any geographic region has been a fact of life, as countries seek to secure their own strategic interests. For Singapore, as a small country, we must adjust nimbly to existing and new groupings to guard our own interests too. For example, Singapore is a member of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) between Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and the UK, that commemorates its Golden Jubilee this year. Each FPDA exercise can involve up to 4000 troops, 18 ships, 50 to 60 aircraft, and even submarines, but our ASEAN neighbours accept this, as the grouping is not aimed at any one country but, as intended in its origin, to act as a security umbrella for the peace and stability of Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore. The FPDA is inclusive. We have invited the Secretary-General of the Indonesian Ministry of Defence (KEMHAN), as well as ASEAN Defence Attaches to observe our exercises."
2021-10-04-T-058-S-02327,2021-10-04-T-058,2327,Ng Eng Hen,"The 10 nation ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM) and the 18 nation ADMM-Plus was formed 15 and 11 years ago. This security grouping has conducted more than 20 military exercises among its seven Expert Working Groups in the last decade. In Asia, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation involves eight member states, four observers and six dialogue partners. The SCO recently concluded its 6th biennial multinational counter-terrorism military exercise. The Quad of Australia, India, Japan and the US had its first dialogue in 2007 and re-established dialogues in 2017 after a hiatus. The AUKUS pact would be the latest addition."
2021-10-04-T-058-S-02328,2021-10-04-T-058,2328,Ng Eng Hen,"Whatever the configuration, Singapore encourages each grouping to contribute constructively to regional peace and stability, through transparent and open dialogue with others outside the group, and with activities that are non-confrontational, do not escalate tensions and promote a rules-based order. Member nations of these groups should also abide by the ASEAN treaties that they have signed individually, such as the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia. MINDEF will continue to engage all groups to push for these outcomes."
2021-10-04-T-058-S-02329,2021-10-04-T-058,2329,Ng Eng Hen,"Australia’s nuclear-powered submarine programme is expected to take more than 10 years before it rolls out its first submarine for deployment. If at that time, Australia requests to use facilities at our naval bases, we would treat such requests as we do now with various countries. In general, we will facilitate port calls by naval vessels from countries that we have good bilateral ties with and that promote stability in this region. These vessels will have to abide by our laws, regulations and rules during port calls, especially those pertaining to safety for nuclear-powered submarines."
2021-10-04-T-059-S-02330,2021-10-04-T-059,2330,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment with regard to the implementation of mandatory tray returning at public dining spaces from 1 June 2021 (a) how many advisories were issued to diners during the advisory period from 1 June 2021 to 31 August 2021, disaggregated by month; (b) what were the challenges faced by NEA officers during the advisory period; and (c) how are such challenges ameliorated."
2021-10-04-T-059-S-02331,2021-10-04-T-059,2331,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"During the advisory period from 1 June to 31 August 2021, the National Environment Agency (NEA) issued an average of about 6,000 advisories daily across the 110 hawker centres to remind diners to return their dirty trays, crockery and clear their litter after their meals. Enforcement action was not taken during this advisory period."
2021-10-04-T-059-S-02332,2021-10-04-T-059,2332,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The majority of diners were cooperative and would comply when advised to do so during the advisory period. Nevertheless, NEA enforcement officers occasionally encountered diners who did not heed their advice. In such cases, the officers would explain to the diners the rationale of the mandatory tray and crockery return policy and urge them to comply with the rules."
2021-10-04-T-059-S-02333,2021-10-04-T-059,2333,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Following the end of the advisory period, NEA has started to enforce against table littering in hawker centres from 1 September. For diners who do not clear their dirty trays, crockery and litter, enforcement officers will first advise them to do so. Diners who refuse to heed officers’ advice will have their particulars taken down and be issued written warnings if it is their first offence. Only second and subsequent offenders will be issued fines or be sent to Court. Thus far, diners have largely complied with our advisories and only one written warning has been issued since enforcement commenced."
2021-10-04-T-060-S-02334,2021-10-04-T-060,2334,Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Government will consider increasing the penalties in respect of S Pass and Employment Pass holders who are found guilty of submitting forged documents including academic certificates to gain entry into Singapore.
2021-10-04-T-060-S-02335,2021-10-04-T-060,2335,Tan See Leng,"Under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA), Work Pass applicants found submitting forged educational qualifications are liable to a maximum fine of $20,000, or to a maximum imprisonment term of two years, or to both, upon conviction. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will also revoke offenders’ work passes and permanently bar them from employment in Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-060-S-02336,2021-10-04-T-060,2336,Tan See Leng,This is one of the higher penalties under the EFMA and is commensurate with penalties of other contraventions of a similar nature under the Immigration Act. There is no need at this time to consider further raising the maximum penalties.
2021-10-04-T-060-S-02337,2021-10-04-T-060,2337,Tan See Leng,MOM has and will continue to strengthen our screening capabilities and fraud detection efforts. Employers should also continue to do their part to ensure that their recruitment process of foreigners is rigorous.
2021-10-04-T-061-S-02338,2021-10-04-T-061,2338,Darryl David,asked the Minister for Manpower whether there are plans to manage or regulate maid agency fees and other related fees for foreign domestic helpers given that some maid agencies seem to be charging potential employers high fees.
2021-10-04-T-061-S-02339,2021-10-04-T-061,2339,Tan See Leng,"The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has been monitoring the fees charged by employment agencies (EAs). Overall, while there remains a good range of EA service fees, we have observed a general increase in the service fees that employers pay for hiring migrant domestic workers (MDWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. This could be because additional costs are incurred by EAs to enable the MDW to satisfy various COVID-19 requirements in both the source country and Singapore. In addition, their business volume has fallen due to COVID-19 travel restrictions."
2021-10-04-T-061-S-02340,2021-10-04-T-061,2340,Tan See Leng,"MOM does not regulate the service fees charged by the EAs. With more than 900 active EAs that place MDWs in Singapore, there is sufficient competition in the market. Employers may wish to compare the prices charged by different EAs and consider the packages and levels of service offered by the EAs. All EAs are required to provide a clear and accurate breakdown of the fees paid for by the employer. Action will be taken against EAs who misrepresent the costs of any regulatory requirements imposed such as local SHN and COVID-19 tests."
2021-10-04-T-062-S-02341,2021-10-04-T-062,2341,Edward Chia Bing Hui,"asked the Minister for Manpower in view of the higher COVID-19 vaccination rates in Singapore, whether the Ministry can prioritise the entry of migrant domestic workers who have been fully vaccinated at their source country."
2021-10-04-T-062-S-02342,2021-10-04-T-062,2342,Tan See Leng,"As recently announced, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will start accepting applications for entry approval for migrant domestic workers (MDWs) on 15 October 2021, for entry into Singapore from 1 November 2021. These MDWs will be required to be fully vaccinated before they arrive in Singapore. To manage the risk of COVID-19 importation and protect public health, the entry approval quota for vaccinated travellers will continue to be managed tightly for those from countries where the COVID-19 situation remains worrying."
2021-10-04-T-062-S-02343,2021-10-04-T-062,2343,Tan See Leng,"For overseas MDWs who are not vaccinated and for those who need to enter Singapore urgently, their employers may consider the on-going industry-led pilot programme by the Association of Employment Agencies (Singapore), AEA(S), to facilitate the safe entry of MDWs into Singapore. As additional safe management measures are done prior to the MDWs’ entry into Singapore, we will not apply the vaccination condition on them. However, those who are unvaccinated will have to go through full vaccination after arriving in Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-062-S-02344,2021-10-04-T-062,2344,Tan See Leng,"As we resume entry approvals for MDWs, MOM will do our best to facilitate their entry within the parameters set by the Multi-Ministry Taskforce to safeguard public health."
2021-10-04-T-063-S-02345,2021-10-04-T-063,2345,Lim Wee Kiak,"asked the Minister for National Development as Singapore experiences rising temperatures and a hotter climate, what are the steps taken to prevent fires in our nature reserves and parks."
2021-10-04-T-063-S-02346,2021-10-04-T-063,2346,Desmond Lee,"NParks has put in place fire safety measures to minimise the occurrence of vegetation fires in our nature reserves and parks, particularly during dry periods. For example, NParks trims vegetation, clears wood debris, and maintains fire breaks in nature reserves. It also conducts patrols at fire-prone hotspots and steps up enforcement against smoking and unauthorised burning during dry spells. NParks also works closely with the SCDF and other land management agencies to regularly review its fire safety measures."
2021-10-04-T-063-S-02347,2021-10-04-T-063,2347,Desmond Lee,"NParks is also developing a Forest Fire Detection and Monitoring System for nature reserves, which will make use of closed-circuit television cameras, drones, and video analytics. The system will allow NParks officers to quickly identify a fire’s location and obtain real-time information on the fire. This system will improve the effectiveness of NParks’ fire surveillance regime, and allow NParks and SCDF to mount a more rapid response in the event of a fire."
2021-10-04-T-063-S-02348,2021-10-04-T-063,2348,Desmond Lee,"In addition, NParks has put up signs to educate the public on ways to prevent vegetation fires, such as by not smoking in nature reserves and not leaving fires unattended at camping and barbecue sites."
2021-10-04-T-064-S-02349,2021-10-04-T-064,2349,Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for National Development with regard to HDB’s recent decision to impose an income ceiling of $7,000 for applicants under the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (a) what is the basis of fixing the $7,000 income ceiling; and (b) whether HDB can consider taking into account the per capita income of the applicant’s household."
2021-10-04-T-064-S-02350,2021-10-04-T-064,2350,Desmond Lee,The Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS) provides an additional temporary housing option for eligible first-timer households awaiting the completion of their new flats.
2021-10-04-T-064-S-02351,2021-10-04-T-064,2351,Desmond Lee,"Since 2020, the demand for PPHS flats has increased due to delays in the completion of BTO flats, more people working from home and more competition for open market rental. At the same time, the supply of PPHS flats has tightened as delays in BTO completion have stalled the return of PPHS flats to HDB, and the shortage of workers has slowed down sprucing-up works for the PPHS flats before they can be rented out to new tenants."
2021-10-04-T-064-S-02352,2021-10-04-T-064,2352,Desmond Lee,"While we will be increasing the supply of PPHS flats starting from this year and over the next two years, the number of PPHS flats remains limited. Given the increased demand and supply crunch, we are prioritising families in greater need of subsidised temporary housing, and have fine-tuned the eligibility conditions and allocation process. The income ceiling of $7,000 will enable us to support families who are less able to afford renting a flat on the open market. At the same time, it is well above the median monthly household income of PPHS applicants of about $5,700. Presently, $7,000 is also the income ceiling for 3-room flats in most BTO projects in non-mature estates."
2021-10-04-T-064-S-02353,2021-10-04-T-064,2353,Desmond Lee,"Households with a monthly income of more than $7,000 but who have high monthly expenses, including larger households, may approach HDB if they require assistance with temporary housing. Their PPHS applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis."
2021-10-04-T-065-S-02354,2021-10-04-T-065,2354,Abdul Samad,"asked the Minister for National Development with regard to HDB home loan eligibility (a) whether there are appeals to waive the maximum two-time of such loans; (b) if so, how many have been approved and rejected to date; and (c) under what conditions will the appeal be successful."
2021-10-04-T-065-S-02355,2021-10-04-T-065,2355,Desmond Lee,"HDB provides up to two housing loans to eligible Singapore citizen households and this is generally sufficient to meet the life cycle needs of a flat buyer. Beyond this, households who require another housing loan may seek financing from financial institutions regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-065-S-02356,2021-10-04-T-065,2356,Desmond Lee,"Nevertheless, HDB does exercise flexibility to provide another HDB housing loan for those who have exhausted their financing options, and are in urgent need of housing, on a case-by-case basis."
2021-10-04-T-065-S-02357,2021-10-04-T-065,2357,Desmond Lee,"Between September 2020 and August 2021, about 2,900 households approached HDB for another housing loan. Around one in five of these appeals were successful."
2021-10-04-T-066-S-02358,2021-10-04-T-066,2358,Lim Wee Kiak,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what has been the utilisation rate of existing charging points (CPs) for electric vehicles; (b) what has been the response from owners of private premises such as condominiums or retail malls regarding the installation of CPs at these premises; (c) whether the installation of CPs will be made a mandatory part of new building plans; and (d) whether there are plans to install separate CPs for electric-powered motorcycles.
2021-10-04-T-066-S-02359,2021-10-04-T-066,2359,S Iswaran,"There are about 2,100 electric light vehicles, or EVs, and 2,100 charging points in Singapore today. Current utilisation rates per charger is thus likely to be low, since a typical electric car only requires a full charge once every five to seven days. Nevertheless, EV adoption has picked up pace, and utilisation rates are likely to increase."
2021-10-04-T-066-S-02360,2021-10-04-T-066,2360,S Iswaran,"There is strong interest from owners of retail malls and non-landed private residences such as condominiums to install EV chargers. For the latter group, interest has grown since the launch of the EV Common Charger Grant in July, which defrays part of the cost of installing a charger. So far, more than 50 condominium management corporations and EV charging operators have reached out to LTA to enquire about the Grant and register their interest."
2021-10-04-T-066-S-02361,2021-10-04-T-066,2361,S Iswaran,"Beyond the immediate term, the Government plans to require car parks in new developments to provide for sufficient electrical capacity to support EV charging, and ensure that a minimum number of charging points are installed. Given that EVs will form a significant part of our vehicle population in future, it is in the interest of building owners to make these provisions. These provisions should cater to the charging of all light vehicles including motorcycles, and take into account expected EV demand and daily charging needs. EV charging operators are also studying whether cars and motorcycles can share the same charging point. That will largely depend on the site-specific configuration of parking lots and the charging systems used by cars and motorcycles."

2021-10-04-T-068-S-02368,2021-10-04-T-068,2368,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,(b) written PQ from Mr Desmond Choo filed for the next Sitting.
2021-10-04-T-068-S-02369,2021-10-04-T-068,2369,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"There are three aspects to the recent developments in China’s property sector that are relevant to Singapore. First, the exposure of Singapore’s financial system to China Evergrande Group and China’s property sector. Second, the exposure of Singapore’s property developers to China. And third, the exposure of Singapore’s economy to a possible growth slowdown in China."
2021-10-04-T-068-S-02370,2021-10-04-T-068,2370,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"First, Singapore’s banking system exposure to China’s property sector is not large."
2021-10-04-T-068-S-02371,2021-10-04-T-068,2371,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Direct exposures to China’s property sector are less than 1% of non-bank loans.
2021-10-04-T-068-S-02372,2021-10-04-T-068,2372,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Exposures to Singapore property developers with operations in China are a further 2.5% of loans to non-bank customers. However, this includes all loans to these developers, not just loans related to their Chinese operations."
2021-10-04-T-068-S-02373,2021-10-04-T-068,2373,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Our banking sector’s loan exposures to China Evergrande Group itself are insignificant.
2021-10-04-T-068-S-02374,2021-10-04-T-068,2374,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Second, with regard to Singapore developers with operations in China, MAS estimates that about 30% of their revenues in aggregate are derived from China. However, their median interest cover ratio (or ratio of earnings to interest expenses) is in aggregate more than three times."
2021-10-04-T-068-S-02375,2021-10-04-T-068,2375,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Third, while the Chinese authorities have thus far maintained stability in their financial system, the slowdown in China’s real estate sector could dampen its GDP growth. It is difficult to estimate how significant this will be, and hence how adverse its impact will be on regional economic growth. MAS and MTI are keeping a close watch on any indirect or spillover effects on the Singapore economy arising from developments in China."
2021-10-04-T-069-S-02376,2021-10-04-T-069,2376,Abdul Samad,asked the Minister for Transport whether the Certificate of Entitlement for motorcycles can be tiered according to their engine capacity especially for those 200cc and below.
2021-10-04-T-069-S-02377,2021-10-04-T-069,2377,S Iswaran,"Unlike cars, the quota for motorcycle Certificates of Entitlement (COEs) is relatively small. Further dividing the motorcycle COEs into multiple tiers would result in even smaller quotas for each sub-category and may result in significant volatility in their COE prices."
2021-10-04-T-069-S-02378,2021-10-04-T-069,2378,S Iswaran,We understand that the high motorcycle COE prices have raised concerns from Members of this House. LTA is monitoring the market situation closely and will respond as needed.

2021-10-04-T-071-S-02401,2021-10-04-T-071,2401,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"There were a number of encouraging performances at the Tokyo Olympics, such as breakthrough performances from paddler Yu Mengyu who finished 4th in the Women’s Singles Table Tennis3 and the Women’s 49erFX crew comprising Kimberly Lim and Cecilia Low who achieved the best ever performance by Team Singapore sailors at the Olympics4. Team Singapore Paralympians achieved five National Records, seven Personal Bests and two Season Bests, including Ms Yip Pin Xiu, who successfully defended her Women’s S2 50 metre(m) and 100m Backstroke titles which she won at the Rio 2016 Paralympics. On the other hand, we experienced our share of disappointments at the Games. Our athletes, more than anybody else, are disappointed when they do not perform up to their expectations and are motivated by the desire to come back stronger and better."
2021-10-04-T-071-S-02402,2021-10-04-T-071,2402,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"After each Major Games outing, there is a thorough review of Team Singapore’s performance, incorporating views from the athletes, coaches and the National Sports Associations (NSAs). Following the return of our contingents from the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics, we have already commenced our review, which takes into account not only the performance of the athletes, but also the operating environment and challenges in the run-up to the Tokyo Olympics and during the Games. This allows us to analyse performance systemically, and to consider this against the backdrop of our national High Performance Sports (HPS) system and strategies. An important priority is to enable our national athletes to train and compete uninterrupted amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic situation, to ensure that preparations for upcoming international competitions and Major Games are not affected. We will also refresh our understanding of the competitive landscape, and learn from the experience of other countries and their HPS systems."

This allows us to continually learn and build on our experiences for future Major Games, including the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games and beyond. Our current focus is to prepare for the busy Major Games schedule in 2022, including the Southeast Asian Games and ASEAN Para Games, the Commonwealth Games, as well as the Asian Games and Asian Para Games."

As mentioned in this House recently, Part V of the EPHA on the abatement of public nuisances through the use of nuisance orders, addresses public nuisances that affect the public at large. It does not apply to private nuisances, which interfere with another person’s use or enjoyment of his property."
2021-10-04-T-072-S-02406,2021-10-04-T-072,2406,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In the last six years, the number of nuisance orders issued stood at 21. Most were issued to address public nuisance arising from waste management issues at trade fairs and dust nuisance at construction sites."
2021-10-04-T-072-S-02407,2021-10-04-T-072,2407,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Prior to 2015, more than 1,700 nuisance orders were issued, with the vast majority issued for dust issues at construction sites. Dust issues from construction sites have been addressed under section 18 of the EPHA since 2015. This allows us to act more expeditiously when the construction site fails to take reasonable precautions to prevent flying dust from affecting the well-being of persons using any public place, without the need to first establish that the public at large is affected by the dust nuisance and prove that it is due to a particular construction site."

2021-10-04-T-073-S-02409,2021-10-04-T-073,2409,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Safe Management Measures (SMMs) at hawker centres, such as access control to facilitate SafeEntry check-in and restrictions on dine-in group sizes, are measures to slow down community transmissions as Singapore transits towards a COVID-19 resilient nation. The SafeEntry system helps to identify and ring-fence COVID-19 cases through contact tracing, while seating restrictions facilitate safe distancing between dining groups. The SMMs will be reviewed and recalibrated regularly based on"
2021-10-04-T-073-S-02410,2021-10-04-T-073,2410,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The National Environment Agency (NEA) has rolled out several programmes to make our hawker centres safe and clean, and help our hawkers adapt and pivot to new business models in a post-pandemic world."
2021-10-04-T-073-S-02411,2021-10-04-T-073,2411,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"These programmes include the Hawker Centres Transformation Programme (HTP) and the Hawker Centre Toilet Improvement Programme (HCTIP). Under the HTP, which will be progressively implemented at all new and redeveloped hawker centres, hawkers and patrons can look forward to improvements such as better ventilation and wider aisles. Town Councils can also tap on funding under the HCTIP to install better fittings and technology for easier cleaning and maintenance of the toilets at hawker centres. NEA is also consulting stakeholders in new hawker centres as well as those undergoing significant Repairs & Redecoration, to improve spacing at the dining areas to facilitate SMMs should they be needed. These measures will help to improve public hygiene and make our hawker centres more resilient to public health risks."
2021-10-04-T-073-S-02412,2021-10-04-T-073,2412,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In addition, an Alliance for Action (AfA) on online ordering, comprising hawker representatives, online food delivery platforms, community groups as well as NEA and the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), has been convened to help hawkers, especially those who are less digitally savvy, increase their online presence and extend customer reach. The AfA will be piloting their recommendations over the next few months. An example is the setting up of Digital Support for Hawkers (DSH) groups to support and strengthen the digital presence of hawker centres. In addition, the AfA will pilot a 'Common Acquirer' model for food delivery at 14 hawker centres, which will allow hawkers easier access to customers of all participating online ordering platforms, along with an integrated interface to receive and manage orders."

SGQR has grown from about 42,000 merchant acceptance points in 2019, to around 120,000 in 2020 and at least 260,000 merchant acceptance points today. More than 150,000 merchants operating across various services industries including retail stores in shopping malls or food stalls at hawker centres now offer SGQR as a means of payment acceptance. This represents around 75% of merchants in Singapore."

The adoption and use of SGQR under this initiative has been encouraging, as reflected in Table 2. In August 2021 alone, 11,600 stallholders in hawker centres, HDB coffee shops and JTC canteens made close to two million e-payment transactions representing a value of $18.3 million. Over 94% of these transactions were via SGQR."

2021-10-04-T-076-S-02424,2021-10-04-T-076,2424,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Singapore and ASEAN share a close and multi-faceted relationship with Australia, the UK, and the US. All three countries are Dialogue Partners of ASEAN, and have contributed to the region’s peace and security over the years. Australia and the UK are also members of the Five Power Defence Arrangements, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. We hope that the newly-established enhanced trilateral security partnership amongst Australia, the UK and the US (AUKUS) will contribute constructively to the peace and stability of the region, and complement the existing regional architecture which is open and inclusive."
2021-10-04-T-076-S-02425,2021-10-04-T-076,2425,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Singapore and ASEAN also share good and substantive relations with ASEAN’s other Dialogue Partners including China. China is the largest trading partner for all ASEAN Member States, and ASEAN has also become China’s largest trading partner. We welcome engagement with all stakeholders as we work together to uphold ASEAN Centrality in regional cooperation."
2021-10-04-T-076-S-02426,2021-10-04-T-076,2426,Vivian Balakrishnan,"Singapore has consistently articulated the importance of a peaceful, stable and secure region anchored by an open, inclusive and rules-based order in accordance with international law, including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Although competition between major powers may be inevitable, there is room for cooperation and constructive engagement between them and with other stakeholders in the region. ASEAN and our Dialogue Partners will benefit from our collective efforts to enhance regional peace, security and stability."
2021-10-04-T-077-S-02427,2021-10-04-T-077,2427,Tan Wu Meng,asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what support measures are available to assist vulnerable dependants of sole breadwinners who are either under remand or jailed; and (b) what processes exist to identify such vulnerable families who may require assistance.
2021-10-04-T-077-S-02428,2021-10-04-T-077,2428,K Shanmugam,"Families may encounter challenges, such as financial difficulties, in coping with the incarceration of a family member. The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) collaborates with community partners to identify and assist such families."
2021-10-04-T-077-S-02429,2021-10-04-T-077,2429,K Shanmugam,"All newly admitted inmates, including those under remand, are encouraged to participate in the Yellow Ribbon Community Project (YRCP). This is a grassroots-led programme where trained grassroots volunteers visit the inmates’ families and check if they need any help. The families may be referred to community resources, such as Social Service Offices (SSOs) and Family Service Centres (FSCs) for further assistance. On average, over 60% of newly admitted inmates have requested to participate in YRCP."
2021-10-04-T-077-S-02430,2021-10-04-T-077,2430,K Shanmugam,"The wide range of assistance provided by the Government including through the SSOs and FSCs, as well as other agencies, is the primary form of support. Depending on the facts and circumstances, these can cover housing, education, healthcare, as well as other daily needs."
2021-10-04-T-077-S-02431,2021-10-04-T-077,2431,K Shanmugam,"YRCP’s efforts are over and above these. Since its inception in 2010, the YRCP has grown from 74 volunteers, to over 1,100 volunteers, and reached out to more than 16,000 families. There are several YRCP initiatives. One of these is the annual distribution of “Booster Packs” containing grocery vouchers to needy families. Bookstore vouchers are also given to school-going children aged 6 to 12. This outreach has benefitted over 2,000 families."
2021-10-04-T-077-S-02432,2021-10-04-T-077,2432,K Shanmugam,"Another initiative under the YRCP is the collaboration with M3 agencies—MUIS, Mendaki and MESRA—to support Malay/ Muslim families. For example, families with young children receive tuition support from Mendaki while those facing financial difficulties receive Zakat assistance from the mosques. Trained volunteer community befrienders from the Family and Inmates Through-care Assistance Haven (FITRAH), an office under MUIS, provide families with befriending support."
2021-10-04-T-077-S-02433,2021-10-04-T-077,2433,K Shanmugam,"Families of inmates who require assistance are also identified by SPS. During regular interviews with prison officers, inmates can share issues faced by them or their family. Inmates can also speak to Visiting Justices who visit the prisons monthly, or to SPS volunteers."
2021-10-04-T-077-S-02434,2021-10-04-T-077,2434,K Shanmugam,"Once family needs are raised to the attention of prison officers, referrals will be made to SPS’s Family Resource Centres (FRCs) for assistance. For more complex cases, referrals are made to SSOs or FSCs for in-depth and longer-term interventions."
2021-10-04-T-077-S-02435,2021-10-04-T-077,2435,K Shanmugam,SPS has also worked with MSF and FSCs in 2020 to identify and triage newly admitted inmates whose families require more support. These families are then referred to the FSC nearest to their residence.
2021-10-04-T-077-S-02436,2021-10-04-T-077,2436,K Shanmugam,"Over the years, funds have been set up to assist inmates to better meet their family’s financial needs. For example, members of the Board of Visiting Justices have come together to create a small fund called Inmates’ Families Support Fund (IFSF). For inmates who opt for support, the IFSF provides a dollar-to-dollar matching on the work allowances remitted by inmates to their family. This is more to cater for a temporary need. As stated earlier, the primary support comes from the several Government initiatives, targeted at the needy."
2021-10-04-T-077-S-02437,2021-10-04-T-077,2437,K Shanmugam,"Yellow Ribbon Emergency Fund provides some financial support to ex-offenders who have just been released from prisons, as well as their family. SPS works with community partners to disburse the assistance."
2021-10-04-T-078-S-02438,2021-10-04-T-078,2438,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether existing measures are sufficient to prevent terrorist attacks in public places such as supermarkets; and (b) whether the Ministry intends to implement additional measures to prevent terrorist attacks from occurring on our soil.
2021-10-04-T-078-S-02439,2021-10-04-T-078,2439,Joan Pereira,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs in view of a recent advisory issued by the Japanese Foreign Ministry to its citizens in Southeast Asia warning of a possible terror attack in crowded places, whether there have been additional measures put in place to counter a terror threat in places of high human traffic in Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-078-S-02440,2021-10-04-T-078,2440,K Shanmugam,"The Government has strengthened our counter-terrorism capabilities and measures over the years. These efforts must be sustained even when an imminent terrorist attack against Singapore appears unlikely, as is the case now."
2021-10-04-T-078-S-02441,2021-10-04-T-078,2441,K Shanmugam,"We have enhanced our intelligence capabilities to try to detect radicalised individuals and terror groups early. We have strong Police presence on the ground to deter attacks, through vehicular and high-visibility foot patrol in public places. These patrols also provide fast response when an attack happens. Further Police resources will then be activated, including Rapid Deployment Troops (RDTs), who are trained in counter-assault and will respond swiftly on motorcycles to navigate through traffic gridlock. In addition, frontline Police officers are being progressively trained and equipped with pistols, providing officers with higher firepower as compared to revolvers."
2021-10-04-T-078-S-02442,2021-10-04-T-078,2442,K Shanmugam,"The Police have installed more than 90,000 police cameras in public residential estates, towns and neighbourhood centres, and areas of high footfall island-wide. We aim to have more than 200,000 cameras across Singapore by 2030. This boosts the Police’s capability in dealing with terrorist incidents."
2021-10-04-T-078-S-02443,2021-10-04-T-078,2443,K Shanmugam,"Ultimately, a vigilant and prepared community is our strongest defence against terrorism. The SGSecure movement has helped to sensitise, train and mobilise the community to deal with terror threats. We will continue to work with partner agencies to enhance the preparedness of our neighbourhoods, businesses, schools, workplaces and places of worship."
2021-10-04-T-078-S-02444,2021-10-04-T-078,2444,K Shanmugam,"For example, together with MOM, we have engaged business entities to raise their preparedness in dealing with security incidents. Under the enhanced bizSAFE framework, businesses are required to incorporate terrorist attack scenarios in their risk management plans. We have held seminars and produced SGSecure guides to help businesses develop and review their security measures and contingency plans. As of June 2021, more than 63,000 business entities have appointed their staff as SGSecure representatives to work with the authorities and drive SGSecure programmes in their workplace. Counter-terrorism exercises have been conducted with business entities to sharpen their operational responses. Such exercises are also conducted in retail malls involving anchor tenants such as supermarkets."
2021-10-04-T-078-S-02445,2021-10-04-T-078,2445,K Shanmugam,"The Government will continue to review our security measures as the terror threat evolves, and to strengthen community vigilance, preparedness and resilience through the SGSecure movement."
2021-10-04-T-078-S-02446,2021-10-04-T-078,2446,K Shanmugam,"Despite all we do, there can be no guarantee that a terror attack will not eventually succeed. Hence, we must also be prepared as a society to come together, support each other, and stay united in the aftermath of an attack, and not allow such to divide us, as is their aim."
2021-10-04-T-079-S-02447,2021-10-04-T-079,2447,Desmond Choo,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) for the past three years, what is the number of (i) cases of harassment by licensed moneylenders and (ii) persons prosecuted for unlicensed/licensed moneylending-related harassment; and (b) what are the new trends in such harassment."
2021-10-04-T-079-S-02448,2021-10-04-T-079,2448,K Shanmugam,"From 2018 to 2020, the Registry of Moneylenders received 75 complaints pertaining to the conduct of debt collectors engaged by licensed moneylenders, including the harassment of borrowers. The number of complaints has remained stable in the past three years."
2021-10-04-T-079-S-02449,2021-10-04-T-079,2449,K Shanmugam,"In the same period, 2,429 persons were prosecuted for harassment related to unlicensed moneylending. The Police do not track the number of prosecutions of harassment cases that are related to licensed moneylenders."
2021-10-04-T-079-S-02450,2021-10-04-T-079,2450,K Shanmugam,"As for the trend in harassment by unlicensed moneylenders, the number of reports rose from 4,608 in 2018 to 5,281 in 2019, but fell to 3,336 in 2020. The majority of these unlicensed moneylending harassment cases involved non-damage and non-confrontational methods, such as sending messages, phone calls, and placing harassment notes in letterboxes."
2021-10-04-T-080-S-02451,2021-10-04-T-080,2451,Joan Pereira,asked the Minister for Home Affairs what measures are in place to assist ex-convicts and prisoners due to be released to open bank accounts so that they can receive wages or financial assistance where applicable.
2021-10-04-T-080-S-02452,2021-10-04-T-080,2452,K Shanmugam,"Since 2015, the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) has been collaborating with POSB to assist ex-offenders to open and maintain a bank account upon their release. They are given a discharge letter issued by SPS, which lists selected POSB branches that they can visit to open a bank account. Under this collaboration, the service charge that would usually be incurred for not meeting the minimum account balance will be waived for up to a year. The account holder simply needs to present the discharge letter, and an employment referral letter from Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG) or a letter of employment."
2021-10-04-T-080-S-02453,2021-10-04-T-080,2453,K Shanmugam,"To ensure that ex-offenders without a bank account are still able to receive their wages, YRSG works with employers to make alternative arrangements, such as issuing salaries in cash cheques in the first month of employment, so as to give the ex-offenders more time to open a bank account."
2021-10-04-T-080-S-02454,2021-10-04-T-080,2454,K Shanmugam,"Ex-offenders who have just been released can seek interim financial assistance at SPS’s Family Resource Centres (FRCs), located at the Prison Link Centre in Changi. To facilitate the receipt of financial assistance by ex-offenders who do not have a bank account, the FRCs disburse cash, vouchers or EZ Link cards to them, as necessary. The FRCs will refer the ex-offenders to Social Service Offices (SSOs) for further financial assistance if required. As part of the process, the SSOs will guide ex-offenders in creating a bank account to facilitate their receipt of financial assistance."
2021-10-04-T-081-S-02455,2021-10-04-T-081,2455,Tan Yia Swam,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs in the past three years, what is the number of police reports on abuse by partners, spouses and family members respectively."
2021-10-04-T-081-S-02456,2021-10-04-T-081,2456,K Shanmugam,"There were 5,134 Police reports on family violence in 2020. Police started to track such reports to assist the Taskforce on Family Violence to better understand the situation and develop recommendations to tackle family violence."
2021-10-04-T-081-S-02457,2021-10-04-T-081,2457,K Shanmugam,"Family violence cases are varied and complex. As there could be more than one suspect and victim in a family violence case and there are many types of family relationship, it is not meaningful to break down the suspect-to-victim relationship for each case."
2021-10-04-T-082-S-02458,2021-10-04-T-082,2458,Sylvia Lim,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Government intends to enable food catering businesses to resume catering for events with appropriate COVID-19 safeguards in place and, if so, when."
2021-10-04-T-082-S-02459,2021-10-04-T-082,2459,Gan Kim Yong,"Food catering businesses are allowed to cater individually packed food for events and delivery. However, self-service food lines have not been allowed to resume. This is because the risks of COVID-19 transmission for food lines where diners serve themselves is high, and can take place through the contamination of exposed foods and the common use of serving utensils."
2021-10-04-T-082-S-02460,2021-10-04-T-082,2460,Gan Kim Yong,"Nevertheless, we recognise that in some settings, the food line format may be preferable to other forms of catering such as table service. The Government, in consultation with the Association of Catering Professionals Singapore (ACAPS), thus developed a set of safe management measures under which staff-served food lines have been allowed to resume at F&B premises and events. This form of catering is less risky than self-service food lines and allows catering companies to resume catering in a form that is closer to their traditional business format. We are continually reviewing our safe management measures and will review the resumption of self-service food lines at a suitable time, with the necessary safeguards in place, as we transition towards living with COVID-19."
2021-10-04-T-083-S-02461,2021-10-04-T-083,2461,Jamus Jerome Lim,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether supermarkets in Singapore are required to ensure consistency between their posted prices and scanned/barcoded prices; and (b) whether there is any code of practice required of local supermarkets to offer the product at the discounted posted price (or for free) as is practised in countries such as Australia and Canada.
2021-10-04-T-083-S-02462,2021-10-04-T-083,2462,Gan Kim Yong,"Under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (“CPFTA”), a deliberate act by any business to advertise its product or service at a price that is lower than what the supplier intends to sell could amount to an unfair practice which can be investigated by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS). We do not, however, have regulations that govern or punish genuine mistakes. Consumers can approach the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) to seek assistance to resolve any dispute or file a claim at the Small Claims Tribunal. Businesses can also refer to the Guidelines on Price Transparency published by CCCS for actions that suppliers should take to ensure that prices are accurate and communicated clearly, as well as good practices that suppliers should adopt to minimise potential disputes with consumers."
2021-10-04-T-084-S-02463,2021-10-04-T-084,2463,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Ministry will consider regulating the sale of gaming cards or gift cards providing for credit values for online gaming in many retail or convenience outlets so that children and young people below the age of 18 years will not be allowed to purchase such cards by themselves and without the approval of their parents.
2021-10-04-T-084-S-02464,2021-10-04-T-084,2464,Gan Kim Yong,"The Government does not have plans to regulate the sale of top-up cards for online gaming at this time. Nevertheless, we recognise that gaming addiction among youths is an area of concern. It is a complex and multi-faceted issue requiring both social interventions to engage and support affected youths and working with the industry to put in place safeguards to reduce the risk of gaming addiction. Agencies will continue to work together to monitor the situation and intervene if needed. We will also regularly review our laws to keep them up to date with technological trends."
2021-10-04-T-085-S-02465,2021-10-04-T-085,2465,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,"asked the Minister for Transport with regard to the rise in the number of COVID-19 clusters at bus interchanges (a) whether LTA and other Government agencies have reviewed the mental health and support system in place for bus drivers and, if so, what are the findings; and (b) whether LTA and other Government agencies are looking into enhancing measures to mentally support bus drivers working in segregated environments due to enhanced control measures."
2021-10-04-T-085-S-02466,2021-10-04-T-085,2466,S Iswaran,"Following the recent COVID-19 infections at the bus interchanges, LTA and the Public Transport Operators (PTOs) have enhanced safe management measures to protect our public bus workers. We recognise that while these measures are necessary for public health and safety, they place additional strain on the physical and mental well-being of our workers."
2021-10-04-T-085-S-02467,2021-10-04-T-085,2467,S Iswaran,"The well-being of our public transport workers is a key priority for the Government, PTOs and unions. The National Transport Workers’ Union (NTWU) and union leaders play an important role in helping to raise and address the concerns of public transport workers. Since the start of the pandemic last year, LTA and the PTOs have worked closely with NTWU in implementing the safe management measures."
2021-10-04-T-085-S-02468,2021-10-04-T-085,2468,S Iswaran,"There are also on-going initiatives with the Health Promotion Board (HPB) to provide customised workplace safety and health programmes, including health coaching and workshops on mental well-being. HPB also organises training for the management and supervisors of the PTOs to build a supportive workplace environment and promote mental well-being of our public transport workers. To date, over 4,000 public transport workers and management staff have benefitted from these programmes."
2021-10-04-T-085-S-02469,2021-10-04-T-085,2469,S Iswaran,"In addition, PTO supervisors frequently engage the workers to listen to their concerns and take in their feedback. Workers who are stressed or troubled will be referred to medical professionals for psychological support and counselling. They may also call internal hotlines or access publicly available mental health resources such as Mindline.sg and other community-based hotlines for assistance."
2021-10-04-T-085-S-02470,2021-10-04-T-085,2470,S Iswaran,"It has been a challenging time for our public transport workers, but they have shown resilience and kept our city moving. They deserve our continued appreciation and support as we strive towards a COVID-resilient nation. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and work closely with PTOs and NTWU to support our public transport workers."
2021-10-04-T-086-S-02471,2021-10-04-T-086,2471,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether LTA can consider installing mandatory Red Amber Green (RAG) signals for right turns in junctions within a 100-metre radius of schools; and (b) of the 600 or so RAG signals planned to be installed by 2024, whether LTA can expedite the installations of those near schools first."
2021-10-04-T-086-S-02472,2021-10-04-T-086,2472,S Iswaran,"LTA is prioritising the installation of Red Amber Green (RAG) signals at traffic junctions around schools to safeguard students’ safety. To date, more than 60% of the junctions within 100 metres of a school have been fitted with RAG signals. Beyond the 100-metre radius, LTA is also expediting the implementation of RAG signals at traffic junctions that are heavily utilised by students, such as those near transport nodes."
2021-10-04-T-086-S-02473,2021-10-04-T-086,2473,S Iswaran,"In addition to implementing RAG signals to safeguard students’ safety, the School Zone scheme includes traffic calming measures such as lighted alert signs, pedestrian crossings, road humps and road markings to encourage safe driving behaviour within the school vicinity."
2021-10-04-T-087-S-02474,2021-10-04-T-087,2474,Cheng Li Hui,asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many bus routes have been affected by the COVID-19 clusters at public bus interchanges; (b) whether there is any data on the number of passengers affected by this disruption; and (c) whether there is a scheme to recruit and retrain private bus drivers who used to ferry tourists and office workers to drive public buses.
2021-10-04-T-087-S-02475,2021-10-04-T-087,2475,S Iswaran,"The recent COVID-19 clusters at the bus interchanges have resulted in a tighter manpower situation. To ensure that the remaining bus captains have enough rest time between their shifts, LTA and operators adjusted the frequency of bus services from early September 2021. Though the situation has improved slightly, as infection numbers decrease and more bus captains come back to work, it remains fluid."
2021-10-04-T-087-S-02476,2021-10-04-T-087,2476,S Iswaran,"As of 30 September 2021, the waiting times for most of our bus services have been maintained without impacting commuters. Four express and city direct services have been suspended; the affected commuters are able to complete their journeys via alternative rail or bus services."
2021-10-04-T-087-S-02477,2021-10-04-T-087,2477,S Iswaran,Our public transport operators are actively recruiting bus captains. Some former private bus drivers and point-to-point drivers have joined them. The new hires go through training conducted by LTA and the public bus operators before they are deployed.
2021-10-04-T-088-S-02478,2021-10-04-T-088,2478,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Transport whether bus operators have asked for targets under the Bus Service Reliability Framework (BSRF) to be adjusted in light of bus captains being affected by COVID-19 infections and related quarantines.
2021-10-04-T-088-S-02479,2021-10-04-T-088,2479,S Iswaran,"The Bus Service Reliability Framework (BSRF) was introduced in 2016 to incentivise public bus operators to improve the timeliness of bus arrivals for the benefit of commuters. The target arrival times are set as a range, to provide bus captains with some flexibility under different traffic conditions."
2021-10-04-T-088-S-02480,2021-10-04-T-088,2480,S Iswaran,"In the past few weeks, more bus captains have been absent from work because of the COVID-19 clusters at our bus interchanges. LTA and the public bus operators have worked closely to minimise the impact on bus operations, while ensuring our bus captains continue to have enough rest time between their shifts. The tighter manpower situation has led to longer waiting times for some bus services. The situation has improved slightly as infection numbers decrease and more bus captains come back to work, but it remains fluid."
2021-10-04-T-088-S-02481,2021-10-04-T-088,2481,S Iswaran,LTA will exercise flexibility in assessing the performance of bus operators during this challenging period.
2021-10-04-T-089-S-02482,2021-10-04-T-089,2482,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) in each of the last five years, how many complaints of jerky driving have been received by LTA and public bus companies; (b) whether all bus captains are trained and tested on smooth driving techniques; (c) whether any on-board devices are used to monitor the jerkiness of bus captains’ driving; and (d) whether there is any correlation between the jerkiness of driving and the accident rate of public bus captains."
2021-10-04-T-089-S-02483,2021-10-04-T-089,2483,S Iswaran,"All new bus captains undergo a five-day Enhanced Vocational Licence Training Programme  (“EVLTP”) at the Singapore Bus Academy, which includes a module on safe driving techniques. This is followed by an additional five to six weeks of on-the-road training conducted by the public transport operators before the bus captains are deployed to drive public buses. After deployment, bus captains attend"
2021-10-04-T-089-S-02484,2021-10-04-T-089,2484,S Iswaran,Public transport operators have also invested in telematics systems onboard buses to monitor bus captains’ driving behaviour. Those who require improvement are sent for remedial training.
2021-10-04-T-089-S-02485,2021-10-04-T-089,2485,S Iswaran,"The number of accidents per 100,000 bus-km has fallen from 0.16 in January to August 2017, to 0.10 for the same period in 2021. The average monthly public feedback on jerky driving has also fallen from 18 in 2017 to 14 in 2021. Accidents involving bus captains are attributable to a range of factors including the sudden unexpected behaviour of other road users attempting to overtake and cut into bus lanes. We cannot, therefore, infer a correlation between these incidents and jerky driving by bus captains."
2021-10-04-T-090-S-02486,2021-10-04-T-090,2486,Hany Soh,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) how many complaints has NEA received in the past one month regarding foul odour in the air, especially those residing in Woodlands town; and (b) how does NEA carry out the necessary investigation in order to trace the cause of such odour."
2021-10-04-T-090-S-02487,2021-10-04-T-090,2487,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"From 1 August to 24 September 2021, the National Environment Agency (NEA) received about 140 complaints regarding foul odour from residents in Woodlands town."
2021-10-04-T-090-S-02488,2021-10-04-T-090,2488,Grace Fu Hai Yien,"When a complaint on foul odour is received, NEA will carry out ground inspections and check the premises in the vicinity for possible causes, including pollution incidents. These premises include factories, construction sites and agricultural sites. If the odour can be traced to a particular site, NEA will engage the premises owner or occupier to implement the necessary mitigation measures. NEA will also monitor the situation to ensure that the mitigation measures are effective in addressing the odour issue."
2021-10-04-T-091-S-02489,2021-10-04-T-091,2489,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"asked the Minister for Education (a) between 2016 and 2020, what is the annual percentage of Singaporeans attending international schools; (b) what is the annual average number of appeal cases that are received from Singaporean parents who want their children to attend international schools instead of local schools; and (c) what are the common reasons cited by the parents in these appeal cases."
2021-10-04-T-091-S-02490,2021-10-04-T-091,2490,Chan Chun Sing,Less than 0.5% of Singaporean students are enrolled in international schools.
2021-10-04-T-091-S-02491,2021-10-04-T-091,2491,Chan Chun Sing,"On average, we receive around 50 to 60 appeals each year from parents who wish to send their Singaporean children to international schools. The reasons cited include preference for an international curriculum because their children had spent many years abroad, or have special educational needs or medical conditions."
2021-10-04-T-091-S-02492,2021-10-04-T-091,2492,Chan Chun Sing,International schools are primarily meant to cater to the children of the expatriate community in Singapore. It is important that our Singaporean children attend our national schools to help develop common values and a sense of national identity and bonding through shared school experiences.
2021-10-04-T-092-S-02493,2021-10-04-T-092,2493,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,asked the Minister for Education what are the age-appropriate basic first aid skills and first aid awareness taught in primary schools presently.
2021-10-04-T-092-S-02494,2021-10-04-T-092,2494,Chan Chun Sing,"In primary schools, students are first introduced to the importance and skills of first aid treatment at Upper Primary levels. They learn basic first aid skills like the procedures for treating minor cuts and minor burns. They are also taught how to identify signs and symptoms of a cardiac arrest and to call for help in the event that someone suffers a cardiac arrest. These lessons are incorporated in the Physical Education (PE) curriculum for all primary schools."
2021-10-04-T-092-S-02495,2021-10-04-T-092,2495,Chan Chun Sing,The importance of first aid during an emergency is reinforced through stories in SGSecure resources shared with schools.
2021-10-04-T-092-S-02496,2021-10-04-T-092,2496,Chan Chun Sing,
2021-10-04-T-093-S-02497,2021-10-04-T-093,2497,Christopher de Souza,"asked the Minister for Finance in light of how there have been multiple rental rebates for tenants, whether similar types of support can be given to small landlords who depend on such rental income for their livelihood."
2021-10-04-T-093-S-02498,2021-10-04-T-093,2498,Lawrence Wong,"The Government has implemented various schemes to protect lives and livelihoods during this COVID-19 pandemic, through supporting businesses and households. Recognising that both tenants and landlords have been affected by the pandemic, our approach has been to strike a balance between the needs of the two groups through the design of our support schemes. As first announced during the Ministerial Statement in Parliament on 26 July 2021, the Government will require landlords to provide two weeks’ waiver of gross rent to eligible tenants, to help tenants cope with the impact of the period of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) from 22 July to 18 August."
2021-10-04-T-093-S-02499,2021-10-04-T-093,2499,Lawrence Wong,"Tenants which are Small and Medium Enterprises or Non-Profit Organisations must meet the eligibility criteria to qualify for this treatment, such as experiencing a 20% drop in revenue, to ensure that the rental assistance is directed to the more severely affected tenants. Hence, not all landlords have to provide this waiver."
2021-10-04-T-093-S-02500,2021-10-04-T-093,2500,Lawrence Wong,"Provisions are also in place to take into account the difficulties of landlords who rely mainly on rental income for their livelihood and face genuine difficulties in sharing the burden with their tenants. Landlords can apply for relief, to be assessed by an independent Rental Waiver Assessor based on specific factors in each case. If landlords meet the criteria, the Assessors can exempt them from providing rental waiver."
2021-10-04-T-093-S-02501,2021-10-04-T-093,2501,Lawrence Wong,Some landlords may still face cashflow constraints as a result of the mandated two-week rental waiver. The three local banks have committed to provide targeted assistance and restructuring solutions to borrowers. Landlords that face challenges meeting loan repayments should work with their lenders on suitable relief and restructuring options that are tailored to their circumstances.
2021-10-04-T-094-S-02502,2021-10-04-T-094,2502,Murali Pillai,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether he can provide an update on the efforts of the National Committee on Prevention, Rehabilitation and Recidivism (NCPR) set up in 2018 to prevent offending, re-offending and enhance rehabilitation of offenders to date and how these have contributed to lower offending and recidivism."
2021-10-04-T-094-S-02503,2021-10-04-T-094,2503,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The National Committee on Prevention, Rehabilitation and Recidivism (NCPR) was set up in April 2018 to oversee national efforts to prevent offending and re-offending, and enhance the rehabilitation of offenders. It comprises representatives from Government agencies and community partners."
2021-10-04-T-094-S-02504,2021-10-04-T-094,2504,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The NCPR has spearheaded several key initiatives since its inception. The Localised Community Network (LCN) was piloted in 2019, to provide support for children and youth with complex family circumstances or those who exhibited at-risk behaviours. This initiative involves schools, community agencies and other partners sharing information to facilitate the early identification of risks and needs and coordinating timely and holistic support for these children or youth and their families. Thus far, the pilot has supported over 120 students and their families. The LCN pilot complements the comprehensive system in schools to support students. This includes programmes to strengthen students’ engagement in school and address absenteeism issues early, to prevent long-term absenteeism and dropping out of schools."
2021-10-04-T-094-S-02505,2021-10-04-T-094,2505,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"To support youth offenders who are discharged from MSF Youth Homes, post-care support has been extended from two months to one year, to better support them as they transition back to living in the community. Post-care officers provide guidance to these youths, helping to sustain and reinforce the skills learnt and habits formed during their stay in the Homes. Post-care officers also collaborate with key stakeholders, families and volunteers to monitor the youths’ progress and ensure they remain meaningfully engaged (e.g. in school, training, or employment). The extended post-care support commenced in 2019 with a small group of youths discharged from the Homes, but has been extended to all youths discharged from MSF Youth Homes since February 2021."
2021-10-04-T-094-S-02506,2021-10-04-T-094,2506,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"NCPR has also introduced programmes to enhance support for children and families impacted by incarceration. In October 2020, Singapore Prison Service (SPS) worked with MSF to strengthen case coordination and information exchange between the Family Service Centres (FSCs) and SPS to enable offenders’ families to receive timely support from FSCs and community partners. Under this initiative, SPS systematically identifies newly admitted inmates whose families need more support, including families with young children. With their consent, the families are referred to the FSC nearest to their residence so that social workers can assess their needs and develop support plans for these families, where needed."
2021-10-04-T-094-S-02507,2021-10-04-T-094,2507,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The efforts of Government agencies and community partners, including those of the NCPR, have contributed to a lower rate of offending and re-offending. The number of youth offenders1 has decreased by 43.3% from 4,174 in 2010 to 2,3672 in 2020. The overall two-year recidivism rate for offenders has also fallen from 27.3% for the cohort released in 2008, to 22.1% for the cohort released in 2018."
2021-10-04-T-094-S-02508,2021-10-04-T-094,2508,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The NCPR will continue to work closely with its partners, to deal with emerging areas of concern, and enhance preventive and rehabilitative interventions for the at-risk and offender populations."
2021-10-04-T-095-S-02509,2021-10-04-T-095,2509,Murali Pillai,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what kind of specific support that the Ministry can provide to grandparents who are forced out of circumstances to look after their grandchildren left in their care by their children.
2021-10-04-T-095-S-02510,2021-10-04-T-095,2510,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Grandparents may be the main caregiver of their grandchildren due to various circumstances. Some of these circumstances could include neglect, abuse, or abandonment of the child by his or her parents. The parents may also be unable to care for their children due to death, incarceration, or serious medical issues."
2021-10-04-T-095-S-02511,2021-10-04-T-095,2511,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For grandparents who are MSF-appointed kin carers of abused, neglected or abandoned children, they will be supported by case workers from MSF or selected social service agencies that have been appointed as Child Protection Specialist Centres or Fostering Agencies. Since 1 July 2020, MSF-appointed kin carers have also been entitled to childcare leave to support them in their caregiving role."
2021-10-04-T-095-S-02512,2021-10-04-T-095,2512,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Grandparents and non-parent caregivers experiencing financial difficulties in caring for children may be eligible for financial assistance to defray the basic living expenses and additional costs for the child’s needs under their care. In addition, grandparents who require financial assistance with their basic living expenses may also apply for ComCare support. They could approach their nearest Social Service Office (SSO) or call the ComCare hotline at 1800-222-000 for support and further details."
2021-10-04-T-095-S-02513,2021-10-04-T-095,2513,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Grandparents may also approach Family Service Centres (FSCs)1 for support to address their family and socio-emotional issues. FSCs will provide case management and coordinate support with various agencies where necessary, such as schools and childcare centres."
2021-10-04-T-095-S-02514,2021-10-04-T-095,2514,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Grandparents caring for their grandchildren may also approach Parenting Support Providers (PSPs)2 to be equipped with parenting and grandparenting skills and knowledge. In addition, counselling services are available at Strengthening Families Programme @ FSCs (FAM@FSCs) if they face family relationship issues."
2021-10-04-T-096-S-02515,2021-10-04-T-096,2515,Shahira Abdullah,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Local Qualifying Salary will affect the eligibility criteria of families that are applying for social support grants and, if so, how will it affect them."
2021-10-04-T-096-S-02516,2021-10-04-T-096,2516,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Government uplifts our lower-wage workers through a multi-pronged approach. Workfare boosts income and retirement savings, and encourages skills upgrading. Progressive Wages provides job and training progression pathways for lower-wage workers, and grows their wages as they improve their skills and productivity."
2021-10-04-T-096-S-02517,2021-10-04-T-096,2517,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"From 1 September 2022, firms that hire foreign workers will have to pay all their Singaporean employees at least the Local Qualifying Salary (LQS). This is part of the recent recommendations by the Tripartite Workgroup on Lower-Wage Workers that the Government has accepted, which includes expanding the coverage of Progressive Wages, and introducing the Progressive Wage Mark. The Government has also committed to enhancing the Workfare Income Supplement scheme by 2023. Households with lower-wage workers can therefore expect to see an increase in their household income over the next two years."
2021-10-04-T-096-S-02518,2021-10-04-T-096,2518,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Government provides multiple layers of assistance to support lower-income individuals and their families. The eligibility criteria, including income thresholds, vary for different schemes as they serve different purposes and channel support towards different target groups. These eligibility criteria are reviewed from time to time to ensure that the schemes continue to meet their intended objectives. The new LQS requirements have no bearing on the eligibility criteria of social support schemes or how individuals and families are assessed for such schemes."
2021-10-04-T-096-S-02519,2021-10-04-T-096,2519,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Our social support grants, such as ComCare assistance, are intended to tide families through temporary periods of need, as they work towards improving their circumstances. With the expanded Progressive Wage approach, including the new LQS requirements, we expect more families to see an improvement in their financial circumstances and achieve self-reliance in the long run."
2021-10-04-T-097-S-02520,2021-10-04-T-097,2520,Abdul Samad,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs in light of haj pilgrimage cancellations for 2020 and 2021 (a) what is the total number of applicants who are in line to perform the haj in the coming years; (b) how many of these applicants are first-timers, broken down by age groups; and (c) whether there will be an increase in the number of pilgrims in view of the two years of missed pilgrimages."
2021-10-04-T-097-S-02521,2021-10-04-T-097,2521,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Currently, there are about 38,000 applicants who have registered with the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) to perform Haj in the coming years. Out of this group, there are approximately 34,500 first-time applicants, of which (a) 7,500 applicants are 40 years old and below, (b) 18,000 applicants are between the ages of 41 and 60 years old, and (c) 9,000 applicants are 61 years old and above."
2021-10-04-T-097-S-02522,2021-10-04-T-097,2522,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has yet to announce the status and arrangements for Haj 2022 and beyond. Since the onset of COVID-19, the KSA has restricted Haj to a limited number of pilgrims who were citizens and residents within the KSA. With the deferment of international Haj in the past two years, Singapore has been reiterating its requests to the Ministry for Haj and Umrah in the KSA for additional Haj places, beyond the official quota allocated to Singapore, so that more Singaporean pilgrims will be able to perform the Haj when it resumes for international pilgrims."
2021-10-04-T-097-S-02523,2021-10-04-T-097,2523,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Should Haj be allowed for international pilgrims in 2022, MUIS, in consultation with our Ministry of Health, will assess the prevailing public health situation in Singapore and around the world, and the health risks of sending a delegation. Our priority will be to safeguard the health and well-being of our Singapore pilgrims and our community in Singapore."

2021-10-04-T-098-S-02525,2021-10-04-T-098,2525,Tan Wu Meng,asked the Minister for Health (a) what capabilities does Singapore have to detect emerging infectious diseases and pandemics including novel pathogens; and (b) what is the current assessment of the utility of metagenomic testing for purposes of detecting novel pathogens in the environment.
2021-10-04-T-098-S-02526,2021-10-04-T-098,2526,Ong Ye Kung,"Singapore has a multi-layered approach for the early detection of emerging infectious diseases and novel pathogens. This is enabled by the expertise of our professionals, state-of-the-art facilities and technologies, and international networks."
2021-10-04-T-098-S-02527,2021-10-04-T-098,2527,Ong Ye Kung,"Externally, we have established links with the World Health Organisation (WHO), governments, and key institutions in the region and internationally. We collaborate closely with international partners to share information and facilitate research. These processes and relationships provide us timely information about emerging disease threats globally. The insights gathered guide our surveillance and risk assessment of potentially important public health threats to Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-098-S-02528,2021-10-04-T-098,2528,Ong Ye Kung,"Within Singapore, our professionals form the next layer of defence. Officers across One Health agencies (human, animal, food and environment sectors) work together to detect diseases and pathogens in these settings. Our medical community, including general practitioners, play a key role in the early detection and notification of infectious diseases of public health concern. The Severe Illness and Death from Possibly Infectious Causes (SIDPIC) programme in public hospitals also aims to identify emerging infections and novel pathogens among persons with serious illness of unknown cause."
2021-10-04-T-098-S-02529,2021-10-04-T-098,2529,Ong Ye Kung,"We have developed a comprehensive laboratory system supported by specialist laboratory scientists and state-of-the-art technologies. This includes the National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL), which is actively involved in surveillance for highly infectious pathogens, and NEA’s Environmental Health Institute (EHI), which conducts environmental pathogen surveillance. Technologies such as biosafety-level 3 containment laboratories, electron microscopy and next generation sequencing platforms, has allowed us to identify and respond to emerging threats such as Zika virus, avian influenza, monkeypox and SARS-CoV-2. Partnerships exist between various laboratories within and outside of Singapore to drive research and capability development for the detection of new and emerging pathogens."
2021-10-04-T-098-S-02530,2021-10-04-T-098,2530,Ong Ye Kung,"As technologies evolve rapidly, new tools including metagenomics become available to augment the detection of emerging pathogens. There is currently limited evidence to support the utility of metagenomics in predicting emerging pathogens. Due to the complex microbiome in the environment, the use of metagenomics in detecting novel pathogens in the environment must be complemented and supported by epidemiological and disease information from human or animal studies."
2021-10-04-T-099-S-02531,2021-10-04-T-099,2531,Shahira Abdullah,"asked the Minister for Health considering the close proximity of the current dental National Specialty Centres situated centrally, whether the Ministry can consider allowing all hospital dental clinics to provide specialised subsided treatment in order to better serve patients located in further geographical locations."
2021-10-04-T-099-S-02532,2021-10-04-T-099,2532,Ong Ye Kung,"Our two National Specialty Dental Centres (NSCs) namely, the National Dental Centre, Singapore (NDCS) and the National University Centre for Oral Health, Singapore (NUCOHS), are referral centres that provide the full range of subsidised dental services, including specialty and sub-specialty dental services."
2021-10-04-T-099-S-02533,2021-10-04-T-099,2533,Ong Ye Kung,"On the other hand, Hospital Dental Clinics (HDCs) were set up to provide medically-indicated subsidised dental services to hospital patients across inpatient, outpatient and day surgery settings, and HDCs may refer patients to NSCs when services capacity or capabilities are not available at the HDCs. Where appropriate, HDCs can partner the NSCs to provide an expanded scope of subsidised services at the hospital based on services needs and specialty support by the NSCs, subject to approval by the Ministry of Health."

2021-10-04-T-100-S-02537,2021-10-04-T-100,2537,He Ting Ru,asked the Minister for Health (a) how many individuals are currently hired for COVID-19 contact tracing operations; (b) whether manpower numbers will be adjusted given the recent huge spike in cases and as Singapore moves towards an endemic COVID-19 situation; and (c) what are the principles behind how manpower adjustments in contact tracing operations will be made.
2021-10-04-T-100-S-02538,2021-10-04-T-100,2538,Gerald Giam Yean Song,"asked the Minister for Health (a) since 18 August 2021, how many patients who tested positive for COVID-19 waited (i) between 24 and 72 hours or (ii) more than 72 hours, after the receipt of their test results before being issued Quarantine Orders; and (b) whether more staff and resources will be provided to operate the Ministry hotline and convey COVID-19 patients to Government quarantine facilities."
2021-10-04-T-100-S-02539,2021-10-04-T-100,2539,Ong Ye Kung,These questions for written answer have been addressed by oral reply to Question Nos 1 to 20 on the Order Paper for 4 October 2021.
2021-10-04-T-101-S-02540,2021-10-04-T-101,2540,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Singapore National Eye Centre has seen an increase in patients seeking medical attention for eyesight problems as a result of the Work-from-Home and Home-based Learning arrangements; and (b) whether the Ministry intends to embark on a public education campaign on the importance of maintaining good eye health in the post-COVID-19 new normal.
2021-10-04-T-101-S-02541,2021-10-04-T-101,2541,Ong Ye Kung,The Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) is unable to quantify the number of patients seeking medical attention for eyesight problems arising from the Work-from-Home and Home-based Learning arrangements since 2020.
2021-10-04-T-101-S-02542,2021-10-04-T-101,2542,Ong Ye Kung,"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, SNEC ophthalmologists have been giving education talks through public webinars organised by the SNEC as well as in partnership with grassroots organisations such as Lions Clubs of Singapore. The talks cover a wide range of topics including myopia prevention and eye care while working or studying at home. SNEC consultants have also provided useful tips on how parents can care for their children’s eyes via interviews with various mainstream media."
2021-10-04-T-101-S-02543,2021-10-04-T-101,2543,Ong Ye Kung,"The Health Promotion Board (HPB) has been actively promoting myopia prevention through programmes such as the National Myopia Prevention Programme (NMPP), which was launched in 2001, and involves annual vision screening for children and workshops to equip parents with strategies to develop good eye care habits in their children. The Ministry of Health, HPB and public healthcare institutions will continue to look into avenues to promote eye health in the new normal."

2021-10-04-T-102-S-02548,2021-10-04-T-102,2548,Yip Hon Weng,asked the Minister for Health in light of the approvals for various vaccines (a) whether persons who opt for the Sinovac or Sinopharm vaccine will be given the option to take the COVID-19 booster jab under the Government's vaccination programme; (b) how many more vaccines are now under consideration for inclusion into the national programme to be covered by the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme (VIFAP); and (c) whether those who have taken the Sinovac or Sinopharm vaccine will be included under VIFAP.
2021-10-04-T-102-S-02549,2021-10-04-T-102,2549,Xie Yao Quan,asked the Minister for Health what are the Ministry’s plans to recognise healthcare workers for another challenging year of managing COVID-19.
2021-10-04-T-102-S-02550,2021-10-04-T-102,2550,Ong Ye Kung,These questions for written answer have been addressed by oral reply to Question Nos 1 to 20  on the Order Paper for 4 October 2021.
2021-10-04-T-103-S-02551,2021-10-04-T-103,2551,Jamus Jerome Lim,asked the Minister for Health what mental health support is there for frontline individuals such as taxi and private-hire car drivers or nurses and doctors who may repeatedly be exposed to Quarantine Orders (QO) especially at dedicated QO facilities instead of at home.
2021-10-04-T-103-S-02552,2021-10-04-T-103,2552,Ong Ye Kung,"The well-being of our frontline workers, who are crucial in our fight against COVID-19, is an important priority for the Government and our tripartite partners. At the workplace, transport operators and public healthcare institutions (PHIs) support workers through initiatives such as the formation of driver relations team among taxi and private hire car (PHC) operators, as well as implementation of peer support programmes for healthcare workers, respectively. Within these groups, frontline workers are able to voice out mental health concerns and seek support to cope with stress. Supervisors in both the healthcare and transport settings also closely monitor the wellbeing of frontline workers. Where necessary, workers may be referred for counselling services if they require further support."
2021-10-04-T-103-S-02553,2021-10-04-T-103,2553,Ong Ye Kung,"In addition, the Government also works with PHIs and transport operators to conduct training sessions to better equip frontline workers and their supervisors in promoting positive mental well-being. For example, HPB collaborated with transport operators and unions to organise mental well-being workshops for over 4,000 transport workers and leaders. Similarly, the PHIs have rolled out stress management training, to help staff cope with stressful situations. Frontline workers can also tap on mental health resources such as Mindline.sg, as well as national and community-based hotlines which are available to the broader public, if they require further support and assistance."
2021-10-04-T-103-S-02554,2021-10-04-T-103,2554,Ong Ye Kung,
2021-10-04-T-104-S-02555,2021-10-04-T-104,2555,Don Wee,asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what has been the take-up rate of IMDA's pre-approved cybersecurity solutions among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); and (b) how is the Ministry increasing awareness of the importance of cybersecurity among SMEs.
2021-10-04-T-104-S-02556,2021-10-04-T-104,2556,Josephine Teo,"Under the SMEs Go Digital programme, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) can tap on cybersecurity solutions pre-approved by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA). Since the programme was launched in 2017, more than 5,000 SMEs have benefitted from these cybersecurity solutions that provide endpoint protection, managed detection and response, and unified threat management."
2021-10-04-T-104-S-02557,2021-10-04-T-104,2557,Josephine Teo,"CSA also undertakes complementary efforts to raise the cybersecurity posture of enterprises in Singapore. Under the SG Cyber Safe Programme, CSA develops cybersecurity toolkits to support enterprises with the appropriate measures and hygiene practices that they should put in place. These enterprise toolkits have been customised for different target groups, including SME owners and employees, and will be launched later this month. CSA is also developing a SG Cyber Safe Trustmark which, when launched, will help customers and partners identify enterprises with good cybersecurity measures. We encourage all enterprises to take advantage of these initiatives to safeguard themselves in cyberspace."
2021-10-04-T-104-S-02558,2021-10-04-T-104,2558,Josephine Teo,
2021-10-04-T-105-S-02559,2021-10-04-T-105,2559,Tan Yia Swam,asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether there are policies to prevent hateful or inciteful speech or action being communicated or distributed.
2021-10-04-T-105-S-02560,2021-10-04-T-105,2560,Josephine Teo,"The Government prohibits all forms of hate and offensive speech and has in place enforcement and legal frameworks to address behaviour that, if left unchecked, may erode our hard-earned social cohesion and harmony."
2021-10-04-T-105-S-02561,2021-10-04-T-105,2561,Josephine Teo,"Under the Broadcasting Act, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) can direct Internet Content Providers to take down material that is prohibited under the Internet Code of Practice (ICOP) – this refers to material that is objectionable on the grounds of public interest, public morality, public order, public security, national harmony; or glorifies, incites, or endorses ethnic, racial or religious hatred, strife or intolerance. IMDA can also direct Internet Service Providers to block access to websites containing such prohibited material."
2021-10-04-T-105-S-02562,2021-10-04-T-105,2562,Josephine Teo,"In today’s context, hate speech can also be exacerbated by online tools and malicious actors who spread hate using falsehoods. Falsehoods, including insidious “slow-drip” ones, can create fertile breeding ground for hate, xenophobia, and societal discord. The Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) allows us to swiftly clarify such falsehoods."
2021-10-04-T-105-S-02563,2021-10-04-T-105,2563,Josephine Teo,"There are also laws protecting specific types of hate speech, such as against race and religion. Under the Penal Code, it is an offence to engage in actions that deliberately wound the racial and religious feelings of any person, promote or attempt to promote disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different racial and religious groups, or commit any act prejudicial to the maintenance of racial and religious harmony."
2021-10-04-T-105-S-02564,2021-10-04-T-105,2564,Josephine Teo,"The Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act (MRHA) was amended in 2019 to strengthen the Government’s ability to respond effectively to threats against religious harmony in the digital age, when material of all kinds can go viral swiftly. For example, the Restraining Order (RO) was updated to take immediate effect once issued, so that the Government can quickly take down religiously inflammatory material online and minimise harm."
2021-10-04-T-105-S-02565,2021-10-04-T-105,2565,Josephine Teo,"Regulations are necessary but not sufficient to address hateful speech online. There is also a need to foster social norms for respectful online behaviour and discourse. Under Digital for Life (DfL), a national movement to help all Singaporeans embrace digitalisation, the Media Literacy Council (MLC) works with DfL partners to encourage responsible online interactions and civil online spaces, by promoting shared values of respect, responsibility, empathy, and integrity. MCCY also works closely with community partners to encourage ground-up projects that promote racial and religious harmony, such as through the Harmony Fund."
2021-10-04-T-106-S-02566,2021-10-04-T-106,2566,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Ministry will consider amending the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act to increase penalties for wildlife trafficking, trade and possession offences and to tighten the regulation for shipments in transit; (b) whether the Ministry will put any such proposed amendments through a public consultation; and (c) if so, what is the timeline for the introduction of such a Bill."
2021-10-04-T-106-S-02567,2021-10-04-T-106,2567,Desmond Lee,"MND and NParks have been reviewing the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act (ESA) to ensure that it remains effective in supporting Singapore’s regulation of the trade in wildlife species protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). We intend to strengthen our regulation of the trade in CITES species, enhance penalties, and augment NParks’ investigatory and enforcement powers for wildlife trade offences."
2021-10-04-T-106-S-02568,2021-10-04-T-106,2568,Desmond Lee,"As part of the review, MND and NParks have consulted several stakeholders on the proposed amendments to the ESA. These stakeholders include traders, shipping companies, industry associations, academics and non-profit organisations such as the Animal Concerns Research & Education Society (ACRES), World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Singapore, and TRAFFIC. We will carry out a public consultation exercise on the proposed amendments soon. When ready, we will introduce a Bill in Parliament to amend the ESA."
2021-10-04-T-107-S-02569,2021-10-04-T-107,2569,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for National Development with regard to the Skills Evaluation Certificate schemes (a) for each year in the past five years, what is the percentage of work permit holders who have done work involving skills that match the Skills Evaluation Certificate or Skills Evaluation Certificate (Knowledge) which they have obtained; and (b) if this information is not currently available, whether the Ministry will start tracking this information."
2021-10-04-T-107-S-02570,2021-10-04-T-107,2570,Desmond Lee,"Construction Work Permit Holders (WPHs) are required to attain the Skills Evaluation Certificate (Knowledge) [SEC(K)] or equivalent, to work in Singapore. This ensures that our WPHs possess the basic knowledge and skills required to work in our construction industry. The SEC(K) covers a wide range of trades. It is in the employer’s interest to bring in workers with the relevant skills. Beyond fulfilling the basic SEC(K) requirement, construction firms are encouraged to continually upskill or train their workers to be proficient in multiple trades. This will enable the industry to fulfil its diverse manpower needs, while managing its reliance on migrant workers."
2021-10-04-T-107-S-02571,2021-10-04-T-107,2571,Desmond Lee,"Given that a construction worker may do different kinds of works across multiple worksites, BCA does not track the percentage of construction WPHs who have done work involving skills that match the trade for the SEC(K) that they have obtained. Doing so would impose an undue administrative burden on the industry, which may not be commensurate with the information collected."
2021-10-04-T-108-S-02572,2021-10-04-T-108,2572,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Minister for National Development (a) how is the projected ultimate number of dwelling units determined; (b) whether there is a timeline to reach the said number of dwelling units; and (c) what is the breakdown of the projection of 1,557,000 dwelling units as at FY2019/2020 into HDB flats and private developments."
2021-10-04-T-108-S-02573,2021-10-04-T-108,2573,Desmond Lee,"The projected ultimate number of 1,557,000 dwelling units, as stated under the ‘Key Statistics’ segment of HDB’s Annual Report 2019/2020, is an estimate of the total number of residential dwelling units that HDB towns can accommodate when fully developed. This figure is derived based on the land area zoned for residential use in the Master Plan within HDB’s town development boundaries, and includes both existing and future housing developments."
2021-10-04-T-108-S-02574,2021-10-04-T-108,2574,Desmond Lee,"The projected ultimate number of dwelling units is an estimate that helps us refine our land use planning considerations for HDB towns. It is not an intended target to be reached. As part of our regular reviews of our land use and development plans, the projected ultimate figure may change over time."
2021-10-04-T-108-S-02575,2021-10-04-T-108,2575,Desmond Lee,"Of the 1,557,000 projected ultimate dwelling units, 82% are HDB flats, and the remaining 18% is private housing, including Executive Condominiums."
2021-10-04-T-109-S-02576,2021-10-04-T-109,2576,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"asked the Minister for National Development in each of the last 10 years, of the total completed HDB dwelling units for sale, what is the number of vacant units and vacancy rate, including and excluding units that have achieved TOP and yet to be handed over to buyers, as broken down by flat type."
2021-10-04-T-109-S-02577,2021-10-04-T-109,2577,Desmond Lee,"As at 31 August 2021, HDB managed a stock of 1,025,331 completed homeownership flats. Of these, 1,607 flats, or 0.2%, were vacant units that had not been booked. Most of these units were either being offered under Sale of Balance Flats exercises or open booking where flat selection had not been completed, or were scheduled for offer in subsequent exercises. Please see Table 1 for details."
2021-10-04-T-109-S-02578,2021-10-04-T-109,2578,Desmond Lee,
2021-10-04-T-109-S-02579,2021-10-04-T-109,2579,Desmond Lee,"From 2016 to 2020, HDB launched an average of around 16,500 flats every year. Once the flats are completed, HDB progressively invites flat owners to collect the keys to their flats. As at 31 August 2021, 3,772 homeownership flats had been booked and completed, and HDB has scheduled flat buyers to collect the keys to their flats."
2021-10-04-T-110-S-02580,2021-10-04-T-110,2580,Jamus Jerome Lim,"asked the Minister for National Development what is the justification for the asymmetry in HDB ownership allowances, where individuals who first purchase a HDB flat are allowed to subsequently purchase private property without first relinquishing ownership of the flat, whereas those who own private property are not allowed to subsequently purchase a HDB flat."
2021-10-04-T-110-S-02581,2021-10-04-T-110,2581,Desmond Lee,"HDB flats are meant for owner-occupation. To reinforce this principle, HDB flat owners are not allowed to concurrently own any private property during the Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) of five years for their flat. The same principle extends to private property owners who wish to buy a non-subsidised HDB flat. They will"
2021-10-04-T-110-S-02582,2021-10-04-T-110,2582,Desmond Lee,"After fulfilling the five-year MOP, all HDB flat owners, including those who had previously owned private property, may buy private property."
2021-10-04-T-111-S-02583,2021-10-04-T-111,2583,Leon Perera,asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many cardiac arrest emergencies have taken place in parks and park connectors over the past three years; (b) in how many of those emergencies were Automated External Defibrillators (“AEDs”) used; (c) what is the total number of AEDs installed in parks and park connectors to date; and (d) how many users have downloaded the myResponder mobile application and what is being done to promote it.
2021-10-04-T-111-S-02584,2021-10-04-T-111,2584,Desmond Lee,"From July 2018 to June 2021, SCDF responded to close to 50 recorded cardiac arrest incidents in parks and park connectors. In all these incidents, an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) was used."
2021-10-04-T-111-S-02585,2021-10-04-T-111,2585,Desmond Lee,"NParks has worked with SCDF to increase the number of AEDs in our parks and park connectors over the years. To date, about 200 AEDs have been installed in our most visited parks, including nature reserves, regional parks, as well as park connectors with high visitorship. The AEDs are located at key activity areas in our parks, such as visitor centres, toilet blocks, play areas, fitness corners and F&B outlets. This allows for a quicker response should a cardiac arrest occur. NParks will continue to install more AEDs in our parks and park connectors, in consultation with SCDF."
2021-10-04-T-111-S-02586,2021-10-04-T-111,2586,Desmond Lee,"As of September 2021, more than 180,000 users have downloaded SCDF’s myResponder mobile application, with over 100,000 users registered as community first responders. SCDF works with partners such as the Singapore Heart Foundation and public hospitals to promote the use of the application through organisational townhalls and publicity campaigns. SCDF has also promoted the application through its social media platforms and public engagement programmes such as the Virtual Fire Station Open House, and the Community Emergency Preparedness Programme."
2021-10-04-T-112-S-02587,2021-10-04-T-112,2587,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,"asked the Minister for Manpower with the formalisation of the Household Services Scheme from 1 September 2021, whether the provision of female workers from India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Cambodia be similarly extended to cleaning businesses that provide non-residential cleaning services."
2021-10-04-T-112-S-02588,2021-10-04-T-112,2588,Tan See Leng,"The Household Services Scheme (HSS) allows eligible companies to hire female workers from more countries such as India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Cambodia. This is a special arrangement to support households in need of domestic cleaning services."
2021-10-04-T-112-S-02589,2021-10-04-T-112,2589,Tan See Leng,"Allowing these sources at the Work Permit level for other businesses, including non-residential cleaning companies, will need to be carefully studied. Introducing cheaper sources could intensify job competition with locals on the basis of cost and exert downward pressure on wages. COVID-19 has also revealed the risks of over-reliance on lower-wage migrant workers, and it is more sustainable for firms to transform and reduce their manpower reliance instead. Hence, we encourage cleaning firms to instead continue investing in automation to improve their productivity, and re-designing their jobs to better retain and attract local workers."
2021-10-04-T-112-S-02590,2021-10-04-T-112,2590,Tan See Leng,"Licensed cleaning firms are also covered by the Cleaning Progressive Wage Model (PWM), which provides a clear job and training progression pathway for local cleaners, and helps to grow their wages as they improve their skills and productivity. Most recently, tripartite partners agreed on an upcoming six-year schedule of sustained and meaningful wage increases from 2023 to 2028. This will help increase the Cleaning sector’s attractiveness to locals."
2021-10-04-T-113-S-02591,2021-10-04-T-113,2591,Desmond Choo,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many workers and companies have been assisted by the waiver of foreign worker levies while the workers are on Stay-Home Notice; and (b) how long does the Ministry intend to extend this scheme for.
2021-10-04-T-113-S-02592,2021-10-04-T-113,2592,Tan See Leng,"From January to August 2021, a monthly average of 6,900 workers from 2,700 companies have been assisted by the waiver of foreign worker levies for the duration of their Stay-Home Notice (SHN) after entering Singapore."
2021-10-04-T-113-S-02593,2021-10-04-T-113,2593,Tan See Leng,"On 20 September 2021, MOM announced that the foreign worker levy waiver during workers’ SHN would be extended up to December 2021. This extension will give employers more time to adjust to the costs associated with measures to reduce the risk of importation of COVID-19 as we gradually reopen our borders. MOM will review whether the waiver should be extended in end-2021, depending on the COVID-19 situation and border measures then."
2021-10-04-T-114-S-02594,2021-10-04-T-114,2594,He Ting Ru,asked the Minister for Manpower for each month since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (a) how many inspections of workplaces have been carried out by the Ministry for breaches of safe management measures; (b) how many of these inspections have been notified to companies and workplaces in advance of the inspection; and (c) how many breaches have been discovered.
2021-10-04-T-114-S-02595,2021-10-04-T-114,2595,Tan See Leng,"Since March 2020, the Ministry has conducted close to 45,000 inspections on safe management measures at the workplace. About 21,000 inspections were conducted between March 2020 and end May 2020 during the Circuit Breaker period, and the remaining 24,000 inspections were conducted between June 2020 and September 2021."
2021-10-04-T-114-S-02596,2021-10-04-T-114,2596,Tan See Leng,"The vast majority of workplaces inspected have been compliant with the safe management measures, but there were breaches. A total of 140 Stop Work Orders, 247 Remedial Orders and 399 Composition Fines were issued to 776 companies for breaches of safe management measures. The common breaches were (i) failure to implement work-from-home arrangements for employees who were able to work from home; (ii) failure to wear mask; and (iii) failure to ensure at least one metre between any two individuals. Companies with serious lapses were asked to cease operations until rectifications were completed."
2021-10-04-T-114-S-02597,2021-10-04-T-114,2597,Tan See Leng,The Ministry does not notify companies or workplaces in advance of our inspection.

2021-10-04-T-115-S-02599,2021-10-04-T-115,2599,Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) in each of the last five years, what is the number of (i) suicides and (ii) “unnatural deaths” by work permit holders; (b) whether the suicide rate and rate of “unnatural death” among work permit holders exceed those of the general population in those five years; and (c) whether there has been an increase in the rate of (i) suicides and (ii) “unnatural deaths” among work permit holders residing in dormitories in the last six months as compared to pre-COVID-19 times."
2021-10-04-T-115-S-02600,2021-10-04-T-115,2600,Tan See Leng,"Between 2016 and 2020, the unnatural death and suicide rates among Work Permit Holders"
2021-10-04-T-115-S-02601,2021-10-04-T-115,2601,Tan See Leng,"In the first half of this year, both the annualised rate of unnatural deaths and suicides specifically among Migrant Workers have come down from the highs observed in 2020 and are within the range recorded between 2016 and 2019, pre-COVID-19."
2021-10-04-T-115-S-02602,2021-10-04-T-115,2602,Tan See Leng,"2020 had been a difficult time for our migrant workers, and also for the general population. In addition to other stressors felt during the pre-COVID-19 period, COVID-19 has brought new pressures in Singapore and to the families of our migrant workers in their home countries. We have been concerned and have set up a dedicated Project DAWN taskforce since November 2020 to support the mental health of our migrant workers. The taskforce developed a seven-point strategy to raise awareness on mental health literacy, ensure at-risk persons are identified early, and enable appropriate access to care services, including counselling and post-intervention support. This includes encouraging buddy systems in workplaces and dormitories, and training frontline teams and peer support leaders in psychological first aid. MOM will continue to place close attention in mental health of all workers and offer the help and support."
