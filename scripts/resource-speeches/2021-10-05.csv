2021-10-05-T-001,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng,"asked the Prime Minister regarding the report by MAS that bank customers in Singapore suffered fraudulent credit card transactions following malicious actors' diversion of SMS One-time Passwords (OTPs), whether a retrospective review will be conducted to establish whether additional customers prior to September 2020 may have been affected.",1,1,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00001
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Prime Minister),"Mr Speaker, Sir, aside from Dr Tan's Parliamentary Question (PQ), Member Ms Joan Pereira had filed similar PQ yesterday and Mr Gerald Giam",1,2,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00002
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Prime Minister),"So, with your permission, may I take all these PQs related to MAS' recent announcement on the SMS OTPs fraud, at the same time.",2,3,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00003
2021-10-05-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,4,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00004
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sir, MAS, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and the Singapore Police Force (SPF) announced on 15 September that malicious actors overseas had diverted and used SMS OTPs to perform fraudulent credit card transactions between September 2020 and December 2020. Seventy-five bank customers in Singapore had been affected. Banks have reached out to all the affected customers to waive the unauthorised transactions, amounting to approximately S$500,000.",1,5,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00005
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"There have been no confirmed cases of SMS OTP diversion in Singapore prior to September 2020. Banks are reviewing all card dispute cases reported to them from September 2020, to identify if there may be other fraudulent transactions that were enabled by SMS OTP diversion. Banks will similarly investigate any new reports by customers, including any such transactions before September 2020. Bank customers will not have to bear any unauthorised charges in cases which are confirmed to have been enabled by SMS OTP diversion, as long as customers had taken care to protect their card information and authentication credentials. So, bank customers will not have to bear any such unauthorised charges so long as they had taken care to protect their card information and authentication credentials.",2,6,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00006
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sir, this attack has shown us that the fight against scams and fraud requires collective effort.",3,7,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00007
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Banks have a responsibility to secure their IT systems, put in place robust measures to authenticate customer transactions and conduct active surveillance to detect unusual transactions patterns. They are required to institute robust security controls to safeguard customers’ account information and transaction data from unauthorised access and misuse.",4,8,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00008
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Likewise, bank customers too have a responsibility – to protect their online banking and payment credentials for authentication such as passwords and OTPs, by inputting them only on official websites or mobile applications. These should never be disclosed over the phone, via text message or email.",5,9,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00009
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Giam had asked about the measures taken by banks and telecommunication companies to safeguard against the SMS OTP diversion attack. While banks’ systems were secure and not the cause of these incidents, banks have further enhanced their fraud surveillance measures. This includes rejecting card payments made to common merchants linked to the unauthorised transactions. Banks will continue to closely monitor the evolving cybersecurity landscape, and regularly review authentication mechanisms and other security measures put in place to address risks posed to customers using online financial services.",6,10,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00010
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As for the local telecommunication networks, IMDA, in consultation with the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), has required telco operators to put in place specialised firewalls and system safeguards to monitor and block suspicious diversions of SMS.",7,11,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00011
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As Ms Pereira highlighted, consumers need to also take action to protect themselves. Allow me to share a few actions which consumers can focus on.",8,12,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00012
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"First, consumers must assume that criminals will try to obtain their online banking credentials. Criminals typically do this by tricking consumers into installing malware on their devices or disclosing their online banking username and passwords through phone calls or fake websites. When in doubt, consumers should call the banks’ official hotlines to verify the legitimacy of requests for online banking and card credentials.",9,13,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00013
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Banks work with SPF, National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) and MoneySense, our national financial education programme, to regularly alert consumers to new methods adopted by scammers and to educate consumers on how they can protect themselves.",10,14,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00014
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Consumers must also develop a healthy scepticism about websites, unsolicited phone calls, messages and emails. When making online purchases, they only should use established and reputable online services. If there is any doubt about a merchant’s legitimacy, do not proceed with the transaction. And be wary of any deal or offer that sounds too good to be true.",11,15,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00015
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Second, consumers should set transaction notification thresholds at low levels so that unauthorised transactions are detected early. Banks work closely with SPF and Anti-Scam Centre to exchange intelligence on emerging scam trends, so that they can take prompt action. The sooner a report is made, the higher the likelihood that the funds can be recovered.",12,16,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00016
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Where bank customers suffer financial losses from fraudulent transactions, they are protected as long as they have acted responsibly. Banks are expected to consider whether the customers could have taken reasonable steps to prevent the occurrence of the fraudulent transactions. Bank customers will not have to incur any losses which arise from the banks’ non-compliance with MAS’ rules.",13,17,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00017
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Let me reiterate  fighting fraud is a collective effort. As criminals will continue to perpetuate new and more sophisticated methods to defraud consumers, banks, consumers and the authorities need to remain vigilant in preventing as well as detecting fraudulent transactions. MAS will continue to work with all stakeholders to ensure that e-payments remain safe and secure.",14,18,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00018
2021-10-05-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Dr Tan Wu Meng.,1,19,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00019
2021-10-05-T-001,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"I thank the Minister for his answer. Sir, these are serious revelations. A Clementi resident told me that when he disputed a credit card transaction with his bank, he was told because there was an OTP record in his phone number's name, the transaction must be genuine and therefore, cannot be challenged. He appealed a number of times; the case was resolved. But how many more consumers would have given up before attaining a resolution?",1,20,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00020
2021-10-05-T-001,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Sir, I have got three supplementary questions for the Minister. First, prior to September 2020, how many reports were there of fraudulent card transactions in recent years where the victim said they did not perform the transaction nor receive the SMS OTP? Has the trend been going up, prior to the latest findings?",2,21,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00021
2021-10-05-T-001,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Second, will MAS consider looking into these earlier cases too? Cases, which based on earlier assumptions, might have been deemed clear-cut open and shut, but given the latest revelations, might warrant repeat scrutiny?",3,22,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00022
2021-10-05-T-001,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"And thirdly, can MAS reassure the public, including our Clementi residents, that agencies will continue keeping an open mind when a customer is concerned about cyber fraud affecting their credit card, involving the SMS OTP?",4,23,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00023
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Speaker, as I mentioned in my reply just now, we have not seen any confirmed cases of SMS OTP diversion. I emphasise, we are talking about SMS OTP diversion fraud cases. We have not seen any confirmed cases up to now, prior to September. But the banks, as I mentioned just now, are investigating any further reports by consumers and customers, and these will include transactions that occurred before September 2020, taking into consideration this new revelation or this new finding that some of these SMS OTPs could have been diverted and we would take that into consideration in resolving these cases.",1,24,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00024
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Certainly, if any subsequent report were to be made and found to be linked to SMS OTP diversion, the cases would be resolved as with the 75 cases that I highlighted, which means that for affected customers, the banks will waive the unauthorised transactions, so long as the customers have taken the necessary care to protect their card information and authentication credentials.",2,25,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00025
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Going forward, for future cases, whether it is due to SMS OTP diversion or other fraudulent methods, I have mentioned before in this House that we have a Payments Council. They are reviewing guidelines and responsibilities for customers as well as financial institutions to clarify responsibilities and liabilities.",3,26,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00026
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Ultimately, everyone needs to play their part  financial institutions will have to do so, customers will have to do so. If we clarify what the responsibilities and guidelines are, then, hopefully, we can continue collectively to do more to guard against such fraudulent transactions.",4,27,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00027
2021-10-05-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Gerald Giam.,1,28,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00028
2021-10-05-T-001,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"I thank the Minister for answering my PQ. Given that SMS OTP diversion is something that takes place overseas where MAS has no jurisdiction, how are the banks going to prevent this from happening to their customers again? For example, are banks or IMDA going to work with these overseas telcos to close these loopholes?",1,29,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00029
2021-10-05-T-001,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Secondly, will MAS be directing banks to move their multi-factor authentication methods away from SMS to, for example, more secure app-based authentication methods? If so, how will they ensure that the less tech-savvy customers will not be left out?",2,30,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00030
2021-10-05-T-001,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Lastly, can MAS also require banks to allow existing customers to disable SMS multi-factor authentication for their own accounts and then use app-based authentication instead, because they are more secured?",3,31,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00031
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Sir, let me just take these three questions in turn. First, as I mentioned in my reply, IMDA is putting in place some safeguards with regard to how the telcos operate. In this instance where it comes to SMS OTP diversion, the perpetrators needed to do several things.",1,32,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00032
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"One, they would have obtained the victim's personal and financial information and mobile phone number already. That would have been compromised already, through malware, through phishing, whatever methods they would have gotten that information.",2,33,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00033
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Second, the perpetrators would have gained access to a few overseas telco networks to compromise their system. Then, they would fraudulently modify the location details of the targeted victims as though these victims were overseas. Then, you make a transaction and the bank sends an SMS OTP through this overseas network. And that is how, with the compromised credit card credentials, the fraudulent transaction is made.",3,34,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00034
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"And so, as I mentioned just now, telcos are already putting in place additional safeguards, for example, specialised firewalls and other system safeguards to monitor and block suspicious diversions of SMS. This would include, for example, knowing where an individual's location is, and if you suddenly see the change in location, a red flag may be triggered, and then, the telco would then have safeguards in place to prevent the SMS from being diverted. These system safeguards are being worked on by telcos.",4,35,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00035
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the second question, can you please repeat the second question?",5,36,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00036
2021-10-05-T-001,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,Asking the banks to use other forms of authentication besides SMS.,1,37,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00037
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Thank you. Other forms of authentication and whether you can allow customers to opt out. MAS does not prescribe. The financial institutions are required to implement multi-factor authentication mechanisms. It can include SMS OTP but they can include other forms of multi-factor authentication. Each one will potentially be susceptible to perpetrators trying to take advantage of any possible weakness. It is a continuous process where the financial institutions have to review the type of authentication mechanisms which they would like to use, commensurate with the risk level of the financial transaction and the sensitivity of the data involved.",1,38,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00038
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As for allowing options for customers, it is something that MAS can engage the banks on, to see if the banks will be prepared to give more options for customers who feel they would prefer something more secure.",2,39,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00039
2021-10-05-T-001,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But I must say whatever you put in place, the perpetrators will always be looking out for new ways to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. So, this has to be a continuous effort to make sure that our systems remain secure and it requires continued vigilance by regulator, financial institutions and customers, importantly.",3,40,2021-10-05-T-001-S-00040
2021-10-05-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"asked the Minister for National Development in view of the constant start/stop in construction works with the surge in number of COVID-19 cases (a) whether the previous estimated timelines of HDB BTO project completions are expected to be lengthened; and (b) if so, whether further help will be given to the affected flat owners.",1,41,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00041
2021-10-05-T-002,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"asked the Minister for National Development given the continued high demand for BTO flats coupled with the delay in completion of various ongoing BTO projects, whether the Ministry will consider bringing forward various planned BTO projects or consider building more BTO flats than currently planned.",1,42,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00042
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Mr Speaker, Members have shared concerns about the impact of the ongoing pandemic on our HDB Build-to-Order (BTO) supply, the progress of construction work and waiting times for ongoing projects. Let me address these concerns and set out what we are doing to keep our HDB BTO programme on track and to support affected homebuyers.",1,43,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00043
2021-10-05-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Minister, you are taking Question Nos 2 and 3 together?",1,44,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00044
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Yes, Mr Speaker, my apologies. If I may have your permission to take Question Nos 2 and 3 together?",1,45,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00045
2021-10-05-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,46,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00046
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Thank you. First, Mr Seah Kian Peng had asked if HDB will build more BTO flats or advance planned projects in view of demand. We recognise that demand for public housing has remained strong and that is why we had adjusted our supply. We had launched 14,600 flats in 2019. We increased that to 16,800 in 2020. We are on track to launch 17,000 BTO flats this year in 2021. Next year, we will increase the BTO flat supply even further and launch more than 17,000 flats. We are finalising the details and will announce our plans for 2022 when ready.",1,47,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00047
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Second, there have been concerns over the waiting times for BTO flats, as raised by Miss Cheryl Chan. Some have said that waiting times have risen to six to seven years. That is not the case. Let me start with ongoing BTO projects. The average waiting time for ongoing BTO projects, including delays brought about by the pandemic, has remained between four and five years. Thus far, Government’s support and assistance measures have helped to keep the pandemic-induced delays to our BTO projects to a year or less, except for one project which had already experienced project difficulties unrelated to the pandemic. The total wait time for any given project has been kept under six years.",2,48,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00048
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"For BTO projects launched last year and this year, the estimated waiting times range from three to five and a half years. For example, Hougang Citrine launched in August is expected to be completed in three years. Alkaff Breeze in Bidadari launched in February has a wait time of just over three years. And Garden Court @ Tengah, launched last November, has a waiting time of about three and a half years.",3,49,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00049
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"There are some projects that will take longer, such as Queen’s Arc – launched in August this year – expected to take longer at about five and a half years. There are a few projects like Queen’s Arc, where the waiting times are longer. This is because the conditions of the site are difficult, and construction will take longer, or these are projects with very high storey-heights, very tall blocks, which require more construction time. These have caused some people to worry that all new BTOs will take six to seven years. But these are in the minority. By and large, barring further unexpected developments, most flat buyers can expect to move into their flats within four to five years after booking their flats.",4,50,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00050
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Third, the recent news on Greatearth’s insolvency may have added to the anxieties of home buyers waiting for their flats to be completed and some are concerned whether this puts the completion of their homes at risk. To try to minimise the impact on home buyers, HDB has brought new contractors on board, within a month, to take over Greatearth’s affected projects. Unfortunately, this will still add a further two to three months' delay to affected projects, but we are working closely with the new contractors to bring the projects back on track. We are watching the progress of all BTO projects closely and have stepped up efforts to detect emerging issues earlier and resolve them.",5,51,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00051
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Fourth, existing home buyers may be concerned about further delays to ongoing projects given the impact of COVID-19 on the construction industry. With tightened border controls over foreign workers, disruptions in the supply of building materials and stringent worksite public health measures, there have been manpower and material shortages and a slowdown in work, which have affected public and private construction projects.",6,52,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00052
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To try to mitigate the pandemic’s impact on our public housing programme, HDB has rolled out extensive assistance to help contractors complete ongoing projects in a timely manner.",7,53,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00053
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To tackle manpower shortages, HDB has worked with firms to safely recruit workers from various countries and co-shared the increase in manpower costs. HDB has also worked with contractors to explore ways to speed up construction without affecting safety and quality. To minimise work stoppages due to COVID-19 transmission, we have implemented Antigen Rapid Testing, or ART, on top of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) at worksites. This allows members of the construction workforce who have been infected to be picked up and treated early, and close contacts quarantined swiftly. Worksites can then continue operating as long as workers are on the ART regime.",8,54,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00054
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To help with the higher cost of materials, HDB has extended the period of protection against steel price fluctuation and supplied contractors with more concreting materials at protected prices. This is in addition to the extensive Government support provided through the Job Support Scheme (JSS), construction restart grants, legislative interventions, advance payments, sharing of prolongation costs and manpower cost increases, and foreign worker levy rebates.",9,55,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00055
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"While the pandemic has inevitably caused delays to both private and public sector construction projects, including BTO projects, we will continue to do our best to minimise the extent of the delays.",10,56,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00056
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"HDB has also taken steps to support affected home buyers. We have helped some flat buyers secure interim accommodation and will be increasing the supply of flats under the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS) by 800 units over the next two years. For low-income households with no family support and no other housing options, HDB will consider offering Interim Rental Housing, or IRH on a case-by-case basis. Flat buyers who face delays that exceed their Delivery Possession Date, or DPD, will be compensated at the amount and for the period as set out in the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act, or COTMA, which applies to all developers. We will also consider waiving flat booking forfeitures and the one-year wait-out period based on the flat buyers’ circumstances, such as for flat buyers who choose to cancel their BTO flats due to BTO delays and buy a resale flat to meet urgent housing needs.",11,57,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00057
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Even amidst the ongoing pandemic, we are committed to delivering public housing to Singaporeans. With these measures, we will press on to keep our BTO programme on track and support buyers who may be affected by the delays.",12,58,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00058
2021-10-05-T-002,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Miss Cheryl Chan. No more than two supplementary questions, please.",1,59,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00059
2021-10-05-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (East Coast),"Thank you, Mr Speaker, just one. I want to thank the Minister for detailing all the measures that are put in place to ensure the BTO projects will continue in construction, and also to clarify the dates because I have heard a lot of feedback on this aspect.",1,60,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00060
2021-10-05-T-002,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (East Coast),"The question I want to ask the Minister is, just now he mentioned that progressively there will be more BTOs that will be pushed out, even beyond 17,000 over time. Given the fact that there is also a very vibrant resale market currently, how is the Ministry going to balance between the resale market, just to make sure that the prices are still healthy, and also the future BTO flats in place?",2,61,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00061
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"I thank the Member for the question. We continue to keep a close eye on the property market in general, both the private sector as well as the HDB resale market. There are a range of reasons why demand for housing is high.",1,62,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00062
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"First, of course, this is the Echo Boomer generation, family formation rates, marriage and the desire for housing and their own homes, is one.",2,63,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00063
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Second, the pressures of the pandemic, work from home, changes that we have to adapt and adjust to, have caused people to want more space, in general. And so, both first-timers as well as even second-timers wanting a bigger place.",3,64,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00064
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Thirdly, interest rates, being as low as they are, have enabled people to be able to consider housing options.",4,65,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00065
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Then, the stresses and strains on the construction sector, the delays in both BTO as well as private housing projects, have caused some people who need homes to consider the resale market, both in the HDB resale as well as the private resale market for private properties.",5,66,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00066
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"And the social trends that have been taking place over the years and decades  the desire for more space for more privacy, for more nuclearised families, rather than three-generation families, more singles desiring their own homes and own spaces.

As I have said earlier, we will push out more than 17,000 flats next year, more than what we have launched or are going to launch this year.",7,68,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00068
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"At the same time, for the resale market, we have provided significant grants to help people afford homes in the resale market, if they need to.

2021-10-05-T-002,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Sir, first I want to thank the Minister for the mitigating measures that will be introduced. I also welcome the news that there will be more flats that will be built in the coming years; the Minister mentioned more than 17,000. I am quite sure I am not alone in this House but many of us, each week, we continue to receive many requests and appeals from residents, telling us that they just cannot get their flat early enough; they cannot even have a chance of getting a flat.",1,71,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00071
2021-10-05-T-002,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"I believe that the desired outcomes for all of us must be that we want to give couples their first flat as early as possible. So, we need to continue to shorten the waiting time. Four, five years – can it be shorter? Because there is really a lot of pent-up demand.",2,72,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00072
2021-10-05-T-002,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"So, 17,000 now; my first request is, what is the maximum that we could go up to, in order to meet the pent-up demand? Because demand clearly outstrips supply right now. How can we shorten the waiting time?",3,73,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00073
2021-10-05-T-002,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"There are also concerns by residents that whilst waiting for their flat, some of them, their income ceilings may exceed the limits and, therefore, they are disqualified. How do we deal with this?",4,74,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00074
2021-10-05-T-002,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Finally, again, another concern is that as they wait for the flat, the price of the flat will start to also go up. Their affordability level could be in question. So, my plea to the Minister is that – I do not have the figures obviously, but I am quite sure demand far outstrips supply – let us increase the supply as much as possible to reduce the waiting time and fulfil residents and couples' desire for a flat earlier rather than later.",5,75,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00075
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Indeed, the Member's points are well taken. As I said earlier, we will increase the supply of BTO flats next year, a number larger than the 17,000 we have launched this year. We have been increasing the BTO flats' supply for some years already. For example, in 2019, it was 14,600. Last year, it was 16,800. This year, 17,000. Next year, it will be more than that.",1,76,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00076
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We balance that against the supply in the resale market. As I said, the demand is high for a whole variety of reasons. But we have to keep an eye on the overall ecosystem of housing, both public and private, BTOs and resale, to ensure that the overall housing ecosystem remain stable while meeting the aspirations of Singaporeans.",2,77,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00077

2021-10-05-T-002,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Thank you, Sir. Sir, the Minister in his reply mentioned about the PPHS earlier on, that young couples who are still waiting for the flats may want to consider PPHS. But from my indications, from the appeals that we have received, it seems that rental flats under PPHS are not so forthcoming and there is still some amount of waiting there as well. So, can I ask the Minister what is the availability of the rental flats under the PPHS scheme and whether there is enough to meet the demands or requests from new home buyers?",1,79,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00079
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The PPHS provides home buyers with an option if they wish to stay on their own before their flats are ready; these are for married couples especially with children. The demand for PPHS has grown significantly because of the pandemic arising from the BTO delays as well as the desire for more privacy and, therefore, while waiting for their flats, they want to get PPHS.",1,80,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00080
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To make sure that we target the PPHS supply to those who need such housing because of their limited housing options, we made some moves in August this year to target such support to those with household income of below $7,000 and prioritising those with children. So, that way we hope to ensure that those with more urgent housing needs while waiting for their BTO flats can get support. For those with no family support and no housing options, we have other alternatives such as Interim Rental Housing (IRH). We continue to see how better we can support families who have been impacted by the delays during this period.",2,81,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00081
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mr Seah Kian Peng mentioned earlier, if I can take this opportunity to address him, he did ask a question that I omitted to reply, which is with regard to the income ceiling as well as those who may feel that with a longer wait for housing, the risk of them busting the income ceiling is there. We have made some changes to income ceiling in the last few years and continue to review the household incomes of home applicants to ensure that it meets the needs of Singaporeans.",3,82,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00082
2021-10-05-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"And when people apply for the flats, they book their flats, they get the Housing Loan Eligibility (HLE) as well as their grant eligibility at the point of application. Therefore, the delays in waiting for flats that they have already booked, there will be less impact on that front.",4,83,2021-10-05-T-002-S-00083

Other than requiring employers to attend corrective workshops conducted by TAFEP, employers can be advised to rectify lapses in their HR processes. MOM will not hesitate to take enforcement actions against discriminatory employers such as curtailing their work pass privileges in more serious cases.

Can the Ministry actually do more in the area of greater awareness of fair employment best practises among employers, such as adopting similar like BizSafe framework, where senior executives of firms undergo structured training. And further to that, making it a requirement to attend such training first before one can participate in Government tenders, so that firms are clearly motivated to deepen knowledge in this particular area of fair best practices.",1,87,2021-10-05-T-003-S-00087

2021-10-05-T-003,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Can the Ministry also consider that given that SMEs account for more than two-thirds of employment in Singapore, can such training for SMEs before they can recruit or hire individuals be made compulsory?",3,92,2021-10-05-T-003-S-00092
2021-10-05-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Sir, I thank the Member for his idea to actually name and shame some of these employers who may have adopted discriminatory practices. Currently, firms that may have some degree of discriminatory practices may be put on a Fair Consideration Framework, or FCF, watch list. Firms that are on this watch list, technically, they have not flouted any rules yet but, perhaps, some of their practices may be veering on the grey margins. It is through putting them on the watch list that we use it as a way to engage the firms and signal to them that their practices have to be improved. In most instances, employers who are on this FCF watch list have been responsive to TAFEP's engagement efforts and expanded the employment of local employees. In this instance, such engagement is also an educational effort for companies or firms that may not be aware, upfront, of the nuancing of the guidelines on fair employment.",1,93,2021-10-05-T-003-S-00093

2021-10-05-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Naming firms, sometimes, could also end up having a negative consequence because it would then frustrate their efforts to recruit and hire people.

Indeed, the majority of the roles, I can share the exact data later on, but the roles that we have placed in the JGI, the majority of them are in roles that were the same or better – in terms of their draw of the salary levels. This is the majority of the hires that we placed under the JGI scheme. If my memory does not fail me, I think the percentage is more than 60%.

COVID-19 has been devastating for many families and my residents have told me that in coping with COVID-19, many of them have depleted their intended retirement savings, or that maybe even retrenchments have caused them no choice but to dip into their retirement nest eggs.

2021-10-05-T-006,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"The first pertains to Question No 10. It is important that our workforce is equipped with the necessary skillsets to deal with the structural changes in our economy, post-COVID-19. How does the Ministry check whether these training and employment assistance are fit for purpose, ensuring that there are right workers equipped with the right skills in the right sectors? And what will be the KPIs for tracking outcomes for success?",2,207,2021-10-05-T-006-S-00207
2021-10-05-T-006,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"My second supplementary question pertains to Question No 12. In terms of plans and strategies for our workforce and companies, can the Ministry share in greater details  (a) what is insufficient today and what must change; (b) what must our workforce and companies aspire to do; and (c) when these plans must be firmed up to prepare for the opening of our economy?",3,208,2021-10-05-T-006-S-00208
2021-10-05-T-006,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"I thank Mr Yip for his questions. To his first question, as part of the Industry Transformation Map (ITM) planning, MOM and MOE work very closely with the different sector agencies to identify emerging and in-demand skills for jobs in the various sectors. This will then enable the training providers and the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to refine their course offerings to make them more relevant, to make them more targeted and more specific for the industry needs.",1,209,2021-10-05-T-006-S-00209
2021-10-05-T-006,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Doing so will help to ensure that our workers have the necessary skillsets to take on good jobs. In addition, under my other portfolio in MTI, through EDB, through ESG, we have got various market readiness grants. There is also the global innovation alliance network, with the global connect network that we work very closely with SBF, to try to see the needs, the industry trends in many of the developed countries all over the world and to see how we can continue to keep our local workforce abreast of changes to keep them ahead and to keep them competitively sharp. I hope that answers the Member's first question.",2,210,2021-10-05-T-006-S-00210
2021-10-05-T-006,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"To the Member's second point about plans and strategies for our workforce and companies, indeed, this pandemic has accelerated disruption and transformation. It has highlighted very clearly the need for businesses to strengthen their resilience as well as to have to constantly think about the disruptive changes that will come and to diversify. This would not just apply to business transformation but also to the workforce transformation as well, to keep our workers adept, to keep them agile and nimble. So, emerging trends today that we can see, such as automation and digitalisation, have radically transformed and changed the way we work, with remote work becoming more prevalent across many workplaces.",3,211,2021-10-05-T-006-S-00211
2021-10-05-T-006,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"To retain our competitive advantage, to find good sustainable jobs for Singaporeans, our efforts to continue to transform and innovate our economy must continue so that we can strengthen, fortify our business environment and we can ensure that Singapore always remains the preferred hub, the preferred location for trade, for investment, particularly in new emerging growth areas, for instance, like additive manufacturing in Fintech. The anchoring of global companies which meet our desired profile and the aspirations of Singaporeans will help to preserve, spur the creation of good jobs, strengthen our Singapore Core.",4,212,2021-10-05-T-006-S-00212
2021-10-05-T-006,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"I think that point that we debated so long yesterday adds to the fact that we must continue to reinforce trust, reinforce the credibility, our reputation that other economies have, the faith and trust, in us through the years and, hopefully, through the decades ahead.",5,213,2021-10-05-T-006-S-00213
2021-10-05-T-006,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"We must also sustain efforts to help Singaporeans build skills which are relevant to the global talent marketplace. We have started the SkillsFuture movement. We have complemented it with a more nuanced, targeted Career Conversion Programme and these programmes have helped many Singaporeans take up new jobs in growth areas. At the same time, we are also looking to build up our CET pipeline ahead of demand in key growth areas in the green economy. Many of these initiatives come, they converge, we distill them and we develop a very targeted approach to help our fellow Singaporeans.",6,214,2021-10-05-T-006-S-00214

2021-10-05-T-006,Yeo Wan Ling,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Will the Ministry consider working with companies then on identifying key digital skills and the appropriate courses, perhaps across the many different skillsets, on the SkillsFuture platform, that will allow our less digitally inclined workers to be on a level playing field with digital natives in the hiring process and in future in job promotions?",3,218,2021-10-05-T-006-S-00218
2021-10-05-T-006,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Thank you, Ms Yeo. I think these are very pertinent points. For the training part, in terms of the elderly residents, we do have SG Digital Ambassadors to go around to teach them. And for those, even with the literacy skills, the National Library Board (NLB) also has a whole slew of programmes to help them transform as well.",1,219,2021-10-05-T-006-S-00219
2021-10-05-T-006,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"But I think what the Member has hit on is a key issue which is really making sure that when companies and the workforce innovate, when they digitalise and so on, they must be relevant to the needs of the company. To that end, that is really a huge drive by WSG to develop these Career Conversion Programmes, because they are working with the company.",2,220,2021-10-05-T-006-S-00220

2021-10-05-T-006,Hany Soh,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"In this regard, I wish to find out whether options, such as the Career Trials or Place-and-Train programmes, had ever been explored by the employers with these job vacancies. If yes, whether there have been any findings on why such initiatives were unsuccessful in filling these job vacancies.

2021-10-05-T-006,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"There will always be a certain level of job vacancies in a properly functioning labour market. Sometimes, the job vacancies could just be due to a skills mismatch where the jobseekers may not have the full set of requisite skills to be ready for the job. So, as I have shared, this is where the Career Conversion Programmes come in. Sometimes, we even go above that. We work with the companies to develop these Company Training Committees to ensure that the jobseekers have a proper market-clearing opportunity for them to be able to match up to the expectations of the employers.",2,236,2021-10-05-T-006-S-00236
2021-10-05-T-006,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Many of the employers who have actually worked with us to adopt this approach, have found out that the people whom they hire and even then the middle-aged workers, because of their experiential wisdom, the aptitude and attitude, they have actually found that after that conversion programme, that upskilling and reskilling, they found that they actually become pretty good fit.",3,237,2021-10-05-T-006-S-00237

I do not know about that, but there is a difference in scope, they say. And that private donors, and not the Government, are the ones footing the bill for the awards and, therefore, it is they who traditionally felt that the awareness and appeal of sponsoring disability sports is lower than that of mainstream sports, leading to a lower prize for medalled disabled athletes. So, those are the reasons.",8,383,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00383

2021-10-05-T-007,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"First up, Government, as the Minister has mentioned, the Singapore Government has always maintained its position to invest upstream in overall sports participation and then, in grooming sports talents to get to the podium at national, regional, global games under its High Performance Sports system. The Government has hitherto been reluctant to use public funds for what it calls post-podium awards, especially cash awards. So, that is one thing I found out.",11,386,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00386
2021-10-05-T-007,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"The second is this. The two cash awards schemes for medalists are the Multi-Million Dollar Award Programme (MAP) for the Olympians and then, the Athlete Achievement Award (AAA) for the Paralympians. They are administered by different NGOs or non-governmental bodies, SNOC and SNPC. They have different genesis, they started at different times and they have different scopes and features.",12,387,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00387
2021-10-05-T-007,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),The AAA for the Paralympians is managed by the Singapore National Paralympic Council (SNPC) for the para-athletes. Chairman is the ever-passionate Dr Teo-Koh Sock Miang. I think she is there. Dr Teo-Koh. The Olympians are governed by Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) chaired by none other than our also very enthusiastic Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin.,13,388,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00388
2021-10-05-T-007,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Both NGOs separately negotiated for the prize awards at different times, much later for the para-athletes and managed to get quite different sponsorships. There are some features. For instance, under the MAP, a gold-winning Olympian may win $1 million but will not get more if he scores another gold medal. For the Paralympians, a gold-winning Paralympian, on the other hand, will earn a $200,000 award each time he or she wins a gold. The whole system is not quite neat at all and bears a review.",14,389,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00389

Singapore has adopted and ratified the United Nations Convention for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to grant equal rights to the disabled. Our country has moved decisively in the last decade or more to narrow the gap between persons of different abilities in the important realms of life, in education, healthcare, transport, employment. We are still doing that, we still have not arrived, but we are doing that. So, let us make a statement in sports. Make sports accessible, inclusive and prevalent for all persons with disabilities in Singapore and change the headline from what we always debate about after every major game, about disparity, to equality and to something more positive and exciting.",18,393,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00393

So, take heart, whether you are medalled or not. Of course, Pin Xiu is our pride and joy. But also all the others who have just made such a difference. I hope like what Jamus has said, let us take heed, take heart, the rest of Singapore, that we have this culture that is also supportive, whether our representatives are medalled or make it to the podium or not.

We had daily conference calls with SSI's Sport Scientists to make sure that all aspects of her training were covered, and together with Mick Massey from SDSC, we planned for a smooth transition post-circuit breaker. Never once did we lose sight of the target, and in the end, Pin Xiu won two golds.

We must embrace failure, give constructive and not destructive comments.",15,441,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00441
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Beyond winning medals, we must remember the greater meaning of sports and of the Olympic Games. As summed up by Tokyo Olympics Chef de Mission, Dr Ben Tan, and I quote him, ""Team Singapore showed professionalism, fearlessness and tenacity at the Olympics"". It is already an immense achievement for an athlete to qualify for the Olympics. In the midst of this raging pandemic, it takes an even greater amount of determination and courage to compete. We must all support Team Singapore!",16,442,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00442
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Mr Speaker, now that the Tokyo Games is over, it is time to review our national sports strategy. Prof Tommy Koh mentioned in his opinion piece that small countries could win medals as well. I agree. Now that it is evident to us that being small and unable to perform is just an excuse, we need to look into why Singapore cannot win more Olympic medals when countries that are less well-endowed and with similar or smaller populations can do so. Countries such as Hong Kong, Luxembourg, San Marino, Jamaica, Bahamas and Grenada have each won several Olympic medals. What else must Singapore do more and do differently?",17,443,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00443
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"In preparation for this Motion, I have consulted several senior members of SportSG, Singapore Sports School, national coaches and several national athletes. I thank them for their candour and I would also like to put on record the commendable work and contribution in the development of the local sports ecosystem by MCCY, SportSG, SNOC, SNPC, many National Sports Associations and local sports clubs over the years.",18,444,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00444
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Here is a chronology of what was done so far for sports in Singapore. In 1993, the Sports Excellence programme, or SPEX in short, was introduced. In 2004, Singapore Sports School was launched and in 2011, the Singapore Sport Institute to support Team Singapore athletes and coaches in high performance sports started. In 2013, SPEX Scholarships for top national athletes was launched and other athlete-centric programmes were introduced. In 2014, the $1.3 billion Sports Hub with its state-of-the-art integrated facilities opened. By 2015, National Youth Sports Institute was operational.",19,445,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00445
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Annually, the Government invests some $400 million towards sports and sports development in Singapore, including $70 million on the High Performance Sports system to support the development of national athletes and national sports associations.",20,446,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00446
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Clearly, these are significant investments by a country to ensure their high performance athletes have a conducive training environment and some financial support for them to train and compete full-time for major competitions.",21,447,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00447
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"However, despite these investments to the sports ecosystem, Olympic medals still elude Singapore. Clearly, there are still gaps that we need to address to help our national athletes excel on the world stage.",22,448,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00448
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"It is time for us to make a clear commitment whether we want to provide the best possible support to our sporting talents and excel on the world stage or are we just satisfied with participating in some major international events. If we want Singapore to shine and to show the world that our sporting talents are world-class, we will need a better plan with a clearer strategy.",23,449,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00449
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),I would like to suggest the following recommendation basing on the following four points.,24,450,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00450
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"First, focus. We need to be very clear about the sports that we intend to develop to create multiple structured development pathways. Basing on past performances and future potential, we will have to carefully identify three or four sports to focus on, basing on performance outcome and not social community participation.",25,451,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00451
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Second, search. To excel in anything you do, one will require the time to train. If you wish to be an Olympics Champion, you need to start training from an early age. We have to build a broad-based pyramid that includes the community sports academies, clubs and National Sports Associations to identify young sports talents. Upon selection and training, expose these talents to high-level international competitions in order to sharpen their skills and build up their experience. It is possible to find our gems if we search hard and early enough.",26,452,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00452
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Third, nurture. We have to do way more if we wish to develop a conducive environment for our talents, starting with MOE schools and the Institutes of Higher Learning to be more supportive in accommodating sports talents. Athletes will have to miss lessons or even examinations when they are representing Singapore at the regional and international sporting events. Such students should be provided with flexibility if they have to take a longer time to complete their academic studies, diploma or degree programmes. It is not easy for anyone to focus 100% if they have to choose between achieving excellence in their interest and their academic commitments. Most parents would want their children to focus on academics because that is the mainstream approach when it comes to securing a good future. This common mindset about no future for professional sports in Singapore must change. Academics may not work for everyone and sports can, in fact, be a good alternative for those who are less academic.",27,453,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00453
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"We can be talking about our strategies and problems till the cows come home but the fact is, ""No money, no talk."" So, on the financial aspects of nurturing a sports talent, we have to ensure that all talented athletes from humble family backgrounds are not denied a chance to excel due to the lack of resources. As of now, most of our national athletes are amateur athletes with no professional sponsorships. Most will have to juggle full-time studies or a full-time job with daily training. Nearer to major competitions, some may have to decide if they wish to take a year or two off from school or work at their own expense. Understandably, not all athletes can afford to do so.",28,454,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00454
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"The SPEX Scholarship was launched in 2013 to address this issue. SportSG sponsors about 70 top-tiered national athletes with a monthly stipend so that they can train full-time. SportSG also provide various training grants to those athletes who decide to take time off to train full-time. Separately, SpexBusiness is a network of companies from diverse industries which offers our national athletes various career development support, such as employment opportunities and workplace flexibilities.",29,455,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00455
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"All these grants sound good but it is just not good enough to attract talented athletes to go professional. To groom an Olympic medalist from a young age, it can easily cost millions. Instead of having to constantly justify why more state funds should be used to groom a handful of athletes when these resources could well be channelled into social services, we could relinquish total management control of our national athletes.",30,456,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00456
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"With professional management, successful professional athletes can be very influential, just like big stars. When athletes win medals and excel at the global stage, they not only bring pride to Singapore, but also goodwill and publicity to their corporate sponsors. We could look into working with bigger commercial corporations that require endorsements and branding and in return, have them support the cost of training and provide financial assistance. A strong partnership with big corporate sponsors should be considered. Recently, there are some fast-growing multinational technology companies setting up shop in Singapore. We ought to move fast.",31,457,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00457
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"A career in sports can be short-lived. I would now like to touch on the matter of professional athletes retiring. In March 2015, the Singapore Coach Excellence Programme was established to provide enhanced training and development pathway for all coaches from the grassroots and community to high performance sports. However, a career in coaching may not work for all athletes. One possibility could be a continuation of partnership with the corporations that supported these athletes or for Government-linked companies or Temasek-linked companies or even the Public Service to assist and support our national athletes to transit into second careers. A viable second career opportunity would certainly provide an additional assurance to athletes and their parents when considering if they should turn professional. All professional athletes' safety net must be addressed.",32,458,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00458
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"On this note, I would like to recommend that MCCY and MTI work together to start a Sports Representation programme, to recognise the participation of big corporations in the support of our top-tier national athletes who are keen to turn professional.",33,459,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00459
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Fourth, persevere. The reality is that there is no short cut. A lot of hard work, resources and systematic development have to be invested in order to groom that one winner. Developing a talent to be able to compete at a high level competition and able to have a continuous pipeline of talents will require time.",34,460,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00460
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),These four pointers are necessary to ensure a strong pipeline of athletes. The next Olympics Games is only three years away and we look forward to more local athletes shining brighter in the Paris Olympics in 2024.,35,461,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00461
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Mr Speaker, I would also like to discuss how community sports bond our nation.",36,462,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00462
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"The People's Association (PA), Health Promotion Board (HPB) and ActiveSG actively promote sports and active living. The annual National Sports Participation Survey reports that regular participation of at least once weekly in sports and physical activity grew from 42% in 2011 to an all-time high rate of 69% in 2020. Since the launch of ActiveSG in 2014, they have garnered a membership base of two million and a visitorship of over 17 million every year to ActiveSG sport facilities and programmes before the pandemic. Community sports, such as zumba and brisk walking, have also garnered a huge following. In Northwest CDC, the brisk walking club has membership of more than 60,000 walkers!",37,463,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00463
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"These sporting activities are simple, widely accessible and affordable. They are suitable for people of all ages and, more importantly, these community sports activities bring people together, regardless of their race, language and religion, gender and age. In addition, community sports and fitness activities play a very important role to keep our residents, especially the seniors, active physically and engaged psychologically, so that they can continue to age actively into their golden years. To add, instead of staying home to play online games, our younger residents are reminded to exercise several times a week through these community events.",38,464,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00464
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Unfortunately, the pandemic caused a severe impact on our community events. The strong momentum gathered over the past decade declined. A recent study by marketing research company Ipsos showed that 30% of 500 respondents experienced an average increase of around five kilogrammes during the pandemic. The main reasons were due to the more sedentary lifestyles and the closure of and capacity restrictions in gyms and fitness studios. Fortunately, 40% of the respondents reported that they are exercising more often due to the absence of work commutes which made it easier to carve out time to exercise.",39,465,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00465
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Going forward in a COVID-endemic world, if some of the safe management measures were to remain for a prolonged period, PA, HPB, ActiveSG and schools must look into what can be done to encourage people to partake in community sports. There are several challenges that will require creative solutions. I hope we can consider the following.",40,466,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00466
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Firstly, different measures for the vaccinated and unvaccinated. Access to enclosed and air-conditioned gyms and fitness studios will not be accessible to the unvaccinated individuals. Unvaccinated individuals will have to exercise in the open spaces instead. In fact, some fitness centres, including those operated by ActiveSG, have started outdoor gyms so that members can still do their free weights and circuit training in an open space.",41,467,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00467
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Secondly, I recommend that ActiveSG rent out fitness studios at a special rate to fitness instructors who wish to coach their students online. This will allow some fitness instructors to leverage technology to amplify their outreach. They could even take a step further by using these facilities to create digital content and produce fitness workout videos.",42,468,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00468
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Sports will prepare our youths to be physically and mentally prepared for the challenges of the real world and my biggest concern is actually the unvaccinated young children below 12 years old. At the moment, physical education lessons for Primary schools are very controlled or suspended. In fact, most national school sports meet and games have also been halted for almost two years now. This stoppage of physical activities has an unhealthy and negative effect on young children and youths. Not only are they not able to exercise, they are not able to interact with their friends and are also unable to develop their physical and mental strengths through sports and games.",43,469,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00469
2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),It is important for MOE to take a risk-based approach to gradually open up sports activities and CCAs in Primary schools and restart the national school sports meet and games in the Secondary schools and Junior Colleges.,44,470,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00470

2021-10-05-T-007,Poh Li San,Ms Poh Li San,"As the pandemic situation wanes, sports that are played in the outdoors, such as track and field, and those with minimal contact and played indoors, such as table tennis and badminton, should restart. Hopefully, team sports with less contact like volleyball and netball can also restart. Understandably, contact sports like soccer and rugby will take some time but the game could be reorganised into smaller teams so that children can resume playing again in a safe manner.",1,472,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00472

2021-10-05-T-007,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"We have seen for ourselves how sports have the capacity to rally a nation and inspire generations. Sports, therefore, play a crucial and important role in forging a strong Singapore spirit. Sportsmen and sportswomen also serve as good role models for our youths, with their passion, perseverance, drive and values in sportsmanship. Athletes like Yip Pin Xiu and Joseph Schooling are good examples.",3,478,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00478

2021-10-05-T-007,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"In order to achieve this, the Government can consider working further with the private sector by creating an official platform and invite like-minded private sector organisations to come on board to spearhead these efforts. At the moment, we do have various existing programmes by the Government and the private sector in support of the sporting community. Examples include funding from SportsSG, the One Team Singapore Fund, spexScholarship and also spexBusiness which tap on private sector support. I am also aware, for instance, that Deloitte has its own specially-curated programme, ""Deloitte Ignite"" which offers internship and employment opportunities for elite athletes, current and retired.",6,481,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00481
2021-10-05-T-007,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"These existing programmes have certainly assisted our athletes over the years but, Sir, I think we can do more. We can invite senior executives from the private sector to sit in a committee, together with MCCY, to look at how we can better support our athletes holistically. Working closely with the private sector, we will be able to access a wider range of resources and utilise these resources flexibly to benefit a wider spectrum of athletes in more sporting disciplines. We will also be able to better tailor the support given to each athlete as requirements may differ from athlete to athlete and from sport to sport.",7,482,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00482
2021-10-05-T-007,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Separately, a perennial worry for elite athletes is their livelihoods after their sporting careers are over. The spexBusiness network has done well in this area for many of our athletes but such a committee can look to leveraging the existing network to do even more.",8,483,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00483
2021-10-05-T-007,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Japan, for example, has a culture of ""corporate athletes"", where Japanese corporations have sometimes hired elite athletes as full-time employees with a flexible work-training schedule that is tailored to meet the athlete concerned. While we may not be able to adopt a similar model, the committee can look at other innovative arrangements, suited to our local context, for our Singapore athletes.",9,484,2021-10-05-T-007-S-00484

I would just like to clarify that based on the latest available data from 2020, the proportion of job vacancies unfilled for six months or more was 27%, not 57%.",1,500,2021-10-05-T-008-S-00500

2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"The crime of Sedition has its origins in English common law.

2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"The Sedition Act, in its current form, has its roots in the Sedition Ordinance 1948, which was introduced by the British to the Federation of Malaya in 1948 in part to curb local opposition to British colonial rule. The Act criminalises conduct with seditious tendencies. Those tendencies are defined in section 3 of the Act including  (a) bringing into hatred or contempt or exciting disaffection against the Government; (b) exciting citizens or residents to attempt to change in unlawful ways, any matter legally established; (c) bringing into hatred or contempt or the exciting of disaffection against the administration of justice in Singapore; (d) raising discontent or disaffection amongst the citizens of Singapore or residents in Singapore; and (e) promoting feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population in Singapore.",4,506,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00506

2021-10-05-T-009,Deputy Speaker,Mdm Deputy Speaker,Mr Leon Perera.,1,527,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00527
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, the Government has set out its rationale for the repeal of the Sedition Act Bill. It said that it had used the Sedition Act in the past to address various forms of conduct that weaken our social fabric and undermine our institutions. However, new laws were introduced to deal with these concerns in a more ""targeted and calibrated manner"", such as the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act (MRHA), Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), Administration of Justice Act, Undesirable Publications Act, Newspaper and Printing Presses Act (NPPA) and specific provisions under the Penal Code.",1,528,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00528
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"MHA has said that for this reason, it finds that the Sedition Act is of limited application and can be repealed. But as a result, various provisions in other Acts are being amended.",2,529,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00529
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Madam, I do not oppose this Bill but will pose some clarifying questions to the Minister on areas of concern.",3,530,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00530
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, under section 5(1) of the Sedition Act, ""No prosecution for an offence under section 4 shall be begun except within six months after the offence is committed  provided that for the purposes of this subsection a prosecution shall be deemed to be begun against any person when a warrant or summons has been issued in respect of any charge made against that person and based on the facts or incident in respect of which the prosecution afterwards proceeds.""",4,531,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00531
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),This would appear to create a time limit for prosecution for any offences committed under the Sedition Act. This plays a useful role of helping to reduce the risk of a suspect being investigated too long after the event and relevant evidence may not be fully available.,5,532,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00532
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"With the consequential amendment to section 267C of the Penal Code, this time limit for prosecution would not seem to apply anymore.",6,533,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00533
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I would like to ask the Minister to confirm this and if it is so, what is the basis for making this change? Should not the time limit for prosecution provision have also been added as an amendment to the Penal Code in this Bill in the same way that this Bill makes the offences described in sections 298, 298A and 505 of the Penal Code arrestable, because they are arrestable in the now to be repealed Sedition Act? That is my first point.",7,534,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00534
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Secondly, the new section 267C of the Penal Code will be amended to clarify that ""counselling disobedience to the law"" includes but is not limited to providing instruction, advice or information that promotes disobedience to the law.",8,535,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00535
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"My concern here is with the phrase ""information that promotes disobedience to the law and such order"". I would like to clarify whether the act of merely conveying information about the topic of civil disobedience without any specific intent to induce someone to commit a specific act of civil disobedience would count as an offence.",9,536,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00536
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"For example, a lecturer may teach a module on the history of civil disobedience as part of a course in history or politics or citizens may convey information to one another on social media about acts of civil disobedience that have been committed elsewhere or in the past or ideas relating to the philosophical arguments for and/or against civil disobedience.",10,537,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00537
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"If there is no specific intent to induce a person to commit a specific act of civil disobedience in Singapore that can be demonstrated from the said sharing of information, would this still constitute an offence? I think it should not but I welcome the Minister's assurance on this point.",11,538,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00538
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"My third point, Madam, is that this Bill makes offences under 298 and 298A arrestable, which the Minister just alluded to, meaning that the Police may arrest without a warrant.",12,539,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00539
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"No doubt these powers were already in the now to be repealed Sedition Act. However, I would like to ask for clarification about why these offences are now being made arrestable in the Penal Code for the following reasons.",13,540,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00540
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"At paragraph 11 of the MHA press release accompanying the First Reading of this Bill, MHA pointed out that the offences under the Sedition Act are arrestable and stated that with its repeal, making this change is ""to ensure that the Police can continue to act swiftly and effectively when dealing with egregious cases that affect social cohesion"". Hence, MHA proposes to make, among other things, sections 298 and 298A in the Penal Code that deal with conduct that threatens social cohesion and harmony arrestable.",14,541,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00541
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The problem is, sections 298 and 298A are broadly worded. By way of contrast, even the offences in the colonial-era Sedition Act contains safeguards and exceptions to protect legitimate, non-seditious speech, which these sections of the Penal Code do not appear to contain.",15,542,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00542
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Section 3(1) of the now to be repealed Sedition Act defines a seditious tendency and includes in section 3(1)(e) ""to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population of Singapore.""",16,543,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00543
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Critically, however, section 3(2) of the now to be repealed Sedition Act sets out a list of exceptions to specify what shall not be deemed as seditious and I quote from this section 3(2) of the now to be repealed Sedition Act, ""Notwithstanding subsection (1), any act, speech, words, publication or other thing shall not be deemed to be seditious by reason only that it has a tendency  (a) to show that the Government has been misled or mistaken in any of its measures; (b)	to point out errors or defects in the Government or the Constitution as by law established or in legislation or in the administration of justice with a view to the remedying of such errors or defects; (c)	to persuade the citizens of Singapore or the residents in Singapore to attempt to procure by lawful means the alteration of any matter in Singapore; or (d)	to point out, with a view to their removal, any matters producing or having a tendency to produce feelings of ill-will and enmity between different races or classes of the population of Singapore, if such act, speech, words, publication or other thing has not otherwise in fact a seditious tendency."" Section 4 then sets out the list of offences under the Sedition Act.",17,544,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00544
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In contrast, sections 298 and 298A of the Penal Code as amended by this Bill do not have such express exceptions or safeguards.",18,545,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00545
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Perhaps the safeguards come in the requirement that there must be ""deliberate intention"" to wound the religious or racial feelings of any person in section 298.",19,546,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00546
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In section 298A, the offender must know that they are promoting or attempting to promote feelings of ill will and so on between different racial or religious groups or must know that they are committing an act which is prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony between different religious or racial groups in which disturbs or is likely to disturb public tranquility.",20,547,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00547
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"However, I am not sure if such requirements in section 298 and 298A of the Penal Code really provide for the same safeguards as section 3(2) of the Sedition Act. In particular, I am concerned about the scope of the new section 298A(b).",21,548,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00548
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"What if someone points out something which they know is prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony between different religious or racial groups and is likely to disturb public tranquility but they are doing so for the purpose of trying to point it out so as to remove it? This would fall under the exception to section 3(2)(d) of the Sedition Act, which is now to be repealed but with the Sedition Act to be repealed, that would not be an exception in the amended Penal Code. So, will the Police investigate such conduct as a potential offence?",22,549,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00549
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Madam, because of the safeguards in the Sedition Act but which are not in sections 298 and 298A of the Penal Code that are in this Bill, I do not think that the offences under the Sedition Act versus 298 and 298A of the Penal Code are a like-for-like swap or porting over, as it were.",23,550,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00550
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"MHA's rationale for adding arrestability to these two offences, aside from merely porting these over from the Sedition Act, is also so as ""to ensure that the Police can continue to act swiftly and effectively in dealing with egregious cases that affect social cohesion"".",24,551,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00551
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"However, is there a threshold for what constitutes egregious and if so, what are some of the criteria for it? Determining such offences involves judgement and by making these offences arrestable and giving the Police the power to arrest without a warrant, would that not increase the risk of the wrong judgement being made, which might potentially inflame a delicate situation further? How would that risk be mitigated and managed?",25,552,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00552
2021-10-05-T-009,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"And my last point, Madam. Section 298 and 298A of the Criminal Procedure Code were amended when the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act was amended back in October 2019. I would like to clarify if those amendments are already in force. The Singapore Statutes Online facility does not reflect any MRHA amendment being enforced from 2019. The last amendment reflected there is in 2011.",26,553,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00553

2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Thank you, Madam. I wanted to say I thank Members for the overwhelming support for this Bill to repeal the Sedition Act. The fact that only Mr Perera wanted to speak, I think, does suggest overwhelming support. And he supports it as well, so, I thank him for that. I will address the clarifications that Mr Perera has raised.",1,556,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00556
2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I think the first question that he asked is the time limit for prosecution. Under the Sedition Act, actions have to be brought within six months and there is no time limit under the amended provisions.",2,557,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00557
2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"To understand this, I think we need to look at the Sedition Act a little carefully. We are talking about very different offences. Let me make that clear.",3,558,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00558
2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The six-month time limit is in section 5 of the Sedition Act. Section 5, then, must relate back to section 4, for example, 4(1)(a), where any person who does or attempts to do or makes any preparation to do anything which would have a seditious tendency. So, what is important is seditious tendency. That, in turn, brings you back to section 3(1), which defines what seditious tendency is.",4,559,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00559
2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"A seditious tendency is a tendency to bring into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection against the Government.

2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, if you went out there and you said something that makes people upset with the Government of Singapore, under section 3(1)(a), that is an offence. If you raise the discontent or disaffection amongst the citizens, it does not matter whether it is against the Government or not, that is also an offence.",6,561,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00561
2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, it is a very extreme legislation and we are doing away with it and you can understand why a time limit of six months has been put.",7,562,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00562
2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As I said earlier, I think on the strict wordings of section 3, Mr Leon Perera would have committed offences several times. I am likely to have committed offences several times as well, both in my previous incarnation and now, because it talks about raising discontent, disaffection amongst the citizens of Singapore and exciting disaffection against the Government. These all really have not been relevant for a very long time.",8,563,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00563

So, there is legislation that deals with that.",9,564,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00564
2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Section 267C takes some parts of section 4. That is really on violence, getting people to violently do something and contrary to the law. There is no complete taking of the Sedition Act and putting it in. What you now have with the other pieces of legislation are completely different animals. The essence or the heart of the Sedition Act is actually being done away with.",10,565,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00565
2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, the rationale for the six months has got to be seen in the context of what the Sedition Act provides. In the other legislation, in normal criminal cases, you take the normal criminal approach, which is that there is no time limit on prosecuting offences.",11,566,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00566
2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, for example, if you look at section 267C, which is the amendment that is coming along, section 267C of the Penal Code is an existing provision with no time limits. It originally dealt with usage, making, printing, reproducing, distributing, communicating any incitement to violence. So, you can see it is a very different type of offence, counselling disobedience to the law or to lawful order of a public servant, which is likely to lead to a breach of the peace. So, it is that sort of offence. It has got nothing to do with exciting disaffection against the Government or making people unhappy. It is a very direct focused offence and we are making some changes there, including to the mental elements.",12,567,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00567
2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Specifically, we are covering statements made, words uttered and reproduction sale, offer for sale and importation of documents. That is the reason why the six months' requirement under the Sedition Act is not being ported over because, basically, most of the key elements of the Sedition Act, which kept the colonial rule in place, are being done away with. Bits and pieces which are relevant for modern Singapore have already been moved out into other legislation. Now, one last bit is being moved out.",13,568,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00568
2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The second point that Mr Perera makes on the counselling of civil disobedience and the mental element. Again, if you look at section 267C, conveying information about civil disobedience is, in and of itself, not an offence under section 267C because if you look at section 267C, it has got (1)(a), (b), (c), (d), then it says, in the proposed amendments, the person does any of these things, intending for violence, disobedience to the law or such lawful order or breach of the peace to occur. So, the person must have intended for the violence or the disobedience or the breach of the peace to occur, or knowing, or having reason to believe, that such consequences would occur. And, likewise, under 267(2)(d), there is also a requirement for knowing or having reason to believe an intention. So, the mental elements are set out in the proposed amendments, which are at a higher level than what the Sedition Act requires.",14,569,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00569
2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The third point Mr Perera makes is why is it being made arrestable. Again, I think you need to compare sections 298 to 298A, which are already in our Statute books, with section 3(1). I just took the House through section 3(1). As I mentioned, a large number of us would probably have run afoul of section 3(1) at one point of time.",15,570,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00570
2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The reason for lower thresholds in section 3(1) is due to its own history of maintaining colonial rule. You have got to look at section 3(1) and you have got to see what is important is that section 3(1)(a), ""A seditious tendency is a tendency to bring into hatred or contempt or excite disaffection against the Government"". And then, of course, you have got (b), (c), (d), (e), some of which have been moved over in the past and one aspect is being moved over now.",16,571,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00571
2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"And then, section 3(2) says it shall not be deemed to be seditious by reason only that you are trying to show that the Government has been misled or mistaken; or you are pointing out errors or defects in the Government as by law established; or you are trying to persuade citizens of Singapore, the residents in Singapore to attempt to procure by lawful means the alteration of any matter in Singapore; or to point out, with a view to their removal, any matters producing or having a tendency to produce feelings of ill-will and enmity between different races or classes.",17,572,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00572
2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, you see this is really nothing to do with the offences that are now found in other legislation, including the slight amendments to section 267C which is on counselling disobedience to the law or the view to breaking of the law.",18,573,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00573
2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Sedition Act section 3(2)(d) has some reference to producing feelings of ill-will and enmity between different races or classes, but you must look at it in the light also of section 3(3), which says the intention of the person charged at the time he did some of these things, seditious words are irrelevant. Your intention is irrelevant. If you did what you did and it has these tendencies, then you are liable under the law. Your intention, your knowledge is completely irrelevant. So, it is a very different animal, very different kind of offence and one could almost say very sui generis. We are not going down that route.",19,574,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00574
2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"If you look at sections 298 and 298A, which, by the way, is not an issue today, ""whoever by words, spoken or written, or by signs or visible representation, promote or attempts to promote, on the grounds of religion or race, ill-will and commits any act which he knows is prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony between different religious groups"". That is section 298A. So, the element of intention is incorporated in section 298A(b). Section 298 refers to deliberate intention. It is relevant today insofar as offences are being made arrestable.",20,575,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00575
2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, one can ask  does it have to be made arrestable? What is the prejudice? Those are fair questions. I do not think the question can be asked by reference to the Sedition Act which, as I have said, deals with quite different subjects and the exceptions do not make sense in the context of these provisions. But I think it is legitimate to ask. Do you need to make it arrestable? I think a counter question is  what is the prejudice if it is made arrestable? It allows the Police to move faster, it allows the Police to intervene and these are serious matters. And that is a matter of judgement.",21,576,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00576
2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I think Mr Perera's fourth and final point is whether the MRHA amendments are already in force. No, they are not yet in force. I think we answered a Parliamentary Question in September. The amendments were passed in 2019 but, normally, with many such legislation, which affect a large group of people on the ground – here, it is all the religious organisations – they have to make disclosures, they have compliance requirements. You cannot just bring the Act into force without making sure – religious organisations are differently resourced. Some are well-resourced, some are less well-resourced. Some are essentially a very small operation – to give time to all of them to resource themselves, to be able to comply with the requirements of the legislation. In fact, you have got to take time to educate them, talk to them about the requirements.",22,577,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00577
2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We also have to make sure that our own systems are set up to be able to receive the information that comes through. Another subject which I have spoken about quite frequently in this House is that we are short of officers and we now have to find officers who can be trained to deal with these specific returns that the religious groups will be giving. So, there are a number of different factors here.",23,578,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00578
2021-10-05-T-009,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We will do this as quickly as we can. I have said the training of the Investigation Officers on the thresholds for the amended offences is ongoing and that will take a little bit of time. But, on the ground, as in the religious organisations, also need a little bit of time. And our systems need a little bit of time. We will bring it into force as soon as all these things are in sync.",24,579,2021-10-05-T-009-S-00579

2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"First, to help businesses with cash flow, the enhancement to the Loss Carry-Back Relief scheme has been extended for another year. Qualifying deductions for the Year of Assessment (YA) 2021 may be carried back up to three preceding YAs, instead of one. The amount of qualifying deductions that may be carried back is capped at $100,000. This allows businesses to get a refund of up to $17,000 of income tax paid for YA 2018 to YA 2020. Clause 32 of the Bill provides for this amendment.",5,590,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00590

Likewise, to continue supporting corporate volunteering, the Business and IPC Partnership Scheme (BIPS) has been extended for another two years to CY 2023.

This will allow tenants to benefit from the full amount of the monetary support payments. Landlords will also be allowed to claim income tax deductions for these monetary support payments they made to tenants in 2021. This is to facilitate the passing on of rental waivers granted to master tenants of qualifying Government-owned commercial properties to their sub-tenants, as well as the making of monetary support payments by landlords to their tenants in 2021.

2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"First, we will set out the tax treatment for two situations  where trading stock is appropriated, or used, for non-trade or capital purposes, and vice versa.

The proposed amendments will now codify this current tax treatment into our tax legislation.",10,595,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00595
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Trading stock held by taxpayers may be appropriated for non-trade or capital purposes. For example, a property developer may decide to stop trying to sell unsold units and instead keep them for long-term capital gains. In such cases, we will treat the market value of the trading stock on the date of appropriation as income at that juncture. Any gain, which is arrived at after deducting expenses, will then be subject to tax, while any loss is allowed as a deduction.",11,596,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00596

2021-10-05-T-010,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My first point is about tax deductions for donations. Singaporeans should donate to social and community causes.

2021-10-05-T-010,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, many businesses continue to struggle during this pandemic period. I support the provisions and exemptions to reduce some of their overheads. Nevertheless, I would like to highlight five issues.",1,639,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00639
2021-10-05-T-010,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"First, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I am concerned about ensuring adequate revenue streams from the loss of income tax due to the exemptions. The Government has already had to dip into reserves twice to fund the COVID-19 package. Through the Government’s prudent planning and reallocation of resources, we are assured that we do not need to expect to tap on the reserves anytime soon. Yet, it is apparent that the costs to deal with the economic effects of the pandemic are rising.",2,640,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00640
2021-10-05-T-010,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"In these trying times, it seems that the Government would continue to fund the bulk of the COVID-19-related healthcare expenses for as long as possible. With reduced tax revenues, how does the Government ensure that the expenses remain sustainable? What is the projected loss in revenue from the proposed provisions and tax exemptions?",3,641,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00641
2021-10-05-T-010,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, related to the above, my second point is on ensuring that the tax exemptions for businesses meet their intended purpose of providing a lifeline to struggling businesses. These exemptions should remain sustainable, in case they have to be extended in light of the persistent uncertainty of COVID-19.",4,642,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00642
2021-10-05-T-010,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Businesses have been accorded a litany of support measures to tap on, from the JSS to rental waivers, training grants and schemes, and so on. Do we really need to further exempt in areas that companies are supposed to strategise and exercise prudence on, as part of running a business? I am referring specifically to packaging, provision of doubtful debts and diminution in value of investments and renovations.",5,643,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00643
2021-10-05-T-010,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"For instance, companies that have had to invest in R&R works to pivot their business, or to fulfil safe management requirements owing to the pandemic, should be the intended recipients of this tax exemption. On the other hand, there are also companies that have clearly expanded and are thriving due to the pandemic  delivery companies and online office solutions come to mind. There must be a way to differentiate between the former and latter type of companies, as the latter are not the intended recipients of these tax exemptions.",6,644,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00644
2021-10-05-T-010,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),These companies should indeed be applauded but they should be assisted through other schemes and grants that we already have in place which reward companies that are expanding or hiring more employees.,7,645,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00645
2021-10-05-T-010,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"As for tax exemptions on the design of packaging for overseas markets, I understand that this is meant to support internationalisation efforts. However, we should be promoting green and sustainable packaging, in line with the global call for more sustainability efforts. It would appear contradictory to our long-term goals of reducing waste in packaging, if companies can get subsidised for extravagant packaging. Let us not forget that the recently introduced Mandatory Packaging Reporting Framework under the Resource Sustainability Act, which was intended to help companies reduce packaging use, had also hit roadblocks due to COVID-19.",8,646,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00646
2021-10-05-T-010,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"I would propose a more targeted approach to identify relevant sectors and businesses for specific tax rebates. This is not to make things difficult for businesses, but to be judicious in providing rebates. Support schemes should remain sustainable. This is to continue providing the necessary assistance to businesses and workers for as long as needed. Beyond tax exemptions, further support can be given in the form of mentorships and consultations, to guide businesses to tap on the existing relevant support schemes.",9,647,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00647
2021-10-05-T-010,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, my third point is that the impending GST hike, originally planned to take place between 2022 and 2025, will come sooner than later, to make up for this loss in tax revenue. I have spoken about this before in my earlier speeches. Understandably, the GST hike was announced before the pandemic and there were plans to implement measures to cushion the impact on the lower- and middle-income groups. However, residents have expressed the sentiment that the GST hike should only be implemented after the job market stabilises, hopefully, in the short to medium term. This is especially so as we brace ourselves for overall increases in the cost of living over the next few years.",10,648,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00648
2021-10-05-T-010,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Fourth, Mdm Deputy Speaker, there must be increased vigilance against unscrupulous companies who may manipulate the provisions. In the past two years, we have seen how some errant employers either tried to make money off the Jobs Support Scheme by falsifying CPF contributions, or asked employees to return part of their monthly wage in cash. Some would also split wages across business entities to circumvent the salary ceiling. What are the methods of auditing to prevent such acts from happening? Moreover, how would IRAS determine the validity of declared expenses to ensure that they are not frivolous, or worse, fictitious? This is relevant, especially in reference to clause 7 of section 13ZA, which relates to the exemption of certain payments received, in connection with COVID-19 events.",11,649,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00649
2021-10-05-T-010,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, my last point is that I support the introduction of whistle-blowing protection in clause 50 of the ITA and the related tax statutes. This is consistent with the Cybersecurity Act 2018, as what the Minister has said, and the Regulation of Imports and Exports Regulations (RIER). This also helps to prevent unscrupulous companies from manipulating the provisions, a point I made earlier.",12,650,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00650
2021-10-05-T-010,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"In practice, it is difficult to detect corporate crime like money laundering and fraud. It does not mean that this does not exist. Corporate crime exists in Singapore. We have seen recent high profile cases involving Hin Leong and the fraudulent Envy nickel trading scheme. Whistle-blower protection is key to good corporate governance. It allows employees who want to do the right thing to speak up, alert the authorities and limit damage before it becomes too late. The fallout can be enormous and damaging.",13,651,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00651
2021-10-05-T-010,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Hence, the introduction of whistle-blower protection in tax statutes is welcomed. Will the Government introduce similar provisions to other statutes concerned with corporate crime? Will the Government also consider enhancing the current whistle-blower protection clauses to prohibit corporations from retaliating against whistle-blowers? The current provision only protects informers from being identified in proceedings. However, it does not stop a company who is aware of a whistle-blower complaint, from initiating a witch-hunt to flush out the whistle-blower. The company may also place pressure on the whistle-blower, for example, by threatening to derail his career.",14,652,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00652
2021-10-05-T-010,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Protection of a whistle-blower’s identity in the context of proceedings is scant reassurance, when they could still be retaliated against in other forms. Without further protection, whistle-blowers will still be reluctant to come forward.",15,653,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00653
2021-10-05-T-010,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"In conclusion, Mdm Deputy Speaker, the past two years have been difficult for our local businesses. Many continue to struggle to stay afloat to provide jobs for Singaporeans and to move our economy. They should be the target of our support schemes and tax exemptions to help them tide over these difficult times. The Government is also running a tight ship with increased demands and expenses, exacerbated by the pandemic. A poorly timed GST hike would lead to reduced consumer activity, which in turn hurts businesses. Additional prudence must be exercised. This is to ensure that the assistance offered is, as John Maynard Keynes put it wisely and succinctly, targeted, timely and temporary. I support the Bill.",16,654,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00654

Even if we take into account the sharp spike in HDB resale prices year-to-date, HDB resale prices rose by 11.7% in the past five years compared to 19.7% for private home prices. This wealth gap has been exacerbated by the falling percentage of resident households who live in public housing, which has declined to 78.7% in 2020, from 80% in 2015 and 82% in 2010.",25,680,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00680

2021-10-05-T-010,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Let us also remember that not only does Singapore not have a wealth tax, there is no capital gains tax, no tax on dividends, no inheritance tax, no estate duties, and has one of the lowest effective personal income tax rates globally.",31,686,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00686
2021-10-05-T-010,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Yes, there could be implementation challenges and a wealth tax will take many forms, be it net wealth tax like Switzerland, a property gains tax or an inheritance tax, to name a few. And, yes, having a wealth tax alone will not eliminate widening wealth inequality in Singapore. But do we truly want to have a tax system where our low- to middle-income workers pay more in income tax than a trust fund baby living off his grandparents' inheritance?",32,687,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00687
2021-10-05-T-010,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),The second issue is to raise the level of progressivity in our corporate income tax regime to better support our local SMEs.,33,688,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00688
2021-10-05-T-010,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I do recognise that there are features in our current corporate taxes that better benefit SMEs. Corporate income tax rebates being capped at a dollar amount, $15,000 for the Year of Assessment (YA) 2020, for example, would mean large multinational companies (MNCs) would not disproportionately benefit from the corporate income tax rebate of 25% that was given.",34,689,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00689
2021-10-05-T-010,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"In 2018, Hong Kong implemented the two-tiered profits tax regime to relieve the tax burden for SMEs, in particular. In Singapore, we do have the tax exemption scheme for new startup companies and partial tax exemption for all companies which have a similar effect. Yet, it was in the same year in Budget 2018 that the Government announced tighter restrictions around these schemes. For an SME making $300,000 in chargeable income, for example, total corporate income tax paid before any rebates will be close to $34,000 or an effective rate of about 11%, compared to around $25,000 or an effective rate of about 8% based on prior rules.",35,690,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00690
2021-10-05-T-010,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Even as other support for companies to build capabilities is being strengthened, I hope the Government will consider providing greater tax relief to our SMEs, such as by raising tax exemption limits which are geared towards SMEs, given the challenging domestic trading conditions brought about by COVID-19.",36,691,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00691
2021-10-05-T-010,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I recognise that Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong has said that effective tax rates for SMEs are much lower than the effective tax rates for non-SMEs in Singapore. But what is also true is that SMEs paid $4.8 billion in corporate income tax out of profit before tax of $44 billion for YA2019 versus non-SMEs, which paid $11.5 billion in corporate tax out of profit before tax of $459 billion.",37,692,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00692

2021-10-05-T-010,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Now, I do appreciate that MOF has its way of calculating effective tax rates, which the Finance Minister has clarified is based on a definition of chargeable income that is a bit different from that per section 38 of the Income Tax Act.",39,694,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00694
2021-10-05-T-010,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"So, using the data provided to my Parliamentary Question yesterday, for example, based on the subset of profit-making firms in YA2019, SMEs accounted for 20% of accounting profit before tax, 22% of chargeable income but 30% of corporate income tax paid.",40,695,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00695
2021-10-05-T-010,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"So, similarly, the conclusion can still be made that SMEs collectively paid more tax per dollar of either pre-tax profits or changeable income, as compared to non-SMEs.",41,696,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00696
2021-10-05-T-010,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Ultimately, what companies report in their financial statements to shareholders are accounting profits, which are audited in Singapore based on the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards, which are, of course, modelled after the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).",42,697,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00697

2021-10-05-T-010,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I recognise that a lot of details on BEPS implementation are still being ironed out. But given the current average effective corporate tax rate is close to 3% as shared by the Minister, technically it would seem that even a small shift towards the proposed global minimum rate of 15% could result in much higher corporate tax receipts for the Government.

2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,I should clarify that the Bill gives effect to the implementation of measures that have been announced in the Budget and in the various COVID-19 support packages. These are not new measures. They really detail the implementation of measures that have been announced.,4,727,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00727

2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I think Mr Yip had questioned if these exemptions were too generous. But to clarify, these are not new measures, they were announced earlier either in the Budget or in earlier statements and we are implementing them, and you would see that in the implementation of these measures, we have been quite careful in scoping them.",6,729,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00729
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For example, the Renovation and Refurbishment (R&R) measure mentioned by Mr Yip, allows taxpayers the option to claim tax deductions on qualifying expenditure over one year, instead of the three years which is already allowed under the Income Tax Act today. But we are just allowing now one year instead of three years. There is also no change to the overall cap of $300,000, which applies for every relevant period of three consecutive Years of Assessment. So, basically, we are allowing the option to claim tax deductions on an accelerated schedule which provides cash flow support to businesses during this period, but we have not changed the overall caps.",7,730,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00730
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Yip also asked about tax deductions on provisions of doubtful debts and the diminution of value of investments under section 14I of the Income Tax Act. This is only available for banks and qualifying finance companies, and is subjected to caps to safeguard against excessive provisions. This existing tax deduction aims to promote the overall soundness and stability of our financial system by catering for the building up of adequate provisions to cushion against potential losses in the financial institutions’ loan and investment portfolios. The change, which is to be incorporated into this Bill, expands the scope to include specified loans and securities in line with financial reporting standards. Again, there is no change of the prevailing caps in the Bill.",8,731,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00731
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Yip was also concerned about tax exemption for packaging costs. I wish to clarify that packaging costs, like any business expense incurred in the production of income, can only enjoy 100% tax deduction. There is no further tax break.",9,732,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00732
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"There were also some questions on the Double Tax Deduction for Internationalisation, or DTDi scheme. That covers, amongst others, specified expenses incurred in the design of packaging for overseas markets. These expenses are design costs, not packaging costs. Such design costs include, for example, costs of third-party consultancy fees to design packaging for overseas markets. As part of the Budget 2021 measure, we have announced that design costs would be added to the existing list of automatic qualifying expenses under the DTDi scheme. Again, the overall cap remains unchanged at $150,000 per year for the list of qualifying expenses which taxpayers can claim in their tax return without the prior approval of Enterprise Singapore under the DTDi scheme.",10,733,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00733
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Don Wee had asked about qualifying expenses in relation to virtual trade fair that qualify for this scheme. Expenses incurred by firms on overseas advertisement and promotional campaigns on social media, including the engagement of influencers, are covered under the DTDi scheme. In this Bill, we will enhance the scope of the DTDi scheme to cover specified expenses incurred to participate in approved virtual trade fairs. These specified expenses include third-party costs for the design and production of digital collaterals and promotion materials for the approved virtual trade fair, and logistics costs incurred to send samples overseas to potential clients met at the approved virtual trade fair, subject to conditions. So, as you can see, we are talking about expanding the scope of qualifying expenses but we have continued to keep a cap on the overall amount at $150,000.",11,734,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00734

The answer is yes. Green bonds which meet the qualifying criteria for the DTD scheme can qualify under the scheme.",12,735,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00735
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, these are to address all the comments about Budget measures, COVID-19 measures which had been announced, but we are talking about the implementation and we want to assure Members that in working out the implementation details as reflected in the amendments in this Bill, we have been careful to make sure that the schemes are carefully and properly designed.",13,736,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00736
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Don Wee then also asked about the further extensions of some of the schemes, beyond what had been announced. For example, he asked if the option to accelerate the write-off of the cost of acquiring plant and machinery can be further extended for another year, in view of the current situation. I should say that each time we ask for additional requests for help for businesses or individuals, we should look at schemes in totality. It is not just one particular scheme but we have other schemes in place overall to encourage businesses to invest in new and emerging technologies to sharpen their competitiveness.",14,737,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00737

We continue to monitor the situation closely and review all our schemes, as needed. Should there be a need to extend any measure, any such extension will then be announced at Budget 2022 and then it will be effected in next year’s Income Tax (Amendment) Bill. So, it is an ongoing process.",15,738,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00738

2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"First, Mr Louis Chua asked about the new section 10P. This is a scenario where trading stock is appropriated for capital purposes.

2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Chua asked about the disposal of property, plant and equipment. That is capital in nature. So, it is not considered as business trading stock in the first instance. So, there would be no appropriation of trading stock and section 10P does not apply under such a scenario.",18,741,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00741
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Louis Ng asked about the new section 14ZH in the concerns that it may inadvertently reward a landlord who evicts a failed tenant and keeps the property vacant. This section is in line, again, with the existing tax treatment that IRAS applies up to now. The legislative clarification provides tax certainty for the taxpayers, namely landlords who are taxable on their rental income. So, under this section, as long as the landlord demonstrates with supporting evidence that he has made reasonable efforts to secure a tenant during the vacancy period, IRAS will allow tax deduction for qualifying expenses such as property tax, repair, insurance and maintenance of the property incurred during the vacancy period.",19,742,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00742
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, what does the landlord have to demonstrate in order to show reasonable effort? For example, IRAS would request a taxpayer to provide supporting evidence such as documents showing that the repair was made to the property to keep it in lettable condition; or that a property agent was appointed to find a tenant; or that the property had been advertised for rent. And if IRAS is satisfied that reasonable efforts have been made to seek a tenant during the vacancy period, then this section will apply. But if IRAS is not satisfied that reasonable efforts have been made to secure a tenant, then the tax deductions will not be allowed.",20,743,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00743
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Next, let me address the points raised by Mr Ng with regard to donor-advised funds (DAFs). Mr Ng asked for data on the amount of income tax deductions linked with donations to DAFs. We do not track this data specifically because tax-deductible donations are currently tracked based on IPC and approved grant-maker status, and this is in line with requirements for the receipt of tax-deductible donations under the Charities Act and the Income Tax Act respectively.",21,744,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00744
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I understand Mr Ng's concerns over ensuring the timely disbursement of funds by DAFs to IPCs. So, for DAFs which are themselves IPCs, they have flexibility to disburse the funds for the charitable programmes, no different from other IPCs. But I think Mr Ng is more concerned about DAFs which are approved grant-makers. For such DAFs, they are required to disburse the tax-deductible donations to IPCs within five years from receiving the donations.",22,745,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00745
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The only exception is when an endowment fund is being set up by the approved grant-maker, in which case the approved grant-maker can disburse the tax-deductible donations to IPCs over a longer period, obviously because they are setting up an endowment fund.",23,746,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00746
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"To ensure accountability, all grant-makers are required to submit annual reports to IRAS on the tax-deductible donations received and disbursed. Thus far, all grant-makers have disbursed the donations received to IPCs according to the disbursement requirements within the specified number of years. So, Mr Ng can be assured that we do not have this scenario where donations are being made to grant-makers, but they hold back on disbursing grants to the charities.",24,747,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00747
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Ng also asked about the information requested by IRAS when an individual attempts to claim tax deductions on their donations to a DAF. Again, IRAS does not separately request for information on tax-deductible donations to a DAF. If the DAF is an IPC or an approved grant-maker, the same reporting requirements applicable to IPCs and approved grant-makers would then apply respectively.",25,748,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00748
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the issue of tax deductions for donations, Mr Wee had proposed for the Government to tier the tax deduction rates based on the donation quantum. I understand the intent of such a suggestion but such a tiered system would then primarily benefit the higher-income as well as larger IPCs who have the resources to engage higher-income donors. Mr Wee's suggestion to provide 300% or 400% tax deductions will also result in more tax revenue forgone.",26,749,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00749
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"And Mr Louis Chua, likewise, had suggested to make permanent this tax deduction. Again, I appreciate the intent of Mr Louis Chua and Mr Don Wee to promote philanthropy and charitable giving. But we have to consider the merits and trade-offs carefully, bearing in mind that we currently have one of the highest tax deduction rates for donations in the world and we want to make sure that any scheme we have in place is fiscally sustainable.",27,750,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00750
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In addition, besides tax deduction, the Government also adopts a multi-faceted approach to encourage charitable giving within the community. So, let us not just look at tax alone. Let us look at what we do with regard to non-tax measures as well. And we will continue to review both the tax and non-tax measures to do more for charitable giving.",28,751,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00751
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Next, several Members asked about data confidentiality issues regarding audits on the administration of public schemes. In my speech, I mentioned that safeguards are provided for in the Bill to minimise the risk of unauthorised disclosures and the misuse of tax data. The audits provide independent checks to ensure IRAS disburses payouts correctly to their intended beneficiaries and the data provided to auditors will be limited to what is necessary for quality assurance of that specific scheme.",29,752,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00752
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For example, annual revenue data would be provided to auditors to determine the eligibility of SMEs for the Rental Support Scheme. As revenue size is not part of the scheme design for the Jobs Growth Incentive, such data will not be shared with auditors for the Jobs Growth Incentive. So, the Comptroller of Income Tax will have the discretion to decide on the extent of information that needs to be made available, subject to the safeguards that I have explained.",30,753,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00753
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"More importantly, as I mentioned earlier in my speech, the data made available will not be identifiable. Various methods like tokenisation would be used to prevent the disclosure of individual data.",31,754,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00754
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Authorised persons who are granted access to protected data will be prevented from retaining or making copies of the data provided in the first place. In other words, they can only access data on IRAS-issued devices and only within IRAS' premises. So, there is no issue of external auditors storing data for excessive amounts of time.",32,755,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00755
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Authorised persons who are granted access to protected data would be required to make and subscribe to a declaration of secrecy. It would be an offence under the ITA and the Official Secrets Act for authorised persons to disclose any protected information to other parties.,33,756,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00756
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Appointed audit firms will also be required to adhere to contractual terms on data confidentiality and ensure that the use of confidential information is only for authorised purposes. In the event of a breach, the appointed firm will be liable to legal actions under the terms of the appointment contract and penalties under our Acts governing the data.",34,757,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00757
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Let me assure Members that the Government takes this issue very seriously, and safeguards would be put in place to protect the confidentiality of taxpayers' information and to minimise the risk of unauthorised disclosures and the misuse of tax data.",35,758,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00758
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Next, Mr Yip asked about the methods of audits on the disbursement of schemes like the JSS. IRAS, as the administrator of the JSS, had instituted a robust anti-gaming framework, making use of data from multiple sources to identify and detect abuse. While we are unable to share the specifics of IRAS' anti-gaming operations for good reasons – if you tell people what we are doing, I think it will encourage more gaming behaviour – this framework has been in place since the first JSS payout in April 2020. For cases suspected of higher fraud risks, IRAS requires the firms to authenticate their CPF contributions before the payouts are released. Cases with strong corroborative evidence to suggest abuse are reported to the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) for further investigation and prosecution.",36,759,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00759
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I also thank Mr Yip for his support for the introduction of the Protection of Informers, or POI, provision in the Income Tax and other tax Acts. Mr Yip asked about whistle-blower protection in other statutes.",37,760,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00760
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In fact, the proposed POI provision in this Bill is modelled after similar provisions in the Customs Act and the Cybersecurity Act 2018. The legislative amendment to better protect informers will also apply to other tax Acts, beside the ITA.",38,761,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00761
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Mr Wee asked how we will prevent people with malicious intent from falsifying claims against their rivals or competitors.,39,762,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00762
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Let me assure Members that IRAS does not act on baseless or frivolous allegations. IRAS will carefully examine not only the information provided by an informer, but also other information available to IRAS, and assess the validity of any allegations. IRAS will only commence an investigation when it assesses that a prima facie case exists for tax evasion and if the information provided by the informer proves to be reliable and accurate.",40,763,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00763
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Apart from IRAS' internal process, the POI provision includes a legislated safeguard, similar to the POI provisions in other domestic legislation, which will mitigate against the risk of informers making false claims. In particular, the safeguard provides that the Court may require the production of the original complaint and full disclosure of the informer's identity only if the Court is satisfied that the informer wilfully made in his complaint a material statement which he knew or believed to be false or did not believe to be true; or justice cannot be fully done between the parties without the disclosure of the informer's identity. So, these safeguards are in place.",41,764,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00764
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Let me now turn to some of the broader comments raised by Members.,42,765,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00765
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Louis Chua mentioned wealth taxes and more reliefs and help for SMEs. I would say, in terms of direction, what Mr Louis Chua has suggested is completely aligned with MOF's thinking. We want to address wealth inequalities and we want to do more to support our SMEs. So, in terms of policy intent, we are completely aligned.",43,766,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00766
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But to address wealth inequalities, what exactly do we do? What sort of measures do we put in place? That is something that we will have to study carefully. In fact, we already have a form of wealth tax by way of the tax levied on private residential properties today which is tiered according to annual value (AV). So, we already have that structure in place in our property tax system.",44,767,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00767
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I am unable to reveal what we are thinking about now. I think that will be premature and I do not want to pre-empt the Budget next year. But, obviously, we are continuing to consider all options to address, as I have said, number one, income and wealth inequalities; and number two, what more we can do to support SMEs.",45,768,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00768
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Where SMEs are concerned, I think the data is very clear. I think it is useful to bear in mind when you look at the data, it is not a homogenous group; it is very diverse. And, therefore, if you look at averages or you look at effective tax rates, one can get a misleading picture. Because, in fact, the vast majority of SMEs, vast majority of them, pay very little tax. That is the reality.",46,769,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00769
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We also need to be careful when we look at reliefs and exemptions for SMEs that we do not want to have inadvertent consequence. This discourages them from growing because if they stay small, they pay less tax, I think that will be unhelpful for our SMEs to scale up and grow and develop to become global champions in their own right.",47,770,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00770
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, we need to find the right incentives to support them but, at the same time, encourage them to scale up and grow. So, that is something that MOF, together with our economic agencies, continue to study carefully. And we will look not only at tax measures but also at non-tax measures, in other words, the kinds of support schemes we can provide to them through grants, loans and equity.",48,771,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00771
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Next, Mr Yip also highlighted the caution that we need to ensure that we spend in a fiscally sustainable manner. And he is absolutely right because beyond our short-term fiscal response to COVID-19, we are mindful of our long-term fiscal responsibility to maintain a balanced and sustainable Budget position. Our prolonged fight against COVID-19 has been facilitated greatly by our ability to tap on Past Reserves for extraordinary measures to protect lives and to safeguard livelihoods.",49,772,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00772
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But beyond these emergency conditions, when it comes to recurrent expenditure, ongoing expenditure, I think it is very important that we maintain the principle to fund them through recurrent revenues. As our recurrent expenditures continue to go up for a whole range of reasons, including rapidly ageing population, the need for more healthcare, to make growing demands for social spending, then we have to ensure that we look at raising our recurrent revenues to meet these recurrent expenditures. So, there is no avoiding this.",50,773,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00773
2021-10-05-T-010,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Of course, it is never easy to implement a tax increase, let alone a GST increase. The Government has announced that the GST rate increase will take place sometime during 2022 to 2025. This remains unchanged and we will continue to consider all factors, including our fiscal needs as well as the prevailing economic conditions in deciding on the timing of the GST rate increase.",51,774,2021-10-05-T-010-S-00774

However, under section 17(C)(3) of this Bill, it is stated that the accused has to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the accused’s conduct was reasonable in order not to be convicted in Court. In other words, as long as security officers feel that they have been verbally abused by the other party and the other party is charged in Court, the chances of the other party being found guilty are much higher than in ordinary cases. It appears that the security officers are even better protected in this aspect than civil servants. I would like to ask the Minister, why is this so?",9,825,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00825

However, some black sheep may abuse their power and make life difficult for others for no good reason. At present, when people encounter an unreasonable security officer, they usually complain to the security company or the entity that hires their service.

If convicted of such an offence, an officer could be fined up to $2,000 or jailed for up to three months, or both.

Thus, for instance, the offence of voluntarily causing hurt to a security officer in the course of his duty will attract imprisonment of up to five years, between the maximum jail terms in the Penal Code for similar conduct against a public servant which attracts seven years and that against ordinary citizens which attracts three years.

To this end, I note that the situation has improved somewhat. In answer to my Parliamentary Question in July this year, MOM reiterated that the overtime hours for security officers have come down, even if the proportion of full-time security officers who still did overtime each month for last year was still nearly eight out of 10 officers, or 80%.",12,863,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00863

On average, it handles 200 cases yearly. In a recent case, an officer was tasked with managing entry into a club's facilities room. A visitor, apparently upset with the verification process, vented his frustration and dragged the officer from the chair. The matter was reported to the union and investigations are ongoing. But there should not be such disrespect in the first place. We can only hope that this case is the exception rather than the norm. We are taking no chances. We will launch a mobile application by the end of this year for officers to report cases quickly.",7,873,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00873
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),We must reinforce this protection of our officers. We need enhanced penalties against abusers of security officers. There must be zero-tolerance for abuse. It is even more urgent now during COVID-19. Abusers must not breach our defence of SMMs. I would like to raise two points for the Ministry's consideration.,8,874,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00874
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"First, the proposed section 17C makes it illegal for an individual to threaten and abuse a security officer. However, it seems that we can only prove liability if the offence is committed while the security officer is doing his duty. What if an abuser abuses and threatens an officer while the latter is off duty because of an earlier incident? Can the abuser be similarly punished?",9,875,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00875
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Second, the elements of section 17C is substantively in pari materia to section 3(1)(a) and (b) of the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA). However, section 3(1)(c) of the POHA, which relates to the offence of doxxing, is not found within the proposed section 17C. This appears to be a gap. Abusers can use social media to publish personal information to harass these officers and their families. Could the Ministry consider including the offence of doxxing in section 3(1)(c) of POHA within the proposed section 17C?",10,876,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00876
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Next, will the Ministry consider the inclusion of section 5 of POHA within the amendments as well? This section concerns causing fear, provocation or the facilitation of violence. Like section 3 of POHA, section 5 also relates to abusive behaviour which security officers may face during their course of duty.",11,877,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00877
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Next, I would like to speak on the proposed shift to accredit security consultants by the industry.

They are subject to the yearly renewal of their accreditation.",12,878,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00878
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"This pivot ensures that Security Consultants are attuned to the new security trends and needs. These consultants can help guide service buyers on outcome-based security contracts as qualified persons by leveraging technology rather than manpower. This can improve security outcomes significantly. We can be more productive. This makes wage increases in the security PWM sustainable. Better jobs and better pay for the longer run.

2021-10-05-T-011,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"In September 2019, as mentioned in Minister of State Desmond's speech, a man was jailed for punching a security officer at Roxy Square. In January 2021, another man was jailed for punching a security officer after breaking through a safe distancing barricade and causing a ruckus at Jurong Point. And in a video that went viral on social media, a member of the public was recorded to be berating an elderly security officer and using insulting language on him when the security officer informed him that he needed to pay a fee for his friend to park his vehicle in a condominium after 11 pm. These are all examples of utterly reprehensible behaviour towards our security officers.",5,890,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00890
2021-10-05-T-011,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Madam, in each of these incidents, the security officers were just doing their job and certainly should not have been subjected to any form of abuse.

Part of the increase in incidence of abuse could be attributed to possible tensions that arise from the implementation of COVID-19 related measures, such as safe entry and safe management measures.",9,894,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00894

Would this lead to a differentiated level of protection based on employers and employment arrangements? If so, would the Government consider aligning the penalties to ensure parity for all security officers, regardless of the institution and organisation they are working for, and whether they are outsourced or direct-hire staff?",17,902,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00902

2021-10-05-T-011,Abdul Samad,Mr Abdul Samad (Nominated Member),"We acknowledge there are some lower-earning security officers who may find it challenging to pay the membership fees.

2021-10-05-T-011,Abdul Samad,Mr Abdul Samad (Nominated Member),"Madam, every security officer is a human being tasked to enforce rules, some of which are not well thought through.

In addition to their usual work, many now have to do the thankless task of enforcing COVID-19 safe management measures. The Union of Security Employees says that this has increased tensions for security officers.",1,941,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00941
2021-10-05-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Indeed, a survey of 1,002 security officers between September and November 2020 found that two out of five security officers had experienced some form of abuse in the course of their work.",2,942,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00942
2021-10-05-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I thank our security officers for their service. This Bill is a welcome step for increased protection for them.,3,943,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00943
2021-10-05-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I have two points of clarification.,4,944,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00944
2021-10-05-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"First, I would like to ask what counts as a security officer's duty. This Bill is meant to protect security officers from abuse. To this end, it strongly punishes individuals for assaulting, hurting or harassing security officers. However, this enhanced punishment kicks in only if it happens during the execution or discharge of duty by the officer.",5,945,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00945
2021-10-05-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Can the Minister share what counts as the execution and discharge of an officer's duty? Do these new offences apply only to functions outlined in section 13 of the Private Security Industry Act or do they apply to any functions reasonably connected to a security officer's work?,6,946,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00946
2021-10-05-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),We need to be clear about this as security officers may be required to perform diverse tasks not outlined in section 13 of the Act. Such tasks may equally put the security officers at risk of abuse and harassment. We should look to protect security officers performing such tasks too.,7,947,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00947
2021-10-05-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My second clarification relates to the defences against the offence of intentionally causing harassment, alarm or distress to a security officer under section 17C.",8,948,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00948
2021-10-05-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Notably, the wording of section 17C tracks the wording used in section 3 of the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA). Section 3 of POHA deals with the offence of intentionally causing harassment, alarm or distress.",9,949,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00949
2021-10-05-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"One of the defences to section 17C is that the accused did not know or had no reason to believe that the words, behaviour or communications would be perceived by the target person. However, this is not a defence to the similar offence of intentionally causing harassment in section 3 of POHA.",10,950,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00950
2021-10-05-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Instead, this defence appears only in section 4 of POHA. Section 4 of POHA deals with the offence of behaviour, which is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress. Importantly, section 4 is different from section 3 of POHA in that it does not require intention to cause harassment.",11,951,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00951
2021-10-05-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"It seems inconsistent that a defence to a harassment offence in POHA that does not require the element of intention now applies to a harassment offence in the Private Security Industry Act, which requires intention.",12,952,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00952
2021-10-05-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In addition to inconsistency across legislation, this seems difficult to understand in principle. Surely, someone who acted with the intention to harass another person should not be allowed to say that they had no reason to believe that harassing conduct would not be perceived by the victim.",13,953,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00953
2021-10-05-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Can the Minister clarify why this defence applies to intentional harassment under section 17C when it does not apply to intentional harassment under POHA? Does this suggest that intentional harassment under the Private Security Industry Act has a different scope from intentional harassment under POHA?,14,954,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00954
2021-10-05-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Madam, notwithstanding these clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill.",15,955,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00955

2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, a number of my Yio Chu Kang residents are security officers. Security officers play an unsung but important role in our society. We sleep soundly at night, knowing that with their vigilance, we are safe and that our property is protected.",1,957,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00957
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Yet, security officers are not safe from abuse. Many Members have spoken about this today. Nearly a third of security officers have experienced abuse on the job, a 30% surge over the past two years.",2,958,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00958
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"We cannot claim to be a gracious and kind society if our workers are going into work expecting that it is unfortunate but normal to be insulted, threatened or even assaulted on the job. We need to improve protection and welfare of our security officers.",3,959,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00959
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),I would like to highlight four issues.,4,960,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00960
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"First, Mdm Deputy Speaker, we must be able to deter harassment by ensuring effective means to capture concrete evidence. The Bill introduces definitions to the offences that constitute the types of harassment and abuse faced by security officers. This is a good initiative. However, without a witness or closed-circuit camera in the vicinity, harassment and verbal abuse can be difficult to prove.",5,961,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00961
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),The high-profile case of a condominium resident verbally abusing a security guard last year came to light only because it was caught on video and then circulated. Many other security officers would suffer in silence.,6,962,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00962
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Similar to the point made earlier by Member Joan Pereira, I urge the Government to consider recommending or requiring security guards to wear a body camera. Notwithstanding, we must account for the need to balance the provision of adequate protection with the challenges of ensuring data privacy, as well as managing rising costs in the industry.",7,963,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00963
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"To address these concerns, one suggestion is for body cameras to be considered if the security guard works in a location where he is susceptible to higher risks of abuse, patrolling alone or out of range of nearby closed-circuit television (CCTVs).",8,964,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00964
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),The body camera proposal is not just beneficial for the wearer. Section 17 of POHA states that the burden remains on the prosecution to prove the offence is beyond a reasonable doubt and disprove a defence raised based on a balance of probabilities.,9,965,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00965
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"However, whether the accused's choice of words and tone can be interpreted as abuse is subjective. Moreover, prior provocation may have occurred to lead to their choice of words and tone.",10,966,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00966
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),There has been feedback that some security officers are rude. There are usually two sides to every story. The truth usually lies somewhere in the middle.,11,967,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00967
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),The body camera can help to even the odds. It can shed some objective light into where truth may lie.,12,968,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00968
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"If harassment of security officers falls under this Act, the burden of proof falls on the accused to justify their word choice and behaviour. Likewise, without witnesses and audio-visual proof, it will be difficult to prove their innocence.",13,969,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00969
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Yet, in the eyes of the law, an accused is innocent until proven otherwise or beyond reasonable doubt. The onus should be on the plaintiff, in this case, the security guard, to provide the evidence of harassment or abuse. In this case, the evidence would come from the officer's body camera. It is indisputable evidence that is up for evaluation by the Court, rather than personal interpretation.",14,970,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00970
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Second, Mdm Deputy Speaker, security officers must be equipped with the necessary skills to protect themselves and to react appropriately when faced with aggression.",15,971,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00971
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Self-defence training should be recommended and made accessible for those who are in the security industry or planning to join it. These courses should be tailored to different age groups. This is because the age demographic in the industry is varied, with youngsters in their 20s to elderly in their 60s.",16,972,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00972
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),Those in a front-facing role should also receive training on communication skills. These skills should focus on managing disputes with residents and de-escalating conflicts.,17,973,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00973
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"In this regard, would such training and skillsets be made mandatory in subsidiary legislations or guidelines? How does the Government plan to work with the industry to further professionalise the sector and provide pathways for progression? Expectations will be increased. However, these skillsets are transferable and will serve security officers well if they wish to explore other roles or to take on greater responsibilities in the sector.",18,974,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00974
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Third, Mdm Deputy Speaker, security officers are often ordered to do things that are beyond their job scope and they rarely receive remuneration for it. A resident of mine who is a security officer in a condominium told me that he has been asked to drop off the mail or food delivery, water the plants or even clean up messes when the cleaner is not available.",19,975,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00975
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Whilst some security officers do so out of goodwill, it should not be a given. Not only is this unfair, it is also dangerous. They are called away from their focus of security work. In the meantime, there is no one around to cover for them.",20,976,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00976
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Although they can lodge a complaint to MOM, I have been informed that some employers tend to side with the residents. Lodging a complaint may also threaten the officer's job security, so most would rather accept the extra work.",21,977,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00977
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Beyond the abovementioned issues, many security officers have to work up to 12 hours a day for six days a week to alleviate a persistent manpower crunch. The long hours and lack of rest time make the job unappealing, which only perpetuates the problem.",22,978,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00978
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),I hope the Bill will introduce regulations to make it explicitly illegal for security officers to be tasked with extra work beyond the agreed job scope.,23,979,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00979
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),But it takes more than laws to eradicate the undesirable mentality that such workers are at the beck and call of the privileged who engage their services. We must continue to address this problem through multiple angles. This includes drawing awareness to the problem through education and by enforcing stiff penalties against those who abuse their positions of power towards the vulnerable.,24,980,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00980
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, my last point is on granting reformed ex-offenders the chance to qualify for security jobs.",25,981,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00981
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"A few residents shared with me about their distresses with job hunting at my Meet-the-People Sessions. They were keen to be security officers, given the high demand for such jobs. They were willing to attend the necessary courses to obtain the relevant skills. However, because they have a criminal record, they have had difficulties obtaining a security officer licence.",26,982,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00982
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Can the Ministry clarify whether a criminal record automatically disqualifies one from working in the security industry? This information is not immediately clear from the Security Officer Licence application website. However, past media reports suggest that this is indeed the case.",27,983,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00983
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"While security is an industry that requires a high amount of integrity and trust, writing someone off for having a criminal record seems to run contrary to our advocacy for giving second chances and for the Yellow Ribbon initiative.",28,984,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00984
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"I recognise that the public and buyers of service may be uncomfortable with ex-offenders as private security guards, due to the perception that ex-offenders may recidivate. Be that as it may, if the industry further evolves and develops sub-specialties in roles, surely we can find positions for ex-offenders in the industry. These include appropriate roles that give them an opportunity to perform and show that they have reintegrated into society, without the perceived risk of putting a known thief to guard one's belongings. From there, they can further professionalise and assume greater responsibilities, having demonstrated that they have turned over a new leaf, perhaps through licensing and so on.",29,985,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00985
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"In conclusion, Mdm Deputy Speaker, when we occasionally encounter a problem at work or in public places, one of our first instincts, besides calling the Police, is to approach the security officer for help. When a child goes missing in a mall, the parents would ask the security officer for help to look for the child. When one encounters a stalker, they head immediately to the nearest security officer for protection.",30,986,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00986
2021-10-05-T-011,Yip Hon Weng,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"It is ironic that despite our reliance on security officers for safety, they command little respect and recognition for their work. This must change. Our security officers must have more protection, more training and we must prevent haphazard designation of work that is unrelated to their job.

2021-10-05-T-011,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman (Marine Parade),"Abuse towards security officers may be more commonplace than we think.

2021-10-05-T-011,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman (Marine Parade),"The amendments to enhance the protection for security officers are thus timely. While there have always been existing laws to protect all from harassment and abuse, no special provision has been given before this specifically for security officers. That being said, I would like to ask MHA what will be done to ensure that security officers and members of the public will be made aware of these amendments so that our security officers will know their rights and be able to better assert themselves while carrying out their duties.",6,994,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00994
2021-10-05-T-011,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman (Marine Parade),"(In English)  The second amendment, the shift towards the industry-led accreditation of security consultants is an important step for the private security industry. With this amendment, the certification of security consultants would now reside within the industry, which potentially signals an increased availability of qualified security consultants who can help buyers buy security correctly  conduct a proper security assessment, install the right technology and deploying ably trained manpower to leverage the technology. This Assessment, Technology and Manpower or ATM approach can improve security outcomes significantly and lower overall security costs through increased productivity.",7,995,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00995
2021-10-05-T-011,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman (Marine Parade),"The ATM approach also complements outcome-based contracting, where clients specify outcomes rather than go by the traditional procurement method of specifying headcounts. Outcome-based contracts also advocate for the use of technology and job redesign which can help to make the work of security officers more efficient and effective. With the use of technology such as the remote gate guarding, facial recognition, visitor management system and remote video surveillance, the service buyer has been able to achieve the same or better outcomes.",8,996,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00996
2021-10-05-T-011,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman (Marine Parade),"The transition to outcome-based contracting can be daunting for many service buyers. Many are unsure how to craft an outcome-based tender specifications that may be intimidated by the upfront cost of purchasing technology. Furthermore, it can also prove challenging to convince all stakeholders that the transition to outcome-based contracting will be a fruitful one. For example, many residents in condominiums may still feel that having security officers on-site 24/7 is important.",9,997,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00997
2021-10-05-T-011,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman (Marine Parade),"However, after undertaking the transition, the benefits often outweigh the initial adjustment period. One such example of a security agency that was able to help their clients better procure security services via outcome-based sourcing is Focus Security. With the use of technology such as a vehicle management system at the entrance to the residential site, they were able to cut down the manpower needed by two while continuing to deliver similar outcomes.",10,998,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00998
2021-10-05-T-011,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman (Marine Parade),"In addition to increased productivity, a better-designed deployment plan coupled with technology adoption will help minimise the risk of abuse of security officers who will no longer need to manually enforce rules in a public-facing setting. For example, illegal parking can be better managed through gantries, signages and CCTV with Video Analytics rather than a patrolling security officer who is tasked with requesting that errant drivers move their cars.",11,999,2021-10-05-T-011-S-00999
2021-10-05-T-011,Mohd Fahmi Aliman,Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman (Marine Parade),"Thus, I would like to ask MHA if there are any plans to encourage the adoption of outcome-based contracting and technology to help make our security officers' work safer and more effective.",12,1000,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01000

Section 17D provides for circumstances where enhanced penalties may apply. What is significant is that the penalties prescribed in each section are higher than that stipulated for similar offences under the POHA. This is an important recognition that it is particularly egregious to harass, or to assault or to hurt a security officer while he is carrying out his functions, because the role that he plays is essential and critical to the orderly functioning of society.",4,1027,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01027
2021-10-05-T-011,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"To a certain extent, these provisions are a corollary to the amendments made to the Private Security Industry (Conduct) Regulations in 2019. Those amendments introduced penalties, including fines and jail terms, for security officers caught being remiss in the conduct of their duties. The rationale for those amendments was to hold security officers up to a high level of conduct, if they were remiss while on duty, precisely because of their critical functions. It is, therefore, fair and fitting that even as we underscore with those amendments the importance of security officers’ duties, that we also move the current amendments to afford greater protections for them.",5,1028,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01028
2021-10-05-T-011,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"The urgency for these new provisions is apparent. The Union of Security Employees (USE) and the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) conducted two surveys that had been referred to by several speakers today. Madam, the findings are nothing short of appalling. Last year’s findings showed that a third of security officers faced abuse and this year’s findings found that the frequency had increased to 40%, with the increase being attributed to the greater role that security officers were required to undertake due to the pandemic measures. Older officers were found to face abuse on a more frequent basis.",6,1029,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01029

Teo punched SO Chew in the chest and SO Chew fell backwards and suffered injury to his cervical spine. Sadly, SO Chew died from his injuries six weeks later. Of course, causing grievous hurt as in this case is not part of the amendments to the PSIA, and will still fall under the Penal Code, but my point is that security officers, as frontline workers and as enforcers of rules, are often subject to physical abuse, which has caused injury and has even been fatal on occasion.",8,1031,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01031

Today’s amendments will change this. So, I would like to say to all our security officers  your uniform, your PLRD ID are now symbols of the protection that you now have. In the course of your duties, if you are verbally abused, if you are harassed, assaulted or hurt, you are now protected by law.

Another important initiative was launched by Senior Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad in July this year  the Security Industry Workplace Safety and Health Guidelines, which was drafted by a committee co-chaired by SAS and USE.

However, security officers are engaged not to work at their employer’s offices, but to work at a third party’s premises to provide specific services. The services that are to be provided and their incumbent terms and conditions are, therefore, the subject of a separate service contract between the security agency and the security buyer. Often, where a service buyer engages a managing agent to manage its site, these service contracts are proposed by the managing agent based on their existing templates.",14,1037,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01037
2021-10-05-T-011,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"The problem arises because many of these service contracts contain clauses that directly affect security officers’ employment and employability. SAS recently called out some of these discriminatory and unfair clauses in a tender document that was put out by managing agent Savills Property Management on behalf of its client, Hillview Heights condominium. We identified three specific clauses of concern  an immediate removal clause allowing the managing agent to essentially, summarily dismiss security officers, a clause that appeared to discriminate on race and a clause that appeared to discriminate on age.",15,1038,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01038

I do not exaggerate when I say that most, if not all, outsourced services contracts contain some form of discriminatory clauses or immediate removal clauses. These are accompanied with unfettered discretion given to managing agents or security buyers to decide to reject officers deployed to a site or to demand that they be removed immediately.",16,1039,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01039
2021-10-05-T-011,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"Madam, many officers apply for security officer jobs based on particular sites or locales. This is because, given that they work 12-hour shifts, they prefer to have a work site near their home so that they can reduce their commuting time to as low as possible. So, imagine, Madam, when that officer arrives at site, and is told that he has been rejected and no reason needs to be given to him. Or he is told that he has been rejected after working at a site for some time, again with no reason needing to be provided to him. An employer, Madam, would not be able to do that. There are processes that need to be abided by for such summary dismissal. But the managing agents and buyers have been able to do this with impunity.",17,1040,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01040

Hopefully, this can serve as an example, a model and, perhaps, an inspiration for other industries to self-regulate in appropriate areas.",35,1058,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01058
2021-10-05-T-011,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"What then is the role that security consultants play in the transformation of the security industry? It is important to note that the development of a core of security consultants is one pillar out of four pillars in the Security Industry Transformation Map. As Members know, and as mentioned by Member Mohd Fahmi Aliman, one of the biggest drives in the PWM sectors is to move away from headcount-based contracts to outcome-based contracts.",36,1059,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01059
2021-10-05-T-011,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"In headcount-based contracts, buyers stipulate the number of security officers they require. In outcome-based contracts, buyers stipulate only the expected outcomes and leave it to vendors to propose solutions that optimise manpower and technology resources. In order for a vendor to propose such holistic solutions, it would first need to conduct a security risk assessment – and the person who carries this out is the security consultant.",37,1060,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01060
2021-10-05-T-011,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"There are, of course, many benefits to outcome-based contracts  more efficient and effective security solutions, job redesign for security officers as well as the possibility to move towards more reasonable working hours, a fairer contracting regime. This is why outcome-based contracts are in and of themselves another pillar of the Industry Transformation Map. But in order to make that move towards outcome-based contracts, we need to have a core of security consultants to carry out the first steps.",38,1061,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01061
2021-10-05-T-011,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"Madam, next year, SAS will launch an online-based tender generator and repository called OBX, which will provide an easy-to-use platform that will help security buyers make that jump to outcome-based contracting. We are glad to have gotten strong support from SPF and Enterprise Singapore for this initiative. But we will also need to ensure that as this platform provides that big push towards OBCs, that there is a sufficient number of consultants to service these new contracts.",39,1062,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01062
2021-10-05-T-011,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"In this regard, SCAP is working hard to accredit consultants and ensure that they have a high level of competence and the technical expertise to provide the best holistic solutions to clients.",40,1063,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01063
2021-10-05-T-011,Raj Joshua Thomas,Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member),"Madam, please allow me to conclude by coming back to the amendments introducing protections for security officers.

2021-10-05-T-011,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"Madam, I rise in support of the Bill. Security officers play a vital role as the first line of defence for many of Singapore’s residents. They are on the lookout for any suspicious activities. They guard our homes, our businesses against unwanted incidents and crimes.",1,1067,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01067
2021-10-05-T-011,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"With their responsibilities, we need to first acknowledge that security officers are not Police officers. They do not have the power to arrest. They do not carry arms. When they are carrying out their responsibilities, most of the security officers fend for themselves before any reinforcement arrives.",2,1068,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01068
2021-10-05-T-011,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"We need to realise that these officers are someone’s parents, children, grandparents, relatives and friends.

2021-10-05-T-011,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"First, can the Minister of State give us an overview of the number of abuse and harassment cases reported against security officers by themselves, members of the public or security agencies over the past three years? Presenting this data would show the severity of the issue and the challenges security officers and agencies face.",5,1071,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01071
2021-10-05-T-011,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"Moving on from that point, what are some actions taken thus far against those who abuse or harass security officers?",6,1072,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01072
2021-10-05-T-011,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"Madam, the second point that I would like to raise is that, in this House, we can pass Bills and legislation to better protect the rights of Singaporeans from being abused or harassed. At the same time, victims must, they must come forward to report to the authorities about their abuse. There must never be any impediments for victims to lodge a report or complaint.",7,1073,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01073
2021-10-05-T-011,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"With that, I would like to ask the Minister of State if there will be a proper protocol, perhaps a whistle-blowing channel, for security officers to use to report incidents of abuse or harassment?",8,1074,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01074
2021-10-05-T-011,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),I ask this as I would like to ensure that all security officers are free to report any cases of harassment or abuse that they might face in their line of duty without compromising their careers with the security agencies and their clients.,9,1075,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01075
2021-10-05-T-011,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"Madam, I would also like to highlight the skills of the security officers in their line of duty. This is not to say that they are ill-equipped with the skills needed to be security officers, as we know they are required to undergo courses and trainings to face evolving challenges.",10,1076,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01076
2021-10-05-T-011,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"Given the severity of abuse cases among security officers, will there be an upgrade of the framework that can be applied to officers across the board if they face any problems of abuse and harassment? Should security agencies invest then in body-worn cameras to better equip officers against possible perpetrators?",11,1077,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01077
2021-10-05-T-011,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"Finally, we know that security officers work round the clock and man 12-hour shifts. This would induce lethargy among officers. Will the Ministry introduce any limit to working hours, including mandated off days or off hours, for officers, without affecting their salary?",12,1078,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01078

2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,Dr Wan Rizal and Mr Melvin Yong asked for an overview of the number of abuse and harassment cases reported against security officers in recent years. Dr Rizal also asked what actions were taken against these offenders.,3,1083,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01083
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"As mentioned in my earlier speech, in the last three years, there was an average of about 150 cases of abuse while security officers were on duty per year. Depending on the facts and circumstances of each case, the action taken against offenders may range from stern warnings to Court prosecutions.",4,1084,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01084
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,Let me now address Members’ questions on the new offences.,5,1085,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01085
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Mr Louis Ng asked what counts as the execution and discharge of a security officer’s duty. This refers to the functions of a security officer as defined in section 13 of the PSIA, as he has alluded to, and includes broad roles such as patrolling or guarding another person’s property, or to check individuals seeking entry to any place. This could extend to certain other functions, including SMM functions, such as denying entry to persons who do not wear masks.",6,1086,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01086
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Mr Desmond Choo asked whether the new section 17C PSIA applies to abuse committed while a security officer is off duty and whether MHA will consider including other harassment activities covered by POHA section 3, such as doxxing, or section 5 in the new PSIA offences.",7,1087,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01087
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,I have to say that the introduction of offences in PSIA expressly provides targeted protection for security officers against common types of abuse and harassment faced by the security officers at their work.,8,1088,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01088
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"If a security officer is abused while off duty, but the abuse is in relation to the execution of the officer’s duties under section 13 of the PSIA, then an offence under the new section 17C PSIA may be made out. The key here is the abuse or harassment must be in relation to the work or the duty that he performs. I want to assure Mr Desmond Choo that we will continue to monitor the ground situation to ensure that security officers get adequate protection.",9,1089,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01089
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Mr Louis Ng also asked why the new section 17C PSIA offence allows the accused to prove that he had no reason to believe that his actions would be perceived by the target person. Mr Ng noted that this is not a defence for a section 3 POHA offence. Mr Ang Wei Neng raised concerns about shifting the burden of proof and suggested that, for a similar offence, section 17C PSIA may accord security officers with a higher level of protection than public servants.",10,1090,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01090
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"To clarify, stipulating defences does not shift the burden of proof to the accused. The prosecution still needs to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an offence has been committed. The defences make it clear that the accused may be absolved under certain specific circumstances. That said, it is not the case that the accused can simply claim that he or she did not believe that his or her actions would be perceived by the target person.",11,1091,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01091
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Rather, the defence under the new section 17C PSIA requires the accused to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not know and had no reason to believe that the words or behaviour used, or the communication made, would be heard, seen or otherwise perceived by the target person. An example of this scenario can be found in illustration (b) of section 3 POHA and I read",12,1092,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01092
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"""Character X writes a letter containing threatening words towards Y intending to send the letter to person Y to cause him alarm. X decides not to send the letter and throws it away. Person Y finds the letter and is alarmed. X is not guilty of an offence as he had no reason to believe that the letter would be seen by Y.""",13,1093,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01093
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,The proposed section 17C PSIA is not intended to mirror POHA completely and takes into consideration the nature of security officers’ work.,14,1094,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01094
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Nevertheless, the defences available for a section 17C PSIA offence are similarly available for offences against public servants, under section 6 POHA. Hence, there is no higher protection as suggested. Although a similar defence is not present in section 3 POHA, it is also clear from illustration (b) that I have read of that section that if an accused had no reason to believe that an offensive communication would be perceived by the target person, the offence under that section would not be made out.",15,1095,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01095
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,Mr Darryl David asked why and how section 17C PSIA differentiates itself from section 6 POHA for security officers who are essentially carrying out the same job functions. He asked if this would lead to differentiated level of protection of security officers.,16,1096,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01096
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"To clarify, some security officers are already considered Public Service Workers under POHA, such as those deployed at public healthcare institutions, step-down care institutions or educational institutions.",17,1097,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01097
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Security officers who are executing duties in the capacity of Public Service Workers are excluded from the new section 17C PSIA offence, to avoid overlap with section 6 POHA. This group of security officers continue to be accorded protection under POHA, with the same penalties as the new section 17C PSIA harassment offence.",18,1098,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01098
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Mr Ang asked if Police reports must be made before the Police investigates into the new PSIA offences and whether the Police would be more inclined to charge persons for the new section 17C PSIA offence. Yes, reports should be lodged in such cases. I would like to emphasise that the Police have treated all cases and allegations of harassment and abuse against security officers equally and seriously, and will continue to do so.",19,1099,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01099
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Ms Joan Pereira suggested that offenders should be made to serve community service and undergo mandatory social education programmes. The Criminal Procedure Code already allows for the Courts to issue community orders for suitable cases. Such community orders include mandatory treatment orders for psychiatric conditions and community service orders, which can also be combined with short detention orders.",20,1100,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01100
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Yip asked if ex-offenders are automatically disqualified and how many are employed in the security industry. Given that the security officers are placed in a position of trust, the Police need to ensure that they are competent and suitable for the roles that they are licensed to perform. Depending on the merits of each application, the Police may and have granted licences under suitable conditions, including to ex-offenders.",21,1101,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01101
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Between 2017 and 2021, the Police received an average of 300 security officer licence application appeals per year, including from ex-offenders, of which about a fifth were successful. We will continue to look at each application on their merits and to ensure eligible applicants, including ex-offenders, can continue to join this industry.",22,1102,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01102
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Mr Yip Hon Weng, Ms Joan Pereira, Mr Melvin Yong and Dr Wan Rizal asked about and gave suggestions on the use of body-worn cameras. These are issues that should be discussed by the service buyer and service provider, taking into account various factors, such as the needs of the buyer, the deployment locations as well as the costs involved.",23,1103,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01103
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"We have, in MHA, strongly encouraged the industry to make use of technology, like body-worn cameras, to facilitate better onsite management or investigation into allegations of abuse. And the industry has responded, as we have seen an increasing trend of security agencies deploying body-worn cameras for their security operations. Between 2019 and 2021, the Police approved 43 requests made by 15 licensed security agencies for the use of body-worn cameras at various deployment sites for their security officers.",24,1104,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01104

2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,Mr Yong and Ms Mariam Jaafar asked what is being done to further improve work conditions and make the private security sector more attractive.,26,1106,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01106
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"This Bill is just one of the initiatives under the security ITM to help transform and raise industry standards, improve wages and, also, improve the work conditions and environment for our security officers. The Government has and will continue to work closely with tripartite partners through the Security Tripartite Cluster to uplift wages and skills upgrading of our security officers. For example, on wages, the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) has improved wages for about 40,000 security officers. Real median monthly gross wages for security officers grew cumulatively by 36% from 2014 to 2019, outstripping the 21% growth for workers in general.",27,1107,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01107
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Ms Sylvia Lim, Mr Yip Hon Weng, Mr Darryl David and Dr Wan Rizal also asked about skills upgrading and training for our security officers. It is indeed an important area. And on this area, tripartite partners have introduced courses to train security officers in public management, such as customer orientation, problem-solving and collaboration skills, as well as identifying relevant skills to combat evolving security threats and including terrorism threats. Security agencies that need help in redesigning jobs, incorporating technology and upskilling their officers can also leverage on WSG's Job Redesign Reskilling Programme for Security Officers.",28,1108,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01108
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Regarding working conditions, Dr Rizal also asked if the Ministry will introduce any limit to security officers' working hours, including mandated off days and hours. I would like to assure Dr Rizal that these are currently covered under the Employment Act. Tripartite partners have also taken concrete steps to address security officers' long working hours. The most recent is the removal of overtime exemption in January 2021.",29,1109,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01109
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Previously, with the exemption, security officers could work up to 95 hours of overtime per month and now, overtime is capped at 72 hours per month. So, the cap on overtime hours will hopefully improve the working conditions and increase attractiveness into the demanding industry.",30,1110,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01110
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"On Mr David and Mr Raj Joshua Thomas' suggestions for rest areas for security officers, we are unable to mandate minimum rest areas due to the practical infrastructure constraints of certain premises, but we have encouraged buyers of outsourced services to set up proper rest areas for outsourced workers at their premises through the Workcare Grant. MHA and our tripartite partners will continue to monitor the ground situation to ensure that our security officers' welfare is not neglected, and will not hesitate to intervene where necessary.",31,1111,2021-10-05-T-011-S-01111
2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"On Mr Fahmi's further query on the adoption of outcome-based contracting (OBC) to make security officers' work safer and more effective, MHA had shared in our response to a Parliamentary Question in July that the Government has already taken the lead in the adoption of OBC.

2021-10-05-T-011,Desmond Tan,Mr Desmond Tan,"Finally, I will address questions relating to the changes to the regulatory regime for security services. Ms Mariam Jaafar raised potential concerns about industry-led accreditation for security consultants. To clarify, we are removing persons who only provide security consultancy services from regulation under the PSIA.

2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Sir, the Coroners Act was introduced as a standalone Act on coronial matters in 2010. Before that Act, Coroner's Inquiries were dealt with under the Criminal Procedure Code. The 2010 Act updated our coronial system to clarify its role and also, strengthen its procedures, so that it could better serve the public interest.",2,1133,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01133
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"The Act made three key changes. First, the Coroner's Inquiry became fact-finding, rather than fault-finding. Second, the Coroner was empowered to tap on the technical expertise of forensic pathologists or assessors, to facilitate more effective coronial investigations. Third, it re-scoped the Coroner's jurisdiction, giving it a clearer focus.",3,1134,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01134

2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"This Bill seeks to do so in two ways  first, to make viewing of the body by the Coroner discretionary rather than mandatory in all cases; second, to empower the Minister for Law to exempt selected deaths from certain provisions of the Act. Let me take Members through these two broad changes.",5,1136,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01136
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Currently, section 12 of the Act requires the Coroner to view the body as soon as possible, in all cases, after a death is reported to him. This is to ensure that the deceased is correctly identified. However, today, the viewing of the body by the Coroner may not be necessary in all cases in order to correctly identify the body. We have other safeguards, which use technology to ensure the correct identification of bodies.",6,1137,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01137
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Today, when a death is reported to the Police, the following steps take place. The Police Investigation Officer (IO) will investigate the deceased's identity at the scene by, for example, interviewing the next-of-kin, and also obtaining the deceased's NRIC or passport. The Police IO will then record the deceased's particulars on a tag, which will be attached to the body at the scene. At the mortuary, the Police IO will present the deceased's NRIC or other identification documents to the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) staff for registration. Two additional body tags will also be attached to the body in the mortuary  first, a Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tag to track the body's movement within the mortuary; and, two, a QR code body tag to confirm the deceased's identity.",7,1138,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01138

A photograph of the deceased's face and the body tags will also be taken and attached to the BIF. The same Police IO, who recorded the deceased's particulars at the scene, will verify the accuracy of the BIF, before the BIF is sent to the Coroner. The Coroner will then check the BIF against the report filed by the Police IO.",8,1139,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01139
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"These steps and safeguards are sufficient to ensure correct identification of the deceased.

2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Clause 2 of the Bill, which makes the body-viewing by the Coroner discretionary, will (a) expedite the release of the body to the family; and (b) save resources for the Police, HSA and the Coroner. The Coroner will still be able to view the body if the Coroner considers this to be necessary. For example, the Coroner may wish to view the body in a case where foul play is suspected, or where the death may have wider implications on international relations.",10,1141,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01141
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"In addition, the amendment will not affect the Coroner's duty to carry out a preliminary investigation into the cause of and circumstances connected with the death. During the preliminary investigation, the Coroner will consult the HSA forensic pathologist and the Police IO. The Coroner will generally ask the Police IO about the scene investigations and any witness accounts. Where the deceased's identity is unclear, the Coroner may then direct further steps, such as checking missing persons records, fingerprint identification and also forensic analysis, as may be appropriate. The forensic pathologist will generally study the CT scan carried out on the body in the mortuary and the deceased's medical records, to determine the possible cause of death.",11,1142,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01142
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Sir, I next move on to the next tranche of amendments under the Bill. This is introduced by the new section 17A. It aims to deal with a situation where the deceased, firstly, had sustained an injury, contracted a disease or suffered a condition outside Singapore, that apparently caused the death; or, second, held certain positions in a foreign state, such as being a government minister; or was the spouse or child of persons holding certain positions in a foreign state. In such situations, it is possible that a foreign state may request Singapore not to conduct a post-mortem examination on the body, so that the foreign state may itself carry out its own examination.",12,1143,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01143
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"At present, under the scope of our Act today, it is not possible to accede to such requests. The Act requires the Coroner to certify the cause of death based on the findings of the Coroner's Inquiry – if one is held – or based on the available evidence if a Coroner's Inquiry is not held. However, there may be some cases where a post-mortem examination might be necessary to determine the cause of death, for example, if there are no external visible manifest signs of injury or disease. In such cases, a post-mortem examination must be carried out before the Coroner can release the body.",13,1144,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01144
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"The new section 17A proposed provides flexibility for Singapore to accede to requests in appropriate cases, by allowing the Minister to issue a certificate to exempt the death from certain provisions of the Act.",14,1145,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01145

2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Third, the Minister must be satisfied, after having regard to the circumstances of the case and any undertaking given by the foreign state, that it is not in the public interest for the provisions of the Act to apply to the deceased. In other words, the assessment is made as to whether there is a public interest, notwithstanding the request by the foreign state, for the examination to take place in Singapore.",18,1149,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01149
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"In deciding whether to issue a certificate, the Minister may consider various factors, such as the forensic pathologist's views on the death; the Police's investigative findings on the death; the Public Prosecutor's views as to the likelihood of any criminal prosecutions in relation to the death and the likely impact of an exemption on such prosecutions. And fourthly, the purpose for which the request was made by the foreign state. If the Minister issues a certificate, a post-mortem examination must not be conducted and the body must be released immediately to the foreign state.",19,1150,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01150
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"The Bill does not change the default position under the Act, which is that the Coroner will investigate deaths falling within the Coroner's jurisdiction. It is only in exceptional cases that the default position may be departed from under the new section 17A; and the three conditions I have mentioned above must be met and, in particular, I stress that the Minister must be satisfied that it would not be in our public interest for the usual coronial process to apply to the deceased.",20,1151,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01151

2021-10-05-T-013,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill. I only have one area of clarification that I seek from the hon Minister. The Minister proposed to vest with him the power to exempt certain deaths from the application of the Coroners Act. Principally, the deaths that are proposed to be exempted from the Act are persons who died in Singapore, arising from conditions contracted outside Singapore or are for persons who are or were part of foreign government; this includes the spouse or child of the person too.",1,1154,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01154
2021-10-05-T-013,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),My concern is how this proposal squares with the existing framework of the Coroners Act dealing with the Public Prosecutor's powers.,2,1155,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01155
2021-10-05-T-013,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"When the hon Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs and Law, Prof Ho Peng Kee moved the Coroners Bill in 2010, he stated, as recounted by the hon Minister, that the Coroner's role is purely fact-finding. It is not the job of the Coroner to decide who is criminally responsible for the death. He stressed that it is the Public Prosecutor who has the constitutional responsibility of who should be prosecuted for being responsible for the death.",3,1156,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01156
2021-10-05-T-013,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"That was why the current Act provides for the Public Prosecutor to have wide-ranging powers, which includes the power to direct a Coroner to order a post-mortem examination, direct a forensic pathologist to investigate the cause of and circumstances connected with the death and direct a Coroner to hold an inquiry into any death occurring in Singapore.",4,1157,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01157
2021-10-05-T-013,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I am concerned about a situation where the Minister and the Public Prosecutor may not be ad idem on the issue of whether the death should be exempt from the Act. Would it not be preferable for the Minister to be only allowed to use his power, as contemplated under this Bill, only after the Public Prosecutor had consented.",5,1158,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01158
2021-10-05-T-013,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"This is the case in the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (CLTPA). As Members would know, the CLTPA may be invoked by the Minister to detain a person who is believed to have engaged in criminal acts affecting public safety, peace and good order. This same person may well be subject to prosecution by the Public Prosecutor, exercising his constitutional powers. That is why it is provided in the Act that the Minister may only order a detention upon procuring the Public Prosecutor's consent. In fact, it is expressly provided in the Act that nothing in that Act derogates from the powers of the Public Prosecutor with regard to the control and direction of criminal prosecutions.",6,1159,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01159
2021-10-05-T-013,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I will be grateful for the hon Minister's explanation on this matter. Notwithstanding my comments, I support the Bill.",7,1160,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01160
2021-10-05-T-013,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Bill seeks to make two changes to the investigations of deaths that are defined as reportable. I have concerns about both provisions and would like the Ministry's clarifications.",1,1161,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01161
2021-10-05-T-013,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, it is proposed by clause 2 that section 12 be amended to make the viewing of the body by the Coroner optional. That is, when the Coroner is conducting his preliminary investigations into a reportable death, he can decide not to view the body at all. As for the rationale for this change, it was stated in the MinLaw release that this would ""expedite the process of the body to the family and will also save resources for the Police, the Health Sciences Authority and the Coroner"".",2,1162,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01162
2021-10-05-T-013,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, it would thus appear that the move to make viewing of the body optional is motivated, at least in part, by resource constraints. However, we must ask, to what extent will this change result in any compromise of investigations of deaths? Despite what the Minister said earlier, it is not clear, to me at least, on what basis or the kinds of cases that are appropriate for a Coroner to decide that viewing of the body is not required. Could the Minister please elaborate further on how the Coroner would be supported to ensure that he or she does not inadvertently miss or overlook important evidence that further investigations into the death may be warranted?",3,1163,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01163
2021-10-05-T-013,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The second change brought about by this Bill is to give the Minister for Law the power to issue a certificate for the release of the body of a deceased person at the request of a foreign state. Clause 3 of the Bill will introduce a new section 17A to the Act, to provide that if a foreign state has requested release of the body of a deceased in Singapore, then the Minister can consider issuing such a certificate in two situations. First, where the deceased had sustained an injury, contracted a disease or suffered a condition outside Singapore that appears to have caused the death; or, second, where the deceased person was or formerly was a head of state, head of government, government minister, government official or spouse or child of these persons or a diplomatic agent of a foreign state. If the Minister sees it fit to issue such a certificate for the release of the body of the deceased, then all investigations into the death must stop. A post-mortem should not be carried out and any Coroner's Inquiry into the death should cease.",4,1164,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01164
2021-10-05-T-013,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"According to the media release by MinLaw on 13 September, one of the reasons is that the foreign state may wish to conduct its own post-mortem examination on the citizen or resident who happened to die in Singapore after sustaining an injury, contracting a disease or suffering a condition outside of Singapore. I have two observations to make on this.",5,1165,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01165
2021-10-05-T-013,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, it should be noted that the proposed section 17A phrases the conditions of (a)(i) and (a)(ii) as alternatives.",6,1166,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01166
2021-10-05-T-013,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"So, for example, if the deceased happens to be an incumbent or a former head of government, it is not necessary that the deceased should have sustained an injury or illness outside of Singapore that appeared to lead to his death. The deceased's very status as a current or former head of government is enough to bring up such a case within the new regime even if the cause of death has no overseas nexus.",7,1167,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01167
2021-10-05-T-013,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Secondly, there could well be circumstances where a foreign state could request the return of the body of a deceased government official because it does not want a post-mortem or inquiry to be done by an independent party. This could be motivated by a desire to preserve the dignity of a formal leader, but could also be motivated by less noble reasons, for example, to cover up a death deliberately caused to a political opponent. We cannot dismiss this possibility and it is certainly not far-fetched that political adversaries could be killed through poisoning or other nefarious means. The likelihood of the death of a foreign leader occurring in Singapore is not low as Singapore is a noted destination for medical treatment. It goes without saying that when a death occurs in Singapore, important evidence surrounding the death may well be located in Singapore. Furthermore, such evidence may not be immediately available after the death as the Police may need time to uncover it. Thus, there are risks associated with a quick handover of records and evidence to the foreign state.",8,1168,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01168
2021-10-05-T-013,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, I note that under the Bill, the Minister retains the discretion whether or not to issue the certificate to release the body to a requesting foreign state. He can order investigations in Singapore to continue if he believes it to be in the public interest to do so. He can also subsequently revoke an earlier certificate for release. These are important provisions.",9,1169,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01169
2021-10-05-T-013,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"As a member of the international community, we have a part to play to ensure that history is accurately recorded and that the world is not misled by fake news about the death of national leaders and officials. The Minister will need to be alive to this risk, even as he will likely face pressure from the requesting foreign state.",10,1170,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01170

2021-10-05-T-013,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"On the first amendment which is to give the Minister flexibility to issue a certificate for the release of a dead body to a foreign state in certain circumstances, I would like to ask the Minister what were the circumstances that prompted this particular amendment. Was there any recent incident where a foreign state objected to or requested for exemption from the Coroner holding an inquiry? What were the difficult circumstances in that case, if at all, or those cases which prompted the Government to wish to give the Government the discretion not to hold such an inquiry?",2,1173,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01173
2021-10-05-T-013,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"I would also like to ask the Minister, in making such an amendment, whether the Government has done a study of the likely reciprocity from other countries based on their current laws. Will there, for instance, be mutual reciprocity? I would also like to ask the Minister whether the proposed discretion is widely available in other countries.",3,1174,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01174
2021-10-05-T-013,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"I would like to ask what safeguards are in place to ensure that our Minister, in making such a decision, will not succumb to any strong pressure from a foreign state to release the body of a dead person when there are mysterious or suspicious circumstances leading to his or her death.",4,1175,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01175

2021-10-05-T-013,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"According to MinLaw, there are two reasons for the suggested change  (a) the viewing of the body serves ""to ensure that the deceased is correctly identified. However, there are already existing safeguards to ensure the correct identification of bodies"", which the Minister has touched on today; and (b) this will expedite the process of releasing the body to the family, and will also save resources for the Police, the Health Sciences Authority and the Coroner.",7,1178,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01178
2021-10-05-T-013,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"In the debate to the Coroners’ Bill in 2010, the Senior Minister of State introducing the Bill, Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee, said that  ""…this provision will enable the Coroner to harness technology in appropriate cases, where the Coroner may be indisposed to be physically present to view the body, without having to cause unnecessary delay to the progress of time-sensitive investigations. This will expedite the release of the body to the next-of-kin after the Coroner has viewed and identified it. But let me assure Dr Lam that the norm will still be the current practice of the Coroner going down physically, right to the mortuary every morning to view and identify the body, and that includes weekends and public holidays.""",8,1179,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01179

2021-10-05-T-013,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Needless to say, viewing the body is an important step in determining whether a death happened due to natural causes or whether an inquiry into the cause of death is needed.",10,1181,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01181
2021-10-05-T-013,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Comparing Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee’s remarks on the default practice of the Coroner going down physically to the mortuary to view and identify the body, to the present proposed amendments, there appears to be a significant mindset shift on this.",11,1182,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01182
2021-10-05-T-013,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Sir, I would like to ask the Minister with this amendment, whether there is an intention to stop the Coroner’s daily attendance at the mortuary as a default practice, if it is not already happening, and let some other means, as what the Minister has explained, like video link to take over as a daily default practice in place. If not, what is the expectation of the Government with respect to when the Coroner is expected to attend in person?",12,1183,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01183
2021-10-05-T-013,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"I would like to know whether the proposed change arises from a significant resource shortage for the Police, the Health Sciences Authority and the Coroner’s office.

2021-10-05-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, I support this Bill, which will allow for greater flexibility in the Coroner’s discharge of duties.

2021-10-05-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My first point is on the Coroner’s investigation process. Body viewing is one of the steps the Coroner must take in investigating and determining the cause and circumstances surrounding a reported death. Having a proper procedure in place is important because it provides reassurance to the deceased’s family and similarly protects the Coroner from any allegations of wrongdoing or negligence.,3,1189,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01189
2021-10-05-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"With the amendment to make such body viewing discretionary, can the Minister share what remaining mandatory requirements the Coroner has to fulfil in its preliminary investigation?",4,1190,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01190
2021-10-05-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My second point is on the safeguards to ensure correct identification of bodies. I note that existing safeguards to ensure the correct identification will remain. As Minister has shared, these safeguards include the tagging of the body with the deceased’s particulars at the scene and at the mortuary, the Police signing off on a Body Identification Form and sending it to the Coroner.",5,1191,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01191
2021-10-05-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Can the Minister share if additional steps will be taken to strengthen the existing safeguards to ensure correct identification notwithstanding the removal of the mandatory body viewing requirement?,6,1192,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01192
2021-10-05-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My third point is on the revocation of certificates to release the bodies of deceased persons to foreign states. The new section 17A provides the Minister’s power to issue a Minister’s certificate to release the bodies of a deceased person to foreign states in certain cases. Under the new section 17A(4), the Minister also has the power to revoke any Minister’s certificate previously issued.",7,1193,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01193
2021-10-05-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Can the Minister clarify under what circumstances would the Minister’s certificate be revoked? Is there a time limit in exercising the revocation?,8,1194,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01194
2021-10-05-T-013,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"If the certificate is revoked after the body has been buried, cremated, or transported out of the country, can the Minister share what methods and procedures are in place to ensure that the quality of the resumed investigation under the new section 17A(4)(a) will not be compromised?",9,1195,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01195

2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Ng asked what were the mandatory requirements for the preliminary investigation. There are no mandatory steps in this. But it really depends on the particular circumstances of the death and the context in which it occurs, and whether or not there are particular areas of concern that the Coroner has, which will then drive the steps to be taken in the preliminary investigation.",2,1199,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01199
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Ng, Ms Lim and Mr Tan asked about the current process, whether there are safeguards, whether we are doing this because there is a manpower issue, and it is driven entirely by this.",3,1200,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01200
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"First of all, I will remind Members what I said at the outset, that we have been doing this for a couple of years now, since the Coroners Act came into force in 2010, using a variety of different steps, technology, video usage, RFID, QR coding. And I think I described the process in some detail earlier. We looked at that, we looked at the records, we looked at the reliability of that system and, as I said just now, we found that as far as we could tell, there were no misidentifications using this system. This then gave us enough confidence to propose this suggestion.",4,1201,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01201
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"It is not to say that because of this that there will be a flood of non-inspections or non-viewing of the bodies as a result of this. I think it just gives the Coroner the discretion, on a case-by-case basis, assessing the probative value of each of the different sources of identification, making an overall assessment and deciding whether or not it is sufficiently safe not to actually view the body.",5,1202,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01202
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,I do not think I will go into the specific steps again. I think Members can take reference from what I had said earlier.,6,1203,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01203
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Ms Lim had asked about the exemption, section 17A. Ms Lim, to paraphrase her, suggested that there might be circumstances where the request could be motivated by less noble reasons, nefarious reasons, I think, was the phrase that was used. I would like to assure Ms Lim that if such a situation arises, then it would not, obviously, be in the public interest for us to accede to that request. If there are suspicious circumstances surrounding a head of state's or a foreign government minister's death in Singapore, then, obviously, it is not in our country's interest to give up on the investigation and to let the foreign state take over the investigations and, in fact, to completely remove the body from Singapore altogether. So, I think that she should be reasonably assuaged.",7,1204,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01204
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On the suggestion that there might be a quick handover, there are steps in section 17A(2) which sets out the different checks that the Minister will have regard to prior to issuing the certificate and this includes looking at information from a forensic pathologist, even directing the forensic pathologist to investigate the apparent cause, to have some degree of satisfaction, and also the Minister may direct the Police to provide any further assistance that a pathologist might require.",8,1205,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01205
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, all of these steps give us the assurance that the death has not occurred in nefarious or unusual circumstances, and there is enough, sufficient public interest for us to accede to the request.",9,1206,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01206
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Tan asked about the rationale of section 17A. The point is this. There are circumstances where a foreign state may have a legitimate interest in the death and request that Singapore does not conduct our post-mortem examination. For example, the foreign state may wish to maintain the integrity of the body – I think Ms Lim mentioned ""preserve the dignity"" – so that it may conduct its own post-mortem examination on its resident or citizen.",10,1207,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01207
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On other occasions, the death may have taken place in Singapore, but the cause of death is really only tangentially connected to Singapore and is instead more closely connected with events and circumstances overseas.",11,1208,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01208
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Tan asked whether it is motivated by any particular occasion. It is really a question of comity, as far as we can to try and accommodate in appropriate situations. The point here is, at this point in time, the Act does not allow any leeway, whatsoever. What these amendments do is not to say that in all such requests they will be granted but it creates the possibility of acceding to these requests when they come in.",12,1209,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01209
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Pillai asked about the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act or CLTPA.

2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Well, first of all, the PP's views, whether or not they are going to be conducting further investigations, its sense of whether there is any impropriety which merits further review or investigation, will all be taken into account.",14,1211,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01211
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"It is not the same framework as the CLTPA here because in that situation, we are dealing with consent to detain a person. Here, it is in relation to a request by a foreign party to not conduct a post-mortem here and to release the body to a foreign state. And, of course, the whole gamut of matters that surround the public interest criteria, including whether or not the PP's view is that there should be a further investigation, will be taken into account.",15,1212,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01212
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I would add that the Minister is very unlikely to reach a conclusion that it is in our public interest, where circumstances surrounding the death is either unknown, unclear or it is not apparently the reason, as set out, through a disease or manifest cause and where there might be a suspicion of foul play, then in those situations, in assessing public interest, the Minister will obviously have to consider the PP's position as far as these considerations are concerned.",16,1213,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01213
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Ng asked for a clarification of the circumstances in which the Minister's certificate might be revoked. When deciding whether to issue the certificate in the first place, in other words, before we have to get into a situation where we have to decide what happens when we revoke it, the question as to what is public interest, whether it is appropriate in this case, whether we should be granting the certificate, will be judiciously considered. This minimises the possibility of having to subsequently reconsider similar circumstances, as far as possible.",17,1214,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01214
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Obviously, there could be a change in circumstances. There could be a scenario where the foreign state, for example, withdraws the request for the certificate or that there is now some other material that is known now, that was not available at that point in time. Obviously, these are matters which might arise.",18,1215,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01215
2021-10-05-T-013,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"There is no time limit prescribed for the revocation. But, obviously, the Minister will have to consider the time elapsed that has gone by, the prejudice, if any, that may have been incurred as a result of the body's movement and whether it is practical in the first place, if the body had already gone back, had undertaken a foreign post-mortem examination and it is not feasible to have that review done in Singapore thereafter.",19,1216,2021-10-05-T-013-S-01216

Largely, my speech will focus on reviewing and making necessary and reasonable changes to the current Vehicle Quota System (VQS), namely Category D of the Certificate of Entitlement, better known among Singaporeans in short as COE. Additionally, I would also like to raise two other related proposals.",1,1226,2021-10-05-T-015-S-01226

Category D is for motorcycles and Category E for all vehicles except motorcycles.",2,1227,2021-10-05-T-015-S-01227

2021-10-05-T-015,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Sir, let us explore the trend for motorcycle’s COE prices over the years. In 2001, the lowest COE prices for Cat D was $509 in December while highest was $1,313 in January. Ten years on, 2011, the lowest price was in December, $1,481 and highest in March, $2,534. This year, 2021, the COE price in January was $7,501 and it has skyrocketed in the last couple of months, to $8,899 and $9,689 for August and September, respectively.",5,1230,2021-10-05-T-015-S-01230

A number of these residents are likely to be motorcyclists engaged in delivery and dispatch services with one of the existing platforms. In addition, there are riders who are direct employees of various companies. There are no clear indicators on the number of Singaporeans who are riding commercially.",6,1231,2021-10-05-T-015-S-01231

That is to say, that someone who wants to purchase a Class 2B motorcycle so that he can earn an income as a dispatch rider, will need to set aside four to 10 months of a salary he has not yet earned just to afford the latest COE for a motorcycle. When we take into consideration the road tax, insurance and other costs involved in purchasing a new bike, the number can go up to 14 months. More than a year of working just to afford a vehicle that is needed.",7,1232,2021-10-05-T-015-S-01232
2021-10-05-T-015,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"There is the option of second-hand motorcycles. However, those are not cheap either. A three-year-old motorcycle can go for around $10,000. A motorcycle with three years left on the COE can cost around $5,000. After buying a second-hand motorcycle, the new owner will soon be faced with a decision on whether to renew the COE when it expires. And again, the difficult choice has to be made between buying a new machine or a second-hand vehicle. They can also rent motorcycles, but that is not a sustainable option in the medium to long term, given the rental rates of around $70 daily. One month’s salary does not even cover the rental costs. And this is before we consider the cost of petrol, parking, ERP and more.",8,1233,2021-10-05-T-015-S-01233

In this regard, I am making a few proposals towards improving the COE system for Cat D. I am mindful that the ultimate goal is not to lead to an increase in the number of motorcycles on the road. Rather, my intention is to improve the well-being of our fellow Singaporeans who rely on riding motorcycles to make a living.",9,1234,2021-10-05-T-015-S-01234

This is a proposal I first mentioned in a cut I filed for the 2016 COS debates.

2021-10-05-T-015,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Firstly, I would like to propose to divide motorcycle COEs into three categories, much like the existing categories for the motorcycle riding licence system. Further, I suggest that the number of COEs available be allocated in accordance with the percentage of motorcycles on the roads in each category. This is not a new proposal. In 2016, the Senior Minister of State for Transport at the time had replied that the move would lead to rigidity and further volatility in the COE prices for motorcycles. However, it is clear that the situation mentioned by the Senior Minister of State still happened recently in the current COE system. So, I hope that MOT will consider my suggestion so that we can create a fairer system for motorcyclists in Singapore.",38,1263,2021-10-05-T-015-S-01263
2021-10-05-T-015,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"The second proposal is abolishing COE bidding for Class 2B motorcycles, that is, motorcycles which use engines below 200 cc, and replace them with a conditional balloting system. I understand that the then Minister of State for Transport had once replied to a question about balloting system for the COE for cars. She explained that such a system will cause problems like a black market and also mentioned the difficulty of determining a suitable price for the COEs. In my opinion, we should consider the creation of a system similar to the one used to purchase BTO flats. Those who wish to buy BTO flats and those who wish to buy Class 2B motorcycles are both definitely first-time buyers.",39,1264,2021-10-05-T-015-S-01264

This move could reduce the negative effects caused by speculation on the part of the motorcycle dealers. Although LTA maintained that there is no evidence of speculation, the number of COEs that had been obtained but remain unused, as well as the increase in COE prices in May despite a higher number of COEs on offer, indicate the possibility that this problem really exists.",40,1265,2021-10-05-T-015-S-01265

2021-10-05-T-015,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Besides the COE, I would like to submit two more proposals. First, I propose that a Preferential Additional Registration Fee (PARF) be also extended to motorcyclists who de-register their motorcycles early. As MOT had explained previously, given that the ARF for motorcycles is only 15% of its Open Market Value (OMV), the amount of PARF that motorcyclists can receive is not high enough to incentivise them to de-register their motorcycles. Since most of them who work as delivery workers do not earn a high income, any PARF rebates, even a modest amount, will be appreciated. More importantly, policies should be implemented consistently across all vehicles.",42,1267,2021-10-05-T-015-S-01267
2021-10-05-T-015,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Secondly, I propose to have allocated parking lots made available for dispatch workers in areas such as the Central Business District (CBD), regional business hubs such as Changi Business Park as well as shopping malls located in housing estates especially public housing estates. Riders often avoid using the available parking lots because they want to save money and time. In situations where riders are fined for parking their motorcycles indiscriminately, those fines will further impact their livelihood. By setting up allocated motorcycle parking lots for dispatch workers in such areas, it can help them perform their duties without compromising public safety, save delivery time and, at the same, enhance their work routine and their life circumstances.",43,1268,2021-10-05-T-015-S-01268

2021-10-05-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng),"However, we have observed very high utilisation rates over the past year, which suggests that the higher premiums are a result of higher demand.

This remains the case even for the TCOEs that just expired at the end of September 2021 where the utilisation rate was 99.7%. These were the COEs that were secured in March 2021.

So, for the current August to October 2021 period, the COE supply is 28% lower than the preceding quarter, May to July 2021 period, with the supply being predominantly determined by deregistration. So, this combination of increased demand and the lower COE supply would likely have contributed to the higher premiums in the bidding exercises since August but has receded somewhat in the most recent bidding exercise.",11,1283,2021-10-05-T-015-S-01283

2021-10-05-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng),"First, Mr Faisal suggested splitting the motorcycle COEs into sub-categories according to vehicle classes in the same manner as riding or driving licences, as well as allocate the COE supply for each category according to the percentage of these vehicles on our roads. This is not new. Former Member of Parliament, Mr Zainal Sapari had in 2015 suggested this as well as Mr Abdul Samad who just filed a Parliamentary Question for this Sitting. Ms Joan Pereira had also spoken about separate quotas for motorcycles based on the different categorisation. Mr Chong Kee Hiong also asked to create a new category of COEs for motorcycles used for delivery work.",14,1286,2021-10-05-T-015-S-01286
2021-10-05-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng),We have explained the considerations in the past and these considerations remain relevant today. Let me reiterate.,15,1287,2021-10-05-T-015-S-01287
2021-10-05-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng),"Unlike cars, the quota for motorcycle COEs is relatively small. For example, for August to October 2021, about 440 Cat D COEs were available in each bidding exercise. If we were to divide this further, there will be even smaller quotas for each sub-category. This will likely result in greater volatility and potential increases in COE prices. Of note, allocating sub-category quotas based on the prevailing split in motorcycle population has its challenges. The percentage of Class 2B motorcycles registered fluctuates across the years and even from month to month. It would, therefore, be very difficult for us to arbitrarily select an allocation basis.",16,1288,2021-10-05-T-015-S-01288
2021-10-05-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng),"Second, Mr Faisal also suggested abolishing COEs for all Class 2B motorcycles and to replace it with a balloting system. I understand that the intent is to make COEs affordable for those who need a motorcycle for livelihoods but this is not necessarily better. Such a two-tiered COE system is not equitable since other types of vehicles, such as cars and commercial vehicles, can also be used for livelihoods. More importantly, such a system requires us to arbitrarily set a price. This is different from BTO flat prices. If the price is too low, it will increase demand and crowd out those who truly need the motorcycle for a living and are prepared to pay a bit more for the value it brings.",17,1289,2021-10-05-T-015-S-01289
2021-10-05-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng),"Third, on allowing motorcycle buyers to bid for COE under their own name, this is already allowed as individuals can bid for COEs through the ATMs. However, many motorcycle buyers still choose to go through dealers as this will allow them to get their motorcycles immediately, using the TCOEs that the dealer has already secured. The removal of this option could have unintended consequences for buyers and will have to be studied carefully.",18,1290,2021-10-05-T-015-S-01290
2021-10-05-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng),"Fourth, the five-year COE renewal option is something we created for vehicle owners who need their vehicles for only five years instead of 10 years. If we were to allow COEs to be renewed for five years repeatedly, there will be fewer COEs recycled for bidding. This would tilt the current balance between existing and prospective vehicle owners.",19,1291,2021-10-05-T-015-S-01291

2021-10-05-T-016,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Government will take urgent steps to allow more migrant domestic workers (MDWs) into Singapore to reduce the current waiting time for Singaporean households urgently requiring the services of MDWs especially to look after seniors and young children who critically require appropriate caregiving services.,1,1302,2021-10-05-T-016-S-01302
2021-10-05-T-016,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"MOM is doing our best to facilitate the entry of as many migrant domestic workers (MDWs) as possible, within the parameters allowed by the Multi-Ministry Taskforce. We have completed rescheduling MDWs whose entry approvals were postponed in May, for them to enter before the end of the year. We will continue to give priority to households with urgent and very challenging caregiving needs, particularly sick elderly and family members with special needs.",1,1303,2021-10-05-T-016-S-01303
2021-10-05-T-016,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"We will also be accepting new entry applications for vaccinated MDWs from 15 October 2021, for entry into Singapore from 1 November 2021. But as entry approvals continue to be limited for public health reasons, it could take around three to six months before their MDWs can enter, depending on the COVID-19 situation at source and locally. If the situation improves in the region, we can approve more to enter.",2,1304,2021-10-05-T-016-S-01304
2021-10-05-T-016,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"To meet the demand for MDWs, the Association of Employment Agencies (Singapore) (AEA(S)) started a pilot programme in July 2021. Under this commercial initiative, the AEA(S) works with its overseas business partners to implement additional safe management measures prior to the MDWs’ entry into Singapore. Households which need their MDWs urgently can consider this programme.",3,1305,2021-10-05-T-016-S-01305
2021-10-05-T-016,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"The pilot has shown to be effective at reducing the risk of COVID-19 importation. AEA(S) and its partner employment agencies (EAs) are doing their best to scale up the pilot, as well as to expand the programme to include MDWs from other countries. However, they will need time to find suitable business partners to facilitate the ground processes in overseas countries and ensure that it remains effective at minimising importation risk.",4,1306,2021-10-05-T-016-S-01306
2021-10-05-T-017,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"asked the Minister for Education whether students taking national exams such as the PSLE and ""O/N/A"" levels and who are served a Quarantine Order or Stay-Home Notice will be permitted to undertake their exams in a centralised, dedicated quarantine facility instead of being prohibited from taking the exams altogether.",1,1307,2021-10-05-T-017-S-01307

These include special arrangements to allow students to take their national year-end examinations while on Quarantine Order (QO), Leave of Absence or Approved Absence in a safe manner, starting from the PSLE which began on 30 September 2021, and for GCE ""N(A)/N(T)"", ""O"" and ""A"" level examinations thereafter.",1,1308,2021-10-05-T-017-S-01308
2021-10-05-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Students on QO will be allowed to sit for national written examinations under stringent conditions including a rigorous testing regime and safe management measures. These includes a negative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) entry swab at the beginning of the QO, and students completing a self-swab with Antigen Rapid Tests (ART) kits at home and test Ag- within 24 hours before each of their examination papers. Safe management measures and other precautions are also put in place at the examination venues to ensure the safe conduct of the national examinations.",2,1309,2021-10-05-T-017-S-01309
2021-10-05-T-017,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In the immediate period before the national examinations, travelling should be avoided. In addition, Stay-Home Notice is mandatory for persons after returning from overseas trips. SEAB will, however, make an exception if a student needs to travel for compassionate reasons, for example, demise of close relatives. For these candidates on SHN, SEAB will apply similar arrangements as that for candidates on QO to allow them to sit for their national written examinations.",3,1310,2021-10-05-T-017-S-01310
2021-10-05-T-018,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what more can be done to raise the awareness and expand the current pool of trained pharmacists to identify signs of violence among their customers.,1,1311,2021-10-05-T-018-S-01311

2021-10-05-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"It takes a whole-of-society effort to tackle family violence. The multi-stakeholder Taskforce on Family Violence (Taskforce), which I co-chaired with Minister of State for Home Affairs, Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, released its report late last month, detailing a set of 16 recommendations aimed at improving immediate support for survivors of family violence, enhancing protection for them, preventing violence from recurring and raising awareness of early warning signs. The Taskforce’s report and recommendations, which build on the existing work by the Government and community partners in the area of family violence, seek to strengthen efforts in tackling family violence over the next few years. We do not condone violence against any person and these recommendations are intended to support all persons affected by family violence, regardless of nationality, gender, race, religion or sexual orientation. The Government is considering the set of recommendations carefully and will respond to the Taskforce’s report thereafter.",2,1314,2021-10-05-T-018-S-01314
2021-10-05-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"It is heartening to know that many community partners, agencies and individuals feel strongly about tackling family violence. MSF actively seeks out and collaborates with community partners and organisations to strengthen community detection of violence and refers persons experiencing violence to available support. For instance, MSF worked with Unity Pharmacy to provide Family Violence Awareness Training to over 40 pharmacists in November 2020 and more than 120 retail assistants in April 2021. The intent is to equip them with skills to detect signs and symptoms of family violence among customers who approach them for medication or advice. MSF has rolled out the Family Violence Awareness Training to more partners this year, including staff and volunteers from educational institutions, grassroots and religious organisations. These included PCF Sparkletots, ITE College Central, EtonHouse Community Fund, the People’s Association, MUIS and the Presbyterian Church in Singapore.",3,1315,2021-10-05-T-018-S-01315
2021-10-05-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Beyond training various partners to recognise signs and symptoms of family violence, MSF has also worked with FairPrice and Unity Pharmacy to make available brochures and posters on family violence across their retail outlets, to reach out to customers who may not feel comfortable approaching staff members directly for help.",4,1316,2021-10-05-T-018-S-01316
2021-10-05-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MSF will continue to expand our outreach to more organisations, particularly partners that are likely to have direct contact with survivors of family violence or with groups that are at a higher risk of family violence.

2021-10-05-T-018,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Taskforce agrees that this is something worth doing and has included this in its recommendations. MSF has already started looking into ways to make it easier for persons experiencing family violence to signal that they need help promptly and discreetly. We will release further details later this year.,7,1319,2021-10-05-T-018-S-01319
2021-10-05-T-019,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry as we transit into a state of COVID-19 endemic (a) what is the impact on our economy in 2022 for any delay of border reopening; and (b) what measures are taken in the transition to ensure that SMEs can tide through this period.,1,1320,2021-10-05-T-019-S-01320
2021-10-05-T-019,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Singapore is a small, globally connected economy that thrives on the flow of people and goods. As we move towards COVID-19 resilience with a high rate of vaccination, we will be gradually easing our border restrictions. We had earlier introduced Vaccinated Travel Lanes with Germany and Brunei, and have recently included more countries in Categories II and III following a review of their COVID-19 situations. This facilitates travel with more countries, and we will continue to establish VTL and other travel arrangements with key destinations.",1,1321,2021-10-05-T-019-S-01321
2021-10-05-T-019,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,Keeping Singapore connected to the world is important for three reasons.,2,1322,2021-10-05-T-019-S-01322
2021-10-05-T-019,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"First, Singapore’s strategic position as a business hub depends on our connectivity with the world. Many companies here serve global or regional markets. Continued restrictions on business travel will hamper their ability to operate effectively.",3,1323,2021-10-05-T-019-S-01323
2021-10-05-T-019,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Second, the recovery of our travel-dependent sectors such as aviation, tourism, and meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) relies on foreign visitors. These sectors employ many Singaporeans and have borne the brunt of the ongoing pandemic.",4,1324,2021-10-05-T-019-S-01324
2021-10-05-T-019,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Third, we will need to ease labour shortages, particularly in the construction sector, which has been experiencing serious project delays or disruptions, including many BTO projects. Many families are also awaiting domestic workers to help care for their loved ones.",5,1325,2021-10-05-T-019-S-01325

2021-10-05-T-019,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"To alleviate the tight foreign manpower situation, the Government has relaxed regulatory conditions to help firms retain their work permit holders. We are also facilitating the safe inflow of new workers from a range of source countries.",12,1332,2021-10-05-T-019-S-01332
2021-10-05-T-019,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We are prepared to consider other ways to help our firms as needs arise. Singapore has weathered many crises in the past. We have done it before, and I am confident that as long as we stay united and resilient, we will emerge from COVID-19 stronger than before.",13,1333,2021-10-05-T-019-S-01333
2021-10-05-T-020,He Ting Ru,Ms He Ting Ru,asked the Minister for Social and Family Development given a recent NGO finding that more than 10% of Singaporean households have experienced food insecurity (a) how does the Ministry track this issue; (b) whether there can be an update on the steps being taken to address it; and (c) what has been the trend in light of the prolonged COVID-19 situation.,1,1334,2021-10-05-T-020-S-01334
2021-10-05-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"While MSF does not specifically track the number of Singaporean households experiencing food insecurity, Singapore has performed favourably in international comparisons of food insecurity. For instance, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation’s 2021 report on the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World estimated that 4.5% of Singapore’s population in Singapore faced at least moderate food insecurity. This was lower than other developed economies like Australia, New Zealand and the United States.",1,1335,2021-10-05-T-020-S-01335
2021-10-05-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MSF recognises that there are vulnerable groups within our community who require assistance and we support them in a number of ways. Low-income households with difficulties meeting their basic living needs can approach the Social Service Offices (SSOs) for assistance. Those who are eligible for ComCare will receive comprehensive support, which include cash assistance for basic living expenses such as food-related expenditures, employment assistance, as well as support with household and medical bills.",2,1336,2021-10-05-T-020-S-01336
2021-10-05-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"SSOs also link households up with other Government agencies and Social Service Agencies (SSAs) for additional support. Examples include MOH’s Meals-on-Wheels programme, which delivers cooked meals to homebound seniors with limited social support, and MOE’s School Meals Programme for Primary and Secondary school students on the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS). SSOs, Family Service Centres, Community Justice Centre and Citizens’ Consultative Committees also provide interim cash and supermarket vouchers for households facing immediate needs.",3,1337,2021-10-05-T-020-S-01337

These measures were part of the suite of Budget relief schemes, such as the COVID-19 Recovery Grant, for affected workers suffering income or job loss and helped the lower-income cope with household expenditures, including food expenses.",4,1338,2021-10-05-T-020-S-01338
2021-10-05-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"MSF works closely with our community partners to strengthen support for food insecure households. In 2019, MSF convened a cross-sector Charity Food Workgroup, comprising food charities, Government agencies, corporates and volunteers. The workgroup is developing a food directory and database, and piloting ""local food coordinators"". The objective of these initiatives is to better identify and match households with food needs to food support organisations, and ensure that beneficiaries receive the correct type and amount of food support that meets their dietary needs.",5,1339,2021-10-05-T-020-S-01339
2021-10-05-T-020,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"During the 2020 circuit breaker, the Charity Food Workgroup worked closely with Government agencies, social service agencies, food charities and volunteer groups to ensure the continuity of food support. The SG Cares Community Network subsequently activated agencies and volunteers to proactively reach out to all 50,000 rental households across Singapore. Households that indicated food needs were linked up to further support, including food charities or meal delivery services for those with mobility or health issues. Going forward, MSF will be scaling up Community Link to strengthen support for 14,000 families with young children living in rental housing. We will not only connect families with food needs to food support, but also support them in addressing the underlying causes of their food insecurity, such as unemployment or health issues.",6,1340,2021-10-05-T-020-S-01340

Two, they pass on some of this price stability to consumers through fixed price plans.",2,1344,2021-10-05-T-021-S-01344
2021-10-05-T-021,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Nonetheless, sustained high fuel prices will eventually feed into our electricity prices. We are importing close to 100% of our energy needs today. In spite of best efforts to deploy solar energy in Singapore, we are land constrained and will need to continue to rely on energy imports one way or another, and be subject to global price movements. Fuel prices have been low for some time and had dipped to their lowest in the last 20 years earlier this year, but as we have seen, may rise as global demand recovers.",3,1345,2021-10-05-T-021-S-01345

Even though ridership improved slightly in 2021, it remains significantly lower than pre-COVID-19 levels. Nonetheless, the rail operators have largely preserved service capacity and headways to ensure that commuters can maintain safe distancing. Rail reliability also continues to be high, at more than one million train-km between failures. To ensure commuter safety, the operators have also incurred additional costs, for instance, by stepping up cleaning efforts.",1,1354,2021-10-05-T-022-S-01354

2021-10-05-T-023,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"To enable schools to benefit from fresh perspectives and share good practices at the leadership level, our Principals are also typically rotated after contributing in the same school for between four and eight years.

2021-10-05-T-024,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the lessons learned from the abrupt exit of oBike from Singapore; and (b) what are the protective measures which LTA may now require of all operators of similar public-subscribed transport schemes in the interest of (i) consumers for loss of deposit payments (ii) local service providers for unpaid services rendered and (iii) public authorities for arranging disposal of abandoned equipment.,1,1364,2021-10-05-T-024-S-01364
2021-10-05-T-024,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"When dockless bicycle sharing services first entered Singapore, they offered Singaporeans another convenient travel option. At that time, LTA deliberately adopted a light touch regulatory approach towards this new innovative business model. Many users have used the services for their commuting needs. However, the proliferation of the services also led to indiscriminate parking and many stranded bicycles. To address these disamenities, we started licensing bicycle-sharing operators in 2018 under the Parking Places Act. That was when oBike made the commercial decision to close its operations.",1,1365,2021-10-05-T-024-S-01365
2021-10-05-T-024,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In February 2020, the Shared Mobility Enterprises Act was passed to enhance the licensing regime for shared mobility devices. Under the regime, licensees are required to have plans to remove their devices in a timely manner should they exit the market. They are also required to furnish a performance bond to LTA to ensure compliance with their licence conditions, or be used to offset the impact of a sudden exit. Whilst all current licensees do not require deposits from consumers, the enhanced regulations also allow LTA to prohibit bicycle-sharing licensees from doing so should the need arise. This strengthened regulatory framework provides a foundation for sustainable and responsible device-sharing operations in Singapore.",2,1366,2021-10-05-T-024-S-01366

2021-10-05-T-026,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Singapore currently does not produce finished vaccines, although we manufacture active components that go into making the final product, for example, bacteria antigens.

2021-10-05-T-026,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We are strengthening our research and innovation ecosystem to complement and support our biopharma manufacturing activities. For example, MOH launched the Programme for Research in Epidemic Preparedness and Response (PREPARE) this year. One of the thrusts of this programme is to develop research and technology platforms that can be used for both infectious and non-infectious disease vaccines. This would deepen our research capabilities, enhance Singapore’s attractiveness as a vaccine development partner and improve our access to potential vaccines during future epidemics.",2,1373,2021-10-05-T-026-S-01373

The tripartite partners had considered mandating KETs for employees hired prior to 1 April 2016 but decided against it after taking into consideration the administrative burden on employers, especially the SMEs. Furthermore, most employees would eventually be covered under the requirement for employers to provide KETs when they change employer or when their contracts are renewed after 1 April 2016.",1,1383,2021-10-05-T-028-S-01383

It has, likewise, not observed any disputes arising from failure to provide KETs to persons employed before 1 April 2016.",2,1384,2021-10-05-T-028-S-01384

2021-10-05-T-030,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Currently, BNPL schemes do not pose significant risk to household indebtedness. They are not yet widely used relative to other payment methods. For example, industry estimates put the total value of BNPL transactions in 2020 at around $114 million. This is a very small fraction of the $92 billion in credit and debit card payments over the same period.",2,1392,2021-10-05-T-030-S-01392
2021-10-05-T-030,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"Further, the current features of BNPL schemes in Singapore are effective in mitigating the risk of excessive debt accumulation by consumers. For example, BNPL users’ accounts are subject to credit limits. They will typically be suspended by the BNPL provider – that means no further use of that BNPL scheme – once a payment is overdue. Late payment fees apply, but these are typically capped. As BNPL schemes do not charge compounding interest on the outstanding amount, the risk of rapid debt accumulation is also not large. As of end 2020, the total outstanding value of BNPL transactions was about S$12 million. This includes the value of instalments that had yet to fall due.",3,1393,2021-10-05-T-030-S-01393
2021-10-05-T-030,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"MAS is, nonetheless, assessing whether a regulatory framework is necessary to guide the evolution of BNPL schemes as they become more widely used in Singapore. This could include adoption of fair dealing practices by BNPL schemes. For instance, clear disclosure at the point of account opening is helpful in ensuring that consumers are fully aware of the late fees chargeable if they do not pay on time. MAS has been engaging BNPL providers and has been reviewing the experience in other jurisdictions where such schemes are more prevalent.",4,1394,2021-10-05-T-030-S-01394

For example, a single set of rules on loan tenures and loan-to-value ratios applies for motor vehicle loans, regardless of whether these are granted by FIs, hire-purchase companies or licensed moneylenders. For housing loans, which are mostly provided by FIs, MAS’ rules require all FIs to take into account borrowers’ total outstanding debt obligations, including housing loans from the HDB, motor vehicle loans under hire-purchase arrangements, and loans extended by licensed moneylenders. Likewise, for unsecured loans, caps are applied to the maximum amount of unsecured borrowings that an individual can obtain from an FI, a licensed moneylender or a credit co-operative.

When students return to school, teachers ensure that students can make up for the in-person learning that they could not conduct online.

Under SFA, SGX is required to ensure that the markets it operates are fair, orderly and transparent and there is no market manipulation. SGX has assessed that the increased volatility in electricity futures prices in the month of July 2021 can be attributed to price movements in the underlying spot electricity market. In particular, SGX noted that this coincided with an unplanned gas curtailment which caused prices to increase in the underlying spot market. The gas curtailment was due to a temporary drop in gas production upstream which has since been resolved. The spot electricity prices have now stabilised. In its assessment, SGX did not observe any trading irregularities during this period of increased volatility in electricity futures prices.",1,1545,2021-10-05-T-061-S-01545

2021-10-05-T-092,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"MND, MOH and HDB have launched the Community Care Apartments (CCAs), a new public housing typology that integrates senior-friendly design features with care services, and facilitates community building through social programmes and communal spaces.

We are now studying plans for a second pilot and will share more details in due course.",2,1657,2021-10-05-T-092-S-01657
2021-10-05-T-092,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We are also studying private sector models of assisted living and possible sites to pilot them, including vacant school sites. As vacant school sites are not configured to support residential and care needs for seniors, they will require some retrofitting to convert them to private assisted living facilities. We have been evaluating the feasibility of tendering a vacant school site for a purpose, and engaging stakeholders such as developers and healthcare operators on the appropriate parameters for the site, as well as potential market interest from industry players and potential residents.",3,1658,2021-10-05-T-092-S-01658
2021-10-05-T-092,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"There are also alternative uses for vacant school sites, such as special education schools, community and welfare institutions, and offices.

2021-10-05-T-093,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"The Singapore Construction Manpower Exchange (SCMX), set up in May 2020 by SCAL in partnership with MOM, has replaced the Foreign Construction Worker Directory System (FCWDS) as the platform to actively facilitate the matching of workers in the construction sector. It gives workers the opportunity to continue working in Singapore and saves employers the repatriation costs. Workers whose work permits have been terminated can register with SCMX and the existing employer must agree to the transfer. As of end-August 2021, around 420 workers have successfully found employment via the SCMX. These make up around 20%",1,1662,2021-10-05-T-093-S-01662

As of end-August 2021, around 340 workers have successfully found employment via these schemes. These make up around 50% of the workers enrolled on these schemes.",2,1663,2021-10-05-T-093-S-01663
2021-10-05-T-093,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"To encourage more workers to be retained in Singapore, from 1 September 2021, MOM, in partnership with SCAL has introduced a new six-month SCMX (Retention Scheme). Under this scheme, experienced workers whose previous employment has been terminated but wished to continue working in Singapore will be placed on the scheme, with safeguards in place against abuse, for example,  workers who job-hopped and changed multiple employers within the past 12 months. These workers would not need to seek consent from their original employer and will be granted a 30-day stay during which SCAL will take over the responsibility for the workers, including repatriation if they are unable to find a suitable employer. MOM is in discussion with ASMI and ASPRI to explore setting up a similar retention scheme for the marine-shipyard and process sectors respectively.",3,1664,2021-10-05-T-093-S-01664

The next release will be in early October 2021. The Member can look at these published sources for more information.",1,1666,2021-10-05-T-094-S-01666
2021-10-05-T-094,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Investigations into many accidents, including fatal ones, reveal safety lapses such as unguarded openings and open sides, and poor maintenance of heavy machinery. These suggest that adherence to safe work procedures has not been sustained. While the COVID-19 pandemic has led to cost pressures on affected businesses, it is unclear the degree to which this has contributed to safety lapses at the workplace. The Ministry does not condone any actions, cost-cutting or otherwise, that compromises safety. Employers are very clear that the safety of the workers must not be compromised under any circumstances, and the Ministry will not hesitate to take stern action against companies, officers and management for safety lapses.",2,1667,2021-10-05-T-094-S-01667
